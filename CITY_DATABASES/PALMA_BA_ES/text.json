        "wiki": "Bellver Castle (Catalan: Castell de Bellver) is a Gothic-style castle on a hill 3 km to the west of the center of Palma on the Island of Majorca, Balearic Islands, Spain. It was built in the 14th century for King James II of Majorca, and is one of the few circular castles in Europe. First serving as the residence of the Kings of Majorca, and afterward long used as a military prison throughout the 18th to mid-20th century, it is now under civilian control, being one of the main tourist attractions of the island, as well as the seat for the city's History Museum.\n\n\n== Origins and evolution ==\n\nThe castle's plan, a circular floor with round towers attached to it, seems to have been inspired by the upper complex of the Herodion, a 15 BCE hilltop palace in the West Bank, that was also circular and had a large principal tower and three minor towers as well. They are attached while the principal one is coupled to the complex by a high bridge over the surrounding moat.\nThe main part of the fortification was built by architect Pere Salv\u00e0, who also worked in the construction of the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, together with other master masons between 1300 and 1311 for King James II of Aragon and Majorca. Rock from the hill where the castle sits was used for the building, which has eventually led to the appearance of cracks.\nOnce the castle had been built, and following the introduction of artillery, the battlements on the top balconies and the barbican disappeared, being soon followed by those in every tower; loopholes were built instead.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe castle originally served as a residence for the Kings of Mallorca whenever they were not staying in mainland Europe, and was subsequently seldom used as a residence for viceroys during the 17th century. As a fortification, it suffered and successfully resisted two sieges during the Middle Ages; the first of them in 1343, during Peter IV of Aragon's campaign to reincorporate the Majorcan territories to the Crown of Aragon, and then again in 1391 during an anti-semitic peasant revolt. The castle has only fallen once in its history into enemy hands, in 1521 after an assault during the Majorcan seconds Revolt of the Brotherhoods.\nThe castle was usually governed by a Lord Warden. In 1408, King Martin I of Aragon gave the lordship of Bellver to the Charterhouse of Jesus of Nazareth in Valldemossa. Charles of Viana arrived in 1459 to take possession of both the island and the castle, as he had agreed with his father King John II of Aragon, even though finally the king did not grant the lordship or Bellver Castle.\nBeing an enclosed site, since the end of the 14th century it was used as a prison, firstly to hold Queen Violant of Mallorca, her children James and Isabella and other supporters of King James III of Mallorca after his death in the Battle of Llucmajor in 1349. During the War of Spanish Succession it was used to imprison first supporters of Phillippe d'Anjou, and after the Bourbon victory, Maulets (supporters of the Habsburg pretender). During the Spanish Independence War it was used to hold several prisoners captured at the battle of Bail\u00e9n and later, political prisoners, the most famous of these being the minister Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos (1802\u20131808) who first made a description of the castle and commissioned the first blueprints and drawings of it. The castle served from then on as a political prison, used to lock up several important supporters of the subsequent Habsburg pretendants to the Spanish Throne during the 19th century, and later notable republican and Catalanist leaders during the 20th century, including Alexandre Jaume, Member of the Parliament who first won the castle for the city, and Emili Darder, who was the mayor of the city, both subsequently shot.\n\n\n== Features ==\nHaving been founded as a seat for the royal court of James of Mallorca, its structure combines the needs of a palace with defensive elements. The most notable feature in its structure is its circular shape, unique in Spain. Both its surrounding wall and the inner yard are so-shaped, and so are the three minor towers and the donjon. A moat is found surrounding the castle and its donjon.\nThe circular inner yard must be highlighted. It has a well in the middle of it, which indicates there is a cistern underneath. The palace itself is structured as a two-story building around the central yard. All its dependencies face this yard through a gallery of gothic semi-circular arches.\n\n\n== Current uses ==\nIn 1931, the Spanish Second Republic gave the castle to the city of Palma, along with the forest surrounding it. It became a museum in 1932, being restored in 1976 to become the city's History museum. Thanks to the parking lot and road built next to the castle, it currently welcomes a great number of visitors. The main yard is the seat to many different public ceremonies, such as protocollary and cultural acts, and concerts. Due to its location and visibility from the sea or any other point of the city, it has become one the city's symbols.\nThe surrounding forest encloses the stables of the city's Mounted Peelers. There is also a chapel dedicated to Saint Alphonsis Rodriguez, built between 1879 and 1885.\nThe Sunday following Easter Sunday, the citizens gather at the forest and the castle for the celebration of the Diumenge de l'\u00c0ngel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirtual 3D-tour of del Castillo de Bellver\nIm\u00e1genes del Castillo de Bellver\nCastillo de Bellver en la p\u00e1gina del Ayuntamiento de Palma de Mallorca\nArt\u00edculo en MallorcaWeb (en mallorqu\u00edn)\nVista a\u00e9rea del castillo en la p\u00e1gina web del Ayuntamiento de Palma\nVista del Castillo de Bellver en Google Maps\nCastillo de Bellver en castillosnet.org",

          "Came across this castle from the hop-on/off sightseeing bus. Well preserved Castle and some amazing views at the top. Small selection of memorabilia and history to view within the grounds. Small entry fee \u20ac4 per person and a good a visit.",
          "Traveled up to the Castle on the Hop on Hop off bus. 4 Euros per person entrance but beware the ticket booth is by the car park and not the entrance to the Castle. Immaculately clean grounds and fabulous views of the City of Palma",
          "It is quite a spectacular castle, more of a design statement than a serious military structure but that being said I wouldn't fancy attacking it! It has been fully restored and has superb views over Palma and its surroundings. Entry was \u20ac4 and we spent far longer here than in",
          "Ok, so the museum could have been a little more interesting but hey, who needs the museum when you have the stunning views! I would have paid to go in for the views alone. We drove up on a Tuesday afternoon at about 2.30pm and easily got parked in the car park at the castle. As",
          "We have been to Palma and the rest of Mallorca many times, but this was the first visit to Bellver. We arrived by car at about 11.00 and managed to find a parking space in the small car park near the ticket office. Parking is free and alternative parking is available along the",

          "Visited Bellver castle interesting visit nice little castle and the view over Palma was great. You could either walk to it or like us got on the hop on hop off bus it was 4 euros in which I thought was worth it. Also had a snack area and toilets",

          "The castle is easy to get to as it is one of the Hop on Hop off tour bus stops. These buses stop every 20 minutes. I found that the 40 minute gap (missing one bus) just gave me enough time to see the castle and museum. The front entrance has many steep steps but a sloping path",
          "The castle is not so far from Palma center (5/10 min by car). Free parking. Access is also posible by bus. Ticket is only 4\u20ac per person. You can visit the 3 levels and have a global view of Palma city from the roof top. The inner room exposes some detail on the history of",
          "Not worth the ticket. In the inside there is no added value you can see all the beauty of the castle outside.",

          "Museums inside the castle were very interesting. Good way to have an overview of the island. Great gardens of you\u2019re willing to go up and down",
          "With lovely views of the bay and city from its vantage point on top of a hill make for excellent photos. The castle itself houses a museum on the city but not much else. For 4\u20ac it isn\u2019t bad but not as much history or architecture as I would expect.",
          "This is great way to spend an hour or two with magnificent views of Palma, surrounding hills and the coastline. Very reasonably priced at \u20ac4 per adult and free for under 14 years. Don't walk up the hundreds of steps but take the gently sloping path on the right as you enter the",
          "Very cheap ticket and a beautiful castle. I would definitely suggest a visit if you're staying on that side of town. It has information on the castle itself and then on the history of Palma. Beautiful view and walk around the castle. Cons: a lot of stairs, but that's all.",
          "This historic site was a nice surprise. Easy to move around and nice views. In the light part of the season there were few visitors. Enjoy.",
          "I like a castle visit and this didn't disappoint. There were a lot of exhibits throughout which made it more interesting and extended our time there. Some people have complained about the number of steps. They're not that bad if you are if average fitness. Just take a break",
          "Beautiful building, felt like being on the set of GoT, we were able to look around most of it and kids were kept very interested. Also free parking and a very reasonably priced cafe on site plus a lovely walk down to the harbour. Altogether a great half days entertainment.",
          "Such a lovely castle to explore, totally worth the 4 euros! Lots to look at inside and beautiful views of Palma. Nice little cafe also.",
          "Only \u20ac4 per person to enter. Views from the top are stunning. 360 views over Palma and countryside. Small exhibition too, to read.",
          "I was lucky to visit this attraction. I have a friend who is from Mallorca and given my short visit there, he felt this was a \u2018must see\u2019 location. I 100% agree! The castle is on a hill above Palma Bay and has incredible views of the surrounding countryside. Dating to 1300, the",
          "What a great way to spend an afternoon with friends in the sunshine. It is a beautiful well preserved building and the most amazing views of the wonderful Palma. The walk up is lovely through a park and halfway there a small chapel where you can sit and have a picnic",
          "It is very interesting to visit, the gardens, the structure, the bridge. It is easy to imagine life then.",
          "No bus service except the ridiculously expensive tour bus at 18 euros each both ways. Taxi under 10 euros one way and then walked down the road. Shop closed permanently?- cafe open.",
          "beautiful view over Palma and the sea! Its realy quit, thats nice. You can eat and drink something before or after you enter the castle. Nice castle! ticket costs only \u20ac4. Use the hopp on hopp off bus to reach the castel or a taxi",
          "We visited this castle as part of our day in Palma. If you go only for the views across the city then you will not be disappointed. If you are driving there, you can drive all the way to the top and park at the castle car park, there's limited space, but we got a space without",
          "This was a great quick trip out, was only \u20ac4 each for admission, was there for around an hour, very nice castle to visit, lots of different age groups visiting. Nice photo spot.",
          "As part of the red hop on hop off bus route we got off at stop 9 for the castle, and from where the bus stops that\u2019s where the ticket office is for the castle, although the entrance is 100meters back along the bus route. I had money off the entrance as I\u2019m a pensioner, but it",
          "Part of the open top bus tour, only a few euros to enter plenty of information but the best bits are the views over Palma town and the marina.",
          "We recently visited the castle having arrived on the Hop on/off bus that dropped us right outside. It was \u20ac2.50 to visit and you can go right to the top where the view of Palma and the Port is worth every cent. There is a cafe but we didn\u2019t actually go inside. Quite a lot of",
          "It only costs 4\u20ac to visit this beautiful castle, with a commanding view of Palma. It is possible to walk all the way up to the top of the hill on which the castle is situated, but the easier option is tro do it as part of the CitySightseeing tour - the bus stops just outside! A",
          "I visited Bellver Castle it is only \u20ac4 entrance fee, and there is lots to see with amazing views. There is a walk up to the castle but it is very steep. I got the city sightseeing bus, which stops right outside.",
          "One of the better castles I've seen abroad......great situation right at one of the stops for tourist busses. Quirky castle incorporating varied styles. Well worth it. Cheap to get in as well.",
          "We walked here from the Jaime III hotel \u2013 strolling down to and along the harbour front, and then turning right up a flight of steps alongside the Tryp Palma Bellver hotel (then left along the main road, before following a sign to the castle opposite the Gran Melia Victoria",
          "Lovely to walk up the steps (there is a lot of them) through the pine forest. The Castle is gorgeous to walk round and the view from the top is amazing.",
          "Its worthwhile catching the hop on/off tourist bus to get to the castle which is well preserved and gives excellent views across Palm Bay.",
          "I\u2019ve toured castles in England, France, Italy, Germany, etc....this was one of the smallest and least informative. Minimal historical pieces despite a \u201cmuseum\u201d being in site. Sunday\u2019s are free...go then, if you want",
          "Hiking up the mountain for Castel de Bellver is a challenge but worth the effort. Enjoy the cafe with its lovely view and climb the stairs for this early medieval impressing building. You will be breath-taken by the views and caught by the stories told.",
          "An unusual round castle still looking as if it was built yesterday. Very easy to get to on public bus no 3. Stop at Gomila Square and just follow the signs. Takes no time to get up top to admire panoramic views. The museum is cramped with so much interesting exhibits and great",
          "This castle is well worth visiting - the history and architecture are fascinating given the history of Mallorca. Given its strategic position the views from the top are sweeping. We visited on the hop on/off bus and took in the Miro Foundation as well.",
          "Since the castle stands on top of a hill which can be seen from most of Palma, it\u2019s quite easy to find. Not wanting to join a tour where time at the castle would be limited, we took a look at the nearest point a local bus would drop you off and decided that the part it covered",
          "Well worth a visit if you are on the tour bus. Wonderfully restored castle with small but interesting museum. Fantastic views over Palma. 4\u20ac ticket is good value for money.",
          "Seen from the harbour the castle is already a 'storybook' castle but get up there and it's better still. Very inexpensive (\u20ac3pp), with an excellent 'history of Palma' museum in the open rooms, and excellent views out across the city from the ramparts. The tower was closed on our",
          "From a distance and even close up this must be most peoples idea of what a castle should be. We thought we could walk there from Palma - big mistake! We ended up on the hop-on-hop-off bus which delivered us to the entrance. There is a pleasant cafe and good toilets for before",
          "We took the open top tour bus up, very pleasant. There isn\u2019t much to see in the castle it\u2019s the views you go for and they are totally worth it. Great little bar serving reasonably priced drinks and snacks to indulge before you hop on the bus to go back down. I do believe there",
          "Visited with my sister during a recent stay in Palma. We decided to go on foot from our hotel at the front (15/20mins) which was a really picturesque and pleasant walk. You can go via the winding path or up the steep stairs (we went up stairs and back down the path). As other",
          "Well worth the walk up from the city- great views. Reasonably priced (especially compared to the cathedral). As you walk round there is some interesting information about the city\u2019s history.",
          "A wonderful viewing platform to see the city. A nice place to mooch and I enjoyed the walk down to the town from the castle. An interesting building",
          "A very well preserved castle that includes a very interesting documentation of the island's history. Enjoyable views both to the bay and city below but to the forest on the other side.",
          "Enjoyed a couple of hours looking around & viewing the bay & harbour from above. Worth the effort cycling up.",
          "Went here in February. Great views from the top but very windy. Surrounding park area is nice for walking.",
          "The castle is (as you would expect) on top of a steep hill to the east of the city. It has been well preserved and documents the history of the city from the pre Roman days up to the developments that are currently taking place. It is useful to visit this as the first stop as",
          "Maybe because it was January, but the highly touted views were a little lack luster, especially at the ground level. Visiting hours were short due to it being off season. When we finally caught the castle open and paid the 5 euros, it was worth visiting and seeing the views",
          "U expect a great view but ut is not. Maybe the wrong month byt Still. Castle could be better, should be for free...",
          "I would say this castle is a must-do stop for Palma. The entry price is cheap. We were charged 4 euros for adults, 2 euros for our 17 year old and nothing for our 14 year old. The views are fantastic across the whole area. The museum has a lot of detailed information about",
          "This circular castle is still actively use as museum and also for exhibition or gathering. the view of Palma and the harbour from the top is lovely. There is parking lot on the top and ticket box right beside it. Get there early as those parking lot get busy very quickly other",
          "A wonderful place within walking distance from the city center. An exciting architecture: medieval with an almost modernist touch. The name of the place says everything about the beautiful view.",
          "Only 4\u20ac gets you admission to this really lovely circular castle with spectacular views of Palma and an interesting museum about the history of Palma to the present day (don't worry, the information is in English too!). Very unspoilt, even the toilets are built within an outer",
          "What a treat we had as the views to Palma and the harbour were fantastic. A circular castle which has a fantastic position overlooking Palma and beyond. Well worth a visit and free to get in on Sunday\u2019s.",
          "We visited this castle after there were no signs indicating which way to go for the pedestrian walk way. We ended up taking the car route and walked a lot longer than necessary. The admission was 2 Euro due to student discount. The castle provided excellent views and there were",
          "We really enjoyed our visit - it was very cheap to get in but full of great views and history. Recommended,",
          "This is worth a visit on a nice day for a wonderful panoramic view over Palma and the bay. The castle is a small and interesting circular building over three floors set in wooded countryside. For the best views climb to the top floor. There is a nice cafe and good toilets in the",
          "Enjoyed our brief visit to the castle. The real charm is the history of the location and it\u2019s setting up in the hills. The castle itself isn\u2019t spectacular but it is well preserved. To truly enjoy it take time to read thru the history shown throughout the building. We had coffee",
          "Located on a hill overlooking Palma. If you want the best photos of Palma then this is the place to go. It is also a stop for the Hop on Hop off bus. Interesting and worth the 4 Euro entry fee, just for the photos of Palma.",
          "Go up till the top to get a beautiful view of Mallorca harbour, simply gorgeous! It's a huge castle, one could easily spend an hour or 2 exploring this castle, their museum within and it's surrounding.",
          "The castle walls were quite majestic, the view from the very top of the castle was amazing - spanned the entire city of Palma. We also quite enjoyed the hike up, there are stairs and also less steep stroller or bike friendly route. It is quite a hike though, so bring some water.",
          "This is a very unique castle. If you just would like to see the architecture, 15-20 mins will do. If you are interested in the history of Mallorca, give yourself a couple of hours to see the museum in the castle. The castle is open from 7.30am to 6.30pm between October and",
          "I went on Sunday because I was told it was free. Lovely castle on the hill with awesome panoramic views at the top. In the rooms, the exhibits with description of the history and the artwork are interesting as well. A bit of the walk up to the castle but it's not strenuous and",
          "This is a great nature walk up to the castle,lot of runners there. On Sunday is free of charge and not so much tourists in december. Lovely view to the whole port with a exhibition of history inside. Worth it!",
          "the round castle is very rare,interesting architecture. many statioues around the first floor. on the second floor are many rooms with nice stuff that was found in the castle and around. . it is worth to visit and spend one hour there. it is like a museum. in a castle.",
          "Not only the castle itself is interesting and worth it, but also the views from here are amazing! Be aware that the ticket office is next to the parking place, do not stop in front of the castle as there is no place to buy tickets.",
          "The castle has spectacular views of the city of Palms de Mallorca and the surrounding areas. If you walk the stairs up, be prepared! Pretty good hike! Great architecture and scenery",
          "The castle itself is very beautiful and just walking there is wonderful. Inside theres a permanent exhibition on two floors covering the pre-historics of the Balearics and the development of Palma since it was founded by the Romans.",
          "Nice view, beautifull nature on the vay up. Unfortunatelly for us, castle is closed for the public in mondays.",
          "It is possible to drive up to this castle but the pedestrian route up steps through rustic parkland is recommended. Entry provides the additional benefit of a museum detailing the history of the city and a limited art collection, particularly including a couple of rooms of Roman",
          "Visited here in my first solo visit to Palma. Love the castle. Interior and the views across Palma and out to sea are amazing. Luckily the entrance was free when I visited on a Sunday but worth paying to see too.",
          "In my country (USA), we do not have any sort of European style castles to visit and explore. Accordingly, I take every opportunity to see these sites when I'm in Europe. We visited Bellver Castle while on a cruise shore excursion. Because it was a Sunday, the admission was free!",
          "After lived in Mallorca for many tears, and always heard that Bellver Castle is something you MUST see... This was for me an overrated thing",
          "Knowing little about Palma we opted to take the City Sightseeing Hop On Hop Off Bus which was half price (9 Eurs) for seniors. Seeing the view when we neared the Castle we opted to talk a tour of the castle. While it is small the view was fantastic. Again we got the Senior",
          "We visited here on a city break and got here via the hop on hop off bus tour. It was well worth it for the views alone. We found the entrance pretty confusing as the ticket office is a few mins walk around the corner where they failed to tell us how to get in!",
          "I got the audio guide and walked the castle grounds in 40 mins. The queens side of the castle was closed and there was only a few actual rooms on view. A bit disapointing. In huge castles like this it\u2019s always interesting to see the kitchen areas and how the bed rooms was",
          "Great castle with many rooms to discover. Lots of history to learn making the visit beneficial for all tourists regardless of age. Cant be bored.",
          "Very pretty castle with incredible views over Palma _ lovely trees and countryside too Free entry on Sundays Does not take that long to visit as quite small castle but it is on outskirts of Palma so lovely escape from busy centre If you get bus or taxi to castle it is fairly",
          "If you are going to be in the Palma area this castle is worth a quick stop. It is on the way to west beaches and provides an opportunity to see a relatively rare circular castle design. While I didn't find the interior to interesting the views from the top of the castle are",
          "We really did not know what to expect when visiting the castle but found a gem. the castle is in remarkably good condition considering it dates from the 13th Century. it is well presented with lots of interesting information without over elaborating on the history. The views",
          "Lots of history in the not so well documented castle. Unique in that it is round. Get the audio guide if you have time or get a knowledgeable guide otherwise there Isn\u2019t a lot of marked info.",
          "We caught the city bus around Palma and got off at Bellver Castle it was a lovely place to visit and the views were amazing the staff and coffee shop were very friendly & service was great worth a visit.",
          "We are from central europe where plenty of castles are built. Reason why we gave it 3 stars is, because the castle is old and in a good condition but there is nothing inside. Naked walls, emty premises, simple architecture, small castle.",
          "We went on the last opening hour on a Sunday when the place wasn't too packed and there wasn't an entrance fee. The castle is beautiful and nicely kept. The views are amazing. Btw, if you're going there with small children, drive your car all the way up to the closest parking",
          "Free entry on a Sunday! We used our hip on hop off bus tickets to get there. Enjoyed looking round, plenty of stairs fairly easy to climb. Interesting rooms and exhibitions to look around and fantastic views from the top. Would advise using the bathrooms situated in the castle",
          "Road the hop on hop off bus up to the castle. The castle is closed on Mondays (the only day we were in town), but the small cafe and restrooms were open. Some nice views from where we are and still worth the stop.",
          "It was fun visit. But be sure to prepare to climb some stairs if you want to get on the top, but it is definetely worth it. Enetry fee is something around 5 Euros, but you have to buy tickets somewhere else than at Entrance. You can also climb to the top of the Castle where from",
          "Worth a visit just for the view alone. I\u2019d recommend taking a taxi or bus from the city centre if you don\u2019t have a car there\u2019s also a little cafe/bar at the entrance.",
          "Visited as part of a shore excursion from a cruise ship. The castle has a museum and gorgeous views of Palma. I'd set aside about an hour and half to do the whole thing. You can see the castle from the port.",
          "I last visited Bellver's Castle last June for \"Altantida Film Festival\". The castle and the surroundings were a perfect place to chill out and celebrate. Incredible views, great historical monument and a beautiful place to enjoy day or night, tourism or bussiness. Unforgettable!",
          "Cheap and great views over Mallorca. Lots of little rooms to look into too. I walked up from the town which was nice along the harbour and took about 45 mins.",
          "This castle is about 15 minutes away from the city centre, on top of a hill. You can either get a taxi up there, or walk up a winding slope - but be warned, it is the equivalent of climbing about 20 floors! Once you get here though, you\u2019ll be stunned by the panoramic views - you",
          "Bellver Castle has been around for many centuries, a credit to the architecture, design and construction. There are many informative exhibits in various rooms providing history of the inhabitants of the castle and general history of Mallorca. There is a lot to explore and",
          "We visited the castle on a tour from our cruise ship and for some unknown reason we were given exclusive access to the castle before normal bus trips arrived. We were guided around the exterior before being given a tour inside. There were numerous statues, small and large,",
          "Really worth a visit. Lovely views and a fascinating history. Worth exploring it all as some really interesting rooms/exhibitions",
          "For a flavor of Spanish medieval life, make the Believer Castle one of your stops. In addition to the history lesson, we enjoyed the sweeping views of sea. A delightful way to spend a morning.",
          "Either go by taxi or climb the steps which go directly up to the Castle; the long walk up the road must be exhausting on a hot day. The views are very extensive, but the castle itself is the main interest. Its circular design is one I have never seen before. There are some",
          "Very nice place with great view over Palma. Good view to see the mountains. Lots of history to see. One of the bests sites that should not be missed.",
          "Great walk from Palma. 501 stairs once you enter the gate. Worth 4 euros to tour. Good museum pieces inside and the view from the top is one of the best!",
          "Set in a woodland high on a hill, walkable from the Port or Taxi from the city centre. Made famous by Game of Thrones' scene. The outside is very picturesque - the inside unusual - you won't be dissatisfied.",
          "We visited this place on a City tour bus it is worth a visit if only for the views, you get plenty of time to look around then catch the next bus.",
          "With the most spectacular views across the city of Palma and the bay this is a \u2018must do\u2019 tourist attraction. A taxi from the city centre will cost around \u20ac12. From the entrance there is a relatively easy path and steps route that takes you down to the main coastal road. Easy",
          "Like the catedral, its very recoment to visit here when you come to palma the mallorca. Entrance 7 euro per person. Take the guidness in 3 euro.",
          "We took the stairs up and down - great exercise - 2 hours up...1 hour down. The castle was extremely interesting and the final view at the top overlooking all of beautiful Palma was breathtaking!",
          "Went to the castle on the hop on hop off bus route. The history and exhibits at the castle were good. The views from the castle are far reaching. Very good value for entrance fee of 4 euros. Smell of the pine be trees is refreshing during the heat of the day. Little cafe and",
          "Had a few hours to spare during a recent trip to Palma, and decided to walk the 2 miles or so up to Bellver Castle. The walk was reasonably steady as we followed the road up rather than taking the more direct route up the steps. The castle is free to enter on a Sunday and we",
          "Amazing views from this castle so it\u2019s well worth the trip! We walked up through the forest and it was a relatively easy with a gentle incline of steps and plenty of rest points. You buy tickets from the kiosk in the car park -it\u2019s only \u20ac4 with discounts for 65+ , students and",
          "We were staying at the marina end of Palma, so we walked to Bellver Castle. We picked up the path part way along Carrer Camilo Jose Cela (that's the sign on the street but on the map and on Google Maps it's called Carrer Castillo Bellver). At the entrance to the castle site,",
          "We paid \u20ac4 to get into Bellver castle and was really worth it. Although we climbed approx 500 steps to get into the castle, the views surrounding were amazing. A definite recommend if you are in the area.",
          "Stopped off as part of the city bus tour. Way up above Palma, has one gallery going through the history of Palma, one more about the castle. View from the top is fantastic.",
          "Used the sightseeing tourist bus to visit here as it\u2019s a very long climb otherwise! There\u2019s a charge to look around the castle and there\u2019s also a small cafe serving cold drinks, snacks adequate for the time you\u2019re here. Good views",
          "We visited as part of our hop-on, hop-off bus tour and thoroughly enjoyed the 360 degree views of Palma from the battlements. The castle itself is impressive - not least in its completeness, but its contents are sparse. There's a pleasant cafe by the bus stop.",
          "We hiked from the city of Palma up to the grounds of the castle. It was a Saturday in mid September and locals as well as many tourists were present. You can access the Castle via car if you prefer, but it looks as though parking is limited. The museum throughout the Castle",
          "best place for views across the bay and Palma. We used the hop on hop off bus to get up there and walked back done the steps - its a lot of steps if you are going up the way. there was no fee to enter the day we visited (not sure why).",
          "Perfect for a walk in the afternoon, on hot summer days. There is plenty of shade in the gardens around the castle. There are two options: stairs (short path) or alley (long path). Took the long path upwards when climbing the hill and the stairs when returning. Great views",
          "The ticket price is very affordable (4e). The view is beautifule from the castle. You can find a free audioguide app on google play, which talks in more detail about the history of Mallorca and the castle. I highly recommene a visit here.",
          "Great views from the top of the castle around the whole of the Palma area. If you're feeling fit and energetic there's a walk way up through the pine forest to the castle.",
          "A little way out of the city, too far to walk except for the young and fit but regularly served by the hop-on-hop-off tourist buses. The castle itself is nothing very special. It has an interesting history, has been very well maintained (perhaps a bit too well and looking too",
          "A definate must if you visit Palma. A very steep walk to the top but the views of Palma are breathtaking at the top.",
          "Went here after getting off the hop on bus. Its a lot of walking as the kiosk to buy tickets isnt clearly marked so ended up walking round and up and down steps for a while before finding the kiosk then having to walk all the way back, it was a very very hot day so it took it",
          "We walked up to the castle from the sea front and on a hot day it was challenging. There are a lot of steps and they get steep towards the end. The castle is well maintained has a lot of historical information about the town and the part the castle has played in it. The",
          "We used the hop on hop off bus to get there otherwise it\u2019s a taxi ride or a very long walk up a very steep hill. If you go by car there is limited parking. The views across Palma are amazing, as is the architecture and the history. This is not a great visit for children.",
          "Nice castle and great views particularly of the port. Definitely worth a visit for fans of castles whilst in Mallorca. We took the long walk up hundreds of steps to visit here on a hot day (definitely should have researched it in advance) and so were very happy to see a decently",
          "It's quite a trek up to the Bellver castle but well worth it when you get to the top. The castle itself is an impressive and interesting structure - built for King James II of Mallorca and one of the few circular castles in Europe. It's in very good condition and clearly",
          "We loved the castle. It's clean, in a very nice condition. The 4 Euros why fee is well worth it. It's not very long, but the view from the top is amazing! Everything is written in English as well. The only complaint is that we did not find any sings informing us that we need to",
          "Visited here beginning of September and wow were we surprised as the beauty within. The castle itself on the outside is beautiful, however once inside there are magical treasures to behold. There is good disabled access into the castle with a stair lift fitted too. Only \u20ac4 entry",
          "Amazing views over Palma. A lot of steps up but so worth it. If you walk through the park up to the castle not by the main road which is what Google maps suggests it's much more picturesque.",
          "Trekked up here one day and the views and setting were well worth it. Cost into the castle is only a couple of euro and I seen it was free on Sundays on a sign at the entrance..",
          "We went on the hop on hop off bus which took us to this castle. It was really beautiful but you had to go to an office about 400 meters away to buy your tickets then you could enter the castle. It was smaller then I emagined but love how they built it in a circle formation with",
          "One of the few round castles in Europe, once you get on top of it, it looks like the roman colosseum. A nice place to visit, the bus stop it's right outside the castle, right next to a bar. The castle itself has a nice view, you can see the entire city of Palma from the top of",
          "Me and my husband had a photoshoot in the castle, the views from the roof are breathtaking. It is clean and nice area. We liked the style of the castle too.",
          "I used the Hop On/Hop Off bus as transportation to the castle. The drive up the mountain is lovely as is the walk from the parking lot to the castle itself as it overlooks the main city. There's also a nice cafe with reasonably priced sandwiches and drinks.",
          "If you are enthusiastic, do sports and love to hike, climb up for good views this is the spot in Palma: though a small place in comparison to other churches, castles.And you have to really climb high to reach this place.One of my friend was totally exhausted after this",
          "Recommend this place for its magnificent view of Palma. Not too interesting as a sight in itself. Recommend to go on the Hop on hop off bus to get there as it is uphill from the port.",
          "The castle is perched on a height, offering you beautiful views of the city from its rooftop. Inside the castle, the sights on offer give you a good glimpse into its glorious past!",
          "Beautiful castle, pretty empty rooms, :) Take care about transportation, regular busses only went to base of hill. Only touristic busses or taxis goes all the way up. Spectacular view from the top floor.",
          "The castle was situated just behind our hotel so we decided to visit it. The climb to the top via the many, many stairs in the scorching heat was an achievement in itself. Once at the Castle, after a detour to the ticket office, you get to wander round looking at the old roman",
          "I drove to the castle in my rental car and just parked along the road near the driveway to the castle. Visiting the castle was free and it is fun exploring the different floors and rooms. The views on the top are gorgeous. I would recommend an early or late afternoon visit, as",
          "Definitely worth of a visit. Costs a little bit but the views are fantastic and the arts gallery offers a snapshot of arts history. Good and cheap cafe. Highlight of our Palma trip.",
          "Being from Canada, we don\u2019t have real castles dating back as far as this one. Do the opportunity to tour inside and on top of this castle was incredible. Visiting the museums inside the castle to learn about the history of Mallorca was also great. We tied this tour into a \u201cHop",
          "we walked up there, it was a good experience, castle is nice, great panorama from the top went on August 15 and had free entrance! recommend it",
          "Amazing building. Ongoing restoration, but 90% complete so it doesn\u2019t effect your enjoyment. Roman era water jugs sitting out to touch. Recommended place to visit.",
          "We spent a good 3 hours at this location and it was well worth the visit. We drove over from the East coast and the views of the island and the marina are fantastic. You are able to get a meal here at the restaurant, although we didn't and there is a bar/ refreshment area for",
          "...and felt so much prouder for doing that! It's a good 30 min walk from town but if you start near the cathedral and walk along the marina coast path its a great trip. Yes, forts are on the top of hills and we acended through a pretty park with fine scrubby woodland and",
          "I love the view on top! Also, i love that there was a restaurant just outside the castle. Would just suggest that they would put sign where to enter the castle, I mean from the parking lot, coz its kind of hard to figure out.",
          "From up there you have great view over the city and harbour of Palma de Mallorca. You can get married there as well",
          "Visited castle during day wonderful views of Palma and interesting history information. Spotted there was music on the next evening so booked tickets (\u20ac10 each) online. This was a highlight of the holiday, superb group, fantastic acoustics, amazing setting, highly recommended!!!",
          "Again, another must visit for a very low ticket price. Beautiful views from the cafe near to the ticket office. These views get batter as you enter the castle and take in the splendid of old Mallorca. Wouldn\u2019t hesitate to revisit if I were back in Mallorca.",
          "Simply one word for this place.. AMAZING The views from.the Castle is nothing other than spectaculor. The hop on off tour bus takes you up the steep hill to the top. Step of the bus and catch the breath taking views . They even have a shop offering a range of food and drinks If",
          "the view from the top is amazing beware if you are walking up there then you have to climb hundreds of steps and then there is a 15 minute hill climb. you can get a bus. the castle inside is a nice place very well kept very resonibly priced to get in there is a cafe and",
          "As the castle was quite far away from our accommodation by the cathedral we decided to get a taxi there (as we knew it was free entry on sunday) - it was worth the \u20ac9 taxi ride. Lovely to meander round, with museum sections to look at. Toliets and cafe were good too. We walked",
          "Enjoyable walk to the castle on trails through woodland. Modest castle but interesting displays and outstanding views. Very good value for money.?",
          "Trek up if you aren't using the tourist bus. Great views from top but not much else. Caf\u00e9 was busy but needed a drink. Free on Sundays nit sure I would pay...",
          "We stopped here by chance on the hop on off bus and decided for 4\u20ac it was worth a look. The views are spectacularly from the castle and the castle itself was well worth looking around. We sent about an hour looking around",
          "Fantastic views of Palma. Lovely building not a lot to see there but worth a visit on open top bus then hop on to see rest of town",
          "Went here on the hoho bus, its a nice castle and quite accessible, there are stunning views over the city. Nice outside cafe and it was a very warm day, so we had a nice cold beer each and they were one of the cheapest on our whole trip, free wifi too.",
          "Went here on the red \"hop on, hop off\" tour bus. You can walk up but ensure you have a good map/route. Not a huge castle so you can get round in a reasonably short time. Stunning views of Palma and the surrounding countryside. Facilities are good and there is a cafe with both",
          "We came here with friends to visit Mon but the castle was closed. We came back Tues so we could see inside. The access is a lot of steps so people with mobility issues will have to beware. We were half way round before a nice guy in the information office helped us download an",
          "Go there for the nice view, but the museum part was not very big or interesting. Signs in spanish...",
          "Really really enjoyable! Not only do you get to go in and have a look around the castle, there are little exhibitions in different parts of the castle that give information about the castle itself and the city of Palma back in the day. Word of warning: the castle is located up",
          "From our ship in the bay we can look up and see this castle. From it are some of the most amazing views of the bay and the city. It\u2019s an easy drive from the pier or the downtown through a lovely neighborhood. From the park entrance you could, if you are up for it, walk up",
          "Well worth the trip up for the views of Palma and the surrounding area. Remarkably cheap too compared to other sites locally. Treat yourself and get a slushy in the cafe after!",
          "An interesting, wellbuilt castle within an easy drive of the port. Nice views from the top. Worth a quick drive and a quick tour.",
          "Uncrowded well laid out with good historical reference, if a little bare in places; good views and easy to get to",
          "We visited the castle during Christmas holiday. Is worth visiting it for its uniqness. Enjoy the ride and come back !",
          "Well preserved and unusual castle. Well worth a visit if only for the fantastic views over the Bay of Palma.",
          "I would give this attraction a 4.5 if I could. The views are world class. You can see the full extent of Majorca from here. What is offered of the history is good, but I feel there is much more that could be said to contextualize the location as you look out on the sea, harbor",
          "The location is excellent with amazing views over Palma harbour and all along the coast. The castle which was also a prison is interesting and is generally in good condition. We had considered walking up through the park but it is a long walk up the hill especially in the heat.",
          "Quaint castle that is on the bus route. You can see everything in about one hour. Beautiful views of the city 360 degrees. Interesting history.",
          "IT is one of the few completely circular castles in Europe still used for official functions and it also serves as the historical museum for Mallorca. The walk form the bus stop 3 or 20 route was about 1 km in 85 degree heat today and up a steep hill with 350 steps. The museum",
          "This is one of those places where the journey is as nice as the destination. You walk through a lovely forest to get there, so wear comfortable walking shoes. The castle itself is interesting, although not as \"castle-y\" as those of the French Loire Valley for instance. Still, in",
          "This is another must visit destination for tourists in Palma. It can be a bit of trek to get there but, definitely worth it. Also, great opportunity for pictures, you can see all of Palma from the top of the castle.",
          "Take bus ride number 3 from downtown Palma and climb high steps through park up to this #1 castle close to Palma. Wonderful architecture and lots of information of Mallorcan history.",
          "Bellver Castle or Castell de Bellver as it is commonly known in Majorca is highly recommended if you are holidaying in or passing through Palma. For a reasonable entrance fee of 4 euros you can take in the incredible views of Palma and the cathedral from the castle rooftop as",
          "Visited the castle and was blown away by the well intact castle and it\u2019s \u20ac4 entry fee! Fantastic condition with unbeatable views of Palma City. Great place to visit for an hour!",
          "This castle is almost a 3 in 1. It was once a fort, castle and a prison. It is not your typical castle visit, the structure is very unique but magnificent and extremely well preserved. Since this castle is quite a drive from the city centre and the shopping district, it does",
          "I enjoyed the trip to Bellver. This is one of the most complete and best preserved castles I've seen in Europe.",
          "Took a taxi up to the castle, but you can walk up if you are fit. The structure is magnificent, and very well maintained, with a museum and interesting artefacts. The inner courtyard is circular, and was set out for a concert on our visit. The rooftop space is flat, and is worth",
          "This was both a castle, fort and a prison. It now serves a a museum and is full of interesting items. It is well worth your time to travel up to this venue. The views from the castle are breathtaking. Plan to spend at least an hour here.",
          "Visit the castle and see and old home, it is very interesting. There is a great view to all sites from the top of the castle.",
          "Had a great morning walk up to o the cattle and a good look around. It\u2019s around 4 EUR to go round and us a very impressive building. Lots to read about the history of the castle and the growth of Mallorca.",
          "This stunning castle is a must visit when in Palma. You can easily visit as part of the city tour and it won't disappoint. Free entry, stunning architecture, views back over Palma and to the mountains behind.",
          "The castle is not very big but allmost well carried and we learned so much about the island history. It also offers a georgerous view on palma",
          "You don't have to take the steps up to this lovely, well preserved castle, but if you do it is well worth the effort. Very well kept, fabulous views on Palma and the bay",
          "You will be humbled by the amazing views from the castle. The site is rich in history and artefacts. It is almost as if time hasnt touched this castle. the middle of the Castle has been turned in sort of amphitheatre, when we were there is had silver chairs and a red curtain",
          "This is one of the most interesting castles in Mallorca. Well kept, with access to many areas. Great view. Would be interesting for kids. Parking nearby, and accessible by public transport.",
          "Free on Sundays. Lovely views. Bit of a hike up there but once there it's very nice. It also has a museum which tells about the history of Palma. Even if you want another day for 4 euros it would be well worth it.",
          "One of the main tourist attractions of the island is this 600 year old castle. Used to be a kings residence and afterwards a military prison. First round castle I've ever visited! The view of the city is amazing...",
          "It was a long way up the hill and to be sent to a separate kiosk for a ticket whilst standing at the entrance was a poor start, but it picked up from there. Great value, lovely building, quite different in style from anything I had seen before. Wonderful views out over the city.",
          "I was struck by the exterior beauty of the castle and was delighted to discover the interior contained a history of the city of Palma - dating to the Bronze age to the present. I especially liked how the castle offered access to the rooftop for stunning views of Palma, the bay,",
          "This circular fortress was built in the 14th century on top of one of the highest mountains in Palma and one that gave it a commanding view of its harbor. Over the centuries it has been used as a fortress, palace, military prison and now a venue for concerts and weddings. This",
          "A must visit in Palma, the view over Palma and Palma bay is fantastic. If interested in the history of Mallorca and Palma the museum is very good and very informative. There are tour buses or taxis for those who can\u00b4t walk all the way.",
          "We were recommended to see this castle by our Jet2 rep and it was so worth doing even just for the views of Palma. It was $6 euros each to get in and it was really clean and well kept. There is not much in the way of rooms or decor but there is a small museum on the castle/port",
          "This is a quite a way out of the main part of the city - I arrived on the hop-on, hop-off tour bus - also worth doing if in Palma - but it rewards a visit. It's a singular example of Mediterranean Gothic, with a very unusual round shape. The displays about the history of Palma",
          "Previously visited by coach.This time decided to walk up the road to the castle. Walk is approximately 25 mins from the gates. Slightly challenging as uphill but enjoyable walk. Great views from road in front of the castle, but even better 360 degrees view from the castle",
          "We arrived here on the open top bus - great experience. Spent about 1 hour looking around - so interesting and the views, are something else",
          "Visited Bellver castle with some school children who all enjoyed the experience. There was a wedding being held on the Saturday we attended which added to the excitement",
          "Take the hop on - hop off bus on a very interesting trip to arrive at the castle. Go straight ahead to the ticket house. Visit the exhibitions. Look at the marvellous court d' armes. Watch the splendid views. Take care of the steps. Outside, rest and take a refreshment at the",
          "Lovely castle in excellent condition atop a hillside above palma amazing views of city and mountains and harbour. Magnificent building with full access to all three floors. Bring a camera with wide angle lens for fantastic photos.",
          "This site was a part of a cruise excursion. Knew very little about Majorca and this castle was a great way to learn about its history. It was built in the 1300s and is the only circular castle in Europe. It is massive with huge towers and deep moats. We visited on a rainy",
          "The history is rich and interesting. Easy to get to and leave in a can as well. The view on top has a view of the ocean as well as all the green trees in Palma. It is for sure worth a visit. Very beautiful",
          "Up the hill and up the stairs, on the top the old castle. Built 700 years ago as a fortress overlooking and defending the harbour and the city of Palma, ended as a prison, nowadays just a nice view, and a good healthy uphill walk. Pay the entrance fee and go up on the roof of",
          "Well worth a visit. Situated overlooking Palma and its harbour, it offers one of the best coastal views I have ever seen. Audio tapes give you the history as you walk around. Precook your return taxi though, or use the Hop on Hop Off bus which goes every 20 minutes.",
          "We went here on our 2nd full day in Palma. Possibly stupidly, we walked all the way from our hotel, Palma Bellver by Melia, to the Castle, taking a suggested detour, off track, uphill all the way! By the time we got there, we were tired, but really enjoyed walking around the",
          "We drove to this castle and spent an hour walking around the place. Entry was free on a Sunday. Not too busy despite being free. It requires a lot of walking and climbing stairs, but the views of Palma from the top are amazing. We also had a snack at the cafe which has seating",
          "Loverly castle. Great views. Go by taxi. Lots of steps. Sunday is free. Even during the week it is not expensive.",
          "Excellent place to visit best views of Palma and surrounding beaches , good history of Majorca and Palma which we haven\u2019t found in any of the other museums or places of interest , Audio available , disabled access and stair lift Walk up or catch the tourist sightseeing bus .",
          "Lovely walk up to castle, 4 euros to enter, worth it for the views and the exhibition. Nice cafe and toilets.",
          "Some cracking views when you get to the top of the castle its worth all the effort and walking to get to the castle you won't be disappointed. You could easily spend a few hours up there but if you don't fancy walkling there is a bus which will take you to the castle. There is a",
          "We went to Bellver an hour and half before closing and we spent every minute being amazed by the beauty. The castle is on top of Palma and has the most magnificent view. You can see the mountains and sea just by standing on the top. It is definitely a \u201cmust see\u201d with lots of",
          "Some fantastic views from Castle Bellver and only 4 Euros entry. Bit of a hike, so if you are only used to shuffling along to the corner shop I would advise using the bus for the Castle!",
          "Wonderful panoramic view of Mallorca wither mountains around so younger a great bearing of the island. It is a very well maintained castle. It is a \u201cMust see \u201c and takes around 1/2 hr . There is a walk up from the town which goes through the park but we drove with a bus",
          "Castle is not very impressive and has the most dull museums ever but it's in very nice place with great views! Go there by taxi (it's high) and then go back by foot. Nice stroll to the port, with great views.",
          "We visited the castle as part of the sightseeing bus tour. It was quite busy the day we went however, it didn\u2019t detract from our visit. There are some interesting exhibits inside the castle however, the biggest would be the view. It\u2019s beautiful. It costs \u20ac4 to enter the",
          "We walked up to the castle, which is a bit of a slog from the bus stop. They say it's a 20 minute walk but it took us more like 30 minutes. We went on Sunday so it was free entry. We didn't use an audio guide and that was probably a mistake. Lovely views of Palma from the top.",
          "Worth the long walk up the numerous steps for the wonderful views.Stop for a drink in the cool cafe overlooking looking the hills",
          "We visted here on the sightseeing bus and because it was a Sunday did not have to pay to get in. Well worth a visit, climb to the top to look at over Palma you won't be disappointed",
          "This castle is well worth the visit and is reasonably priced. The views of the city are spectacular and the castle itself is also good to explore. I deducted a point on the score as the advertised tours in English were not running with no good explanation. Note also that it",
          "We enjoyed our slow and relaxing walk through the castle and grounds. From up there, you get a great view of the port with cruise ships, the cathedral in the distance, and the city in general.",
          "Bellver Castle is unique in design as well it\u2019s use over the centuries right from 14th century onwards. This castle is well designed to defend from any attack, which is why it proved to be ideal as a prison as well. The castle currently houses the city\u2019s history museum and it is",
          "We walked from Palma town centre using our gps. It is a very steep climb when you get into the grounds. It is a lovely walk and well worth doing. The view from the top of the hill is breathtaking (if you have any left!!!) There is a full panorama of Palma. You need to get a",
          "A lot of interesting facts to this castle which has been used for several different uses over its very colourful history. Quite stark compared to other castles.",
          "I could see this castle in the distance from my hotel nestled amongst the trees on a hill, we were informed that it was the highest point with amazing 360 views of Palma, so set off on foot to go explore do try this option if your have plenty of time and in good health other",
          "We climbed the hundreds of steps on a hot day up to Bellver Castle only to be told when we got to the top that it was closed on a Monday. The views over the city and harbour are spectacular, so it was well worth the effort. If you are not athletic, then we suggest you grab a",
          "One of a very few circular castles. Not a lot to see. Good place to check out via the hop on, hop off bus.",
          "really loved this castle, it's well worth a visit and was fairly quite when we went. really fantastic views over the harbour, My daughters loved seeing the lizards running over the walls, probably the best part for them",
          "It is not really clear what this castle is all about, was it built as a prison or does it became a prison afterwards. A little bit more information in different languages could be better. But it is a beautiful castle and the view over Palma and the Harbor, Cathedral is",
          "You'll get an amazing view over the Palma. it is not some special old castle but its position is very picturesque.",
          "Superb views from the top of this great castle. When we visited there was a live show in the piazza and some small exhibits in rooms within the castle. Worth a few hours of your trip but not much to do.",
          "Great place to visit. Plan to go up using car or taxi, also sightseeing tour goes there. It is 466 steps down, save yourself! Views are so great, lots of great pictures to take home",
          "A very interesting place. A good hike up the hill (and the way back - legs not happy the next morning, but worth it), lots and lots of little nooks a crannies of old stone walls, stairs that have seen a million feet. Roman artefacts, statues and plenty of local history. Very",
          "Tip 1: download the audio guide beforehand if you can. It was really informative. The castle itself is large and has an interesting history. Particularly enjoyed the Roman statue collection. The second floor affords fabulous views over Palma. Tip 2 : use the tourist bus to gain",
          "You can see why Bellver was built as it has a fantastic position on a high point above Palma and would have been strategic in the time of Jaime I. It is an interesting building being completely round with a central courtyard. Part of the upper level has some furnishings to",
          "There are amazing views from the castle, it is FREE on Sundays. There are two ways to reach the castle if you are able, then it's good to walk through the forest area, however, there are many steps and it is steep, alternatively walk the road way or you can get buses or taxis,",
          "After reading reviews complaining about the walk up, I was slightly concerned but I am very happy I walked up. The stairs are quite wide and shallow, so easy to climb. There are many stop points along the way with amazing views! At the top, the castle is very nice with a small",
          "This is an excellent castle. The architecture and views are superb and there is a fascinating history of Palma. Thoroughly enjoyed the trip and a very reasonable entrance fee at 4 euros.",
          "A little far for us to walk from Palma so we caught a taxi and decided to walk the journey back. Beautiful scenery and views. Reasonably priced at 4 euros and provided about an hour and a half of activity, not including walking back through the woodland.",
          "We went up to the castle on a bank holiday. The views over Palma are amazing. The castle is an impressive building, well worth a visit. We took a taxi up and walked back down. There are paths around the area too, but we didn't know this until we were outside.",
          "The castle is worth the climb up the hill. If you enter from the gate to the south there is a long stairway up through the park. But the castle and the views are the reward! The castle can be entered and all 3 levels can be visited, ground, first and top. Loved it!",
          "I thought this castle was, although beautiful, rather bland but the view over Palma from the top was worth the visit.",
          "The Mallorcan version of the Tower of London but in castle form. Lovely exhibition on the history and archaeology of Palma, a must. However you can catch the bus but the walk up the steps past the chapel was lovely",
          "The last stone of this castle could have been laid yesterday. It is unusual for its shape and for the all-but-impregnable round tower which is its most notable feature. Unsurprisingly, the castle has served as a prison until relatively recently. Don\u2019t miss the superb views of",
          "The first vista that greeted us upon arrival in Palma de Mallorca cruise terminal was Castell de Bellver bathed in the morning sun! We had the cathedral on our bucket list, but that castle was an immediate \"must do\". The easiest way to do a one day stopover is the good ol'",
          "A nice view with a neat building the exhibits were a little dated but interesting with good English translations. Well worth the walk up to the top. At 4\u20ac the price is correct.",
          "Perched high above the city this castle offers great views of the bay and a lesson in the history of the city. Be warned, if you\u2019re not on a sight seeing tour (we weren\u2019t) it\u2019s an 800m climb up several hundred steps to the entrance",
          "Took route up through the forest and then back down on the steps. Castle in pristine condition, interesting museum about history of Palma inside. Would have liked more information on the castle itself, but well worth the climb! Come early in the morning or later to avoid the big",
          "We visited the castle while staying in Illetas last year. Taxi there, then walked down the steps to the main road and caught a bus back. Great views, interesting museum with exhibits showing the history of Palma, nice cafe.",
          "This was a lovely and reasonable place to visit. The views of Palma were amazing, the cafe was a welcome site with nice coffee",
          "We walked from our hotel in the centre of Palma on the Rambla to the castle took about 40 mins, was worth it the views were breathtaking even though the walk up the steps was exhausting! Lovely coffee shop at the top very welcome!!!",
          "Well worth the visit. So mush information about te castle,Palma and the history of the island. The views from here take in he whole of Palma, truly magnificent.",
          "Loved this place despite the fact that I don't usually like to go around castles. Great value at 4 Euro each. We could have taken the Hop-on-hop-off bus to the castle, but decided to walk as it was a lovely sunny day. Walked to the far end of the Marina and then started heading",
          "Amazing place to visit. Also lovely views from the castle. Nice little coffee shop. We stop there when on the hop on hope off bus.",
          "You will enjoy the views from the Bellver Castell. Defenetly great to visit with kids or without kids Sunday is free",
          "An easy bus ride from Palma then a walk up hill through gardens. Many steps so beware but it is worth the effort. Stunning 360 views of Palma its hinterland and the coast. The Castell houses the history of palma from pre historic to more recent history. Very informative and",
          "We could see this castle from our hotel room so decided it would be the first thing to visit. It opens 10am during the winter so we strolled up after breakfast. You can walk up the steps straight to the castle or have a less strenuous walk up the road to the right. We chose the",
          "I also had the opportunity to visit this place. It was a bit of a long walk to the top but it was worth every step. The views from the top are absolutely amazing (and makes for a great backdrop for a selfie). Within the rooms are great historical facts to understand what",
          "Lovely castle with clean toilets, cafe and plenty of parking. Museum side of it we found a bit boring but if you like Spanish history it has loads of info, The view from the top was magnificent however looking right across Palma and the bay.",
          "Well worth a visit just for the views. Lots of information about the local history and civilisations. Also walking up the steps on the hill gives you a good workout.",
          "We went on a Sunday when it is free entry. The views of Palma are wonderful & the exhibitions inside are interesting.",
          "This is a fantastic castle to visit, situated on the hills overlooking Palma. It's about a 15 to 20 minute walk from Old Palma. The circular design is striking and the views from its roof are great of the surrounding areas. The museum is mediocre but that's a minor gripe",
          "We walked from the town to the castle through line woods and it was very pleasant. The castle is interesting and very clean but you don't need long inside. The trip is in the journey.",
          "Impressive architecture, beautiful views and interesting museum exhibition - worth spending a few hours here - at least instead of golf :) Take a taxi uphill and descend back to city along the shortcut path with stairs.",
          "Worth every step walking up to Bellver Castle. It is stunning and a must have visit if in the area. The top offers beautiful views. It is spacious enough when busy. Definitely worth it.",
          "Interesting old castle that is very accessible and reasonable well preserved. There was a marathon here and it was a little out of sorts with garbage cans overflowing. The views from there are amazing and we'll worth the effort.",
          "It\u2019s a long walk up the hill, if you are not driving. But worth every step. We can see the whole town, Cathedral, marina. Was sunny, beautiful day to explore it.",
          "Such a shame it is not been captured in a 100% as the date it was build anyway beautiful and impressive",
          "Took advantage of the lovely weather and walked to the top of the castle. Stunning views of the bay from the top level.",
          "We did not go inside the castle but took in views of the city from just below the castle. We were on a tour so time did not allow us to go into the castle. The views from the castle would be better as there would be no foliage blocking part of the view. The castle was built",
          "Nice old castle that has been brought to a beautiful condition but we paid 28 euros to get there and back from Palma and not sure I would pay that much to see a restored castle.",
          "Me and my partner choose bicycle to reach the castle, what was a bit extreme idea but we loved it. The pain has been paid out by the the extraordinary castle, well presented information and low cost entry. Actually hop-on hop-off bus even goes up there, strongly recommended to",
          "Very sympathetically restored castle with splendid views across Majorca. You have to book if you wish to climb up to the top turrets but the view is probably not much different than that from the ramparts. Nice cafe and cleanish toilets.",
          "Visited the Bellver Castle in January. Nice climb up some stone steps. The castle has been well restored and I was surprised to find lots of interesting things in the museum inside the walls. A little disappointed we couldn\u2019t get to the highest tower and was told that an",
          "Its quite a walk up from the marina but there are plenty of places to rest including a little viewpoint at the chapel half way up in the park. You can seemingly get a bus but that's cheating (unless you have to of course!) Well worth the visit for the views and really",
          "Really enjoyed the castle with stunning views of Palma from the top, quite a long walk to get there which included navigating through a woodland trail, but this just added to the experience.",
          "Beautiful and well renovated round castle up in the hill. You can sense the ancient lifestyle. Great view over the city. Definately worth visiting.",
          "What a wonderful place!! Lovely views all over Palma! A steep walk up , but So worth it once you are there! A must for all coming to Mallorca!",
          "Inexpensive to enter this lovely old castle is a good way to spend an hour or so. Small museums on all floors and excellent views across Palma as long as you go on a sunny day like we did.",
          "Early in the morning I decided to walk from the Santa Catarina area to Bellver Castle. The walk is only 30 minutes, slowly walking. It is also a great route for joggers !! I arrived too eary and the castle was closed but the area offers lots of seating for relaxing and",
          "Unusual layout with this circular shape. In very good condition and historical items as there are also a museum within the castle.",
          "I went with my family and my 2 kids. My 2 year old and 5 year old. The castle has a lots of stairs so prams are not advisable to take up there. It's quite fascinating to go around the whole castle and see the history and view from the top of the castle is just breathtaking",
          "Although the museum seems a bit aged quite an interesting museum, good views and nice location. Not too busy in winter.",
          "Set high on a hill with a fantastic view over the town and port/marina. If you drive up there is ample free parking. Really interesting place to spend an hour.",
          "Walked to the castle from our hotel on the front.The weather was reasonably warm so the climb to the castle was pleasant.Interesting enough to pass an hour or so.Great views of the marina .Exhibition inside of the history of Palma which I found very informative.Tried to get a",
          "Walked all the way up and enjoyed the architecture and the stunning views of Palma. Well worth a visit.",
          "A must when in Palma. Went up there on the hop on hop off bus and it was brilliant. The views were wonderful. Not sure what it would be like in the height of the season but in December it was pretty quiet",
          "On a hill with fantastic views over looking Palma. Worth the climb but it is also stop on the Hop on Hop off bus.",
          "My husband and I enjoyed a tour on our own of Bellver Castle. If you enjoy historic castles this is a no-brainer. It was a quick taxi ride up the hill. Once there you pay a small fee I think $7 euros or so per person. It\u2019s a great place to explore and a great view of Palma. It",
          "Fascinating castle. Great little cafe, stylish and well landscaped area. Castle fun and interesting. And a great place to stroll and feel the breeze. The walk up is good for the lungs and heart! But if you can't make that, then just get the tourist bus up there.",
          "Beautiful photopoint, a bargain for Eur 4 entrance fee. Definitely worth a visit to the cafe, food was great and the staff were lovely. Park was nice to stroll in as well.",
          "Walk down but not up lol Take a cab up for scenic views and some history inside and it\u2019s an easy stroll down a private sidewalk",
          "It was a good walk up from the town, google said it was a 12-min walk from the bus stop, probably closer to 30-min. We walked up, took pics and used the bathroom - great vista",
          "Worth the climb up over 400 steps to reach the castle ramparts. Museum was interesting depicting the removal of the city walls and the expansion of the city since. The views are stunning from the port and Cathedral to the end of the island was so clear and the mountains beyond",
          "We visited Bellver on a Sunday, as there is free entry then. The main selling point for me was the view which was simply breathtaking, but I also enjoyed the interior with its exhibits on Palma's Roman, Muslim and Christian history. Definitely worth a visit. Wear comfortable",
          "Stopped as part of a tour. The views looking out over the city below and the country behind are wonderful. Stepping inside was truly stepping back into history. The small rooms off to the side were full of statues.",
          "Castle in old town with lots of history and very scenic. The grounds are very well kept up. We visited this site as part of a tour of the Cathedral and the Castle.",
          "We got off the hop on hop off bus and walked to the castle after you buy tickets. The castle was nice all uneven rocks to walk on so be careful. The inside its very nice and theres a few statues. The view from the castle is nice since you are able to see the Palma marina",
          "We (family with daughters aged 6 and 3) on a sunday (hence the entrance was free), straight of our cruiseship. It was well worth the walk due to the stunning view from the top of the castle.",
          "Go by bus or tour, we went by taxi and found it difficult to get a taxi back to the hotel, we waited over 40minutes. It was really worth going and take your camera it will be needed.",
          "Took hop on hop off bus tour and got off at this stop. Views are fabulous of the city and marina. Not too busy during October half term. My 9 years old loved exploring the castle. Refreshments in cafe rather expensive but to be expected I guess.",
          "We walked up from Palma to visit the castle. Unfortunately not all of it was open, but it was a great morning with interesting facts about the castle and wonderful views over the city and the harbour. Well worth visiting.",
          "We walked to the Castle, via the harbour front, on a lovely sunny day. It\u2019s a bit tricky to find the way up via the side streets, but we eventually found the park, with lots of stone steps up to the castle. When you get to the top of these steps you have go along the road to the",
          "After quite the steep walk from palma harbour (can get a bus!). \u20ac4 entry very reasonable. Stunning views. Takes about 1.5 hours to get around museum exhibits and plenty of opportunities to take pics. Have to visit if in Palma!",
          "Visited just for a photo stop on our bus tour. It is high up at the top of a hill in a lovely wooded area above the city of Palma. We did not have time to go inside and I don't know if there was a charge for this. I did go in many years ago and I think it was free then. I did",
          "Great building in good maintenance shape. On the top you can enjoy a 180 degres views to the sea and the stunning harbour of Palma. Definately will go again next year!",
          "The castle itself is ok, its unique in it being circular. Cost just \u20ac4 to go inside. I went for the walk and the views which did not disappoint. If your in that area then worth the short visit.",
          "Having noticed this castle sat on its hilltop, it has been on our slot chit for sometime. We managed to visit last week and we are so glad we did. The views from the top are breathtaking. However I would point out it is a mission to get to the top. We counted over 500 steps! We",
          "Inside the castle there's an interesting look at the history of Mallorca including various pictures and historical objects and texts. The real deal however are the views at the top of the castle. You can see the entire city of Palma and surrounding areas. Well worth a visit! 4",
          "Absolutely awesome place with spectacular views of Palma . An absolute bargain at 4 euros but REMEMBER to buy your tickets by the car park , the inside rooms are full of artefacts and displays informing you of the history of Palma",
          "Well worth the 4 euro entrance fee just for the great views over Palma Marina and the surrounding mountains.A few ancient artifacts on show amongst the stunning architecture of this medival castle.Very pleasant coffee shop/bar which also does snacks in the car park area next",
          "We prebooked our hop on hop off tour of Palma de Mallorca to include the fees for this castle tour. It was the highlight of the Palma de Mallorca shore excursion of Norwegian Epic cruise itinerary. It\u2019s a round castle with a moat around it. You can toward the castle grounds",
          "It is slightly more difficult to get to than the rest of the tourist attraction, but it is so worth it. You get an amazing view of Palma from the top of the mountain, and it feels like the is no end to the castle. The little museum inside also shows you the \u201croman age\u201d, the",
          "Free as the castle interior not open when we visited? Only able to walk around courtyard,roof gallery on first floor but worthwhile to see the structure of a 700 yo strategic castle. Views over sea and along coast great..it is all very photogenic!",
          "We walked up to the castle early in the morning before it got to hot and it was definitely worth it for the views.The castle is in excellent condition and at only 4 euros each it was very good value",
          "We went to the castle quite early in the morning and on foot. It was not so terrible way to go as it was said!! We walked the whole way from Placa De la Reina, about 3km. On the stairs there was shady places where to rest and drink and over 500 steps were not SO bad.!! But when",
          "Fantastic views both out to sea and over Palma itself. Set high up in the hills amount the trees the castle is a must visit. A point to note is the ticket office is at the side of the car park backing onto a cafe selling most welcome cold drinks and not in the castle. If you can",
          "Great place for 360 view of Palma. Lots of steps to get to it....but we'll worth going to the top. Bring water. We came back down a diet track to the side of the castle. It's very well preserved.",
          "The most astonishing view of Palma from a castle with amazing architecture. Lost of stairs, but totalny worth it ;)",
          "Bellver Castle is located on top of a hill in Palma. If you do not like hop on-hop off buses, walking to the castle is a challenge but definitely worth it. You pass the bars and restaurants that local hang out and start to climb the hill where the narrow streets are full of",
          "Ok, so here is the bottom line. Located up in the mountain side overlooking the town of Palma. Construction began around 1400 and took only about 10 years to complete due to the incentives offered the labors setting the stone blocks. Exterior profile including the tower makes",
          "We walked here from the piers on a Friday morning. It was a good walk up the mountain and gives you a good sense of the surrounding areas. There are actually several trails to choose from as you ascend the hill. This was insightful as one of the main exhibits was about",
          "Fascinating circular castle with great views.a lot of steps but well worth the climb to the top. We reached it via the hop on hop off bus tour from the city.",
          "If you only have time to visit a couple of places in Palma de Mallorca, this should definitely be one of them. The view of the city is excellent and the castle is pretty neat. Just make sure you buy a ticket from the ticket booth, which is located by the main parking area,",
          "Historic and from there you see the entire city. Best is to read about it before you go because there isn't much information there.",
          "You can get a bus or taxi (less than E10) to below the castle or you can make the long walk uphill from the port. We took a taxi and walked down. This is a 14th century castle with excellent views around Palma from the roof of the castle. There is also a small museum. Great",
          "Very interesting castle with lots of information about the history of Mallorca and Palma. Free entry on Sundays.",
          "Took the hop on hop off bus here. It's so far outside town that we were worried to get off the bus, afraid another wouldn't show up like happens in so many cities. Not here though, everything was good! Beautiful views and great history. My sunglasses broke and dropped 2 stories",
          "Worth the climb to the top to take the breathtaking view from the top tower. Photograph opportunity of over Palma and harbour was amazing .",
          "The castle is worth a visit, but the museum inside isn't kept well. The translations are very rough, the information is very disjointed, and many of the artifacts are not labeled. Beautiful view from the top though!",
          "The place offers a nice view of Mallorca and posses a nice architecture but is quite small. The climb is challenging for small kids but doable.",
          "502 steps from top to bottom. A great bit of exercise if you are up to it. Refreshments are at the top if needed. There is an alternative road but why would you? Fab views when you are up there. I stayed at the Melia antenna which is about another 1500 steps from the entrance.",
          "We enjoyed a lovely 1-1.25hr walk to the Bellver castle. A castle that covers a lot of the history of Palma and how it came to be. Definitely worth it. Has a lovely cafe with superbly clean washrooms on top. And we caught a taxi back into to our hotel as it was far too hot",
          "Not easiest place to get to s its a bit out of the centre. We used the hop on hop off sightseeing bus, which with us being over 65 was half price (8-9 euro) , and takes you right to the castle. The views of Palma, city, bay, and surrounding hills were wonderful. Shame about the",
          "Great walk although could have done with more signposts. Lots of steps up to top very reasonable entrance fee with a very information exhibition",
          "We walked from our accommodation in the old town the 3km to the castle. The final part is hilly, but not excessively so. There is a visitors centre from which you buy the tickets before you enter the castle. The building is attractive (if that's an adjective you would use to",
          "We climbed up the hill to the Castle, well worth it. Sunday is free, slightly limited times. The view on a clear day is something.",
          "Considering I paid only 2 euros, having a discount of 50% for being over 65 years of age, I felt that the money spent was very well spent. There are a lot of exhibits in the rooms below showing the history of Mallorca, but the highpoint, for me at least, is climbing to the",
          "Really great views from this castle, that also has a unique circular courtyard and layout. Well worth the visit, just make sure that you have the logistics of getting there and leaving worked out ahead of time.",
          "Try walking up to the castle through the woods .When you reach the castle , don t forget to purchase a ticket from the cafe in the car park before you try to enter.Once inside the castle , if you climb the steps to the top you will be rewarded with fantastic views over Palma.",
          "Having walked up many steps to reach the castle and attempting to enter we were turned away as we did not have tickets. Apparently you need to go around the corner to buy them. No sign of that anywhere but it would have been nice to know! Regardless of this confusion, the castle",
          "Had a lovely visit. Very interesting though museum could do with more information! However we still found the museum informative.",
          "We spent a few hours at this lovely castle the view over Palma was amazing well worth a visit the only fault that I could find with this place is the fact that have to walk past the entrance to buy your tickets then take them back to the entrance.I would recommend to anyone",
          "Great for photographers, when the light hits the centre floor as a circle. Bring your tripod. Parking can be tricky, you might need to leave your car by the side of the road, walk past the castle to the ticket office and walk back down again.",
          "An authentic and amazing castle set high above the city of Palma with breathtaking views . Set in a park and contains a museum about Palma . The castle also has excellent acoustics and often the setting for classical music. Concerts in the summer . There is almost no facility",
          "website said it was open but when we walked all the way up, and there are a lot of steps, we got there at 2.45 and it shut at 3. It is a pretty castle but we only saw the outside. Update your website so others don't have wasted trip!!!!!",
          "I would highly recommend taking a stroll up to the castle. The entrance fee is 4 euros I think, which is great for the views of the city that you get to see. The little museum is great and is filled with some very interesting facts about the history of Mallorca. For",
          "We stayed in El Arenal and decided to take a day trip into Palma to visit the cathedral and castle we checked the website and it was showed the castle closed at 5 pm. After walking up many many step in the scorching sun we arrived at the castle to be met by several disappointed",
          "Short hike up a well maintained hill with steps and you are outside the Castle. Entry from 10am and around \u20ac4 per adult. Well worth the walk and would definitely recommend if you are visiting Palma.",
          "Worth to climb to get to the top of the castle to see great views of bay, the mountains and Palma. Easily accessible by city sightseeing bus.",
          "Bellver is not easy to reach by car and using Google maps to find it probably didn't help but once you get there it is an interesting place to visit. Very well preserved and with a museum within the walls it gives an interesting insight into the island's past. Far ranging views",
          "We parked the car below the hill and walked up because google maps showed you couldn't drive there. At 11.00 in August that was a mistake, we were exhausted when we reached the castle and then we saw that you could drive up and park next to the castle. There weren't really so",
          "We decided to walk up to the castle from central Palma. It's a good 30 minute brisk walk but enjoyable. Tickets are \u20ac4 but well worth it. The castle is well preserved and the museum well managed with some interesting features. I especially liked the history of Palma section,",
          "The walk up the steps with the cicadas singing in the trees on the way up to the castle was hot, but great. The museum was informative and interesting. The views of Palma from the roof make this a must see attraction, and while you're up there, check out the Napoleonic",
          "Loved it here! Only \u20ac4 entrance but views of Palma are magnificent and well worth the money. Highly recommend",
          "The castle itself is interesting and in it is a museum showing the history of Palma. Probably the best way to reach it is by the open top tourist bus or by hire car.Nice to spend a couple of hours.",
          "We walked up to the castle via the steps (about 10 mins). The view is great and gets better once you get into the castle. The castle itself is stunning, all curves and arches - monumental and forboding from the outside but calm and cool within. Interesting exhibition inside.",
          "Probably best to go early in the day because it gets very hot very quickly, and there is no shade to speak of once you get to the top. The climb up through the woods from the street below, if you don't rush at it, is a worthwhile part of the visit as the surroundings are",
          "Highly recommended! Visited here during the afternoon, best time of day to go as the views from the castle are incredible. A fairly cheap entry with no queues. Beautiful structure and historical elements and artifacts inside the room of the castle. The best part was definitely",
          "Visited this on a very hot day via the Palma tourist bus. Visit to the castle was worth it as views of Palma were excellent. Castle itself is quite small, but very accessible. Unfortunately the cafe capacity was limited for the much needed water.",
          "We went to the castle on the open top bus.The drive to and from was interesting and the views from the castle are excellent. Look out over the Bay of Parma. Worth going here , it is a fine example of medieval architecture.",
          "Bellvere castle was built between 1300 and 1311. It was once used as a military prison. Although I didn't tour inside, the outside was cool for a photo stop. It also offered a panoramic view of Palma below. There are many steps to get to the entrance for those who need",
          "Fantastic views across Palma, lots of opportunities for photos. Castle is well worth visiting and lots of information given.",
          "A castle with unique round arquitectura situated in one of the most beautiful spots. It has an interesting history by itself but displays the history of Palma as A museum. I enjoyed the visit. Additionally concerts are given there but tickets are not easy to get.",
          "You wouldn't really know it was there until you get there. The views over Palma are to die for. Great place for photography too.",
          "Went to view the castle towards the evening not very busy. Not much to it but the view is brilliant. Well worth it for only \u20ac4 if you are stuck for something to do. If not very mobile would recommend a taxi to the castle as there are a lot of steps. Would recommend.",
          "Just fantastic! Overwhelming view over palma. Sunday closed at 3 pm. Monday is closed. Other days are open. Website opening hours don't matches with the real castle opening hours. So be sure to be there in the middle of the day for sure. Aside from that the pictures are better",
          "Great value for the money (4\u20ac adult ticket). There is an exhibition about Palma's history inside of the castle which was more informative that the guided tour we took in the city. And of course, the view from the top was magnificent. When you walk there from the city, going up",
          "Take a taxi up to the Castel and walk down back to town. The views of Palma are worth the visit. The castle itself is less impressive than others in Europe but it's a perfect view for sure. Exhibits are a quick walk through. Take time to enjoy the terrace. Great for families!",
          "There are amazing views from the castle of the city below. Many picture opportunities. We visited on a free day so no pamphlets or guides were available. We enjoyed walking around and looking in the rooms. Worth the visit.",
          "Visited in the full warmth of Summer and the castle embraced all 5 kids. We were two families and we had a blast, the tour guide we employed gave the adults a great historical over view, while the kids could safely enjoy the run of the castle. Just a fun space.",
          "Bellver castle is situated on a hilltop overlooking Palma and even before entering it you can see how impressive it is! Well preserved 14th century castle, really cheap to enter (especially compared to UK prices for the same sort of experience at a less impressive castle!) It's",
          "Stopped off as part of the city sightseeing bus, and was impressed. Was able to walk all the way around and the views over Palma are excellent. Don't miss the museum which is hidden away behind the ground floor doors",
          "Fantastic views of the city and the port from the top of the castle. Only \u20ac4 admissions, not a great deal to see but a lot of history of the area and architect to read up on within the castle rooms Nice central courtyard that was hosting a wedding on the day we were there",
          "Bellver Caste was on the hop on /off bus route and I am glad we got off to visit. Great view of the city from the castle and very interesting exhibits on display in the castle.",
          "If you want to spend 1-2 hours enjoying some insights into Palma history and having a nice view from above to the city, visit this place! Our children liked it very much and we as well.",
          "Taking the walk up the hill on a hot day was the perfect way to visit the castle. Not only are the views great but lots to see inside too. Look out for very old graffiti.",
          "We arrived in the morning al Palma de Mallorca , so untill we could enter the hotel , we've visit the Castle. Interesting , if you like buildings you shoud give it a try .",
          "I've been to Bellver castle many times. It's beautiful located on top of a hill. Do your self a favour and walk up to the castle through the forest, the surroundings are amazing. So much history to learn inside the castle and after a visit, the cafe offers coffee, cake etc",
          "We took the 'hop on hop off' bus so very easy to get to by this mode of transport. We went on a Sunday and a little confused as there were signs for tickets, but no where to buy them so entry was free! A small but interesting museum on the first level, which did not take long to",
          "Totally free I couldn't believe it, was worth paying for totally worth see and I really enjoyed it. No cafe or drinks available although there was a toilet. Loved it and fantastic views",
          "We walked from central Palma to Bellver Castle. It was a very hot day and was quite the effort. The views from Bellver Castle were incredible - you can see all of Palma. Other than that, there wasn't a ton to see or do at Bellver. It feels like more of a ruin than a museum.",
          "Great place with amazing panorama! There is a cafe nearby, also the castle is surrounded with great view.",
          "Loved how this Castle is surrounded by land instead of by houses. The castle has been well preserved. Their is no furniture. Their is a small museum. I did not really enjoy the exhibits.",
          "Anyone who is interested in fortifications or history in general will be mad for this place. As it's relatively small, anyone can also enjoy this castle as it's only a 1.5 hour visit. There is a museum but we found the best bit was just walking around the intriguing",
          "We got the sightseeing tour bus up the hill to the castle as seemed the easiest way to get there. There is a new-ish cafe and we had breakfast before heading in to the castle. The castle is very interesting and had plenty of exhibits. You can head up to the top and get some",
          "Nice way to spend an afternoon, interesting exhibits. Great city views. Kept kids entertained. Nice coffee shop.",
          "Partner and I visited today (Monday) briefly. Sadly the place is closed on a Monday but in the short time we had there walking I still found enjoyment. The walk from the bottom to the top will be very difficult although there is plentiful parking at the top and an open bus to",
          "Sadly this place is closed on a Monday. It seemed really decent and I look forward to going back. Lovely lovely cafe, great clean toilet block and ample parking at the top. I think it was 4 euros to get in, great view. I haven't been inside hence only giving three stars. If you",
          "The castle itself is not superimpressive, you have to come here for the awesome view of the city, bay and forest. However, in the heat it is not wise to climb the hill by foot (go by car or sight-see bus). And the ticket booth is away from the castle itself, you have to walk",
          "Definitely well worth a visit,we walked to it but it's all uphill and signposts not very good,the facilities are well thought out with good parking,clean toilets and nice cafe",
          "Nice enough, but quite small. Went round in less than an hour. Views obscured by trees - otherwise would have been amazing. Easiest way to get there if you don't have a car or not on the sight-seeing bus is by taxi - bit of a hike uphill to walk. Girl in ticket booth happy to",
          "From the castle there is a great view. That's about it. On a hot day it's also often a cool breeze up there.",
          "A great walk up through the pines with very noisy cicadas. The view is breathtaking. A good museum on site.",
          "We booked a taxi as we heard it was a steep climb. I felt sorry for people doing the steep climb up a long road. We went up the steps to the entrance but were told by a very grumpy, cross looking man that we should get tickets from the bottom of the steps, around a corner. There",

          "We visited in July and it was ten euro for a family with two teenagers - those under 14 are free - which is excellent. Views are good from the top of castle and it has some nice exhibits on the history of the city and island - worth a look but be warned the entrance is weirdly",
          "We came to Bellver with little expectations as we had never really heard of it. We were very surprised as it was one of the highlights of Palma. The view is spectacular and the story of the castle is even better, well worth the Visit",

          "We walked from the old town along the promenade and up the back streets towards Bellver castle. If you're walking you go through the chained gate and can go directly up the long flight of steps or meander around the woodland upto the castle, which is what we did. Buy your ticket",

          "To get to the castle there were a lot of steps. Apparently there was a shaded path, however we would not find this. There were shaded veiwing areas on the steps so we would rest while enjoying the view. Any reasonably fit person would make the climb with ease. Several locals use",
          "Just been here today and decided to walk up to the castle. As each coach passed we were not regreting our decision. If you take the gentle slope up to castle and not the stairs.(use the stairs on the way back down) You will feel that you have accomplished something when you",
          "It is a nice fort to visit and it's in a good shape, but no transportation goes back from it and it's on a hill. I walked a half hour back to the city center (down the hill) which is not comfortable in the heat.",
          "This is a castle in fantastic condition. Well worth a visit and lots to see. We went via a sight seeing bus which was great. A long walk if you choose a normal bus. Would recommend a visit if you like castles and nice to see in the sunshine."

        "wiki": "Mallorca (Catalan: [m\u0259\u02c8\u028e\u0254\u027ek\u0259], Spanish: [ma\u02c8\u028eo\u027eka]) or Majorca (English:  m\u0259-YOR-k\u0259, -\u2060JOR-) is the largest island in the Balearic Islands, which are part of Spain and located in the Mediterranean.  The local language, as on the rest of the Balearic Islands, is Catalan, which is co-official with Spanish.\nThe capital of the island, Palma, is also the capital of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. The Balearic Islands have been an autonomous region of Spain since 1983. There are two small islands off the coast of Mallorca: Cabrera (southeast of Palma) and Dragonera (west of Palma). The anthem of Mallorca is \"La Balanguera\".\nLike the other Balearic Islands of Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera, the island is an extremely popular holiday destination, particularly for tourists from Germany and the United Kingdom. The international airport, Palma de Mallorca Airport, is one of the busiest in Spain; it was used by 28 million passengers in 2017, with use increasing every year since 2012.The name derives from Classical Latin insula maior, \"larger island\". Later, in Medieval Latin, this became Maiorica, \"the larger one\", in comparison to Menorca, \"the smaller one\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric settlements ===\n\nLittle is recorded of the earliest inhabitants of the island. Burial chambers and traces of habitation from the Neolithic period (6000\u20134000 BC) have been discovered, particularly the prehistoric settlements called talaiots, or talayots. They raised Bronze Age megaliths as part of their Talaiotic culture. A non-exhaustive list is the following:\n\nCapocorb Vell (Llucmajor municipality)\nNecr\u00f2poli de Son Real (east of Can Picafort, Santa Margalida municipality)\nNovetiforme Alemany (Magaluffa, Calvi\u00e0, Miconio)\nPoblat Talai\u00f2tic de S'Illot (S'Illot, Sant Lloren\u00e7 des Cardassar municipality)\nPoblat Talai\u00f2tic de Son Forn\u00e9s (Montu\u00efri municipality)\nSa Canova de Morell (road to Col\u00f2nia de Sant Pere, Art\u00e0 municipality)\nSes Pa\u00efsses (Art\u00e0 municipality)\nSes Talaies de Can Jordi (Santany\u00ed municipality)\nS'Hospitalet Vell (road to Cales de Mallorca, Manacor municipality)\n\n\n=== Phoenicians, Romans, and Late Antiquity ===\n\nThe Phoenicians, a seafaring people from the Levant, arrived around the eighth century BC and established numerous colonies. The island eventually came under the control of Carthage in North Africa, which had become the principal Phoenician city. After the Second Punic War, Carthage lost all of its overseas possessions and the Romans took over.The island was occupied by the Romans in 123 BC under Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus. It flourished under Roman rule, during which time the towns of Pollentia (Alc\u00fadia), and Palmaria (Palma) were founded. In addition, the northern town of Bocchoris, dating back to pre-Roman times, was a federated city to Rome. The local economy was largely driven by olive cultivation, viticulture, and salt mining. Mallorcan soldiers were valued within the Roman legions for their skill with the sling.In 427, Gunderic and the Vandals captured the island. Geiseric, son of Gunderic, governed Mallorca and used it as his base to loot and plunder settlements around the Mediterranean  until Roman rule was restored in 465.\n\n\n=== Middle Age and Modern history ===\n\n\n==== Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages ====\nIn 534, Mallorca was recaptured by the Eastern Roman Empire, led by Apollinarius. Under Roman rule, Christianity thrived and numerous churches were built.\nFrom 707, the island was increasingly attacked by Muslim raiders from North Africa. Recurrent invasions led the islanders to ask Charlemagne for help.\n\n\n==== Moorish Mallorca ====\n\nIn 902, Issam al-Khawlani(es)(ca) (Arabic: \u0639\u0635\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u064a\u200e) conquered the Balearic Islands, and it became part of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba. The town of Palma was reshaped and expanded, and became known as Medina Mayurqa. Later on, with the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba at its height, the Moors improved agriculture with irrigation and developed local industries.\nThe caliphate was dismembered in 1015. Mallorca came under rule by the Taifa of D\u00e9nia, and from 1087 to 1114, was an independent Taifa. During that period, the island was visited by Ibn Hazm. However, an expedition of Pisans and Catalans in 1114\u201315, led by Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, overran the island, laying siege to Palma for eight months. After the city fell, the invaders retreated due to problems in their own lands. They were replaced by the Almoravides from North Africa, who ruled until 1176. The Almoravides were replaced by the Almohad dynasty until 1229. Ab\u00fa Yahya was the last Moorish leader of Mallorca.\n\n\n==== Medieval Mallorca ====\n\nIn the ensuing confusion and unrest, King James I of Aragon, also known as James the Conqueror, launched an invasion which landed at Santa Pon\u00e7a, Mallorca, on 8\u20139 September 1229 with 15,000 men and 1,500 horses. His forces entered the city of Medina Mayurqa on 31 December 1229. In 1230 he annexed the island to his Crown of Aragon under the name Regnum Maioricae.\n\n\n==== Modern era ====\n\nFrom 1479, the Crown of Aragon was in dynastic union with that of Castile. The Barbary corsairs of North Africa often attacked the Balearic Islands, and in response, the people built coastal watchtowers and fortified churches. In 1570, King Philip II of Spain and his advisors were considering complete evacuation of the Balearic islands.In the early 18th century, the War of the Spanish Succession resulted in the replacement of that dynastic union with a unified Spanish monarchy under the rule of the new Bourbon Dynasty. The last episode of the War of Spanish Succession was the conquest of the island of Mallorca. It took place on 2 July 1715 when the island capitulated to the arrival of a Bourbon fleet. In 1716, the Nueva Planta decrees made Mallorca part of the Spanish province of Baleares, roughly the same to present-day Illes Balears province and autonomous community.\n\n\n=== 20th century and today ===\nA Nationalist stronghold at the start of the Spanish Civil War, Mallorca was subjected to an amphibious landing, on 16 August 1936, aimed at driving the Nationalists from Mallorca and reclaiming the island for the Republic. Although the Republicans heavily outnumbered their opponents and managed to push 12 km (7.5 mi) inland, superior Nationalist air power, provided mainly by Fascist Italy as part of the Italian occupation of Majorca, forced the Republicans to retreat and to leave the island completely by 12 September. Those events became known as the Battle of Majorca.Since the 1950s, the advent of mass tourism has transformed the island into a destination for foreign visitors and attracted many service workers from mainland Spain. The boom in tourism caused Palma to grow significantly.\nIn the 21st century, urban redevelopment, under the so\u2011called Pla Mirall (English \"Mirror Plan\"), attracted groups of immigrant workers from outside the European Union, especially from Africa and South America.\n\n\n==== Archaeology ====\nA 3,200-year-old well-preserved Bronze Age sword was discovered by archaeologists under the leadership of Jaume Deya and Pablo Galera on the Mallorca Island in the Puigpunyent from the stone megaliths site called Talaiot. Specialists assumed that the weapon was made when the Talaiotic culture was in critical comedown. The sword will be on display at the nearby Majorca Museum.\n\n\n=== Palma ===\n\nThe capital of Mallorca, Palma, was founded as a Roman camp called Palmaria upon the remains of a Talaiotic settlement. The turbulent history of the city had it subject to several Vandal sackings during the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It was later reconquered by the Byzantines, established by the Moors (who called it Medina Mayurqa), and finally occupied by James I of Aragon. In 1983, Palma became the capital of the autonomous region of the Balearic Islands. Palma has a famous tourist attraction, the cathedral, Catedral-Bas\u00edlica de Santa Mar\u00eda de Mallorca, standing in the heart of the City looking out over the ocean.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate of Mallorca is a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa), with mild and stormy winters and hot, bright, dry summers. Precipitation in the Serra de Tramuntana is markedly higher. Summers are hot in the plains, and winters mild, getting colder in the Tramuntana range, where brief episodes of snow during the winter are not unusual. The two wettest months in Mallorca are October and December.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nMallorca and the other Balearic Islands are geologically an extension of the fold mountains of the Betic Cordillera of Andalusia. They consist primarily of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea during the Mesozoic era. These marine deposits have given rise to calcareous rocks which are often fossiliferous. The folding of the Betic Cordillera and Mallorcan ranges resulted from subduction of the African plate beneath the Eurasian plate with eventual collision. Tectonic movements led to different elevation and lowering zones in the late Tertiary period, which is why the connection to the mainland has been severed at the current sea level. \nThe limestones, which predominate throughout Mallorca, are readily water-soluble, and have given rise to extensive areas of karst. In addition to limestone, dolomitic rocks are mainly present in the mountainous regions of Mallorca; the Serra de Tramuntana and the Serres de Llevant. The Serres de Llevant also contain marl, the more rapid erosion of which has resulted in the lower elevations of the island's southeastern mountains. Marl is limestone with a high proportion of clay minerals. The eroded material was washed into the sea or deposited in the interior of the island of the Pla de Mallorca, bright marls in the north-east of the island and ferrous clays in the middle of Mallorca, which gives the soil its characteristic reddish colour.\n\n\n=== Regions ===\n\nMallorca is the largest island of Spain by area and second most populated (after Tenerife in the Canary Islands).\nMallorca has two mountainous regions, the Serra de Tramuntana and Serres de Llevant. Both are about 70 km (43 mi) in length and occupy the northwestern and eastern parts of the island respectively.\nThe highest peak on Mallorca is Puig Major at 1,445 m (4,741 ft) in the Serra de Tramuntana. As this is a military zone, the neighbouring peak at Puig de Massanella is the highest accessible peak at 1,364 m (4,475 ft). The northeast coast comprises two bays: the Badia de Pollen\u00e7a and the larger Badia d'Alc\u00fadia.\nThe northern coast is rugged and has many cliffs. The central zone, extending from Palma, is a generally flat, fertile plain known as Es Pla.  The island has a variety of caves both above and below the sea \u2013 two of the caves, the above sea level Coves dels Hams and the Coves del Drach, also contain underground lakes and are open to tours.  Both are located near the eastern coastal town of Porto Cristo.  Small uninhabited islands lie off the southern and western coasts; the Cabrera Archipelago is administratively grouped with Mallorca (in the municipality of Palma), while Dragonara is administratively included in the municipality of Andratx. Other notable areas include the Alfabia Mountains, Es Cornadors and Cap de Formentor.\n\n\n=== World Heritage Site ===\nThe Cultural Landscape of the Serra de Tramuntana was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.\n\n\n=== Municipalities ===\n\nThe island (including the small offshore islands of Cabrera and Dragonera) is administratively divided into 53 municipalities. The areas and populations of the municipalities (according to the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, Spain) are:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria ===\n\nArchduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria (Catalan: Arxiduc Llu\u00eds Salvador) was the architect of tourism in the Balearic Islands. He first arrived on the island in 1867, travelling under his title \"Count of Neuendorf\". He later settled on Mallorca, buying up wild areas of land in order to preserve and enjoy them. Nowadays, a number of trekking routes are named after him.Ludwig Salvator loved the island of Mallorca. He became fluent in Catalan, carried out research into the island's flora and fauna, history, and culture to produce his main work, Die Balearen, a comprehensive collection of books about the Balearic Islands, consisting of 7 volumes. It took him 22 years to complete.\n\n\n=== Chopin in Mallorca ===\n\nThe Polish composer and pianist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, together with French writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (pseudonym: George Sand), resided in Valldemossa in the winter of 1838\u201339. Apparently, Chopin's health had already deteriorated and his doctor recommended that he go to the Balearic Islands to recuperate, where he still spent a rather miserable winter.Nonetheless, his time in Mallorca was a productive period for Chopin. He managed to finish the Preludes, Op. 28, that he started writing in 1835. He was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.\n\n\n=== Literature and painting ===\nFrench writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (pseudonym: George Sand), at that time in a relationship with Chopin, described her stay in Mallorca in A Winter in Majorca, published in 1855. Other famous writers used Mallorca as the setting for their works: While on the island, the Nicaraguan poet Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo started writing the novel El oro de Mallorca, and wrote several poems, such as La isla de oro. Many of the works of Baltasar Porcel take place in Mallorca. Ira Levin set part of his dystopian novel This Perfect Day in Mallorca, making the island a centre of resistance in a world otherwise dominated by a computer.\nAgatha Christie visited the island in the early 20th century and stayed in Palma and Port de Pollen\u00e7a. She would later write the book Problem at Pollensa Bay and Other Stories, a collection of short stories, of which the first one takes place in Port de Pollen\u00e7a, starring Parker Pyne.\nJorge Luis Borges visited Mallorca twice, accompanied by his family. He published his poems La estrella (1920) and Catedral (1921) in the regional magazine Baleares. The latter poem shows his admiration for the monumental Cathedral of Palma.Nobel prize winner Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela came to Mallorca in 1954, visiting Pollen\u00e7a, and then moving to Palma, where he settled permanently. In 1956, Cela founded the magazine Papeles de Son Armadans. He is also credited as founder of Alfaguara.\n\nThe English poet Robert Graves moved to Mallorca with his family in 1946. The house is now a museum. He died in 1985 and his body was buried in the small churchyard on a hill at Dei\u00e0.\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\nThe Ball dels Cossiers is the island's traditional dance. It is believed to have been imported from Catalonia in the 13th or 14th century, after the Aragonese conquest of the island under King Jaime I. In the dance, three pairs of dancers, who are typically male, defend a \"Lady,\" who is played by a man or a woman, from a demon or devil. Another Mallorcan dance is Correfoc, an elaborate festival of dance and pyrotechnics that is also of Catalan origin. The island's folk music strongly resembles that of Catalonia, and is centered around traditional instruments like the xeremies (bagpipe) and guitarra de canya (a reed or bone xylophone-like instrument suspended from the neck). While folk music is still played and enjoyed by many on the island, a number of other musical traditions have become popular in Mallorca in the 21st century, including electronic dance music, classical music, and jazz, all of which have annual festivals on the island.\n\n\n=== Art ===\nJoan Mir\u00f3, a Spanish painter, sculptor, and ceramicist, had close ties to the island throughout his life, he married Pilar Juncosa in Palma in 1929 and settled permanently in Mallorca in 1954. The Fundaci\u00f3 Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3 in Mallorca has a collection of his works. Es Baluard in Palma is a museum of modern and contemporary art which exhibits the work of Balearic artists and artists related to the Balearic Islands.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe Evolution Mallorca International Film Festival is the fastest growing Mediterranean film festival and has occurred annually every November since 2011, attracting filmmakers, producers, and directors globally. It is hosted at the Teatro Principal in Palma de Mallorca\n\n\n=== Mallorcan cartographic school ===\n\nMallorca has a long history of seafaring. The Majorcan cartographic school or the \"Catalan school\" refers to a collection of cartographers, cosmographers, and navigational instrument makers that flourished in Mallorca and partly in mainland Catalonia in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. Mallorcan cosmographers and cartographers developed breakthroughs in cartographic techniques, namely the \"normal portolan chart\", which was fine-tuned for navigational use and the plotting by compass of navigational routes, prerequisites for the discovery of the New World.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nIn 2005, there were over 2,400 restaurants on the island of Mallorca according to the Mallorcan Tourist Board, ranging from small bars to full restaurants. Olives and almonds are typical of the Mallorcan diet. Among the foods that are typical from Mallorca are sobrassada, arr\u00f2s brut (saffron rice cooked with chicken, pork and vegetables), and the sweet pastry ensa\u00efmada. Also Pa amb oli is a popular dish.Herbs de Majorca is a herbal liqueur.\n\n\n== Language ==\nThe main language spoken on the island is Catalan. The two official languages of Mallorca are Catalan and Spanish. The local dialect of Catalan spoken in the island is Mallorqu\u00ed, with slightly different variants in most villages. Education is bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, with some teaching of English.In 2012, the then-governing People's Party announced its intention to end preferential treatment for Catalan in the island's schools to bring parity to the two languages of the island. It was said that this could lead Mallorcan Catalan to become extinct in the fairly near future, as it was being used in a situation of diglossia in favour of the Spanish language. As of 2016, with the most recent election in May 2015 sweeping a pro-Catalan party and president into power, the Popular Party's policy of trilingualism (Catal\u00e1n, Spanish, English) has been dismantled, making this outcome unlikely.\n\n\n== Population ==\nMallorca is the most populous island in the Balearic Islands and the second most populous island in Spain, after Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, being also the fourth most populous island in the Mediterranean after Sicily, Sardinia and Cyprus. It had an officially estimated population of 896,038 inhabitants at the start of 2019.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSince the 1950s, Mallorca has become a major tourist destination, and the tourism business has become the main source of revenue for the island. With thousands of rooms available Mallorca's economy is largely dependent on its tourism industry. Holiday makers are attracted by the large number of beaches, warm weather, and high-quality tourist amenities. Due to the climate and diversity in roads, Majorca attracts a lot of cyclists.\nThe island's popularity as a tourist destination has steadily grown since the 1950s, with many artists and academics choosing to visit and live on the island. Visitors to Mallorca continued to increase with holiday makers in the 1970s approaching 3 million a year. In 2010 over 6 million visitors came to Mallorca. In 2013, Mallorca was visited by nearly 9.5 million tourists, and the Balearic Islands as a whole reached 13 million tourists. In 2017, ten million tourists visited the island. The rapid growth of the tourism industry has led to some locals protesting the effects of mass tourism on the island.Mallorca has been jokingly referred to as the 17th Federal State of Germany, due to the high number of German tourists.Attempts to build illegally caused a scandal in 2006 in Port Andratx that the newspaper El Pa\u00eds named \"caso Andratx\". A main reason for illegal building permits, corruption and black market construction is that communities have few ways to finance themselves other than through permits. The former mayor was incarcerated in 2009 after being prosecuted for taking bribes to permit illegal house building.\n\n\n=== Top 10 arrivals by nationality ===\nData from Institute of Statistics of Balearic Islands\n\n\n== Politics and government ==\n\n\n=== Regional government ===\nThe Balearic Islands, of which Mallorca forms part, are one of the autonomous communities of Spain. As a whole, they are currently governed by the Balearic Islands Socialist Party (PSIB-PSOE), with Francina Armengol as their President.\n\n\n=== Insular government ===\nThe specific government institution for the island is the Insular Council of Mallorca, created in 1978.It is responsible for culture, roads, railways (see Serveis Ferroviaris de Mallorca) and municipal administration. As of July 2019, Catalina Cladera (PSIB-PSOE) serves as president of the Insular Council.\n\n\n== Mallorcans ==\n\nSome of the earliest famous Mallorcans lived on the island before its reconquest from the Moors. Famous Mallorcans include:\n\nAl-Humayd\u012b, Moorish historian, born on the island in 1029.\nAbraham Cresques, a 14th-century Jewish cartographer of the Majorcan cartographic school from Palma, believed to be the author of the Catalan Atlas;\nRobert Graves, English writer, lived for many years in Mallorca, buried in a small churchyard on a hill at Dei\u00e0.\nRamon Llull, a friar, writer and philosopher, who wrote the first major work of Catalan Literature;\nJun\u00edpero Serra, the Franciscan friar who founded the mission chain in Alta California in 1769.\nJoaqu\u00edn Jovellar y Soler, 19th century military commander.\nAntonio Maura, two-time Spanish Prime Minister.\n\n\n=== Notable residents, alive in modern times ===\nEaktay Ahn (1906\u20131965), founder of the Balearic Symphony Orchestra and composer of Korean national anthem, lived in Mallorca from 1946 until his death in 1965.\nJeffrey Archer, English novelist, owns a villa in Mallorca.\nMarco Asensio, Spanish footballer, plays for Real Madrid, was born in Palma, Mallorca.\nMiquel Barcel\u00f3, contemporary painter, created sculptures in Palma Cathedral.\nConcha Buika, contemporary flamenco singer.

          "Over 300 hundred years in the making and it still looks fantastic, Apparently 300 years after completion Mr Gaud\u00ed was asked to give it an upgrade and after 12 years of indecision was sacked, love Gaud\u00ed but I love this cathedral as it is",
          "It is a very nice place. I know this Covid has turned us upside down. But the entrance to the cathedral is charged at \u20ac 8 as if you had a guide accompanying you, I think that to promote culture it should be at a more reasonable price.",
          "Amazing place to.see...a must do when visiting Palma. Architecture and history of building breathtaking.",
          "The structure from outside is quite impressive. This year was even more enjoyable since not many people around in full season.",

          "The magnificent Cathedral in the heart of Palma. A masterpiece of Gothic Architecture. Highly recommend the audioguide.",

          "I would highly recommend coming, this is one of the most beautiful architectural strictures I have seen. You can take a step back in time and really see and feel the history. Located on a beautiful hill overlooking the ocean this is a must experience. Make sure to bring a mask",

          "The guy selling tickets made all the tourists wait while he chatted on his cell phone to his girlfriend. Highly unprofessional. After 10mins wait we left hoping to return the next day. The next day, same problem but eventually he graced us with his attention and told us we could",
          "We heard people complain about entrance fee - 8 euro but we thought worth it considering the superb maintainance of the cathedral and the grounds. Very gothic, Gaudi, history, lots of info - just visit for yourself, its worth it!",
          "The cathedral is no doubt very nice ,old and an amazing experience. But we felt the entry fees are more for that. We felt the cost includes visit to palace as well. But it's only to see inside cathedral. There is no separate museum .little disappointed with the price they are",

          "Lovely cathedral. We loved the Gaudi touches, especially the baldachin. The windows are beautiful. The signage helped, but we couldn\u2019t find the brochure or guide they told us was available inside, which would have helped us better understand what we were seeing and also helped",
          "Really amazing structure and beautiful place. Nice catholic church. Old and historical. Love the windows. Worth the visit",

          "A visit to Palma can't be completed without exploring this beautiful cathedral. You can spend a beautiful afternoon in this cathedral and surrounding area. A walk around the cathedral will make you fall in love with it as views of the city will capture your eyes and you would",
          "We both enjoyed our visit to the cathedral, which dates back to 1229 and is the islands main church. The cathedral was not completed until the 17th century and is a massive place with its 21 chapels. It has lots of beautiful stained glass windows and one of them, the great rose",

          "I have seen many other cathedrals throughout Europe and this one is up there. The heights of the sprawling cathedral and the ornateness of the design is incredible. And the view of the city and the countryside from the spot is worth it on it's own. I walked around on my own",

          "Not as impressive as other cathedrals. It is expensive to get into, yet there is not much to see apart from the stunning gothic structures. Far more interesting is the historic surrounding areas san the historic walks of Palma.",
          "We visited on one of only two opportunities each year to see the reflection of the rose window at one end of the cathedral as the sun shines through it to form a figure \u20188\u2019 when combined with the rose window at the other end. The queue starts at around 7am and entry is from",

          "My partner and I spent a couple of hours in the cathedral. The light was shining through the stained glass windows, and it was truly magnificent. I sat quietly taking in my surroundings, and even said a prayer as the moment just called for it. Architecturally the cathedral was",

          "Palma has quite an interesting history that I had know clue about before going. This is a land mark that can be seen from really far. It's huge and sort of on a hill, we even saw it from the mountains. Definitely worth a visit. We didn't go inside though. I'm sure it's amazing",

          "I loved this place when I saw it. It's majestic. Is an excellent front page cover for Palma. Inside, is very spacious and colourful. Coloured glazign and gothic architecture makes this place a piece of art.",
          "Too many people, to the point that taking pictures of the cathedral itself becomes a hassle. Go on weekdays.",
          "Average priced tickets to enter the Cathedral, the walk around the exterior costs nothing as does entry to the Arab Baths if the gate has been unlocked. It\u2019s a beautiful place to visit. If you wish to pay extra for the audio guide you can but entirely up to you. We didn\u2019t bother.",
          "a visit during the low season is of course preferable as you can enter the cathedral without crowds and waiting time.",

          "A very interesting sculpture with very good views of the city. However, it was quite annoying to know, you can only see the cathedral from outside. All doors are closed a d no one is allowed entry. I think it would have been nicer if one could see the cathedral from the inside.",
          "Cathedral is very good architecturally beautiful structure and good to plan for days trip coupled with relax walk around the streets",
          "Wow this cathedral is stunning. Also, the views are incredible from the top of it. It was closed Christmas Day but we still enjoyed it.",

          "Incredible. Majestic. Scintillating. Spent three hours earlier this week at the Cathedral. Totally worth it. Had the opportunity to follow this up by attending midnight mass on 24DEC. Superb. Once in a lifetime.",
          "One of the most impressive structures I have ever seen. I would like in it to the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca, for striking beauty when you first to see it. Gigantic, but in a good way. An architectural masterpiece.",

          "the Catedral is very big and very impressive both outside and inside,there are certain hours, when you can visit the place inside",

          "am hindu , but i like to go in churches , this church is very beautiful , peace in mind , positive energy best",
          "This is simply a must do experience if visiting Palma, this cathedral dominates the city and walking around and inside just has to be done. \u20ac8 per person entry, allow a couple of hours to do the visit justice, enjoy the light shining through coloured glass windows and the",
          "The color crystals are impressive. Very high roof and a design that took years to make. Beautiful inside and outside.",
          "Highly recommended! You must see this beautiful place and you should know that it took 800+ years to build it up",
          "but once is enough. The Cathedral is of course incredible and THE tourist attraction but it is still a cathedral. I've been to Mallorca a few times and of course I went in but once is enough for me.",

          "One of the most beautiful church\u2019s that I have visit I took bunch of pictures. #1 place in the isle not for children\u2019s",
          "I meant to review this a while ago. I normally am not a fan of cathedrals, finding them oppressive and dark. This cathedral is full of light and life, the architecture a joy to behold. We were there around 10.30am on 6th August when the sun burst through the stain glass",
          "Went on an organised tour which happened to coincide with two or three cruise ships arriving the same morning. Thus the tour was rushed, the cathedral was heaving with people and not a particularly enjoyable place to be.",
          "Must to see if you are visiting Mallorca! The most famous building of Mallorca and number of 1 sighseeing goals on the island. Cathedral La Seu is a breath-taking place, so you also need to plan more time for sightseeing of it. Nice option is to buy the skip the line ticket",
          "Majestic cathedral in the city center. Nice surroundings, architecture and well worth to pay for an entrance ticket as the interior definitely matches the exterior, with its massive rose window, huge central dome and other art. Worth a visit when in the city.",
          "We visited in November. It was late afternoon and the low sun was blazing through the stained glass. The colours were beautiful. This is a really lovely cathedral, well kept, beautiful architecture and a momentous visit.",
          "If you like Gaudi work (and even if you don't:-)) you should visit to see a baldachino, an enormous heptagonal crown, that he created for the altar. This enornous heptagonal crown carries a dozens of candelabras and wrought iron lamps that gives the cathedral a delicate light.",
          "Beautiful cathedral..lovely stained glass windows.Really worth a visit. Entrance fee is 9 euros per person.",
          "A very nice cathedral from the outside at least. We didn't go inside, but it's very nice to talke a walk around it. There are tonns of sellers, but they are not very annoying, so they don't bother you that much. Would love to take a trip inside also at another occasion.",
          "The Catedral de Mallorca was stunning. I have visited a lot of cathedrals in Europe over the years but this is in my top three. The individual old chapels were amazing and each of them had a description easy to read. The Gaudi Chapel was a surprise and an added attraction",
          "We saved this for our last day with rain forecast. It was \u20ac7 for 65+ and we spent about 30 mins in there. It was a visit we enjoyed, it\u2019s an amazing building and a very calming experience away from the hustle & bustle of the city. The stained glass windows are really beautiful.",
          "A truly amazing cathedral with architecture to match. The stained glass windows are so colourful which make for nice travel photos. The religious art is very interesting and gaudy had a strong influence on parts of the architecture.",
          "It is not surprising that the cathedral is ranked the number one attraction in Palma. The start of its construction dates back to 1229 and its floor to ceiling height is 44 metres. The entrance tickets cost 8 Euros, which also includes access to the cathedral museum and",
          "The Cathedral is a stunning building but we didn\u2019t get the chance to visit the inside however the outside and surrounding buildings are amazing. This is more however. On returning one evening from a walk we heard music and saw lights around the bottom of the Cathedral. We",

          "Free entrance on Sunday mornings. Beautiful cathedral part of a great wander around town on a Sunday morning. Worth a visit.",
          "One of the most beautiful cathedrals I have seen. The colored lights as a result of the stained glass windows, and tall ceilings give a wonderful feeling. I opted not to take the 4 \u20ac audio guide and just enjoy the ambiance and architecture, but there are multiple plaques",
          "Truly beautiful. Each side chappel has facinating history and details written in English making it easy to enjoy and learn. Amazing at every turn. Set aside about 60-90 min inside. Nice area to walk around and grab a lite bite or gelato.",

          "Waited for mass to finish before entering. Its amazing to see on the outside, even better on the inside. Each section is well looked after and beautiful. Great stained glass throughout. Cathedral is filled with amazing items from the ceiling draped. Free too. Well worth it.",
          "Catedral de Mallorca a most magnificent building, you could spend hours and hours and never get bored",
          "As one of the main sites in Palma the cathedral is understandably busy but well worth a visit. There are some strange modern additions but the main body of the building and the ceiling are good examples of the period.",
          "Not to be missed and it is also centrally located. A lot of activities there and around it. Good shopping nearby too.",
          "We decided to spend the day in Palma, and took the open top bus around the city. This is a very informative trip and well worth a try. We then went to the Cathedral. I was amazed at the interior - it is stunning. You must make the time to see the Cathedral. You won't be",
          "Visited last week, very impressive and imposing architecture, lovely entrance grounds/ gardens upon approach, we sat on the grass in some shade! Once dark and the Cathedral is all lit up looks majestic from the roadside. Worth an hour or so of time to visit if in Majorca",
          "Wonderful place , great for taking photos as the structure of the building is very extravagant and unique. Enterance fee is excessive though at 7Euro per head, Compounded with high tourist tax Majorca is becoming an expensive place for holidays. For those on budget,",
          "Lovely day at Palma Cathedral well worth a visit. Very beautiful architecture inside and interesting history. Managed to go around without audio and could read all the cards around the inside. A must on a visit to Palma.",
          "Excellent photo external opportunities with both the cathedral, and of the ocean from the vantage point that the raised level of the cathedral provides. Beautiful views.",

          "We loved our visit to the cathedral and found the audio guide interesting and essential to our visit. The stained glass windows were extraordinarily bright and truly beautiful cascading light across the interior of the cathedral as the sun is lower at this time of year I think",
          "It\u2019s a must to see a fantastic place overlooking the city easy to walk around lovely gardens to relax in",
          "Though I've visited Majorca many times it was on Monday that I visited for the first time at my wife's suggestion. I was awestruck from the moment I entered the building. It was a day of strong sunshine and I was awed by the way sunlight hitting the stained glass windows",
          "We enjoyed walking around the exterior and interior of this beautiful gothic Cathedral which is the symbol of Palma. We made the mistake of not paying for an audio headset or a guide and as a result we didn't get the best out of the experience. Written information in English is",
          "What struck me on the outside was the absence of one or two high bell towers. The inside is beautifully decorated, occasionally a bit too much. I am not conviced that the colored lighting adds to its beauty. Other cathedrals abstain from doing this and can be as beautiful.",
          "We were visiting Palma de Mallorca as part of our cruise and someone recommended that we visit the cathedral. We were glad that we did! It is magnificent, with beautiful stained glass windows, statues and carvings, and filled with history. We rented the headphones which were",
          "One of the world's biggest Gothic cathedrals and an outstanding protuberant on the hill dominating Palma's skyline, visible from far afield. Entry is 8 Euros and worth it to experience this superbly maintained cathedral. It stands magnificent when viewed from below, across the",

          "First the moan very noisy and it was not very busy.People should remember this a church. That out of the way the Catedral de Majorca is amazing, little chapel to the side, fantastic windows,really worth the entry price. Memorable couple of hours. A walk outside gives you",
          "Beautiful and awe inspiring. 8 euros entry but well worth it. Lots of side chapels. Amazing windows and lights.",
          "On an organised tour of Palma with this as the main highlight we spent 2 hours taking photographs and admiring the workmanship involved in the structure of this fantastic building. Our young guide was full of detail and still respectful of her church giving us everything to make",
          "Amaizing building outside and inside, we visited it in october, it wasn't crowded. There is also beautiful view on the port, when you are standing in front of the cathedra.",
          "This imposing building stands tall on the waterfront and has those arching buttresses that remind you of Notre-Dame, together with the famous circular rose window. It\u2019s orange hued stone walls contain carved statues of people gone-by and the decorative wood work is amazing. Be",
          "A truly beautiful building with great works of art and architecture. Stained glass windows are amazing. Take your time to take in all of the artifacts you won't regret it. Worth the \u20ac9 entry fee",
          "We took a self guided tour and it was well worth it. The history and the architect is impressive. I believe they started work in the 1300 and didn't finish till 1500s. The location, the height and the surroundings are beautiful and well worth the visit.",
          "A giant cathedral with a unique gothic style right on the water seems more Star Wars-esque than thirteenth century to me. I love how the cathedral is in harmony with its seaside location. While not as tightly bound to the water as Falling Water or Mont St Michel, it is in the",
          "We have visited Mallorca many times with the kids over the years but as they have deserted us we decided to absorb a bit more culture. We spent a quiet 2 1/2 hours exploring this Gothic Architectural gem. 800 years old and still being crafted in the last century. This is one of",
          "Like many cathedrals of Europe.. the outside space and vacinity to other sites makes it a great part of a walking tour",
          "From the cruise ship across the water this cathedral is absolutely stunning. You can\u2019t miss it because it is so huge and wonderfully gothic. We walked a good distance from the port and then took a city bus to the old town area. From there walking is pretty easy and the best",
          "The Cathedral is the definition of a tourist honeypot \u2013 a must see when in Palma \u2013 from the outside it is impressive \u2013 standing high above the Marina with views out to sea \u2013 inside it is cavernous steeped in history with evidence of Gaudi\u2019s influence \u2013 we tried to visit in the",
          "Lovely peaceful atmosphere in the church and a beautiful hanging altar piece that was illuminated from time to time as I admired it from the pews. We did not queue to long to get in and there is a stunning view over the sea from outside the cathedral.",

          "Stunning architecture and loved the Gaudi contributions. The audio guide is worth having for an extra 4 Euros.",
          "We visited in October, so probably less tourists then in summer, but quickly to in after 30 min wait. One surprise, they accept cash only, so we had to do a quick run to an ATM. The cathedral is very impressive! Good visit with kids, easy to wander around and enjoy at your own",
          "Stunning building and well worth a visit. Only 8 euros and children free. Would definitely visit again.",
          "Not only is this church gorgeous, but the entire setting is captivating-- the grounds, the stauary and the pond.",
          "The actual inside and outside of the Cathedral were beautiful, the inside is not as big as expected but stunning and I did enjoy going in an looking around. Bought tickets online before but no great saving and on the day I went the queues were not bad. On a down side there was",

          "I can only describe the cathedral as spectacular. The cathedral dominates the harbor with its impressive size and scale. The get up to the Cathedral and you walk the cobbled streets surrounded by Gothic and Arabic inspired buildings. Then you go in the building and again I am",

          "The cathedral is breathtaking. It is 8euro for the tour inside the cathedral. There are horse and buggy rides you can hire to ride through the city centre.There are also lovely side streets and beautiful architecture. So many shops, cafes, bakeries uou could spend a week here in",
          "The cathedral a very special place. Our tour guide told us many fascinating facts about this place. The tour about an hour with lots to see and learn. Enjoyed the whole experience\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

          "The cathedral is in the strict Centre of Palma de Mallorca, so it\u2019s great for people going there by bus and the ones who don\u2019t wanna walk too much. The Palma-city area is also a great place with many romantic streets and old buildings You won\u2019t find on the newer continents.",
          "The Cathedral is excellent. We walked around the city and found a wonderful square with tapas bars. On the top of the hill there\u2019s a modern art gallery which is inside the ancient wall. Palma is well worth a visit even if it\u2019s a simple walk to view the yachts in the harbour.",
          "We had no idea that the Palma Cathedral is another incredible work of Gaudi. We only thought of Gaudi for his work throughout Barcelona yet here is a stunning church with a lot of elements in common with La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. If your travels take you to Majorca this",

          "Beautiful building. Fantastic experience. Everyone enjoyed the visit. Would go back as we ran out of time.",

          "We went to see the work of Gaudi. It was amazing to see and such a contrast with the style of the rest of the cathedral. Not sure the church authorities appreciate it as there are no postcards on sale of the work!",
          "A must see in Palma even if religion is not your thing. How they managed to build such a structure in the 13th century is an absolute mystery. It dis take about 400 hundred years to construct so generation after generation of builders, stonemasons and artists probably worked",
          "Its not widely advertised but you can pre-book on to a 20 only person tour up the towers of the cathedral & see Palma from the top of the cathedral. It is excellent - provided you are vaguely fit & don't mind 208 spiral steps! The booking process is all in Spanish & not a quick",

          "I walked there from my hotel, through the park, lovely water features. Once inside the cathedral just magnificent. Walking around the outside, to view the river and beyond adds to the atmosphere. On the other side of the cathedral, many shops, walk down narrow streets, I loved",

          "Magnificent building, beautiful patterns of light coming through stained glass windows, well worth a visit, a magical place",
          "One of the better cathedrals I have visited - the lighting through the numerous stained windows added to the atmosphere . Huge cathedral - great side chapels . Well worth a visit",

          "Unffortunatly didn't have enough time to go inside, but from outside and around the Cathedral it looks stunning. If you have spare time olease go in. Palma is big and beautiful town and lots of places to see...",

          "What a beautiful Cathedral outside and inside. Paid 8 Euros entrance fee, a little steep I thought but wasn\u2019t disappointed. The Cathedral is very warm and magnificent inside. Beautiful coloured glass window. Spent a while in there tKing it all in. Vey nice visit.",
          "Advised by hotel to get to entrnce by 9.45 to avoid lengthy queues. Good advice!! Entry is 8 euros each and only cash. Well worth it. Beautiful cathedral.",
          "You can only marvel at the wonder of Palma Cathedral, even if you are of no religous background, it is well worth a visit. The views from the outside terraces are just as good, overlooking the sea and port where all the cruise ships dock. Be prepared to queue if you have not",
          "Nice area to walk around and have beer at the side walk cafes. Didn't go into the church as it was crowded.",
          "Great experience, very helpful staff & disabled access very good. Would recommend a visit, stunning inside & out.",
          "Beautiful inside and out. We were keen to climb the tower and see the view from the top, but had been encouraged to buy a Spiritual Mallorca ticket a few days earlier. When we bought the ticket we were not told about the tower being extra, and when we asked if we could climb it",
          "Truly one of the more stunning places we visited in Spain. Excellent grounds, well maintained and breath taking architecture. Very crowded but not noticeable due to the layout. Go early if possible.",
          "Free entry. Last time I came here was in 2001 and I\u2019m not a religious person. My grandmother was dying at the time and I remember feeling calm and spiritual peace. This time my father was dying and it was a similar experience. It\u2019s a beautiful space with some fabulous windows",
          "A beautiful and magnificent cathedral in a wonderful city. Stained glass windows shine brightly in the sun.",

          "Not as grand as many European cathedrals but still nice. Did not buy tickets ahead of time at most a 10 minute wait for the tickets. Worth seeing for 8 euro but not real special.",
          "Beautiful cathedral inside and out. There is an entrance fee. If you ore buy your ticket you can skip the line. Look for the group entrance. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This is a beautiful piece of architecture and definitely worth a visit if you are in Palma. Of course you can expect to queue, but it is definitely worth the wait.",
          "The cathedral is a famous landmark on the Palma city horizon. It is difficult not to be impressed with the interior but there is too much to describe. On leaving we realized that you could visit the roof so we will have to return soon to do that. Incidentally the cathedral is",
          "We took a walk through while on our cruise stop. 8 Euro per person. The line was short and it was worth a look. Very impressive on the outside.",
          "The ticket price for seniors is \u20ac7 which is an absolute bargain. We expected to pay a lot more. How refreshing not to feel ripped off at one of the worlds best cathedrals. And this is really just that. If in Palma do not miss it.",
          "The gothic looking cathedral is certainly the focal point of Palma - well, it is for me. Set on a hilltop, the cathedral looks magnificent against the usual blue skies of majorca. The building is peaceful. The inside is wonderfully preserved with different areas allowing",

          "Reasonably priced 11eur per adult no guided tours on offer. There is underground parking in city centre but nightmare to find",
          "A magnificent cathedral. Structure, stained glass windows and artefacts take your breathe away. Loses a star because I was uncomfortable knowing the starving people with rife illness outside whilst the church was accruing all this wealth in the 13th and 14th centuries.",
          "The cathederal is breathtaking as you approach it but even more so inside, with the high ceilings and amazing stain glass windows, definitely worth a visit.",
          "Absolutely gorgeous, but we did find that the smaller churches which they don't charge admission fee for were equally as stunning and beautiful",
          "This is a stunning building with a long an interesting history. The 2 rose windows are magnificent and the 20th and 21st Century alterations and additions made it feel like a living and evolving building rather than just a 'museum piece'. The audio-guide was useful but a little",
          "Been here last week . What a beautiful and old heritage . Definitely worth a visit . Also you can park your car nearby underground parking.",
          "I didn't go inside, think there was a fee but I can't remember how much. We walked around the building and it was beautiful. Busy area but not enough that you can't get around and see the building from outside.",
          "What a unique experience and only minutes from our hotel. The flying buttresses are simply amazing and the peace and tranquility will astonishing you",
          "Magnificent Cathedral well worth a visit. Very centrally located within the city of Palma, close to shopping area and only a short walk to the beautiful port. Superb views from outside the cathedral over the whole bay. A must to see if you are in Palma.",
          "Everybody who stays on Mallorca needs to visit the cathedral, so get there early. It is open to the public from 10:00am so if you are there before 10:30am there is no queue and the inside is much quieter. The whole place is truly spectacular. I won't bother to repeat the",
          "Went to visit Palma Cathedral last week. Three cruise ships were in that day so very crowded and over subscribed.Felt upset at seeing a disabled lady at the entrance begging.I don't want to be upset on my holiday. Too many people trying to sell things all around. Wouldn't go to",

          "Over 600 years old bulding made from sand bricks. Looking very well from outside. I have not been inside as there was a big queue to ho there and we were rushing to see other things. But I recomend as top one to see in Palma the capital.",
          "This is amazing place. We were walking here for a long time and recommend to visit for everyone who goes for a vacation here.",

          "The Cathedral de Mallorca is a must see place in Palma. It is extremely big and beautiful. The Gaudi details can be seen in the middle of the front part. The presentations of the saints is precise and perfect.",
          "I was awestruck upon walking in to this glorious cathedral. It induced reverence. The height is amazing and the stained glass windows by Gaudi are mesmerizing. It is a total \u201cWOW!\u201d",
          "I\u2019m probably a bit biased but I didn\u2019t find this particular cathedral to be that impressive. However, I have been to almost all the famous cathedrals and churches in Europe such as Vatican, Seville, Barcelona, Italy and France etc, and found this one to be somewhat poorly",
          "For me the capital city of Mallorca wouldn\u2019t be the same withought this beautiful catedral with a very big walking area in front of it with gardens and fountains, also the view of the city from the catedral is amazing. The architecture is astonishing and it is definitely a place",
          "Really a must when visiting Palma Such a magnificent building It's as impressive on the inside As the outside and the entrance Fee isn't as much as I,d expected",
          "Absolutely stunning, a beautiful cathedral, make sure you have plenty of water with you as the steps are thirsty work.",
          "What an amazing cathedral. Really impressive architecture, took about 2 hours to get round everything. Definitely worth a visit both daytime and night time",
          "Not one for old buildings I\u2019m afraid but when we got out of the taxi and walked over to see the cathedral I got a bit emotional! It was simply awesome. It stands so majestic. I can see why many, many people come to visit. There was hundreds of people around the area. Maybe if we",

          "Beautiful buildings inside and out. Thought we would only be there an hour or so. But was there for nearly three hours walking around well priced for what you get to see.",
          "We just did a bit of sightseeing around the outside of the Cathedral before having dinner in the area. The gardens are interesting and the architecture is amazing. There are tons of people about, and you can do other activities like carriage rides, etc.",

          "Stunning location and impressive inside for the almost unique coloured windows. The price was a bit high at 8 Euros, as you'd struggle to spend more than 30 minutes there. Only go if you're really interested in church architecture.",
          "We parked in the underground car park in front of the cathedral, it's easy to get into and keeps your car cool, when you walk out onto the promenade in front of the church you know you are in a special place. The building itself is simply stunning, even if you are not religious",
          "What a beautiful building, so much history and wonderful artifacts. The stained windows are glorious. I thought it was good value as well as I thought it would be much more expensive for such an important cathedral. A fantastic experience",
          "This cathedral is a must if you're in Palma. Absolutely stunning and the surrounding town is lovely with lots to see",
          "One of the must see places in case you decide to visit Mallorca. It is located in the center of Palma city, which gives you quick access to the main streets of Palma. Enjoy.",
          "A beautiful building with lots of light. In total, there are 61 stained-glass windows \u2013 the most spectacular being the central rose window, which harnesses the morning sun, flooding the building with beams of coloured light. One of the most dramatic pieces in the cathedral is",
          "Just 8Euro to enter [7Euro for over 65s]. Ensure you arrive early to avoid queues. Access via the Museum entrance. Arrive early to witness the glorious rainbow spectrum of light thrown across the columns & aisle from the south facing stained glass window.",
          "We visited the cathedral in September. It was well worth the 8 euros to get it. The cathedral and grounds around it were immaculate. The only downside to the visit was that there were lots of beggars outside and they did harrass you a bit. Well worth a visit though.",
          "A complete story is told of this amazing cathedral from its origins to the present day. The self guided tour is much better today than it was only a few years ago with dated technology. Just marvel at the structures facade and the interior with an unhurried sit in the pews and",
          "Once inside the actual Cathedral the huge window is a show stopper. The blue glass was so bright. Lots of pictures and interesting things to look at. I lit three candles for family members and said some prayers. Even though it's open to the public, it still felt like a church.",
          "Great historical place, good atmosphere, great view on port A lot of restaurants and shops with souvenirs in short distance",
          "WE walked past the cathedral almost on a daily basis going and coming from dinner in the square. It overlooks a body of water and is up on a hill. We never visited the interior, but I imagine it must be beautiful inside as well.",
          "Beautiful buildings inside and out. We thought we would only be there an hour or so. But was there for nearly five hours walking around well priced for what you get to see. Lovely areas around the Cathedral to sit and have a coffee and take in the atmosphere. And people watch.",
          "An entry fee to see the interior of a cathedral that took 300 hundred years to build. Also know as cathedral by the sea.",

          "Stunning building and free to enter. The stained glass is particularly impressive. Gaudi influence in several areas.",
          "Dominates Palma and is amazing to see inside. Lot's of great stained glass and the famous design over the alter is impressive. Lot's of people but still worth it.",
          "We were holidaying in Mallorca in August and pre-booked the rooftop terrace tour. Each tour is limited to about 20 people, so not too crowded. There are a lot of spiral steps to get to the roof, and the staircase is very small and hot, so that's worth bearing in mind if you",
          "Can\u2019t understand some of the negative reviews to be fair. We booked a sightseeing bus and walking tour of the city and cathedral and was worth the money, \u20ac18 for the bus and another \u20ac20 for the tour and cathedral and it was worth it. You get to enter the cathedral through a",
          "Took a cab from our cruise ship to the Catedral de Mallorca with my handicapped Mother who uses a mobility scooter. Cabs take credit cards and Euros (not US dollars). Approx $12 Euros. Most cabs (and buses) will drop you at the base of the Cathedral and you have to walk up",
          "This huge building dominates the city and its position on the shoreline means it hasn't been lost in a modern urban sprawl. It took around 400 years to build, starting from the reconquest of the island from the Moors in 1229. There is grassland and a promenade in front of the",
          "Beautiful view close to the sea. If you won\u2018t pay for a ticket just go to a Mass, enjoy the service, the architecture and sunlight shining through the big colored window.",
          "Really interesting and beautiful cathedral. It's well worth getting the audio tour. Note that admission is cash only.",
          "You can see this Cathedral from a mile away as you approach Palma. This was my second visit and enjoyed it just as much. The entrance fee of 8 euros is well worth it. You can take your time in the Cathedral as there is a lot to see and the atmosphere is relaxed and not",
          "Visited here on a day trip to Palma. The architecture is fantastic. Well worth the \u20ac8 entrance fee. So much history. Don\u2019t forget to look at the crypts on the way out under the glass floor",

          "Had a lovely couple of hours looking round this beautiful building. If any advice , I got the audio tape But found it hard to use and find the things it was explaining. Maybe there is a certain route you take but couldn\u2019t find it . All in all it was good value for money and very",
          "Visiting the Cathedral is a regular occurrence as all visiting friends want a look around and I\u2019m still impressed with every visit. It\u2019s such a landmark of not just Palma but of Mallorca itself. It looks awesome from the outside and once inside you feel the respectful",

          "We visited the cathedral on a very bright sunny day which made it even more spectacular against the bright blue skies. A stunning piece of architecture set along the river. Not the most spectacular inside that we have visited on our travels, but still very interesting.",
          "Not to be missed. Notice the majestic Gaud\u00ed lamp coronating the altar. A modern computer study has shown that the slender columns are engineered to be right at the center of the safety structure range. Another interesting fact: The Cathedral is at an angle with respect to the",

          "We spent a couple of hours visiting here. We used the english self guided tour sets which were very informative. Coming from Barcelona it was interesting to see the Gaudi influence here. Unless you are coming on a cruise ship, we were told to try and arrive before the cruise",

          "A really outstanding cathedral not to be missed on a visit to Palma. Architecture is second to none so peaceful",
          "The cathedral is beautiful. There are some beautiful views especially the altars. The one issue was people not obeying the rules, and not showing respect, security should be more serious. Also a bit pricey to enter but it is worth it.",

          "Beautiful Cathedral, pay the 8 euros to gain access to both the museum, cloisters and Cathedral itself, you will not be disappointed. I would liken the inside to that of the Notre Dame, the art, sculptures and sheer brilliance of the contents are simply stunning !",
          "If you only have time to see one place in Palma, the Cathedral, Le Seu, as it is called, is the one. Magnificent Gothic church overlooking the Mediterranean Sea built in the 1300s and renovated by Antonio Gaudi in the 20th century. One has just to step in to see his fabulous",

          "Took advantage of a cloudy day to do some sightseeing by taking a taxi from Palmanova to Palma (\u20ac20). Catedral was top of our list. Breathtaking & imposing from a distance & gets even better close up. \u20ac8 entrance plus \u20ac4 for audio guide. Comprehensive instructions given by staff",

          "Myself and my partner visited Palma for 5 days. The cathedral is just beautiful both through day and especially at night when lit up. Lovely to walk around the gardens and lake. Bar right opposite which is lovely to sit at on an evening and look at the cathedral lit up.",
          "This is a beautiful Catedral which lots of interesting information. Colourful, grand and ornate! It is \u20ac8 entrance fee which I thought was a bit high but my friend wanted to visit. We did an independent trip, talking the 105 bus from Calvi\u00e0 ( Palma) into the bus station then",

          "What a beautiful building inside and out, but I felt \u20ac8 entry was a little pricey especially if there is a group if you. Queues outside were quite long but moved quite quickly (10-20mins). For women it says shoulders need to be covered but I saw people inside with strapless",

          "Great piece of architecture. A must see when in Palma de Mallorca. Stained glass was really cool. Inside and out something to experience. Great piece of history. The guided tour from the cruise ship really added to the experience.",

          "I have visited many churches and cathedrals on my travels and the Palma one is I can honestly say very poorly done. I am not a religious person but I felt it was totally disrespectful with people snapping pictures, posing on some of the side chapels alters with no quite areas",
          "beautifull building not really accessible for wheel chair users due to cobbled streets around it but well worth a visit",
          "We toured the cathedral as part of a tour from our cruise. The cathedral is absolutely beautiful inside and the changes made by Gaudi during its restoration were inspired, including installing electricity, creating a chandelier that is like the one in the Sagrada Familia in",
          "Beautiful cathedral that is set over looking the water. We were initially put off by the \u20ac8 price tag to get you in the gates but it was worth it. Well worth a visit to marvel at it\u2019s wonder.",
          "Palace very interesting. Excellent and we received free entry to the Palace as there was a festival in Palma that Saturday which we did not know ,so an extra bonus..Its my second time doing the Cathedral. Well worth a visit."

        "wiki": "Palma Aquarium is a commercial aquarium and park that first opened in 2007 in Palma, Mallorca, Spain. The aquarium is the property of Coral World International. The aquarium is 500 m (1,600 ft) from Playa de Palma beach, and includes 55 tanks which are home to over 700 different species from the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. One tank, \"Big Blue\" is 8.5 m (28 ft) deep, the deepest shark tank in Europe, and it also contains the largest collection of live coral in Europe The park was awarded \"Best Business Initiative in the Balearics 2007\", awarded by Actualidad Econ\u00f3mica magazine, and was awarded the \"2007 Accessibility Prize\" by the Consell de Mallorca.The aquarium organises environmentally focused activities, and takes part in protection and conservation campaigns.\nPalma Aquarium has more than 400,000 visitors every year, with an average of over 1000 visitors a day. 50% of its visitors are local and national, while the rest are mainly of European origin. Palma Aquarium has received several awards, including the \u201cBest Business Initiative in Balearics 2007\u201d award, awarded by Actualidad Econ\u00f3mica magazine and the \u201c2007 Accessibility Award\u201d, awarded by the Consell de Mallorca.\nA visit to the aquarium is presented as if it were a journey through the world\u2019s seas and oceans.\n\n\n== The Mediterranean Sea ==\n\nThe first stage of the \"journey\" shows Mediterranean marine fauna and flora including starfish, lobsters and slipper lobsters, scorpion fish, wrasses, groupers, prawns and shrimps, crabs, eels, rays, seahorses, octopuses, conger eels, algae and coral. Visitors can also have direct contact with some of these animals, such as the starfish, in the Touch Pools.\n\n\n== Tropical Seas ==\nThere are 25 aquariums in this section showing animals from the tropical parts of the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean.

Visitors descend to the central aquarium\u2019s observation area via a transparent tunnel, while sharks and rays swim over their heads.\n\n\n== Jellyfish tank ==\nThe Jellyfish tank is a cylinder-shaped aquarium containing about fifty jellyfish almost all of which belong to the Mediterranean\u2019s common species, Aurelia aurita.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nA number of different activities are available:\n\n\"Dive with the Sharks\". An activity for adults and children.\n\"Underwater\". In the summer, visitors over the age of eight can swim in the stingray tank, located in the Mediterranean Gardens.\n\"Shark Sleepover'\".

          "As a SCUBA diver I appreciate the work that aquariums like the one in Palma do in educating people about the sea. I have been to the aquarium three times and have enjoyed each visit. The online booking and the options are also easy to use, and facilitate in \"just pitching up\".",
          "A very nice place to relax. You should plan at least one day for this place. My kids and my Wife loved it!",
          "Lovely aquarium, my boyfriend and I spent 4hrs here relaxing and looking round at the beautiful fish. We thought the aqua dome was superb - so realistic! It was also great to see that the turtle was going to be released back into the wild once it had recovered. Overall a lovely",
          "I expected more -fish species variety is poor, as for me. I can compare this aquarium with aquarium in Istanbul(Turkey). Istanbul\u2019s aquarium in much more impressive.",
          "The aquarium is beautiful. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the whale dome. I thought we would see actual whales but it's more of a planetarium. It's 3D so still very cool, but I was just a little disappointed that there weren't real whales. I",
          "Too expensive for what it is , few things to see. Very badly indicated inside- don\u2019t understand where you are and where to go. The online map doesn\u2019t understand anything. No dolphins, only 3 sharks. And whales video;) couple of fishes ... If you have nothing to do one rainy day",

          "Arrived at aquarium for opening at 10:00, paid \u20ac75.50 for 2 adults and 1 child. The indoor play area was advertised as being open Monday - Friday 10:30 - 14:00 but this was closed and when I approached staff about this some of them were unaware it was closed and others explained",
          "A lot of fish, some impressive sharks and a 3D movie experience to see whales as you never will see them. Really a nice visit !",

          "Abusing animals. Really sad and not ok for me. I saw all the fish and whales inside the caves and I left the place .",
          "A really good set up, well run , clean and tidy. I tried my best Spanish but the staff's English was much better, very helpful and knowledgeable staff. The animals were all very healthy and well looked after. Well worth a visit.",

          "We had a nice surprise when visiting Palma Aquarium, they have a rich variety of different fish species, and we also watched a 3D whale documentary which btw was breathtaking!!!!",
          "I came here based on recommendation and was wowed. However, if you are coming here, make sure you are coming with a tour guide or someone who knows the aquarium like the palm of his hand. I came primarily to see the sharks but since the aquarium is a network of confusing rooms",
          "We went on Xmas day as not a lot was open and we rented bikes and rode from Palma for a little exercise. Its a lovely bike path and a gentle ride of about 7 km. If you have a car loads of onsite parking and you could take a bus They were closing quite early so we didn\u2019t get to",

          "Hi, i wish i could give this a positive review. We where exited to go, but the staff simply let in to many people in my opinion. Place was clean, people nice, however we didnt see much and chose to leave after about an hour of walking in a crowd almost as dense as a concert.",

          "Not just an aquarium but outdoor splash park and bouncy castle/play area. So much fun! Places to eat and drink and lots to explore. Make sure you take a towel and costumes for the kids to run around at the splash park",
          "It\u2019s worth every penny. The best aquarium that I\u2019ve ever been. The 3D theatre is amazing and the shark tank is fabulous",
          "When we first arrived we thought it seemed quite expensive for an aquarium however having spent the majority of the day there and still having not been able to get round everything I can definitely say it is worth the money! We had a 16 year old and a 9 month old with us and",
          "Great place, very detailed exhibits! The aqua dome costs extra but worth it as it\u2019s absolutely fantastic! Lunch and gift shop very expensive! Great wee play park here too. The big blue section is excellent! Would definitely come back here!",

          "This is an impressive place that could be a very relaxing experience. However it was not! There were numerous children under three years of age and the sound of crying and screaming was non stop. Parents were content to let their offspring run around, scream and cry. Pity.",
          "Amazing place not cheap but worth the price. Immaculate. And so much for children to do. Happily spent a few hours here.",
          "My family and I had an amazing time at Palma aquarium! We all agreed it was the best aquarium we had ever visited! So much care and pride they take in the place and animals. Also the 3D whale experience was brilliant too and well worth a visit! Definitely be heading back to",
          "Really good day trip for the family to the Aquarium. Well laid out and many species of fish to see. Fun trip on a glass bottom boat to travel over the shark pool so getting up close to these amazing creatures. Also had the experience of 3D cinema for an experience of being",
          "It was a good place to visit, can be a bit busy even on a rainy day that we went, but there is plenty to keep everyone occupied. There are restuarants, or take your own picnic... the usual overpriced tat in the shop, and the typical pushy photo with a parrot (10 euro) each",
          "It was an amazing experience. Worth going tbh. Bit busy even on a rainy day that we went, kids running from tank to tank, pushing in the way of others and getting into shoots of photos. But it has many different fishes and wildlife. Would recommend",
          "We travelled a bit to get here from alcudia was a good day out but a bit pricey if u wontvthe whale 3 d that was extra what was there was good but think the price could be changed to include a family ticket food courtdidn't have a great selection but the coffe bit was good play",
          "A rather expensive trip to an OK aquarium. It's vast so you would think that there would be more tanks etc. I didn't overly enjoy the 3D experience but some of our party enjoyed it \u2026 The food wasn't great but also was on the cheap side which surprised me! Rather pushy on exit to",
          "I took my kids 4&2 years to the aquarium and I was skeptical if the reviews are good enough and if we would enjoy -despite the fact that the turtles were gone for warmer place The kids loved it ! We enjoyed the colors , the information , touching the stingray, fish And really",
          "The aquarium is definitely something that many people decide to do on a wet day, as it is one of a few indoor family attractions on the Island. As it wasn't raining all the time we were at the aquarium, people were spread out across the inside and outside spaces. We had time to",
          "Very over priced . Once in aquarium, everything was extra to price paid for admission , eg aqua drome , family pic . Was also extremely busy so hard to stop and view the fish for any time . An ok trip but maybe numbers could be limited in time slots to ease congestion.",
          "This place is perfect for families with small children... When it's not busy. We went yesterday due to rain and it was absolutely packed. It was a real struggle to see the fish in the tanks because there was so much shoving. Far far far too many people allowed in. Definetly",
          "Arrived at Palma aquarium excited to see what it had to offer, took a walk through the first area of tanks unable to see most excibits due to the overcrowding of people trying to come in, the excibits we did see inside were nice but no starfish, pufferfish and other marine life",
          "My husband and I visited Palma Aquarium yesterday as it was raining and we wanted something to do indoors. Unfortunately, everyone else had the same idea and it was absolutely heaving. There were so many visitors inside that it was hard to see the tanks as there were constant",
          "Had a lovely Day. There are some lovely tanks with fish in and some very large tanks. Best bit was feeding the Fish outside in the pond. Would recommend a visit.",
          "No control over numbers, way too many people allowed in at once. Ruined experience. Even though we pre booked and paid were told we would have to wait 4 and a half hours to do the Whale 3D. If it\u2019s raining and you value personal space don\u2019t bother.",
          "This is a great aquarium. It is small compared to other i have been to, but well worth a visit as so much to see and do. The 2 experiences are good too. The shark tank and the 3d experience. On the 3d experience just wished it was longer. The staff were very friendly and",
          "Absolutely 100% recommended a visit to the Palma aquarium. We spent 3 hours in the place but you could spend longer, they have a brilliant indoor soft play but remember to bring socks or you can buy them there for only \u20ac1. Definitely get the ticket that gets you in to see the",
          "It lovely place to visit values for money staff very helpful .people should visit l go back me and partner love it",
          "Me and my partner enjoying so much it a lovely place to enjoy walk around it so good .it worth the money l advice people to go and visit staff are very good",
          "I have been to many aquariums around the world, and Palma aquarium is one of the best I have seen. It has big, beautiful fish tanks with a great variety of marine life, and the huge shark tank is spectacular. Play areas for children are great, there\u2019s both an indoor soft play",
          "This was our first visit to Palma Aquarium and I thought it will be more or less the same as other aquariums we visited in a lifetime, but I was so wrong.(buy tickets online you will save few \u20ac) When we came in staff was making family pictures in front of aquarium like stands",
          "I have been visiting the aquarium today, found it a beautiful place and hostile. really liked the shark's section. I prefer to look at marine animals at their natural environment, but this is really beautiful place.",
          "This is such a interesting place, the big tanks are at the end of the tour. There's even the opportunity to do a shark boat ride which I enjoyed. A good bit of garden land to walk with great sights. Food is available it is quite nice. I recommend this trip.",
          "Overall, everything was great! Enjoyed it. However, I didn't expect to pay more entrance fees once I got in. But apart from that, would recommend!",
          "This place is fantastic one of the best aquariums I've ever seen lots of big sharks wow ,the grounds are very pleasant to walk around well worth a visit ,the only thing that let's this place down is both that standard of the food and the way it is set for self service not a",
          "This is such a big place, much bigger than the sealife centres in the UK. All the big tanks are at the end of the tour. There's even the opportunity to do a shark boat ride (extra Euros but not expensive) maybe 7 euros each. Unfortunately we didn't get round to doing it as my 20",
          "Our two young children really enjoyed it here I have to say it was really worth the money. They even got free facepaiting and little treasure coin. Really nice day out and they even sat and watched the dome about the whale and enjoyed it. Gutted we didn't get in the little boat",
          "Visited Palma Aquarium with a 2yr old, what a fantastic day! They have so many species of fish and wildlife. Everything has been thought of, there are steps for the higher ranks and there are huge beanbags to sit and watch the more active tanks! The food here is expensive There",
          "A little overcrowded but not a bad way to kill an hour. The children will love it. Informative and fun but not a lot to entertain an adult.",
          "When traveling we always try to visit an aquarium. This is one of the largest and best looking we encountered. Keep in mind that there are several kinds of tickets. The cheapest one only gives entry to the aquarium for extras like a movie etc. one has to have an more expensive",
          "this was a really good day out enjoyed watching the sharks and rays being fed so much to see fantastic aquariums and the jungle rain forest is great as well",
          "The day trip was fasanting for my girls 11 and 15 to see exotic fish snorkeling with rays and watching 3d whale show and the pirates. They had a ball",
          "With over 150 tanks with varying marine life and an opportunity to swim with whales (no clues given!) this is a great day out for all the family. However as I am disabled and was in a wheelchair there's a couple of things worth mentioning for others in a similar situation. This",
          "We have visited this place with 3y old kid, he was quite amazed, but more than fish he liked a playground. It was nice, but from the map it looked actually richer than it was. We went through pretty quickly. Comparing to Aquarium for example in Budapest, I think it is not worth",
          "After being to different Aquariums/Parks all over the world decided to go there to see the wales... they show 12 min film in 3D... and when you ask why it is like this the answer was it took 5 years to film that film.. absolutely not worth it. The price is almost 50euro for",
          "We\u2019ve visited this aquarium during our summer holidays in Majorca. There\u2019s plenty varied fish to see, seahorses, rays, eels, turtles, Claun fish (Nemo and Dory) and even sharks.",
          "We went here and was a bit apprehensive as we was comparing it to Sea Life Centre but we was amazed! It was such a great place. Very informative. The Aqua Dome was out of this world! \ud83d\ude32 we all loved it. It was definitely an amazing experience. Love love love it \ud83d\ude0a",
          "The variety at the aquarium was good and well presented. We got a free bus from our hotel which was great, but we did run out of things to look at towards the end of the day whilst waiting for the bus. The presentations made by the aquarium staff were informative and",
          "Lots to see, spacious, extensive gift shop. A good activity to do whilst in Palma. Tanks looked clean and fish appeared healthy (although I am not an expert). Enjoyed the 3D humpback whale exhibition.",
          "I was mostly very happy with my trip to the aquarium. It lacked a little in information about what the species were, but otherwise it was a great day out for my cousins and I. My BIG bug bear is this....the staff wear t-shirts with \u201cWe Love Oceans\u201d on them...yet when we bought",
          "A good attraction for half a day with children. A lot to see and learn, also many games and activities for kids. Aqua Dome is definitely worth a visit and doesn't cost much. But generally the ticket price feels way too high. Moreover, all the activities advertised for tourists",
          "Absolute rip off! Paid to get in to then find out you have to pay extra to see more stuff other than a few fish!! Not much to see unless you pay even more for extra tickets! Food looked awful. We ended up leaving after half hour",
          "We had a lot of fun there it\u2019s was perfect day and the best part was being at the boat made of glass and see trough sharks it\u2019s definitely beautiful place to make amazing and fun memories! Place to go for sure!!",
          "Visted here with my husband and 13 month old daughter who absolutely loved seeing the fish in the tanks but from adult point of View was rather boring if you visited the deep in Hull. It wasnt to busy which was good as we able to get pram in most tanks. I found it a lot smaller",
          "I went to Palma\u2019s aquarium with my boyfriend, we spent there 2-3 hours and we loved it! The whole experience was amazing, the tour around the aquarium is very well organized, they have very good descriptions of animals, you can also sit in front of some aquariums and relax,",
          "We visited during a wet day in September which meant the whole of Majorca seemed to descend upon the aquarium! There were lots of impatient visitors pushing each other out of the way to view the sea life through many quite small viewing windows. Aside from this, the beautiful",
          "Fantastic aquarium lots to see and the gardens were also lovely we really enjoyed our visit our three girls would defo want to return",
          "Totally breath taking, plenty of things for children of all ages to see. It seems quite expensive for the entry fee but once inside its well worth it",
          "We visited on a wet afternoon in May, it's easy to get to being well sign posted. There are a great variety of fish, and it seemed larger than the aquariums we have been to in the UK. We particularly liked the activities you can do on the day such as feeding the fish. You can",
          "Really not good for the price, nothing special to see, very small aquariums, expensive for the value, elwvator was not working for rhe troller... To avoid absolutely!!",
          "Was a rainy day so decided to go to the aquarium...which I think everyone else in Palma wanted to do \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f We first arrived around 12pm...got stuck in traffic on the turning just before it for 15mins then tried for a further 35mins to find parking and couldn\u2019t so we ended up",
          "The aquarium itself is good, with a range of themed areas. The exhibits seem to have spacious and stimulating environments. The humpback whale 3D screening is worth a visit. I would have given 5 stars except that the food was expensive, mediocre and busy (even out of season) -",
          "Great place for children and adults. Very interestings exhibitions, great environment, intresting animals",
          "To quote TinaTurner - Simply The Best! If you have a damp day in Palma don\u2019t waste it go to this place. Quite amazing. Deepest aquarium in Europe and such an interesting place and the shop at the end is huge and pretty good also. Thoroughly recommended",
          "Family had a great time but then we all love an aquarium. Some great exhibits with Sharks and rays being our favourite Food is reasonably priced for this type of venue too.",
          "Great place to see life from the sea! A little concerned that you can find out which restaurants serves the fish you can see in the local area!",
          "After paying almost 30 euros per adult person we were waiting to experience a magnificent spectacle. However, the place didn't meet our expectations. It was crowded, difficult to locate where is what and without anything worth mentioning. To add to the above that the kids'",
          "The aquarium is quite big for an island as small as Mallorca. There is also an outdoor aquarium where kids can swim with stingrays.",
          "It's nice, with some very nice zone( sharks) but the rest is average ...is crowded, a lot of kids, a little too much noise, annoying especially when the staff explains about different species in the aquarium. Overall, if you have nothing else to do, if you have children, it is a",
          "Aquarium was nice. On the day we went it was super crowded and hot. We could hardly see any if the tanks because of the amount of poeple at every one. If you plan on doing the whale exibit ask about the next available time. We were unaware it was time scheduled when we",
          "Went here with my 2 years old son, he loved going around watching all the tanks. He also saw the 3d whale show and loved it. It's probably best with kids from 3 years and older. It's very crowded so it takes a while to go through the whole park. The food was OK as well.",
          "We spent 5 hours here so it was worth the entrance price. We bought the combo ticket which got you entrance and the 3d whale film. It was an incredibly relaxing environment with, lovely and clean. If you had kids there was plenty for them to do and free face painting. The",
          "The aquarium in itself is quite interesting. Many many different animals. I would strongly advise to buy the tickets online through the website. They are much much cheaper over there. You can find tickets for couples which are way too cheaper than buying the individual tickets",
          "second time here. very nice place. you can visit whatever the weather is. very friendly staff. many activities. a lot of fun.",
          "Enjoyed wandering through through the aquarium and taking time to read everything and enjoy the exhibits.",
          "What a lovely aquarium! If you book online and download tickets to a device you get them cheaper than buying in the door. 6 tickets we had a discount of around \u00a336! Can honestly say it\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve visited for a long time! The whole family enjoyed it, so many tanks",
          "We decided to visit on a day where the weather was rainy and cloudy and ensured we didn\u2019t waste our day sitting in our hotel. We found the aquarium enjoyable, but slightly small and a bit dated. However the shark tank was the highlight of our visit, a huge tank featuring 11",
          "We came here and were not expecting much, but there\u2019s is lots to do, there is a soft play area and outside a big park with bouncy castles. My 3 had a lovely day and we spent a good 4 hours here so worth the money. Would come back definitely",
          "Me and my partner came here on our last full day and thoroughly enjoyed it. There was lots to see and do. Despite the fact it was busy there was never very many crowds and you could easily see everything. The aqua dome was well worth the money and absolutely beautiful. This is",
          "If I was going to visit Palma for any reason and I was at a loose end then I would certainly come here again. If you like fish then this is your place to go, although the fish themselves I found to be very unfriendly.",
          "The aquarium itself is really good. With interesting information and beautiful tanks. That said went we got to actually eat something, 2 chicken nuggets and 2 cans of pop came to \u20ac30. Finding the right bus back was also a faff.",
          "We used this as a place to go on a wet afternoon as did many others! Be aware that some of what you see on the map is outdoors. It was extremely busy so a little unfair to judge on our visit, staff did well on a very busy afternoon. Worth paying a few euros more for the whale",
          "Good aquarium with a tropical forest walk way, great day out for families and friends.Parking near by easy access.",
          "The aquarium was a 5 minute walk from our hotel THB El Cid. Entrance and 3d whale movie was around \u20ac28. The aquarium was really nice and clean. The main tank was massive there was a diver in there cleaning the windows which was a fab photo opportunity. We were there for around",
          "Save money and skip the queues by booking online. Nice set up. Can get crowded and there are signs saying watch out for pickpockets. Suggest going early or again after two (online cheap tickets for post 14h00). Could do more of the aquadome. Too short an insight in my opinion.",
          "This was a last minute decision and glad we did it. The whale dome was disappointing, expected more for the money. You probably only need a couple of hours, it\u2019s definitely not an all day thing!",
          "After some research we arrived later in the day, approx 4pm. It was much quieter and were able to view all exhibits without any crowds. The only downside was the lack of available snacks as all stalls/cafes were closing, despite having several hours left! Would recommend the",
          "We were in the Aquarium in December, which was probably better then during summer season. My little daughter loved it and this year we will go again. The best is the big Aquarium with sharks where we stayed long time.",
          "Great experience. If you want to have quality time in aquarium, it would take at least 4 hours. We were just little disappointed with jellyfish section, they have only 2 varietis of them in whole aquarium",
          "I haven\u2019t been to any other aquarium, so I liked this one. There are quite a lot children attractions but we were without children so I speak from the point of view of adults. Best prices we found in the website of the aquarium. We bought afternoon tickets with entrance after",
          "We have visited twice in a month now as we couldn't wait to go back. Family and friends with younger and teens. The variety of sea life is brilliant and the staff caring and informed. All the tanks are wonderfully maintained and the staff are very knowledgeable and clearly",
          "Went with our teenage daugter on a TUI trip. We took the upgrade that included the entrance to the 3D cinema show and the glass bottomed shark boat. It also included 8euro each for food - which was needed as the food is very expensive and not that special to be fair.",
          "Not just an aquarium but the aquatic rescue centre of the Baldric Islands. Amazing place and huge. You can spend a full day here. There is a reasonably priced restaurant and children's play area too.",
          "Amazing day out but it costs 25.50 euro to get in for each adult but for a one off experience worth every cent. They have over 8000 specimens in here and the displays are brilliant the shark tank is the deepest in Europe and can be viewed on 3 levels. when we were there they fed",
          "As the title says, this was our third visit to the Aquarium, we\u2019ve loved it every time. Kids (10 and 13) did the snorkelling with stingray for an extra 10 euros each, which they did enjoy, although I found it was quite rushed and the two staff members on there didn\u2019t really",
          "Aquarium is good and offers a lot of activities as feeding sharks. We were a little bit dissaponted with 3D movie with whales. It lasted about 10 min and was not too educational, maybe good for kids.",
          "We had a great day out at the aquarium. It\u2019s modern, clean and the staff are all really friendly and helpful. There are lots of different zones to keep everyone interested, including a soft play (take socks for little ones to play or it will cost you a \u20ac1 to buy some). The shark",
          "The Aquarium is beautiful.. but me and my partner got a bit frustrated with a guide named Carla, she clearly was NOT very well educated on marine life (we are experienced divers and ocean lovers) and seemed more interested in flirting with ALL the male divers than paying",
          "We arrived at 9:30am and had already bought tickets online. This turned out to be a great move as by 9:35am we were in having skipped the line for tickets. Lots to see and do throughout and engaging for all ages. The large deep blue tank was fascinating although part of me does",
          "We went there with our two little ones (2,5 years old and 1 year old) and we all enjoyed it very much. Tickets are a little on the pricy side but worth every penny. There were many different areas with a huge variety of species. Easily accessible for strollers and everything",
          "We've spend there entire day and my kids was amazed and wish to stay longer. Pretty good organized place with lots of events and things to do. Aquadome 3D video was pretty short but it was amazing (worth to use back rows, as everything will happen above you), kids were trying",
          "Really enjoyed walking through this aquarium! The aquarium walks you through the different sea animals around the world. There was plenty to see and plenty to do. You can snorkel with sting rays and jump on a boat to get closer to sharks. The moving walk way through the stark",
          "We enjoyed this but it\u2019s not something that will Full your entire day. Easy to navigate to And a nice facility.",
          "Amazing last day spent in Mallorca it was fabulous Would go back tomorrow even though it was extra money to pay for things in there such as the shark boat but it was worth every penny",
          "Worth a visit the fish are incredible and beautifully looked after. There is even sharks. You are actually better of buying tickets from tourist info in Palma as it works out cheaper",
          "Bought tickets for me, my wife and 12 year old kid online. Went at 09.30 in high season. Not crowded at all at this time. Meditiranian section had best info for each tank, nice touch panels where you could read more about all fishes and corals in the tanks. The rest was more",
          "We had a great time and the aqua dome was absolutely AMAZING!! Only problem was the tickets we bought from our hotel meant we were unable to change the time of our viewing for the dome. We arrived at around 11am and had finished the full aquarium by 12.30 meaning we had a 3",
          "Visited the aquarium whilst staying in Arenel. It\u2019s an easy bus ride away. Although quite expensive, I felt the aquarium was good value because we were there for hours. The place is modern, clean and very well kept. They have a huge variety of species here, all well presented.",
          "I went to the Aquarium with my 16 year old daughter and we both loved it! There was a huge variety of sea life to see, staff were helpful and knowledgeable and the shark vision boat was fun! Highly recommended.",
          "This place is an absolute must if you are in the area. Worlds apart from any aquarium I have visited elsewhere. It is large spacious and cool. There are interactive sections and such a wide variety of fish and animals to see. 2 restaurants both looked fab. The whale show",
          "We love this place. We have been many times and each time doesn\u2019t disappoint we love the shark tanks but there is so much to do and especially if you want to get out of the heat for a few hours.",
          "Me and my girlfriend visited this Aquarium on our vacation in Mallorca. We spent almost 3 hours there, which I consider as very well spended! Also, you can buy a ticket for 3D cinema, where a film about whales is projected and it was really amazing.",

          "After having visited the USA numerous times, holidaying in Majorca is a bit like comparing Waitrose to Morrison's in terms of attractions but that's what we opted for this year and upon returning we stand by our choice. The only stand out attraction was the aquarium in Palma. We",

          "Visited here around lunchtime today. It was very busy at the start and there was a bit of waiting to see the first few tanks but after a while the crowd thinned out. Went to see the 3D whale show in the aqua dome at the end of the visit which was by far the best part of the",
          "This was my second visit to this aquarium. It\u2019s a very nice trip to do with small children, you have lots of different sea animals. Overall the visit was good, you have tons of information boards to explain about the different animals. The thing that really bothered me was the",
          "If you like aquariums and big sharks this is the place for you. The shark tank is phenomenal but quite scary for little ones. My daughter went swimming with stingrays for \u20ac10 and absolutely loved it. Highly recommend",

          "A really lovely aquarium. Lots to see. Loved that there were bean bags around the place to just sit and watch. Good talks. The turtle was amazing to see. We also did the aquadome experience which was excellent.",
          "No air con inside. Was very u comfortable as we visited on a very warm day. Poor selection of food in the cafe and what was there was rather expensive. Very good selection of sealife to see. Well set out, didnt feel like we missed anything. Plenty of things for my daughter",
          "We've been to countless public aquariums around the world and all of them have something to offer which makes for an enjoyable experience. But, in all honesty we've never been so confused than our recent visit to the Palma Aquarium in Mallorca. It starts with the confusing",
          "We recently visited the aquarium on a full day visit. It was extremely busy in the morning as I think a lot of the coaches arrive at the same time but you were still able to see all the tanks and the crowds thinned out the further we got round. A fantastic selection of things to",
          "There was lots to see here, we enjoyed the variety of fishes and other animals. It may be a bit expensive for large families and groups but it can be a good day out. We really enjoyed the 3D aqua dome which was a 3D short film about whales, it was so realistic and definitely",
          "As usual a good visit while holidaying in majorca, bought extra tickets for the new whales exhibit at \u00a312 each, only to watch a very non imformative 3d film that lasted about 12 minutes . Next time I'll watch an episode from David Attenborough and save my cash",

          "Visited aquarium with 3 adults and children 8 and 10 years. The sharks was very exciting for the kids. 3D movie of hunchback whales was a new experience since last visit and was fantastic and worth seeing, even it was qute short.",
          "From huge shark tanks to neon coloured corals, this is a \"must\" when visiting Palma. The huge varieties of fish is breathtaking, and seems to never end when you are walking through the different exhibits. It is truly a magical world beneath the water. My personal favourite was",
          "Our family had a great time here, where, they were a little too young to understand the information, but the exhibits and tanks kept their attention. The new whale exhibit looked very impressive too. The kids loved the outdoor play area!",

          "Palma aquarium is a great place for a day out with the family where you can see the beauty of the underwater world. It is really great and worth a visit. It has a playground and different attractions for little kids, so they won't be bored. There are different \"sections\" and one",
          "One of the best aquariums I\u2019ve ever visited. Big with lots to see, a beautiful outdoor area and many opportunities available at extra cost to snorkel with rays, go on the shark boat etc. Lovely outside area to have lunch and explore, definitely worth spending a morning here!",
          "There are two prices, one for locals (25,50\u20ac) and one for tourists (28,50\u20ac). For two tourist, you can expect price 57,00\u20ac. But, if you like fishes and you are curious, than I recommend it absolutely! We loved it.",
          "Palmas aquarium is located in the always cozy Can Pastilla and is worth a visit if you're in the area. It is a nice and big aquarium with lots of things to see and activities for kids. They even have an outdoor area with stingrays. There is also a restaurant and various shows",
          "Visited as part of a TUI excursion for the day bought the plus ticket. Fantastic day out really loved it the shark vision boat 3D cinema amazing. Highly recommend a visit great for kids. Staff were exceptional and the food great. Go If you get the opportunity.",

          "Really like it. Went with my cousin who lives here and she absolutely love it (her first time) there. It wasn't so crowded, so we took our time to admire all ocean life and took many picture. Very educational and fun.",
          "The aquarium is good for kids but there is not much to do there. Considering the price of the ticket I expected more tanks and activities. We paid for the whale aqua dome which is a virtual experience - this was good and the shark bottom boat. Doubt I would return again.",
          "Worth of price 28\u20ac (3D movie included). Amazing indoor tanks. Recommend to see to 3D movie about whales.",
          "This is our second time to the aquarium! So much species to look at. So relaxing to watch them swim over your head. Interaction sections are great. Love the jungle!!",

          "Spent a few hours hear as a family of 4, children 6 and 9. The main reason we went was my son 6 has an obsession with sharks. Cost around \u00a390 sterling with entry into the shark vision boat. Cost a bit expensive. 3 hours max to view everything.",
          "They were nice and very friendly. You could pet and feed some of the fish. I recommend you to go here with the family! Alot of fun 10/10",
          "Yes it's cheesy. Yes it's just like the Peak District caverns scaled-up. But the children loved the rock formations and they loved the little concert & boat ride at the end.",
          "When travelling with kids there is a checklist to fulfill. An aquarium is among the points. We have been to Genoa aquarium last yr and Monaco's the year before. Maybe palma's aquarium is not the best but it is remarkable indeed for many points: not as crowded, the flow is easy,",
          "The largest aquarium in Europe was a great day out. Very interesting exhibits. Highly recommend. But the restaurant near the exit should be avoided. The food was ok and prices very reasonable but the staff were totally indifferent to our presence. They were too busy chatting",
          "During our holiday to Alcudia we had some bad weather so chose to take our 6.month old to the aquarium and I am so glad we did. It was a fantastic day out. You could spend the whole day there. It has inside and outside activities and also different areas. Our 6 month old loves",
          "We've been visiting Palma Aquarium for three times with children of age 1,5 to 8 years old. Every time there was something interesting for both kids and adults. The premises are large but good enough for small kids not to get bored, tropical garden is beautiful. Playground",
          "Visited with the extra ticket for the shark boat. I recommend this. It's a small raft that goes over the shark tank. DONT put your hands in the water. Not just the sharks but there are seabass in there who nibble fingers too. There are lots to see and lots for kids to do. It has",
          "We decided to go to the aquarium as my son wanted to do something other than pool and sun. We were not disappointed. The staff were friendly and walking around was easy. We have been to many aquariums but they are all so different. We saw different types of fish and underwater",
          "Cost 57 euros to go in with entrance also for the whale film. This is a truly amazing place to visit if you like to see ocean life close up. Give yourself at least 3 hours. Paying the extra for the film I thought was going to be a waste but it was worth it in my view. 3D and you",
          "Definitely worth a visit lots to see and do... there is a parking area as well for the kids to play... the food here is very expensive though that's the only downfall",
          "Lots of different species to delight us, my 9 year old son loved being able to touch a star fish and a sea cucumber :) The staff were very friendly. We enjoyed the whale experience, the 3D movie was lovely, wouldn't mind if it was longer. We were surprised with the size of the",
          "Spent a great few hours here, our 2 year old enjoyed everything about it but especially the outdoor play areas. If we\u2019d have visited as a couple we\u2019d probably have been out in under 2 hours but with kids you could easily spend all day. Excellent indoor and outdoor play. Loved",
          "We really liked it here great day for the family on a not so hot day outside plenty to see the whales experience was great all tanks Cristal clear and big sharks",
          "It was a nice experience. It was a pitty that some parts were closed and we couldn't see them all. We also booked the whale movie for extra 5 euro, but in our opinion it was to short. The entrance fee is very high but its a nice experience though.",
          "We went to the Palma Aquarium and found it absolutely fascinating. There were lots of different fish tanks with all sizes of fishes swimming around inside. It was good near some of the large tank viewing areas as there were cushions on the floor for the children to sit and",
          "We spent 5 hours here which sounds like a bit of a challenge but it was a great facility really well run. Great kids play areas one indoor and one outdoor so you can deal with the weather. Some operators also provide free transport from the main resort towns with pick up at or",
          "I really enjoyed this aquarium. There was something for everyone, plenty to see and do. We enjoyed watching the sharks get hand fed by the diver. Loved how up close and personal it felt beside the big tank. My favourite part was relaxing in a giant bean bag in front of the large",
          "Torturous place where I witnessed staff beating the Dolphins. Please do not support this cruel place it\u2019s not entertainment. Take a boat from the port of Soller to witness Dolphins free in their natural habitat.",
          "We booked with tui in our hotel and used the free bus. Good for the price we paid but the place is small and busy. Confusing layout. We walked around a few times and only found the access to the sharks and indoor play area hidden down by the toilets just before we where due to",
          "We went on a Jet 2 excursion and had a good time. You can comfortably do everything in 3 hours though - our trip was 7 hours but we were able to pay an extra five Euro to go into Palma for the afternoon. The aquarium is very good, even for adults. The 3d Whale movie is much",
          "I enjoyed this excursion, though felt that booking it through TUI wasn't the best option. It is a bit short and you will struggle to kill time. However, there are some good points about this place. Despite only being 10 minutes long, the 3D show is worth watching for the",
          "It was ok, but it felt that a few things were closed due to low season. Couldn\u2019t see the turtles . A nice movie of whales but it might be more for grownups then for kids. I would suggest having a couple of choices for kids. It also felt out of date.",
          "Well, we arrive on our holidays and it was raining \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f so we thought we go on a trip to see the fish's through tui holidays. I haven't been to many aquarium and I loved it with my family. Did the shark boat that was amazing. One thing that kept me from giving one star and that",
          "My partner and I visited the aquarium earlier today and can honestly say we were very impressed with all it had to offer. We found it to be both fun and educational making it one of the best we have visited to date. The immersive whale experience is an absolute must for an extra",
          "A little pricy at 28 Euro per head but beatiful fish and mammals. The Whale even another few Euro was disspointing ..more excitement in rhe Star Trek Journey home film dont bother not educational and you cant see much in 3d. Meaks in selfnservice cafe were great. Parking cheap",
          "Went here with the family, they had very nice tanks with different species of fish. Multiple sharks aswell. There was a 3d experience with a whale (wich you pay extra for) in my opinion it's not worth the price, but i imagine the money goes toward keeping the wales alive and",
          "Having been a frequent visitor to Mallorca for a number of years, I have been aware of the aquarium but have never visited until last week. I have 2 young children, one aged 3 and one aged 1 and I must say it is perfect for them. There is plenty of space inside and outside for",
          "Very beautiful place with lots of outdoors and big spaces -:). Lots of different sea animal and big sharks. The food in the cafeteria very good and the fast track a mil! We will repeat it again -:)",
          "Never seen a shark before but this Aquarium gave me the opportunity to see how they really look . The Palma Aquarium is Massive with a lot of different species of fishes. I recommend this aquarium it's worth it for this price.",
          "Poor exhibits with no information on what you\u2019re looking at and the price is ridiculous for what you actually get, getting forced into a photo to at the end find out you\u2019d get charged \u20ac10 per photo at the end is poor at best. Waste of time and a trap for tourists",
          "Went for the day with my wife and had a fantastic day. Paid the extra for the new whale experience which I would recommend to all visitors. Took approx 4 hrs to see everything but well worth the money.Great day with some great memories and will be going again when in Palma area",
          "We've done many a European Aquarium. Palma isnt bad but not up to the reviews if you know your fish and corals to a basic extent. Probably 33% of the touch screens don't work. 50% are just a \" guide\" to the tanks but not close to comprehensive to the inhabitants . If you",
          "We went here on the last day of our holiday only because it was close to the airport and we needed to kill several hours. As it turned out the acquarium is incredible - probably the best we have ever been to. Tremendous variety of displays. Kids loved it. We got the combo ticket",
          "We went to palma aquarium on a rainy day to entertain our 3 & 6 year old children. We purchased our family ticket online to skip the 30 min line outside. Inside it was so crowded you could barely pass by in the corridors. Needless to say it was almost imposdible to get a good",
          "Went on Easter Monday (had been awful weather for two days with rain forecast) so guess this was a popular attraction. Arrived early but it was really packed. Managed to wait and get to see the fish (usually 2 to 4 rows deep with people). Far too dark in the corridors",
          "We went today. We arrived early and pre-booked our tickets online. We parked in the multi-storey underground car park which was nearly empty when we arrived. Entrance went smoothly with one other family in front of us. We walked into the darkened viewing area and it was packed",
          "Brilliant day out a little bit pricey and was fooled by their advertising thinking they had a whale in the aqua dome, turns out it was a 3d video experience. Worth a trip out if its not sunny",
          "Stressful visit- far too packed. We bought online with a free bus to ferry us there. Queued for 30 minutes, got to the front to be told \u201cFull, you have to come back tomorrow!\u201d. Protested and after 20 more minutes got in. When they know how many online had already been sold, why",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to Palma Aquarium. The layout is great and the interactive information displays at each tank are great. The tanks are fantastic and perfect for everyone to view the fish, lots have bean bags and places for you to sit and enjoy viewing. The \u2018Big Blue\u2019",
          "A beautiful must do Aquarium with or without kids. Beautiful collection of all kinds of fishes. In case you would be standimg in a long queue for the tickets, buy online and move to fast lane. Easy going and efficient. One negative note: restaurant Neptuno. Do NOT go there!!",
          "Quite a big aquarium, which interested the kids from start to finish. Feels spacious and there are some nicely presented areas. Perfect for bad weather day. Maybe the new whale 3D dome show could be a bit sharper image-wise, but part from that small niggle would recommend it.",
          "The show with seals and dolphins was entertaining, there was other features to view like parrots, fish and penguins. Once you are in its a captive audience for food and drink but you can go outside and re enter the site again. It might be worth searching locally for cafes and",
          "Great day out on a Breezy day in Palma, plenty to enjoy for all ages. Will absolutely recommend this as a great day out",
          "Had a lovely visit to the aquarium today. It\u2019s well organised and both adult and kid friendly. Lots to see and do and a playground, outdoor area and restaurant in the middle of the tour. Quick tip - buy tickets online so you don\u2019t have to queue! We bought our tickets online",
          "Smaller than we envisaged. Lots of small aquariums a few large ones. One big aquarium with a few sharks about 2.5/meters long. Far too many people inside. We couldn\u2019t move. 12-14 deep at the aquariums, we saw hardly anything. Caferterias are mediocre, overpriced and mediocre.",
          "Admittedly we turned up on a grey day during a Bank Holiday, but a complete waste of time and money. Exhibits were poor, the place was overcrowded (could not even see the exhibits) and was in desperate need of ventilation. Will not go back. Daughter suggested we would have",
          "We came here during a rainy Easter Day. The lines were quite long to get tickets and the aquarium quite full, but definitely worth it. They have a lot of different species, some really big tanks and we visited the newly open whale dome. The 3D Movie was very well done and we",
          "People are very rude, aquarium is quite small. They didnt let kids into soft play area and told them to wait 30min. Waste of time and money",
          "I guess if your into aquariums. it's not bad I thought it would be bigger. Lots of types of sea life. I thought the one on Lisbon was better but that's just my opinion. Lots of kids there. Fairly busy for a Friday lunch. 26.50\u20ac a adult person. Best way to kill some time. 20\u20ac",
          "This wasn\u2019t far from our hotel so decided to go one morning. Surprised at how well done it all was. Great viewing areas with cushions and it all looked clean and very well looked after as did the animals. Loved the sharks and spent ages just watching them. Good place to go and",
          "Lots to do. We were there all day however I would maybe recommend just a half day! Extreemly clean. Great staff who are friendly and helpful. A few extras to pay for, like the boat above the sharks. Loved the cusions to sit on whilst watching the sea animals. Get to",
          "we have visited before and this time was a little dissapointing .the outside areas needed a good clean some of the fish ponds were black with mould if it was in this country i would have complained there was no oxegen in the water for the fish and also inside the aquarium there",
          "We had a good morning out here was a shame that a lot of the thing's was not open but time of year I guess,so u couldnt really spend the day here as it only took us 3 hours to walk round,in summer I bet it really busy was it worth the money not really x",
          "We visited the caves of drac whilst on holiday and it is honestly amazing. The natural beauty and the fact it is so well kept and unspoilt made it feel more exceptional. The lake at the bottom Of the cave offers a natural wonder and the music played by the orchestra was",
          "What an amazing experience, we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a very relaxing experience, there were places to sit and watch the fish which we found very good. The glass bottomed boat was very good and we watched the sharks swimming around. Would 100% recommend",
          "My little boy, aged 4, is going through a fish phase, and this place did not disappoint!! It really is world class. Great aquarium with both inside and outside areas. Huge tanks and loads of sharks. Lots of other smaller tanks too, really educational. We spent over 3 hours",
          "This unique attraction holds something for all ages and enjoyed on many levels. My young children especially love the bright colours and being so close to the sharks. There are steps to enable them to easily look into all the tanks, and magnifying glasses for older children to",
          "Our group consisted of a young couple with a 14 month old baby in a pushchair and two grandparents. It was a sunny day in April. This attraction is open 7 days a week. We arrived early (10.30am) and left at 3.30pm (to go to the airport- homebound). There was plenty to see and",
          "Loads to see & experience, and at a very affordable price too. Split in to various areas & depicting specific environments the exhibits were carefully & thoughtfully organised. The flow of visitors is a little slow, with kids buggies the main culprit, but for the rest of us it",
          "A very good break during inclement weather. Our 5 & 2 yrs old kids were amazed by the extent of the species displayed at the Aquarium. My wife and I were as well. We did not take a food break while there, so I cannot speak to the quality, but the pricing did not appear to be",
          "Visited here early April so it was quiet but still relatively busy. We were lucky enough to visit on the day that they were feeding the sharks which was interesting and we felt we got our money\u2019s worth. There is a cafe/restaurant where you can stop for a quick spot of lunch",
          "But if you have to travel too many time to get here not so great. It was very little few people when we went and it was good because no big crowd. if you have children it is better for them to see.",
          "visited here the first week of March. was pretty quiet no queues to get in and could easily get around all the attractions inside the aquarium. the aquarium is divided into zones inside and they give you a map to help you get around but there are also many direction arrows",
          "Been here twice now. What a fabulous place. We sat in awe looking at the big shark tank. What fantastic creatures. They brought a lump to my throat. All the fish were fabulous too. Highly recommended.",
          "This aquarium made for a great afternoon trip. Booking in advance through click-mallorca we paid \u00a346 (\u20ac51) for two adults tickets and free return coach travel to our hotel. Excellent value for money with lots of different areas to explore. A nice and clean Aquarium, with",
          "Really enjoyed the day, lots to see, good price, lots to do, animals looked in good condition, loved How big the tanks were, and great for kids lots of seating, cushions and chairs. No ice creams, which was a shame, restaurant was a little pricey for not a lot of choice, and",
          "Very bad odour that has ruined the experience issue of a feciecs smell all through out the main enclosures very disgusting after paying so much to visit Patricia duty manager very rude accused us of lieing NOT professional!",
          "Absolutely stunning. The glass bottom shark vision boat is brilliant. If you book in advance you get a reduced rate and the ticket is valid for 90 days",
          "Lots to see, easy to navigate around. Worth the visit, there\u2019s plenty of stuff to see. Tickets sounded a bit pricey, but after we arrived it is most definitely not overpriced. Shark tank was quite amazing.",
          "Must visit.Was there in February with my family.Husband and my 5 year old and my 13 years old.We all loved it",
          "We came in the off-season and half the place was closed or obviously under reservation. Obviously could be an amazing visit with a little effort",
          "The best bit was the start that it had relaxing music and looking at the fish and water tanks made a good therapy new trance to begin the route. Then the fish in the tanks and water was very well observed and made in a suitable environment but some little tanks looked like not",
          "Veryyyyyyyyyy big aquarium . We could easily spend two hours or more in there . There was so much to see. The aquarium provided different ways of seeing the fishes and other water species. For example cushions to sit down , open tanks, bean bags ...etc It was lovely that when",
          "Must visit. Fantastic aquarium My girlfriend and I loved it. They have a great range of different fish!",
          "A great place to spend time in Palma. A lot of fish, aquarium. Our Family liked very much, we will come back next time again.",
          "Had a fantastic time, spent most of the day there, so much to see and watch. Lovely wee gift shop. A very enjoyable day out.",
          "We were travelling with 2 adults + 2 kids. Since it was off-season, there weren't that many other tourists than us. And of course that's a plus since you can see everything properly and actually take your time! In the beginning there were info boards with plenty of information",
          "Great for families and rainy days! It is an aquarium as imagine but it's always good to get to know the world especially under water. If there is a rainy day on your holiday, definetly do that!",
          "My 9 and 11 year old boys loved the Palma Aquarium! They especially liked the shark vision boat. Now they want me to buy the year pass.",
          "Now don\u2019t get me wrong you get what you pay for most of the time. We just left here feeling a little underwhelmed and like we wished we had seen more. (This is even though we did the glass bottom boat ride with the sharks below in the shark tank - which the host was very good",
          "Went to the aquarium for a day trip. As ever, loved looking at all the different species of fish. Was mesmerised by the Shark tank, stood there for ages, just watching all the fish & sharks swimming around the tank. This definitely gets the thumbs up from me, would recommend a",
          "Enjoyed the aquarium. Spent three hours there. Feedings begin at 1 pm and last until 2:30 pm. Shark feeding was busy, but other feedings not attended in high numbers. My husband and I were the only people at the eel feeding. Good for a rainy afternoon. Do check the hours,",
          "Lovely aquarium had a great visit and saw massive sharks the biggest we have seen really enjoyed the visit. A shame the turtles wasn't available to see due to it being too cold for them outside would definately recommend. My husband bought us over the Christmas period while",
          "We took our 6 and 9 year old Spanish/English speaking grandchildren to the aquarium on a quiet Sunday in January.....the children were especially looking forward to seeing the sharks. Although the section where the sharks were housed was quite large there were only two varieties",
          "The aquarium is very well laid out into zones which lead you around the various tanks. The highlight of the visit is the shark tank which is massive and has a fair number of adult size sharks - absolutely fascinating to see them close up. We had a (nearly) five year old and a",
          "We had such a fantastic time here and spent 4 hours, at the aquarium. There was hardly any people and the viewing cushions near the big water windows allowed you to appreciate the marine creatures. The shark feeding and tank cleaning performed by the divers was also good to",
          "Great aquarium with very informative and good layout. Nice outdoor setings as well. Located at Can Pastilla, some twenty minutes drive from Palma. Not excatly cheap entrance, but it's worth it.",
          "It was nice to spend a couplf o hours ehre at the Aquarium with the kids in opur party- the Aquarium has a good selection of marine life. Its center piece is a huge (one of the largest in Europe) tank in the center of the building which is amazing. they put down soft bean bag",
          "This is a good aquarium, which is well laid out. Information on the displays is in lots of languages. There is a large shark tank with lots of fascinating smaller tanks on the way, displayed by region. There is an outside space with a play area for smaller kids, lots of toilets,",
          "For someone like me, a living animal mostly live on the ground, the aquarium does provide a lot of windows for us human beings to observe those adorable beings live in the ocean. The price of the ticket is acceptable. Since the fishes seem to be all fine. I am grateful to those",
          "Would recommend a visit, a lot to see. We took the bus transfer which meant waiting a lot at the end, as we went as a couple we went around all the displays once and had a lot of time sitting about.",
          "Visited in December. The aquarium is divided into a number of displays: Indoor tanks, Jungle, Mediterranean garden and Shark tank. The indoor tanks contain a wide variety of sea creatures and were very good. The gardens and jungle were fairly poor and contained little to see.",
          "I visit the aquarium off season, really amazing. we where most of the time alone. So we had all the time of the world the sit somewhere and watch the fish. Like the combo of in and outside. Great place for family.",
          "We would definitely recommend this centre if you\u2019re in town. Looking at it from the outside, I felt like it would be a small one but it surpassed our expectation. Just be prepared to take lots of lovely photos in the Amazon section if that\u2019s your thing.",
          "Our kids loved this place, lots of fish, plus playgrounds to take a break from the fish which was welcomed by a three year old and an ice skating rink for kids. The shark tunnel was also good. The only thing missing is more variety for mollusks and seahorses.",
          "It was lovely to enjoy the park and outside pools as well as the amazing aquarium. Our three year old loved the enormous shark tank. This is the best aquarium I have ever seen.",
          "Great for a rainy day with children. It is nice and clean and not too big. And a lot to see. Lovely place with great Fish.",
          "We went here to do an aquarium dive with the sharks, from a diving experience point of view the set up was impressive and the dive guides were very good and highly professional. a really enjoyable experience. If you enter the aquarium this way though I would recommend working",
          "Love this place. It\u2019s a great day out of you want to stay out of the November showers. But also great for a day out of the sun in the summer. 100% value for money. The shark boat was a hit for my husband and 3 year old son. Especially the different angles you get and the",
          "The aquarium has around 50 separate tanks including one massive tank housing some very large fish including sharks of 10 feet or more - why they don't gobble up the smaller occupants I have no idea. All the tanks are well lit , well labelled in different languages. and contain a",
          "A great family day out. Lots to keep the children amused (and adults). It was also not too crowded. Highly recommended.",
          "Very disappointing and expensive day trip. No water park and we did the aquarium in 30 minutes. 70 Euros not well spent.",
          "Its not huge, but the shark tank is amazing! Visiting in November meant no big crowds so able to meander at leisure, and childless for a change meant we really could take our time. Large cushions by the glass of the shark tanks meant a comfy perch to sit and watch and get great",
          "Can not waste this chance to say that this Aquarium went out from my expectations as I have been out in other aquariums and thought no other could exceed Ocean\u00e1rio in Lisbon, Portugal, which was awarded a couple of times as the best aquarium in the world. Have been lots of times",
          "We visited Palma Aquarium on our holidays to Mallorca in August 2018, and thought we'd take a day trip here. We managed to get some discounted tickets giving us a few euros off the entry. After arriving in the car par, we had some touts kind of offering to look after your car,",
          "We made an organised trip to the Aquarium, it looked great in the pamphlet but when we got there it was a lot smaller than we thought, yes there are lots of fish to see in small tanks plus a couple of larger ones but, it doesn't take long to go round and the food and drinks",
          "We've been to the Aquarium three times already on our annual holidays in Mallorca, and we continue to enjoy it. As our kids get older, they see and appreciate different things. The Aquarium is very well organized and has fantastic displays of various fish/turtles/rays etc.",
          "We are members of and always comparing to the zoo in Rotterdam , and we liked the Palma aquarium a lot. not much to see outside because of november visit? small but nice playground for little kids and freshly brewed coffee for the parents!",
          "This was one of our best days out, I booked the tickets online for \u20ac88 for me, my husband our 16, 14 & 8 year old. Our hotel printed out our ticket and we hired a car for 3 days so drove there. It has lots to see and do. Our favourite was the children swimming with the rays they",
          "If you are in Mallorca with kids, if you are big fan of Aquariums or if the day is rainy and you don't have a plan- that's the place to visit. Otherwise.... well, I am more fun of natural things so that wasn't something I would hype about.",
          "Very nice aquarium with beautiful displays in well kept aquariums. Lots of pretty corals, different fish, informative signs, nice staff. Clean, informative, a great overall experience especially with kids. Great play area too.",
          "My family enjoyed their visit to the aquarium. Grandson of three years was mesmerised by the sight of the variety of fish exhibited at the aquarium.",
          "Like any other aquarium it has a good variety of wildlife. Shark tank is impressive. Gets very busy around mid day. Queues quite long to get in but this is due to the obligatory photo on arrival. Take your own lunch as food was quite expensive and not much choice.",
          "We visited on a rainy day (2 adults and 2 young kids). Overall it was okay, but was way overpriced in my opinion, plus there was a feeling that more money was to be made from visitors by taking/selling photos and also the shop at the end. All said, the aquarium inside was pretty",
          "We (2 ad + 2 ch) visited on the last Monday in October with complimentary tickets and it was still quite busy. We went on public transport as the bus stop is directly outside, there is a car park as well but not many free spaces. Make sure you buy tickets in advance, as the",
          "Great morning out looking at the marine life in the aquarium. The tanks are all well lit so you can see clearly and the whole place is spotless. The shark tank is exceptional.",
          "We visited the aquarium today and loved it. There\u2019s lots of different zones which culminate in the deepest shark tank in Europe, housing reef and sand tiger sharks. There\u2019s a jungle zone, pacific zone etc. The interactive information boards are good. The shop is well stocked",
          "We visited on a bad weather day so maybe things are different at other times. Things did not start well. We booked direct with the aquarium and were told our free bus would pick us up from the hotel. No bus turned up and 30 minutes after pick up time our hotel rang and were",
          "I have avoided all marine attraction except for those in the wild recently but this is advertised as a \u201crescue centre\u201d so I thought I would give it a try. It is well presented, claims to have the largest Shark Tank in Europe and does have some impressive displays of marine",
          "what a great time to spend a day we cannot say in words of the beauty of this place its a must in majorca to visit",
          "Was quiet when we visited. Family ticket great value. Lots to see for 7 to 11 year olds who loved it. Food was good too lots of choice.",
          "I enjoyed seeing the tanks with fish, sharks & jelly fish. I thought it was over priced for what it was. i had a map but it was hard to follow & i am usually quite a good map reader. The restaurant & cafe get extremely busy & the choice of food is not great. Unusually there are",
          "Our grandson loved the aquarium and so did we. It is laid out really well. Our grandson found something to get excited about around every corner.",
          "We spent 4 1/2 hours here (including lunch) on a Monday in late October. It was comfortably busy but not packed. Our 5 year old had a great time. It's possible to buy tickets online in advance (we found a discounted family entry) which allows you to enter via a separate queue.",
          "we had a very interesting afternoon in the Aquarium. Most enjoyable and they gave us Senior rates. Well laid out and lots of fish",
          "This place is amazing. One of the largest tanks in Europe with sharks and rays swimming in and above you at certain points. The tanks are all large, the animals look very well cared for and the South American jungle set up is amazing. It is quite expensive but the place is set",
          "Having read some reviews I was surprised how quiet it was compared to similar places I've visited. The kids had a good time and enjoyed the marine life on show and the outside area was nice. It's not an all day thing; 3-4 hours including lunch is enough.",
          "It's small and expensive. You can see everything in 1.5 hour. They let in too many people at once and sometimes it's hard to breathe becouse of this. The entry fee should be around 10 euros, 15 top. 25 is a joke",
          "A really enjoyable day. Plenty to do for both alduts and children. Really enjoyed the boat ride above the sharks and all the staff was very informative during feeding times.",
          "We have visited some major aquariums around the world and this one is truly outstanding and great fun with kids. There are more than enough activities for them and they will not be bored. Get there early to avoid the crowds.",
          "A really good aquarium and well worth the visit. We got the No.23 bus from Arenal that stopped outside. Plenty to see and well laid out. The shark exhibit are of course the most popular and always crowds around making it quite difficult to get a good view. There is a restaurant,",
          "2 or 3 hours of great fun, lots to do and see!! The sharks are amazing it\u2019s brilliant all through the aquarium and the outside eating area and Koi carp pools are all brill !!",

          "The Aquariam was good but it was too noisy with children running around and screaming. Walking round was ok not you couldn\u2019t always get close due to the numbers of people there. Very little signage to help you navigate around. Food and drink offering poor and finished early.",
          "Really amusing place. Incredible atmosphere, definitely a must-see in Mallorca. There could be seen a large diversity of species and the shark aquarium is marvellous.",
          "Lovely place. Great place to spend 3 hrs but no more . Food was awful so bring something. The place is great but the restraint let it down big style",
          "Hood prices, great aquarium. A must sse in Mallorca. I've been there about 7 times and everytime I enjoyed it a lot. Not only for families",
          "Great place to visit with your children and very engaging. Very easy to spend a number of hours here with out the children getting board. Food offering could be improved as its limited.",
          "Decided to go to this aquarium instead of a shore excursion since my daughter loves sharks. They have a beautifully set up and clean location. The shark boat was an added bonus. Spent about 2-3 hours here. Great for kids.",
          "My wife, 3 year old daughter and I visited this place during our holiday and it was a very good aquarium. We have visited a couple of these things back in England and this one is far superior. The range of fish and displays are fantastic. We went on a Thursday morning just",
          "Probably a must especially with kids ! Brilliant buildings , gardens , walkways etc ! Just one flaw ! The one constricted space , and mostly dark, so beware if you have toddlers, the first section of smaller tanks sometimes is only wide enough to get three or four people through",
          "you feel as if you are the one on show, as fish surround you. very interesting even the kids loved it. we had a luch reservation otherwise i could have spent hours there!",
          "Very enjoyable trip...some amazing animals to see and very well exhibited......Would recommend it to anyone....worth a visit...",
          "Our flight home was late afternoon so we decided to call in at the aquarium, I wish we has allowed more time it is a great place to fill in a few hours, it is set out very well plenty to see, a welcome caf\u00e9 is also on site, I will be back allowing more time on our next holiday,",

          "Really good sealife centre, wonderful octopus in residence when we went. Picked up a leaflet at our hotel which entitled us to a free gift each (pretty decent beach bag on this occasion) so it could be worth looking out for these special offer leaflets.Great place for little",
          "We had a relaxing 2-3 hours walking round the Aquarium, unfortunately quite a few school trips coincided with our day of choice so it was busy and noisy. The Aquarium itself is okay , very similar to most other Aquariums we have visited, except Loro Parque in Tenerife which will",
          "Enjoyable three hours in the aquarium. Bigger than it looks. Jungle area was our favourite . Entrance price of 25 euros each a bit steep maybe . Would have thought about 15 Euro\u2019s would be more reasonable",
          "Me and my friends went to palma aquarium yesterday loved it seeing the fish up close and personal loved the stinrays",

          "Loved the variety of coral and fish at the aquarium. Well worth a visit. Enjoyed seeing the baby rays. Learned the rays are a type of shark which I didn\u2019t know. They had rays from babies up to full grown. Got some great pics.",

          "Good day out with plenty to do. I would recommend a visit. Especially if you have children under 12. The boat over the shark tank was amazing but the driver was a little rude. Other than that, it was a fantastic day out.",
          "The aquarium is very nice, lots to see. My 3 year old loved swimming with the sting ray for 10 Euro (bear in mind she did not pay an entry ticket as under 4 go free, yey!). We booked online as a couple so we only paid 44 euro for 2 adults. Great value! The only downsize was some",
          "We had a good day at the aquarium. It wasn't too busy so we got a good view of all the fish and the seating areas around the tanks made it very relaxing. We enjoyed the jungle area and the waterfall was very pretty. It was expensive (\u20ac50 for 2 adults) and wouldn't go again",
          "Has an amazing time here, iv been to many aquriums abroud and in uk but this is by far the best seen fish iv not seen before and got to see lovely live coral. Me and my son swam with sting rays which was an amazing experiance he has cerebral palsy n loved it, We all so did the",
          "My 5-year old grand-daughter was promised a visit to the Aquarium and my son-in-law and I honoured this promise a couple of days before returning to London. My grand-daughter was seriously apprehensive about entering the main tunnel to start the walking tour but she realised",

          "Booked an excursion to the aquarium for what was forecast as a rainy day. Booked through the TUI app which included travel and admission to the aquarium. We were given around 4hrs to explore the aquarium we did it in around 2hrs and used the remaining time to explore the",
          "Visited with my son's both on early 20s one into his fish. Better than expected. Some really unusual and interesting species. The Shark tank is brilliant. Good fun well run park. Better information about what is in the tanks would have been good. A tricky place to get Toby",
          "We had a good visit to Palma Aquarium yesterday Lots to do and see especially for young children But we were 3 Adults and we really enjoyed it It's a shame tourists are charged 7 euros more each than the local Majorcan people Recommended day out however",
          "Got an organised trip off the internet which picked us up from the next road to our hotel and dropped us back so great! Arrived about 12pm and it was busy (as expected) but had a good look about and then popped outside for a walk along the beach and lunch at a cafe. Get your",
          "A very good aquarium as a whole. The shark tank was massive and very impressive and it had a big variety of other tanks to peer into. My only negative would be that they funnel so many people in the entrance that the same time, it makes the first area very cramped and busy. My",
          "If there was a rating of Good i'd pick that but average would seem unfair. This place is a good day out with the kids. A well laid out set up with the aquarium stuff interspersed with general kids entertainment like a soft play, splash park, pirate boat and bouncy castle. For",
          "Great aquarium with lots to see. A number of different areas to visit. We went first thing before it got busy so had no problem parking or seeing any of the fish. Everything looked clean and well looked after. If you like to see fish then Palma aquarium should be on your list.",
          "Visited a few years ago then again this year. Absolute bargain - 2 adults at \u20ac44 and a free bus (if booked through hotel anyway). But even at the \u20ac25 each adult it's good value. Picture is taken upon entry which can be purchased at the end of your visit without any pushy",
          "The place was packed, the show was superb and we all had a great time. The dolphin show was a highlight but I have never got so close to whales and walruses",
          "We loved the visit. Lots of fish to see in well tended aquariums. You can read everything in English, so easy to get information. There are several places to eat, but we did not like the options much. The shark tank is amazing!!! It's about 10 meters deep, with lots of",
          "Was expecting a full day here at the aquarium. We walked around it all in about 30 minutes. Was poor and not what we were expecting. Wouldn\u2019t recommend unless you have children.",

          "We have visited many aquariums including Monterey in California and this was as good as any we have seen. The tanks were many, varied and clean and the inhabitants active and easily viewed. The landscaping was lush and pleasant to be in. The food was reasonably priced. We (my",

          "Really good visit, the animals seem well cared for and they have a lot of space. All the exhibits had loads of information. Not their fault but it was very very busy so hard to get around. Restaurant was fine, we went to do the indoor one near the exit, good table service. food",
          "I was very impressed by the aquarium, one of the best I\u2019ve seen. So geared up for both adults and children",
          "One of the best aquarium I have ever visited, at the start a gentlemen takes a photo with you on a marine background which you cna pick it up later, after that you can visit the thousands specimens the aquarium has, you can swim with the shark and stingrays! The greatest",
          "As a diver, I don\u2019t really condone some of the things in there but this aquarium was clean and very informational. Species of all kind in pretty big habitats. Nice level dedicated to lion fish and the Amazon section was a nice touch. The excessive feeding of koi fish was a bit",

          "Beautiful place with a very thoughtful layout. Really enjoyed sitting by the tanks, watching all the fish and found it very relaxing. My daughter who loves fish really enjoyed it. My only annoyance was the need to keep sharks. I can understand it\u2019s a great tourist attraction and",
          "Just not worth the money, nothing special that you can't see at home. Discount leaflets basically worth 1 or 2 euros. Therefore still very expensive.",
          "I like visiting aquariums, and although the tanks and the fish themselves usually look great, Palma aquarium was different in the great way they have planned the tour - from the cool interior to the beautiful gardens and outside pools, it was a better experience that I have has",
          "Was a bit dubious after visiting aquariums in the UK which you are usually in and out in 30 minutes but this was a great day out. Plenty of 'fish', 'sea life' to see inside and the added extras of 'walking through the jungle' with a lovely waterfall. All information in different",
          "My son and I spent a great day at the Aquarium. So many things to see and the Shark Tank is fabulous, we spent ages just watching them. Also very informative videos and displays around the aquarium. The outside play areas are very good too and the shaded seating areas a welcome",
          "This is a quite nice aquarium. The place has a lot to see. I suggest to book the tickets online. If you are two adults and one children, book the double and a single children. I guess it everywhere the same, but really annoying that you have to wait to get in, because the want",
          "I found the aquarium a lovely day out. It had a lot of interesting history in relation to tuna and farming of fish it was informative. There were a lot of photo oppotunities as well. I went during the half term time i believe so there were a few families and children. Would go",

          "Smaller than Barcelona's but still a very enjoyable half day. Nice shark tank. Super quite koy fish.",
          "We had a day out to the Aquarium by using the bus. Generally in Palma, the bus is \u20ac1.50 so that was a cheap way to get there. I got an online discount too which was about \u20ac10 cheaper so it\u2019s worth looking at the website first. The aquarium is good (we thought Lisbon\u2019s was",
          "Not been to an aquarium for a long time so got a local bus to Palma\u2019s. what an experience, really good layout with both indoor and outdoor parts. Kids can snorkel with rays, and the tank inside is apparently the largest in Europe. Definitely recommend a visit.",
          "This is a lovely aquarium with plenty to see. The children all loved reading about the fish/creatures on the screens which had information available in several languages. There are two play areas for younger children - one inside and one outside. There are also cushions around",
          "Very much worth a visit! Friendly staff, clean park with very well cared for animals. Lots to do and prices very reasonable. Our 11 year old was nervous about swimming with the stingrays but was encouraged by a very friendly staff member who swam with her.",
          "Well worth a visit to this nice Aquarium which appears to have a pirate theme like most other places. Well kept and run staff friendly excellent selections of different fishes and animals to see and lots of areas to visit. Look out for special offers for entry, we spent about 4",
          "We loved it. Loads to do all day including indoor & outdoor play areas for kids. We really didn\u2019t think we\u2019d spend so long there but we were pretty much there the whole day. Take your swimwear if you want to use the small splash area. Food & drink is pricey so take lots of water",
          "Comparing to Moscow aquarium - nothing interesting related to marine and ocean inhabitants. However the territory is nice, and there is a lot of information stands with Russian language",
          "I myself have been to many of this group of aquariums in the UK so once I realised there was one in mallorca I had to go and it was everything and more it's one of the best ones I've visited and would definitely go back again and now looking into doing the dive in the big tank",
          "Visited today with my partner. We caught the number 23 bus from Palma town which took around 20 minutes to get to the aquarium. The bus driver was friendly, the bus was air conditioned and overall it was a good journey. We bought tickets online and were able to enter the",
          "Very pleasant trip to Palma Aquarium. We visited in the height of August school holidays so expected it to be busy there. Apart from the initial entrance into the aquarium, it didn't feel over crowded and plenty to see and do with a 5 year old in tow for the day. Free bus picked",
          "Rainy day and worth a visit, the blue fin tuna exhibit I found interesting and the deep blue tank with the sharks was a winner with the kids, pirate ship and water sprinklers outside and a soft play area with coffee.....win win. Little expensive but assume some of the cash goes",
          "We were disappointed with the aquarium. Firstly we had to pay for parking as there is not enough free parking for visitors available. The collection of Fish is great but as people are allowed to take photos this seems to stop others being able to actually see the fish. It was",
          "Really well layed out aquarium with helpful staff throughout. Excellent range of displays and steps at all the tanks for the wee ones. The big blue tank at the end is something I will never forget; sharks, stingrays and a wide range of other fish living together.",
          "The \"splashworld\" was 1 fountain of maybe 10 square meters, the food was terrible (prison like) and expensive and the music on the speakers were on repeat. On the upside of things our daughter really enjoyed swimming with rays so this was the thing pulling the score to 3 the",

          "Palma Aquarium...close to the car hire drop off so ideal for our last afternoon. Booked on line 25 Euro per adult so a little dearer than a comparable UK venue (Blue Planet, Ellesmere Pt) The place really is very good. Great variety of habitats and exhibits. Staff -",
          "This is a fab aquarium and is especially geared up for younger children. The coffee frappacino was expensive but really delicious and very welcome on a hot day",
          "The aquarium is fine but nothing exceptional. Maybe we visited it in a bad day but the glasses were dirty, and the aquarium was overcrowded. It was very hard to see the fishes because of the mass of people there. I would recommend to start your visit at the opening and not at",
          "We visited here last week with our daughter and she loved it. Look out for any tokens on flyers before you go. Or if you can get a local bus and pay on the door a lot cheaper than the expensive trips of 45 euro. Local buses are 1.50 euro and 25 euro on the door. With a token too",
          "A must with children ! We went 4 times this summer pushed by our grand-children and every time they enjoy it very much",
          "Both adults and kids enjoyed. Arrived 10.30 am and completed tour by 1pm. Had lunch at buffet which was very good and clean. Family ticket including lunch and dessert, no drinks but well worth the extra when booking online ticket. Once finished eating we caught up with the",
          "Visited Palma aquarium as a family with 2 boys. We were really impressed with the layout, quality of exhibits (particularly the coral) and information provided regarding conservation. We paid extra for the boys to snorkel with rays (\u20ac10 pp) - wet suits/snorkels and towels",
          "I would say for Europe probably the best aquarium I\u2019ve been in , its deep and if you\u2019re brave you can pay to go and swim and feed the sharks. I think what makes this aquarium lovely is obviously the sheer size of it but it is the outside restaurant play area for the children and",
          "amazing educational experience for the whole family including grandparents, and amazing to swim with sting ray. As a mother, I wished I also had a chance to swim with the sting ray. We also learnt a lot in the section about saving the tuna. It tapped directly into kids projects",
          "Arrived about 10:30am and was greeted with a spectacular sight, quite an impressive building that stood out. Paid to get in and passed through the \u201cphoto patrol\u201d were they take your photo for which you can purchase at the end. If you have been to a sea life centre in the UK",
          "Nearly every place I go, I end up visiting an aquarium and Palma Aquarium definitely didn't disappoint. From the outside it looked very appealing and modern and the inside was up to the same standard. On the day we visited, the sharks were getting fed at 1pm. The commentary was",
          "I would definitely recommend this place for families with children. I'm sure there's something for everyone. We paid $ 75 for three. Two adults and one student. But it was worth it.",
          "Lovely aquarium, nice day out with our daughter. A little bit smaller than expected but with a great variety of sea life!",
          "Well worth the visit! Wide range of tanks containing Seahorses to Jelly fish to many varied fish species, but the main attraction is the massive Shark tank, it is huge! Plenty of Big Sharks to see amongst loads of big fish, plenty to see outside, koi carp, Manta rays, turtles",

          "My husband & I decided to try the aquarium last week during soaring temperatures to avoid being out in the sun all day and I can say honestly it was a pleasant surprise. Great variety of sea life, shark tank was impressive, lots to see and it took us a couple of hours to walk",
          "If you visit I would take a picnic food is very expensive & not very tasty ..We went on a trip which included coach to take us there & back..Realistically we could have completed the visit in 2 hours as it's quiet repetitive lots of tanks with similar fish.A small part had",
          "Came here on a bus trip from santa pon\u00e7a arrived at 12pm. As soon as you walk in you are ambushed to get your photo taken and then ambushed later to pay for it. I can take my own thanks. You are advised that this takes 4 hours to get around. I can tell you it takes 2. We sat and",
          "I love the ocean/sea and I love sharks, so aquariums are naturally a stop for me when on vacation. One thing that impressed me was that this aquarium donates to help the seas \u201cenvironmental protection\u201d. The shark exhibit was my favorite, we were lucky enough to see a diver go",
          "I recently visited the aquarium on my birthday with my partner. The staff were very welcoming and friendly and the attractions were fascinating to see. Unfortunately the shark boat was out of order when we went. I\u2019ve visited Mallorca a couple times and each time I\u2019ve wanted to",
          "A very pleasant day out for the whole family. So many beautiful creatures to see with many easily in reach of small children in pushchairs. The cafe was very good value and the food good for adults and children alike. Soft play area a good extra activity as well as the mini",
          "Nice for a short visit. We went to celebrate the birthday of our daughter. The kids were very enthousiastic. The only downside is that want to charge you for everything! Even 1 euro to buy socks they need to wear in the play area. At the exit they offered a photo\u2019s of my",
          "We had a lovely day and well worth a visit. However...message for the management....plastic pollution is the biggest threat to our amazing plant and the wildlife that inhabit our seas. Shame on you...the aquarium was littered with plastic straws, single use plastic items,",

          "Lots of different types of sea-life from jelly-fish to sharks, could get to see the sharks being fed as too many people in front of the tank, opportunity to feed the turtles for 10 euros, a very pleasant place to wander round but only took about 2 hours and if you;re on a tour",

          "We travelled with 6 year olds, teenagers and a disabled teenager. The 6 year olds loved the play areas (take swimming things) and the teenagers loved snorkelling with the stingrays. Accessibility is very good for wheelchairs. Inside is very well air conditioned but we went",
          "We came here for an excursion and had the option of spending the whole day here or half a day. We opted for half day which gave us plenty of time to enjoy the whole aquarium. The journey through the aquarium is really well thought out and unlike others we\u2019ve visited before you",
          "We were staying in nearby Palma Nova. The Aquarium puts on free buses to and from the hotels which goes direct to the aquarium. It gives you about 4 hours to explore the aquarium which is plenty of time. There are so many tanks and so many beautiful fish to look at. Most",

          "My 5 y/o says she loved the inside play area - especially the ball pit. She loved having her face painted (free) and the outdoor play area (although it has no shade cover so it was extremely hot). There is a sprinkler area so take togs. A taxi from hotel Bellvere area was",
          "We visited as a group which included 2 adults, 2 teens and a toddler. We had a fabulous time on our trip. The Aquarium itself is clean, well signposted and well laid out. The exhibits are all fantastic - we especially enjoyed the shark tank and the jellyfish!! It was very busy",
          "Not worth 50\u20ac! It was nicely made and especially the jungle part was nice but it was sooooo moist and we could barely breathe properly because we were being sprayed with water. Also the shark tank was disapointing and we were very disappointed as it\u2019s very hyped. The cafeteria",

          "Beautiful aquariums healthy fish Nice food Lot off different kind of fish Nice amazon aquarium And big sharks",
          "Spent 2 hours there. Lots of information is provided in different languages. Expensive, but worth the visit. A rather small parking lot is nearby.",
          "We spent two great hours there. There are many smaller and very nicely arranged aquariums. The highlight of the visit is the great shark tank. Just sit in front of it and let the atmosphere sink in. Lots of information provided as well.",
          "We visited the Palma Aquarium in July 2018 during a family holiday in Majorca. It was a great way to spend a half day out. Like all tourist attractions it was not cheap although very interesting. Best to book online even if going through Tui. The kids loved looking at all",

          "Ideally located near the airport and near two petrol stations if you are returning a hire car. We went here to fill a few hours prior to going to the airport for our return home. The aquarium is far better than the sea Life centres back in the UK and the fish tanks are large,",

          "There's so much to do there and far better than the aquarium here in London. You can do everything comfortably within 2.5 hours... Anything longer than that and you'll struggle to fill your time. We went via a coach that was offered to us for free as part of an excursion deal.",
          "My partner and I had no expectations of what the aquarium had to offer. We've been to many in the Caribbean and expected it to be the same i.e. small and limited. Well we were in for a surprise, it is huge and thousands of varieties of sea creatures to see. Well worth the \u20ac25",
          "This place is larger than it appears. When I paid the entry fee I thought that I would be deducting the score for this establishment because of the fee. But no. You do get your moneys worth. The aquariums are very nice, and the shark tank very cool. Also the small aquariums",
          "many fish and marine species to see with a huge tank holding sharks and rays.The jungle or rain forest with it's waterfalls and constant mist feature is exceptional. Overall I thought good value for money.",
          "I had really high expectations after reading all the reviews about it.. It is really nice that I've had the opportunity to see sharks, but really I hoped there would be more sharks and larger ones.. The one in the picture attached it is the largest they have.. And really",
          "A fab set up aquarium. The venue has been set out incredibly well with interactive educational screens by the tanks. The jungle zone is super well done and the shark tank is incredible. If you have little ones take their costumes are theres an outdoor play area with water. Its",
          "The best thing about the Palma Aquarium is the range of sea creatures that are local to the mediterranean sea. Very educational!",
          "Went here with my husband and two kids aged 2.5 years and 8 months. Lots to see for the kids. My son especially enjoyed the playing area outside.",
          "The Palma Aquarium is an absolute joy. There is so much to do and see. The aquarium is fantastic and so many colourful fish. A perfect family day out.",
          "Worth a visit we didn\u2019t spend a full day here more like 3/4 hours but a great place to see. Food is reasonably priced and service is quick.",
          "Great aquarium and we visit everytime we visit the island. Stunning tanks and definitely recommend doing the shark vision boat over the top of the main tank.",
          "Very informative and very well presented. We loved spending our morning here and eating brunch. Fishes were very fun to look at and they looked comfortable in their environment",
          "Would recommend this aquarium as a day out we lovely the deep blue watching the sharks its a v well run aquarium we had lunch there and it was of hagh standard and priced ok only down to day was we booked tickets with jet2 rep bus going was on time but the return bus was v late",
          "It's a huge and well organized exhibition. Can be considered as a place for studying. A bit expensive but it's one of the best oceanarium in Europe - everything has a price. Bistro/cafe/restaurant, definitely, overuse the situation - better to have a lunch with you.",
          "We visited on a recent trip to Majorca and the aquarium is great, a mix of indoor and outdoor tanks. There are also lots of things to entertain the kids, our three year old loved the rain forest walk and waterfall. The only downside was the parking as the car park is tiny so if",
          "If you want to visit all the world's oceans in a few hours, it's possible! Also suitable for children. The bravest can swim with sharks.",
          "Our expectations weren\u2019t high after reading some of the ratings here on TA, so we were really amazed by this place! Take the time to read about each fish and coral, funny facts for sure :) Decent food in cafeteria. We took pictures holding parrots, these turned out great! Large",
          "While this place may be a little on the pricey side and perhaps not the best aquarium in Europe, it is still a really fun place - large, well-planned out, plenty of things for younger kids to do like 2 lovely play areas and marine character mascots. All in all a great day out.",
          "Not a bad place to spend a few hours, tickets are fairly expensive though. We managed to get a few euros off by buying e-tickets online and then showing the code to the ticket desks. The aquarium is made up of a number of different sections, Mediterranean, tropical, sharks, etc",
          "This facility is fabulous. My 3 and 2 year old loved it!! The shark was the highlight of the day and we sat for a half hour twice at the main rank. Great setting although very busy. Delighted when we found indoor playground. Outdoor one was far too hot the kids were not able for",
          "Palma Aquarium is a must see if you're on holiday in Mallorca! The price is slightly high but you get lots for your money. There are three separate areas to explore with plenty of exhibits and different talks throughout the day and feeding schedules. You are free to go through",
          "Palma Aquarium is interesting and fun to visit. Price is high, but you get plenty... sharks, coralls, fish and other marine life. 5/5 for Aqurium side, but 1/5 to restaurants. Especially Neptuno, where waiters are unfriendly, forget you totally and just talk with co-workers",
          "We were staying in the north of Majorca so we had a longish drive down to Palma than I wanted, when I\u2019m on holiday I just want to relax and not do very much, but I love aquariums so was willing to go, I was glad we went it was well worth it.",
          "If you are on holliday in Mallorca than you should take a half day free from the sun and visit Palma Aquarium were you will find a diversity of marine animals, and of course the impressive shark tank.",
          "Overall this aquarium is one of the best we have visited. The tanks for all animals are fairly large, and have plenty of different species to look at. It was some times confusing trying to understand the layout of the park and also the queues for food were extremely busy and",
          "We went to the aquarium to fill in a few hours before returning home with our 2 and 4 year olds. The venue is just 7 minutes from the airport and with easy, free car parking nearby. The venue is fantastic; the displays are excellent, varied and well maintained. There are",
          "It was such a great experience especially for the little one. Many well prepared tanks with the shark one as a cherry on top. Expensive tour but highly recommended for families. 4 stars as the food quality in the dining area wasn't that good.",
          "We had a fantastic day. We were expecting it to be crazy busy but it wasnt too bad. The staff are absolutely fantastic, so helpful and the guys playing the pirates just made our trip! The shark boat was great and the \"captain\" was funny and knowledgeable and put my kids at ease",
          "We booked a trip to the aquarium using mallorca-trip website which included transport to and from our hotel and admission to the aquarium. There are lots of interesting exhibits both indoor and outdoor. Highlight was the huge tank with the sharks which was amazing. Easliy spend",
          "This place was heaving! Queues for everything and impossible to get close to the tanks as it was just so busy. My boy enjoyed it but just too busy for my father who is disabled.",
          "It's okay... they have some very impressive tanks. Especially the shark tank. However it seemed expensive for what it was. Lots of eels. The ray and turtle tanks were a bit barren which wasn't very nice. Probably better if you had kids with you.",
          "We returned for the 5th time this year. Palma Aquarius is great. It\u2019s not cheap to get into but the tanks are amazing. My kids love the shark tank.",
          "We were staying in Santa Ponsa and did a trip the aquarium. We were picked up at 11 and the return was for 4.30pm. It was raining on the day we went so it was very busy. There is lots to see in the aquarium and we took our time and got to see all the fish. The kids had lunch",
          "Travelled up from Sa Coma and that took about an hour. We spent 6 hours here may have been a bit long but we were on a day trip with a tour company. It was quiet busy but still got to see everything easily enough. We done the glass boat in the shark tank and well worth it and",
          "Experience was good. The aquarium is extended to both outdoor and indoor which was slightly different to other such places. However don't expect to walk down an under water tunnel with shark swimming above you as no such feature available.",
          "We visited the aquarium on a weekend & when it was raining, along with half of Mallorca! It took a little time to get around due to the crowds but didn\u2019t stop our enjoyment. We visited as adults with a baby. He was totally in awe of the displays. The aquarium has an",
          "Visited here with our children aged 12, 6 and 1 whilst on holiday. My partner has Marine fish so has an interest in places like this - the rest of us not so! However, we arranged the visit through Tui including transport and entry. We arrived at 12pm and wondered how we would",
          "We have been to Palma Aquarium a few times now and every time it as been excellent. Good thing about it is that it is good for all ages ,everyone is catered for . We have took my parents every time, both have mobilaty problems but they have loved it every time as it is easy for",
          "We visited the aquarium with TUI and while we did enjoy the trip, especially the shark tank, we felt we were there too long. The bus left us there for nearly 5 hours, when really 2-3 would suffice. My son found the children's playgrounds a bit young for him so for younger kids,",
          "Booked through tui reps 41\u20ac for bus to the aquarium, entrance, glass bottom boat expedition, 8\u20ac food voucher for lunch and a free hat in gift shop. The bus picked us up 11am and collected us at the aquarium at 4.30. Fantastic day/trip. Free time to wander around on your own.",
          "I really enjoyed this aquarium. There was lots to see, you can easily spend a few hours here. I loved the turtles, the bluefin tuna exhibition and the sand tiger sharks. They were huge! Education is great here. So much to learn. And I also enjoyed the little cinema where you",
          "Stunning world class aquarium with beautiful imaginative environments and magnificent specimens. Each enclosure is complimented by a fully interactive multi lingual information screen and is full of both flora and fauna with appropriate environment. The jungle section is",
          "It was a bit cloudy for a few days so we went with first choice to the aquarium. It is quite dear but we don't have much of an aquarium near us so we went. They have a glass bottom book which you can go in to see sharks or you can just see them in their massive enclosure.",
          "We walked around very quickly but I think if you got younger children it would be longer but it was one of the best aquariums we have been to , the shark vision boat was fantastic",
          "We spent a great day at the aquarium during our family holiday to Cala D\u2019Or. We booked with TUI and went for the Plus option which included the shark boat tour. This was quite simply awesome - our 7 year old was amazed by the experience of floating on the top of the Big Blue",
          "Visited palma aquarium during our holiday with 4 adults and 4 children. It's quite a large place and it was suitable for wheelchair use. Very strict parking rules as we parked in a disabled bay and a guy stood there watching and waiting for us to put uo the disabled parking",
          "I loved the Palma Aquarium! Quite easy to get there if you walk! Entrance a bit pricey but worth every euro. The highlight for me was diving in to the Big Blue, one of the deepest shark tanks in Europe and enjoyed a dive with 11 shark, but the whole complex is unbelievable. I",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. We saw lots of interesting species including manta rays, sharks and turtles. Well worth a visit",
          "What a fantastic place. We only had few hours as on trip but in 2yrs we will make a full day of it.Never new there was so many different types off fish. The lay out of it is well done. Sharks swimming over your head,fantastic. You got to see it to believe it Recommend you",
          "Myself and my partner enjoyed our visit to the Aquarium on our last day of hols, this is definitely the place to be if it\u2019s raining or a bit cold out! We took our time walking around and learning all about the different fish and coral, the tanks were full of beautiful and",

          "Lovely place. You will see a lot of different species. It is worth the whole to take the Domus Cinema. Be aware they are shown in 3 different languages (Spanish, English, and German) at different times. So, pick the proper one. The rest of the park is full of fishes, sharks, etc",

In La Almudaina, the monarchs of the Kingdom of Majorca, the Aragonese monarchs and Spanish monarchs had their court successively. Philip II of Spain destined the \"Tinell\" to Real Audiencia and installed in the rest of the building the General Captaincy of the Islands.\nThe current structure of La Almudaina corresponds to the one built in the 14th century with its different spaces; the palaces of the King and of the Queen, the chapel of Saint Anne or the baths, are the most outstanding.\nIts decoration presents two environments, on the ground floor the medieval style is recreated with works from the 15th to the 20th centuries. The upper floor, used for the celebration of official acts of the Royal Family, is decorated with objects and furniture from other Royal Sites of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.\nThe current castle, of Roman origin, is a modification of the Muslim alc\u00e1zar begun in 1281, it lasted until 1343, during the reigns of James II of Majorca , son of James I of Aragon, Sancho of Majorca and James III of Majorca. La Almudaina was the seat of the prosperous Majorcan kingdom of 14th century, during the reigns of the aforementioned monarch and his successors Sancho of Majorca and James III of Majorca, until passing to the Crown of Aragon with Peter IV in 1349.\nDuring the first half of 16th century the upper floor was built by order of the king Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.\nIn the same way as in the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, is the official summer residence of the King, as well as other members of the Spanish Royal Family, who also reside in the Palace of Marivent and in the Palacio de la Zarzuela in Madrid.\n\n\n== External links ==\nPatrimonio Nacional | Royal Palace of La Almudaina\nAlmudaina Palace, NorthSouthGuides Royal Almudaina Palace, Mallorca",

          "Whilst waiting for the service in the cathedral to finish we visited the Palace which is now a museum. It is definitely worth the extra for the audio guide and you can chose a 40 min or 75 min tour,",
          "Impression of a municipal building rather than a 'palace'. Good views from wall, pretty courtyard and new meeting hall is impressive space. However wouldn't class it as a must do.",
          "An interesting place you can visit with 7 euros/pers. However, we were disappointed buy the way things regarding the organisation, were managed. For example, the app for the smartphones, that was cheaper than the tablet itself, in that week didn't work. Another example is that",
          "The first building on the hill was of Arabian origin. Today the palace has an official part and the second part is a museum open for publc. The palace contain also the small Saint Ann Chapel. This fortress is a stove, massive, impressive, visible from afar, situated opposite the",

          "This is ideal for those hot midday siesta times. The tour is up to an hour and a half long or a shorter 45 min and self guided with an electronic guide. I strongly recommend bringing headphones as if on a budget you can just but one guide per couple and split an ear plug each as",
          "If you can time your visit to avoid the swarm of cruise ship passengers you can have a very peaceful time here. The audio guide is very helpful (extra charge).",
          "At a cost of \u20ac7 entry it was a pleasant walk round the castle style palace. Good views over the to the sea and quite grand feeling. Wasn't a massive amount to read or see overall. Worth a visit but wouldn't go as far as amazing. Maybe would have been better if we got the",
          "We went here late afternoon, and the crowds had seemed to have died down. We paid 4\u20ac each as we were students and have our student ID with us. Also fully recommend the audio guide which is 4\u20ac, we chose the recommended tour which lasted around 45minutes. This guided us through",
          "This is a really interesting couple of hours visit. I would suggest that you get the audio guide as it greatly compliments the visit. For only an extra 4 euros you get a tablet with commentary and pictures and it really brings the visit alive. You need to leave some form of",
          "I really enjoyed this visit, its free entry with passport on two nights during the week, there are guides on hand to tell you about anything you might want to know, beautiful gardens & views & very relaxed atmosphere",

          "I've read lots of reviews on here which are a bit negative about lack of stuff to see- highly recommend audioguide as this really gave you the background and insight into the palace. Definitely worth a visit with the audioguide, probably a bit boring without!",

          "This an impressive building which was once an Islamic fort and sits opposite the Cathedral. It is a sandstone building similar to the cathedral that was converted into a residence at the end of the 13th century. Walk the area and the various impressive walls of the old fort to",

          "This is one of the highlights to visit in Palma de Mallorca when visiting the old town ( La seu ) but the outsides of the Almudaina Palace smell of urine and are filled with litter its a shame they dont do more to preserve a good image considering the many tourists that visit",
          "A fantastic place to visit if you enjoy architecture and history. A palace without the bling. A very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours taking in the sights and taking advantage of the views over the port of Palma.",
          "Look.. If it's your first time to Palma you will probably want to visit here, but it's not that interesting. Far better things to see - suggest you get a map of all the wonderful patios and spend the morning finding them and taking some great photos.",
          "Very short visit around the palace. However a lovely place to see next to the cathedral. Great views of the port as well.",
          "I can't really add much to what has already been said by previous reviewers: It's all very attractive (everything you'd expect from an old palace), but your access is limited and you've walked around everything in no time at all: the visit works out at 7\u20ac for about 25/30mins.",
          "While you are heading for the cathedral, stop by the palace. A visit is well worth it. The walk takes you round the different rooms and you are given just enough information so as to keep you interested. The security check is friendly and swift.",
          "Spartan at best. Just not interesting enough. Definitely not worth the 7 euros a Nirmal ticket costs.",
          "This building dates back to Roman times and was the residence of the Muslim rulers. The interior has large rooms with vaulted ceilings and exquisite tapestries. The views from the outdoor terrace are stunning.",
          "Interesting but nothing outstanding. More information about the day to day workings would have been good.",
          "For one who wants to be royalty for a day, this is it. A true Palace indeed and greatly enjoyed the wonderful structure overlooking the beach. A beauty indeed.",
          "7\u20ac admission and 4\u20ac for an audio guide. Self guided tour with basic printed information in each room if you forego the audio guide. Sparsely furnished and with limited exhibits, but nice to have a free run around this old palace right next to the cathedral. You will not need",
          "For a rather reasonable price, it was good to visit one of the Spanish Royal Family's royal palaces. Palau de l'Almudaina (Almudaina means in Arabic citadel or fortification) is situated right next to the Cathedral of Palma de Mallorca. I visited this palace after visiting the",
          "The palace is not overdone as most are. It was tastefully decorated. I liked the Moorish arches that were in many rooms. It appeared that an audio guide is part of the entrance fee - but they were out of devices when we entered. There were small signs to provide an overview",
          "Worth a visit. Right next to cathedral. Go early and it is quieter. Cool rooms showing off centuries of history. Good views out to sea from here.",
          "This palace is a must-see while in Palma. The rooms are not overly ornate, but they hold a lot of history. A visit of about one hour seemed to be a good amount of time. The building also offers some amazing views of Palma from one of the balconies available to the public. I",
          "It seemed this place can be overshadowed by the neighbouring cathedral which is also beautiful, but I would recommend making time to look around the palace too, it is definitely worth the very reasonable 7 euros entrance fee.",
          "A great, picturesque location - history and beauty in one place. Makes the city of Palma very special.",
          "Has to be visited.lovely place and since next door to cathedral we did both in same morning. A must do in palma.",
          "Relatively austere stonewalled rooms decorated with tapestries and antique furniture. Very attractive queen anne's chapel and lovely terraces and courtyard.",
          "No little children please (boring for them and you as the adult wont enjoy) , teens interested in history and grown ups will love this place . Get the audio description self tour , you'll be blown away by the background of this masterpiece. The views are superb ( today you look",
          "On an unusual day when it was lightly raining we noticed that the usual soldier was not on duty in his sentry box outside this Royal Palace and it was open to the public. If you check the flagpole on the Palace ( next to the Cathedral) and the Spanish flag and not the Royal",
          "Last time we docked in Palma, the Palace was closed so we were happy to find it open when we visited. There is a nominal admission fee and photography is not allowed, but the Palace holds some great artifacts and historical tapestries, created in Belgium. The Place is 1000 years",
          "Another must see, concession for those over 65 being 4 Euros. Very, very strict on the no photos policy. Again we read up on this prior to visiting, you can only imagine the festivity and opulence that once frequented the Palace during the 9 Kings that reigned. Just under the",
          "Our first surprise was that with my Blue Badge we were admitted free. Secondly there was a lift which enabled me to access all floors of this ancient building. There were also chairs here and there. The museum aspect was very interesting and labelled in English. We also had a",
          "The Palau de l'Amudaina, which is located opposite the Palma Cathedral, is a beautiful historic building in the old part of Palma. It was one of the attractions which was available using our Palma Pass card, and a friend and I thoroughly enjoyed the visit. Well worth a visit",
          "We had visited the palace about 20 years before but decided to refresh our memories. We picked up an audio guide which was helpful as we could share it and replay things of interest. the building which has origins back in the 10th century when Majorca was ruled by the Moors is",
          "Although we didn't enter into the Palace for the visit, it's in the path between La Llotja and the Cathedral. The place is breathtaking, huge and decorated to the detail. The fountains are amazing. There's a lot of stairs going up and down, so be ready if you go with children /",
          "I wanted to visit the Cathedral which is next door to the Castle but since that was not open I decided to visit the Castle which was open to public. I do not regret this visit. The Castle is very beautiful and worth the visit. You can go out on the balcany and see a good view",
          "There is no photography inside the palace which was a bit disappointing as many of the exhibits would be ideal to photo guess they are trying to sell you the glossy expensive brochure. Nice to visit on a rainy day",
          "Definitely get the audio tour, and take your time wandering through and soaking up the atmosphere. The staff appear to be there more to make sure you don't touch stuff (who knew you shouldn't walk on the rug? It's on the floor, for goodness sake!)",
          "If your in the city and have time to walk thru an old palace, then you should visit this museum. This is a very good restored historic palace.",
          "If you want to be a 'proper' tourist then I recommend visiting here. Myself and my friend did for 7 euros each and it was quite nice to look around.",
          "\u20ac7 entrance. We paid an extra \u20ac4 for audio which was very informative. We loved our trip around and to see the upstairs rooms where the King uses as his present day office when visiting Mallorca, was interesting. The history of this palace is amazing especially as it links in",
          "Went on Wednesday after 5pm, which is free as an EU citizen. If I had paid the usual 7 euro entry, I would have felt ripped off. It looks very impressive from the outside - very large, formidable, and well maintained. Unfortunately, as a visitor, you only get to view around",
          "We visited the palace on what was a particularly wet day. While this was intentional on our part the palace would be just as interesting at any other time. Unfortunately visitors are not allowed to take photos within the internal spaces of the palace so all my photos were taken",
          "The location is fantastic, the cathedral and the vue most gratifying, you can smell history in every corner, not to grandiose but nice to visit when you are in mallorca, a beautiful island a pleasure to visit again, just go around and enjoy...",
          "This palace is still sometimes used by the Spanish Royal Family. Unfortunately the audio guide is extra to the admission price - \u20ac7 + \u20ac4. It is pretty much essential though or you will walk through it very quickly. There are some lovely rooms and artwork. Worth a visit.",
          "Visited on the way to the Cathedral but wasn't too impressed, cost 7 euros but couldn't enter a lot of it, was not allowed to take photos. Disappointed.",
          "We got in free as on certain days entrance is free for citizens of EU and Latin American countries - you just need to show your driving licence or passport. The palace itself is quite pretty - it's the official residence of the King of Spain in Mallorca, although he never",
          "We didn't visit inside, but it is a nice walk while you're on your way to visit the cathedral. For sure it's one of the most important sites in Palma",
          "If you find yourself in Palma, get yourself along to the Almudiana palace. It is opposite the cathedral and the building houses many treasures. It is a great insight into Palma's past, the rooms are large, as you would expect, and the paintings and tapestry's are spectacular. It",
          "I visited here with 7 and 5 year old boys. It's not that suitable for small children and there is a charge for them. Interesting enough but not good value for money and a short enough visit. The cathedral might be a better choice.",

          "El Palau de l\u2019Almudaina was a citadel in Moorish times when the governor of Mallorca lived here. After the reconquest of the island by the Christian Jaume 1 the medieval Mallorcan kings lived in this building. Nowadays there are state apartments here and the present king has",
          "Impressive architecture, with some rooms still used for official activities, so much history to learn. The view is fantastic, the furniture and the surroundings are amazing !",
          "A small group of us toured the palace and enjoyed seeing it. I would not call it is must see sight, especially for those who have seen palaces and castels before, but it was ineresting. The palace has good information in English so we did not purchase the audio guide. There",
          "Lovely beautiful palace, however quite pricey for entrance, \u20ac7 per adult. There's a limited amount of the castle you can go in and you get round fairly quick. However still worth the visit.",
          "the palace has lovely rooms inside with nice tapestries in some rooms. the king and queen of Spain use the palace to receive guests from other countries and it will impress anyone to be invited there. the courtyard is large and pleasant with views onto the end of the cathedral",
          "A building offering a glimpse into the Arabic influence on the ruling generations which succeeded the departure of the Moors. Very convenient to the centre of Palma. Still a working building, too, so you tread where the royal family has its Mallorcan home.",
          "I thought it was a very attractive area as a whole. It was actually quite nice to just walk around it to admire it's strength. It was originally a fort before it became a royal palace. To me, it was more impressive looking at it as a fort, rather than a palace. We didn't pay to",
          "I toddled along to the palace and when I was buying my ticket they seemed to have audio guides, but they also had a sign saying that there were guided tours for an extra \u20ac4 on top of the entry cost. I decided to splash out on one and ended up being the only person on the tour!",
          "It was great to have an insight into the royal living. From the terrace the panorama is beautiful. For me it was worth to see it.",
          "As most of people say it is far from the imagination of real and big palace and there is not so much to see but even that I enjoyed it, it is very nice place. Cathedral La Seu is close so you can visit both places.",
          "I can see from reading previous reviews that Palau de l'Almudaina splits opinion on whether it is worth visiting or not. I visited my myself when I had a spare hour or so. I hired a headset which I think was well worth it as I think it really added to my understanding of the",
          "Quite a nice insight into royal living. Not massive amounts to see but just about enough to justify the entrance fee. Nice views from the terrace and the top floor of the 'once' Great Hall is impressive.",
          "This place is far from a palace of any type. It took about 20 mins to walk through all the \"exhibits\" and cost 4 euro (student rate). I can't believe I paid anything to get in here as it should be free with how little is on display. The outside is cool to look at, but don't",

          "We managed to drop on free admission on a wet Wednesday afternoon, and did the whole building in 25 minutes. Probably more interesting to a student of Spanish history, but still impressive to see the scale of the place. Half is out of bounds as military appear to be based here.",
          "Historically significant, and much to see. However access was limited, and collections/furnishings sparse. Incredible some of the restorations completed to date to return back to original design. Given entry fee and access I can only rate as average attraction - lots of",
          "I did not like this palace. There are a lot of almost empty rooms (with some furniture and carpets). The money you spent for the tax it is not worth it.",
          "I wonder how many visitors to the island even visit Palma, never mind the Cathedral (which is indeed a must) or this museum. Some of the history of the island - from Arab occupation, through absorption into Aragon, a brief period of independence, then Aragon again and so into",
          "Well what can I say. Just afew rooms with abit of furniture hear and there.Not worth the effort of walking around and the entrance free. You only can see what they want you to see........which isn't much.",
          "The Almudaina palace is still used by the king of Spain for important meeting but you are welcome to take a walk around most of it. There are lots of fabulous tapestry to see and relics of times gone by. Take a walk through the gardens overlooking Mallorca harbour and the Parque",
          "The Almudeina Palace is quite beautiful and quite big. There is a courtyard that is very big and has a fountain with the statue of a lion with water spouting from its mouth. This lion was made by the Moors and is quite old. The palace has many good tapestries that have conserved",
          "It is definitely overpriced - you will see only one half of the palace with mostly boring and not well furnished rooms. Just explore this Palace from outside, take some pictures and go to the Le Seu and spend your money there...",
          "The ticket is quite expensive. Although the Le Seu Cathedral worths every penny, this Palace Surrogate doesn't. First of all you aren't allowed to take ANY pictures. Nor inside or outside. You can only visit about half of it. Very large rooms, very little decoration. Poorly",
          "The palace us must-see place. For 7 euros you will see portraits of kings, king's and queen's study rooms, anna domini chapel, Arab baths.",
          "There is not much to it. If you have nothing else to do you can visit. Good place for picture taking.",
          "Visited with family. Complete waste of money. Expensive and boring. Learned nothing. Meaningless empty rooms. Wedding in chapel so all that closed off. Avoid at all costs.",
          "We visited the palace because it was next to the cathderal, which we had already been in. For myself, a 22 year old male holidaying with my girlfriend, this was totally boring. There is nothing interactive in the palace and it wasn't cheap to enter. It was literally a walk",
          "Rooms and courtyards of the palace are interesting, but there are few contents, making it an expensive visit at 9 euro",
          "I have the chance of see tripadvisor before I go so we didn't get inside (and paid the entrance fee) based o other reviews. So from outside I have to say it seems big, and a kind pf arab palace that got intact to our days. The thing we liked mosted is the view of the Palau from",
          "We paid to get in (wish I've checked Tripadvisor before going...) and wasn't the best value thing we did. Interesting to see inside a medieval Mediterranean palace: similar but different to similar castles / palaces in Northern Europe. Was vaguely interesting to see the official",
          "I LOVED this palace! The entry was more expensive than the other attractions, but well worth it. Be sure to get the audio guides, as they point out some great artifacts and tell the stories behind each room. The tour wouldn't have been the same without them! This is a MUST SEE!",
          "The palace is right next to the Cathedral and when we were there it was pretty much deserted which is a real shame. Entrance was \u20ac9 and you are able to visit a selection of restored rooms and also the terrace that overlooks the harbour. Photography is not allowed inside but the",
          "This can be seen free if you take your passport and you are an EU citizen. I would have felt seriously short changed if we had paid \u20ac18 entry fee for two.",
          "This is another Mallorcian building that is very impressive. Gothic style. It is a pity they ban photography inside but that may be because it is an official royal residence and also an active military building. So there are airport style scanners! It is expensive if you have",
          "The setting is amazing and I was surprised by the fascinating interior - the tapestries are fantastic. Don t be like me and forget to turn off your camera flash or you'll get told off!",
          "A little more expensive than some of the other attractions at 9 Euros. there were no English booklets, and it was another 4 Euros for the pre-record head phones. However each room has a summary in English about the room, whose it was etc. The court yards are beautiful and the",
          "Not a particularly large palace but certainly beautiful and peaceful inside. I enjoyed the visit and cannot imagine going to Palma without visiting its historical and cultural treasures. Great views from its perch on the top of the hill next to the cathedral. Beautiful Arabic",
          "Palau de l'Almudaina is near the city center and is definitely worth seeing. The architecture is quite different than in northern or western Europe and is quite interesting, the museum part is also very decent.",
          "The most important thing to note is that if you're an EU citizen you can visit for free on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons, as long as you have some ID (they did accept my EU medical card!). This is a good saving as otherwise the price is quite steep, although it does make a",
          "For visiting this and the cathedral would recommend parking in the underground car park on the main road into town at Parc De La Mar before the port. Not cheap but not ludicrously expensive (cost around 1.7 euros an hour) and saves you having to battle town centre traffic, step",
          "Palma city is not blessed with many places to visit, so I felt I cannot be very choosy if I have to make the most of my time here. The ticket is slightly overpriced for what you get to see, but other than that, it is a nice small palace. Parts of it are in use so are not open to",

          "With a 9 euro entrance fee and 4 euro for an audio guide I felt it was overpriced for aprroximately 1 hour, we didn't rush either. If the audio guide wasn't purchased there was very little information in each room. This is the first time we have had to purchase a audio guide and",
          "Not worth the money. Ticket seller told us that we could see how the kings lived. Well, they must have lived on the floors, because there is not much furniture to be seen. A few chairs, wood boxes and many carpets on the walls and that\u2019s it. Unless you are into rags, it is not",

          "The palace is small and charming, with some interesting tapestries, Arab style bath and chapel. The views are nice from the terrace and the courtyard is an oasis of calm and cool. However, the entrance fee is very high (\u20ac9!!) for something that is pretty empty and takes less",
          "A beautiful palace, well preserved. The walk through was amazing and the view from the terrace breathtaking. However the fee was a bit overpriced, but this is a site worthwhile visiting. It really feels like you are in a different era!",

          "We visited the Royal Palace of The Almudaina on 07/06/13. We travelled into Palma on the local bus from Puerta Pollensa. We had been looking forward to visiting the Cathedral, and as we headed through the bustling city, a 20 minute walk from the bus station, equipped with a",
          "Not a popular attraction as it seemed very quiet , we visited it on a Sunday, very peaceful, not a great deal to see in some rooms but the entrance fee reflected that",
          "Some parts have been extensively rebuilt over time; still it is an impressing building. Entrance fee of 9 Euros, audio guide at 4 Euros makes it more expensive than a visit to the Cathedral across the street. About half of the building is closed off due to being an official",

          "The palace is a bit of a mixed bag, some interesting rooms, but nothing really outstanding and quite expensive at 9 euros. Parts have been extensively rebuilt over time so it isn't very coherent as a building - some of the newer development is of less interest. There isn't a lot",
          "Wonderful examples of tapestry but I thought the visit a bit pricey compared to other attractions. Access was limited to a small area only, so felt a bit short changed",
          "Worth a visit before dinner if you have time free on a wednesday or Thursday after 5 pm when it is free to Europian tourists as long as you show a passport .At any other time it is 9\u20ac and if in my view the castle is better value for money",

The museum, designed by Rafael Moneo, was built in 1992.\nMir\u00f3's mother and wife were from Majorca. He settled on the island in 1956.

          "A nicely laid-out modernist style museum, giving a good feel for Miro's works. It was great to see the reconstruction of his studio, and have time to wander and sit in the garden. The cafe was under refurbishment but due to open again soon - in the meantime there are vending",
          "Visited today as we had been to the museum in Barcelona. No comparison ,this place is tired looking, no where to get a coffee and the gardens had very few sculpture,quite frankly it was so bad we left after 20 minutes. Such a disappointment.",
          "Not a great fan of Miro to be honest but it's lovely to see his studio and imagine him at work. Best reached on the red tourist by the way.",
          "I have visited this museum twice. Each time I saw very different art. Miro has such a vast collection, that the art changes quite often. The studio where Miro painted is well preserved. It was fun to walk freely about the campus with such a great view of Palma. The staff",
          "Paintings, sculptures, different materials, citations blend and adds together to experience a meeting of Mir\u00f3. The buildings are also interesting pieces of architecture worth seeing",
          "This is a bus ride (or a walk if you're feeling brave - I really enjoyed exploring my way there) from Palma but if you're interested in Miro's work at all it's well worth the journey! I particularly loved the way they'd recreated his studio and left his graffiti on the walls of",
          "We came from France and Germany to experience Joan Mir\u00f3\u2019s artwork. The exhibition is very inspirational. We have learned a lot about his life, his thoughts, and his art! If you are in Palma, make sure not to miss this museum, especially if you are interested in art and",
          "While the best of Miro will be found elsewhere, there's enough here to give you a great feel for how this artist evolved. It is all presented in a spacious museum that allows his art to stand out. But it is seeing his studio that really makes this special. Watch the video and",
          "Worth the effort to visit. Good gift shop. Lovely garden but cafe was closed. Drinks machine only. If you like Miro\u2019s work then this is the place. Not all his work is here. Quotations in French.",
          "If you're in Mallorca you should definitely not miss the opportunity to visit The Fundaci\u00f3 Mir\u00f3.

          "Lovely place, take a number 1 bus, see Miro's studio and his work in the place he created lovely shaped garden, cafe closed at the moment. Watch the 2 films all through",
          "The museum's architecture is amazing as well as its collection of Miro. The number of artworks is not so big, may take 3 hours time to go through. Miro's studio is also interesting. The location is not that friendly, would be better to arrange a stay around Cala Major. The",
          "Miro\u2019s studio, workshops, and a small museum with his paintings, plus small sculpture garden. The artwork is very well presented, the architecture of the building complements the work, perfect setting to admire his artwork. Museum is wheelchair and stroller accessible. Great sea",
          "If you like art but want to know more about the artist Mir\u00f3 this is a very present and interesting way to experience it. Looking into his studiosand where he feels very present like he would come out and start talking. If you are lucky there are guides around able to tell more",
          "We have been to the Miro museum in Barcelona twice. It was excellent the first time and even better the second visit. This is probably why I was a bit disappointed. For those with a genuine interest in Miro, though, there is plenty to see and enjoy. Many early stage sketches and",
          "Wow. It's such an adventure to get there. You need to take a bus or cab and you actually feel like you're leaving the city. I guess when this was Miro's home and studio in the latter part of his life it was in a semi-rural hilltop setting with stunning views of the sea. Now the",
          "This is a superb celebration of all aspects of Miro's work including paintings and sculpture. It's slighltly off the beaten track in the suburbs of Palma - we chose to visit as part of the Hop-on, Hop-off Bus Tour which conveniently stops outside. Pity about the lack of a cafe",
          "It might be worth noting that the \u2018Nice Cafe\u2019, as mentioned in the 3 Days in Palma is now a vending machine! Having had a traumatic journey to get to this museum (the bus driver refused to let me off at the closest stop) so l had to walk about a mile back, l was in need of some",

          "We know pretty well the fabulous Miro museum in Barcelona but this was a new experience. A brilliant museum thanks to the generosity of some relatives. It\u2019s easy to get to by taxi and really is worthwhile. A great insight into the artist who spent his last thirty years in Palma",
          "We visited late one afternoon. Pretty easy to find the place. Parking was easy. Reception very welcoming. The art was staggering. So much to take in. A great experience.",
          "Worth a visit if you like Miro's work and it's an interesting little find. Had a car so that made it relatively easy to visit. Also saw quite a bit of Miro's work in the small village of Deia.",
          "Main studio and cafe closed and have been for some time, entrance fee not reduced. This failed to inspire or inform. The art was not to our taste, quite dark and not understood. Nothing for children and not close to any alternative points of interest. 46 EMT bus or the hop",
          "Loved this museum! Great collection of Miro including his studio. It is a bit far out of town and not walkable from the center of Palma. Can take Bus # 3 or a taxi. We took a taxi which was about a 15 min ride. Bus takes about 45 min. The museum has a lovely gift shop",
          "Amazing collection. It's a must see if you have more free time in the area of Palma and you are art lover. Entrance is free the first sunday of the month.",
          "As an art lover from New York City, founding member the Whitney, member of MoMA and the Met, I have to say this place is NOT TO BE MISSED. One of the most comprehensive collections of Miros work I have ever seen. There is a sculpture garden, several murals, videos, tapestries",
          "very good overview of Joan Miro life and work. The buildings are well embedded in the surrounding area and of a high architectural quality. We where there from 11am to 1pm, not to crowded even it was high season.",
          "When the tickets are paid, you are told that Miros working studio is temporarily closed due to being rebuild... Miros studio is the main attraction of the museum. Such a disappointment. Still nice place with some of Miros later works.",
          "Be sure to visit the exhibition if in Palma. A fantastic collection of Miros art works! The building itself is worth a visit. A small museum shows how Miro lived and worked during his time in Mallorca.",
          "The hop on hop off bus has a stop close to the museum. The building is interesting. There was a temporary exhibition and a v\u00eddeo of Mir\u00f3. Unfortunately the atelier was closed.",

          "We both loved the venue and the outer buildings / work spaces. The weeping tree was amazing. The Architecture some of the Architects best work. The day we visited the Caf\u00e9 was not open at all. The Library area is worth a visit as well and is within the main building. The Shop is",
          "I may have missed something but if I hadn\u2019t seen works by Miro in other galleries, this place, where Miro lived and worked would not have inspired me to see more. It\u2019s a beautiful setting high up above Palma and includes his studio and house as well as a gallery, library and",

          "This is close to Palma but not in the centre so easy to drive to and with a large carpark ( free) opposite the entrance. It is free to visit on the first Sunday of the month and on Saturday afternoon after 15:00 . We visited on Saturday at 15:00 and had plenty of time to explore",
          "If you have kids you will be delighted to know that kids are free but adults are 7.50 euros. There isn\u2019t a lot of artwork but it\u2019s very good quality. There is also a garden full of art and places to have a nice picnic!",

          "enjoyed our visit to the entire space. You can be fooled as to how much is there as you need to venture into all of the buildings. We were there on a quiet day and had a chance to hear about some of the details from the guard that was at the upper building as we were the only",
          "By visiting the studio of Miro you can see the germ of his ideas for painting, sculpture, ceramics. The guides provide the most charming and authoritative explanation of the master and the gallery houses some great works and sculptures Well worth the visit Take the No 3 bus",
          "Pretty small and very few worthwhile pieces of art. You can give that a miss. Entry fee also high for what you get.",
          "...the Miro exhibition did not impress too much as there are better paintings elsewhere. However, the gardens with some of the Miro\u2019s sculptures and the architecture of both Miro\u2019s atelier as well as the exhibition building were astounding! You definitely can see (and feel) the",
          "Experience the home, the workshop and the \"setting\" of Joan Miro. As with his art, words are not adequate to describe the feeling of this place...and the context of so much of his art. Architecturally, his studio which was designed by a fellow Catalan, is also superb. This",
          "Even if you can\u2019t enjoy the works of Miro, the place is of interest for the buildings and the view. Reach it on bus 46.",
          "The building and especial the studio is worth of visiting. I have to say i didn't like so much most of the paintings. But after saying that, there are also many interesting ones and especially sculptures in the garden are extremely beautiful and fabulous.",
          "The Foundation was just a couple of streets away from my already amazing hotel Joan Miro Museum. Free entry from 15.00 on a Saturday, but don't forget to ask a free ticket in order to enter the other buildings. Fantastic complex, gives a very good insight in the world of Miro.",
          "Informative and nicely set exhibition. There are few buildings out of which one is exclusively museum, and the other ones are former apartments. In addition there is a cafeteria. One can easily spend 1-3 hours, and even more, depending on the rhythm one is accustomed to move",
          "Miro worked and lived a large part of his life here. You get to see the very nice atelier that he had built here as well as a large exhibition of his art - sculptures and paintings. Having visited the Miro museum in Barcelona, we didn't have too high expectations, but this place",
          "It took a bit of finding from the number 3 bus but was well worth it. Look for the sign on the right after the Marivent petrol station and back a few streets from where you get off the bus. Don't go up the steps, it's about 2 roads back. The foundation was fantastic and the",
          "Hidden in a small part outside town Mir\u00f3 museum presents his art as well as his studios. Well worth the 7,50\u20ac (free entrance on Sundays after 15.00). A caf\u00e9 and a museum shop are presented as well.",
          "Reached by taxi from the town for \u20ac5. Not worth the journey, views interesting but the art on display was limited.surly staff & not a lot to see.",
          "Amazing views of the city from the roof sculpture area and the Miro Art collection is great for families. The cafe and shops were excellent and lots to see nearby in the park including Olympic stadium",
          "This gallery is well worth the visit - leave the car behind and take the 46 bus and get off at the second stop after the bus turns up the hill. Admission charge for us was 4 euros- excellent value - until later when reading the leaflet we were given when I saw that admission is",
          "We loved this museum despite the problems we had walking there and getting the bus back (went all around the place). The setting, spaces, gardens & exhibitions were excellent and the lovely and well priced cafe was a real bonus. Delighted we made time for this visit.",
          "The gallery and surrounding buildings which include Miro's studios are interesting and worth a visit, providing some insight into Miro's life and work. They are in a beautiful location and are lovely to wander around, with great views over the bay and various sculptures to look",
          "The Miro Foundation is quite hard to find. It is up a steep hill off the main road out of Palma used by the Number 3 bus but it is well worth the effort to get there. There are superb examples of Miro's work on display inside and outside the lovely modern building and you get a",
          "Great space and display of his late art. Studio and home make for a very interesting visit. Worth the trip if you like Miro.",
          "Although not a huge fan of Miro, we enjoyed this museum as the space is cool, tranquil and shows his work very well. The marble panels which filter the light really add to the atmosphere. Besides the museum, there is a garden with his sculpture and his studio space to visit.",
          "really beautiful to see an artists life that conserved... a lot of small pretty things to discover and to get a hint of how miro lived and worked - wonderful. Also nice thing - the surrounding Parc is for free, so don't hesitate to go there on a hot summer day to relax and enjoy",
          "I wasn't expecting what I saw in the soulless gallery, I must admit. The particular exhibition of Joan Miro's work that I saw was lauded as 'unseen previous art'. There was a reason for this I'm sure as quite honestly I couldn't differentiate the pictures on the wall from that",
          "This musem is well worth a visit. a bit outside the centre, but you can get the Number 3 bus that runs through the City to Illietas, the stop is about five minutes after the large shopping centre. Locals are more than happy to direct you towards the museum. the bus fare is euro",
          "Pretty hard to find without google Map or sat Nav, but certainly very worthwhile. Cafe was good but waitress/Barista was very grumpy and unhelpful with no English. Exhibits and Miro's house were fantastic but the souvenir shop was very expensive.",
          "The museum is located quite far from the center of Palma but you cand get there by bus. Nearby it is a beautiful sandy beach. Overall I think the experience is worth it. The architecture of the museum is really impressive, the spaces communicate beautifuly and the paintings are",
          "This is more like gallery, it is not possible to see much of Miro\u2019s atelier or some artifacts. The exhibitions are changed every few months. However, since we are Miro\u2019s fans it was OK for us.",
          "Fascinating museum where Miro spent much of his later life, when he truly challenged himself as an artist. Amazing to see the views of the sea he saw that inspired him. Definitely one of the most well-done museums we've been to -- a real experience versus simply looking at",
          "This is a great visit. It's not expensive, not overcrowded and offers a couple of hours of tranquil beauty in which to stand back and enjoy some quirky and imaginative art in a setting which enables it to speak to you at its own pace. Do I understand it? Not really - but I'm not",
          "Very interesting exhibition. His work gets a different reaction from everyone they all see something different. The building which houses the exhibition is amazing.",
          "Miro is one of my favorite painters. This was a nice treat. We drove from Deia, which was a decent way to go. Admission is very reasonable. The gift shop has some fun options. The collection is not large but some excellent pieces. You can also see his studio. Definitely worth",
          "The Fondacion Pilar et Joan Miro in Palma is an absolute pleasure. If you love Miro already then this is a no brainer. Smaller than its twin in Barcelona and more intimate. The collection of works is fresh and wide ranging. However the real treat is access to Miro's workshop",
          "When we left this museum it was with a feeling that there is so much more to Miro than the museum shows you. The halls displaying works are of course beautiful and interesting - but only a small part of the potential of the place. The workspaces, houses and other places in the",
          "The Fundaci\u00f3n Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3 is a wonderful museum on the edge of Palma dedicated to the work of artist Joan Mir\u00f3.

          "Lovely gallery in a splendid setting. Well worth a visit for the views as well as the art. An easy bus ride from central Palma. We enjoyed the Miro Unseen exhibition. This gallery concentrates on his time in Majorca. There is more of his work in the modern art gallery in the",

          "The Miro Foundation is well worth a visit, even if you're not keen on his style. A bus ride from the centre of Palma (only 1.5 euros) it is a good way to spend a couple of hours. It is divided into 3 - the original house where Miro lived and worked, the 1950s studio, and the new",
          "OK, so we visited by happy coincidence on June 24th which happened to be the first day on which the new exhibition 'Unseen Miro' was open to the public and, because it was the fiesta de Sant Joan, entrance was free. But I would have happily paid a fee for the manifold pleasures",
          "What a treat in Art and architecture and gardens in this delightful museum in walking distance from the resort of Cala Major! The area is being overdeveloped but thanks to the artist Joan Miro a large area shows you the beauty of this Majorcan gardens and landscape. The museum",

          "The Miro Museum with a touch of Miro himself. Cafe could be better but is OK if u are not expecting a nice lunch. To see Miro's studio is magic and his paintings (huge) are still there in the museum. Walk up to the top - where he/they lived - and u got a excellent view.",
          "This is a great insight into Miro's work, with a lot of the artist's quirky paintings on display, and some key sculptures both indoors and out. The location is lovely, set high in the hills above Palma with great views of the bay - Miro worked here for over 25 years, and it is",
          "The museum itself is not a big one. With a lot of sketches of Mir\u00f3 and also additional information about his life in Mallorca. There is outside a nice but small park, sculptures and a very nice tree. The cafe there has limited choices of drinks and some smaller pastries but",
          "Well worth the stroll - fabulous spot on a hill. Able to visit ground floor of house, studio and museum. Museum is a fantastic exhibition space; soaring ceilings but intimate, with glimpses of the gardens outside. Really lovely way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "Great collection of Joan Moro's art set around his long term residence in the hills outside of Palma. Also wonderful to visit his studio too. Definitely a must visit for art lovers.",
          "Not that easy to find the entrance on foot from the hotel, and quite a steep entrance fee for what there is to see, but enjoyed the artist's studio, the old building at the top of the hill and the views across the bay.",
          "The museum and grounds are very good for the works of Art. Miro is not really our cup of tea but we still enjoyed the visit. Don't miss the other studios where he created the sculpyures - Great views of the coast.",
          "The foundation is really a museum with lots of Miro works and two studios which give you a good idea of where and how he worked. There is a fine bistro too, with lots of outside tables, and a good shop. The place is a bit hard to find and if you walk uphill, you might arrive",
          "A visit to Palma would not be complete without visiting this fantastic serene art museum created in memory of famed Catalan artist, Joan Mir\u00f3. Best of all is that visitors can also see Mir\u00f3's actual studio and home, although entrance is only permitted in the hallway. Do ask the",
          "We arrived not knowing too much about Miro but the building (plus studios) , layout, ambience and area of Palma just made this trip special. Basically this is a tip (strong tip) to go, just go. I'm not looking for negatives so I won't - we were in Palma for a week and for me",
          "Although he knows I'm no lover of 'Modern Art' my son recommended we visit this site. I'm glad he did because it was a fascinating experience; although some of the artworks on show left me puzzled. Beautiful gardens and the original workshops were illuminating too. The less said",

          "Miro lived and worked at this property for decades. You do not want to miss it if you're a fan of his -- and which art lover is not? You can park free across the street. Included with your admission is a wonderful little museum display of his work in many mediums, a",
          "Absolutely fantastic what this foundation offers ... a great selection of impressive works by Miro, including his original Atelier filled with art pieces and making you feel, the master had just been here a short while ago. A \"must\" when in Palma!",
          "This is a lovely museum built on the site of Miro's studio in Mallorca. The neighborhood has many high rise apartments and is unattractive. The museum has its own gardens and lovely views of the sea and mountains. The collection is based on donations from Miro's family and a",
          "Parking can be a bit of a problem...please persevere..!! terrific exhibition. a must see....especially Joan Miro's house and effects..",
          "We really enjoyed visiting the foundation in Cala major. It is a very small Miro collection though. If you go to see many MIros it is not the right address. The studio is however located in a formerly really nice location up the hill and you get a glimpse of why Miro put it",
          "We took a baus no 3 from the Pla\u00e7a de Mercat, and hopped out at the Hotel Nixe (Aven. Joan Mir\u00f3 270). Then walked up a hill appr. 10 min. The museum is nice and clear, and gives both information and experiencies ablut Mir\u00f3's art.",
          "You probably have to like Miro's exuberant lines and colours - we do. But even if the paintings are not really your favourites, the amazing sculptures might captivate you. The wonderful modern museum building is a perfect setting for both - and includes a lovely small cafe and",
          "I knew the artist Juan Mir\u00f3 before, I've seen some of his famous works around the globe. but this museum shows some paintings and sketches you probably have not seen before! I was highly surprised to see how Mir\u00f3 loved using different materials to paint on, and that he did many",
          "The Miro museum is a piece of art in itself. The doodles, the paintings, the tapestry and bronze statues created by the artist are amazing. Few tourist visit I am told as it is off the beaten track. It is worth the ride. I found pieces as whimsical. His studios is also amazing.",
          "I went not knowing much about Miro's work, so I learnt a lot about him during the visit. Not my style of art, but I'm still glad that we went. Got off bus at Marivent, and had a fairly steep walk up to the Foundation (about 10 minutes). Lots of examples of art and sculpture on",
          "Located a bit further away from the center, this little museum is still worth a visit if you are a fan of the great Spanish artists. There's not so many great works of art for display but the studio the location itself and even the museum building with nice architectural details",
          "We arrived at the foundation on foot, we did Bellver Castle first then took the steps down and walked via residential roads, a steep hillside then down and round to cross the motorway bridge then more gentle walks looking at nice houses and front gardens. It took us 45 mn to",
          "I visited this museum because I'm interested in art, and I would definitely recommend it to art lovers. It is also worth visiting if you have some extra time in Palma. It's a nice building, and you get to see a beautiful collection of Miro's works as well as two of his art",
          "We visited this museum in October, but it wasn't not what we expected. The famous works were not there, lot of nameless paintings. The museum building is special. You can use hop on bus, our make a walk.",
          "Its not exactly my kind of art, but clearly the dude has done very well in life so seems many people love it! It has to be said though, some of the pieces are child like and will make even the most open and educated art lover wonder... One of the statues looks like mad mix",
          "Take the 46 bus from Palma, ask the driver when to get off. The bus stop is after the museum entrance, so if you keep an eye out when you are on Saridakis (this comes up on the display on the bus) you shouldn't have a problem. ( it is about 2 stops after the detour around the",
          "Beautiful setting and building on the outskirts of Palma. Plenty of space to show artist's work. Recreation of his workshop was atmospheric. Took a taxi from Potro Pi as not easily accessible by foot - uphill and not always any pavement. We were lucky to hail taxi when we",
          "Very interesting collection of the local artist Joan Miro. Also you can see his studio and work rooms. Well worth a visit if you are interested in art.",
          "Although it's a little difficult to locate this museum/studio/gallery/ coffee shop and souvenir shop is well worth the effort. It shows a large quantity of Miro's paintings in a truly exceptional building that shows off his work to its best. It's great seeing the rooms and home",
          "The star of the show here is Miros friend the architect, if it hadnt been for the buildings I would have been very angry about spending such a huge amount on taxi fares to get to this out of the way place. You really have got to like Miro a great deal!!!",
          "It is worth the 10 minute taxi ride to visit this modern, well curated art collection. All Miro's works are well described to help you understand how is talent, style and diverse techniques developed. there is a small cafe and good shop so more to do than just wander around.",
          "Having visited the Joan Miro gallery in Barcelona, it was essential to find his Mallorcan studio building and the modern gallery now on the same site. Mind you it took some finding, as we drove here and it seems it is easier by bus! There is a car park opposite the entrance, but",
          "If you are really into Miro this is the place for you. They have sebveral building which you can explore. A museum , a garden with sculptures , an old farmhouse on the grounds with Miro grafitti inside, and his workshop ( built in 1956) - left as if he has just gone out for",
          "Wonderfully located museum with the timeless work of Joan Mir\u00f3. Easily accessed by the bus nr 3 from Palma Center.",
          "Take the number 46 bus from the city centre to the Foundation. The hop on/hop off open top bus also stops at the site. Fascinating location where Miro spent much of the later part of his life. The site includes the art gallery built to exhibit some of his work, his main studio",
          "My partner and I are both fans of art, and of modern art. Before we visited, we had a rough idea what we might expect to see.....but we were truly impressed with this living memorial. The building is very light and roomy and one flows from room to room to admire the work of",
          "For any art lovers this is a must. From the tranquil gardens to the workshop and the gallery, this is an exquisite way to appreciate Miro's life and art.",
          "We went on Saturday which is Free. The Museum is above Kings Palace in Marivent. Beautiful setting and Views. Nicely displayed works and interesting Work Studio. In the attractive gardens there is a Cafeteria and it is quiet and Peaceful to sit a while. Parking available and in",
          "This spacious, modern gallery houses paintings and sketches from the last 25 years of Miro's life. You can wander around the grounds, visit the workshops and get a bite to eat in the cafe.",
          "We walked from our resort to the Foundation, and missed the entrance desk so had to double track back to pay. The visit encompasses the galleries (with Shop), gardens and caf\u00e9, his studio and outhouse with print works. Out afternoon was very quiet but allowed leisurely",
          "What an amazing haven of peace and culture - inexpensive and just a manageable size not to become over-loaded - also a good introduction to art for children. We visited on a slightly drizzly day when Palma centre was heaving with people who'd evidently gravitated away from the",
          "A good small collection of Miro's spreading most of his life. Not as impressive as the collection in Barcelona but still very interesting. In addition, the visit of his atelier is quite a special thing. Some good sculptures in the gardens.",
          "Take a walk to the mountains, just a few kilometres of Palma city. There are three buildings (museum and atelj\u00e9). Joan Mir\u00f3 lived and worked here. The oldest building was the first which Mir\u00f3 bought. The others are designed by famous architects (Sert and Moneo) and there is a",
          "Truly amazing experience! IF you are in Mallorca you have to go. Superb architecture and the art is super nice. You will also go and look inte the studio with alot of unfinished pieces. Loved it! Its free admission on saturdays",
          "Oh what a location for his studio for the 25+ years he lived in Majorca. His wife Pilar was from the island. High above the bay, with the sun twinkling on the sea. An idyllic setting for his studio designed by Sert. An interesting building in itself still left as it was in",
          "This is a superb museum, the Moneo Building beautifully designed on land adjacent to Miro's studios and reflecting Miro's own work in its plan. The museum is fairly large and designed so that visitors are not much aware of other visitors. There is a great museum shop, with",
          "It's good to see the old house and the modern atelier of Joan Miro, but allowing you to only visit half of those places, gives a bad feeling. Moreover, I think Miro has much better art work than the ones on display in the museum. That's a pity for a place that calls itself the",
          "Loved this museum building, absolutely stunning, didn't manage to understand the art work, but then that's down to the individual",
          "Situated a few kilometers outside Palma in the western part of the city. A nice place with many of his pictures and also his atelier. Should be visited by everyone!",
          "If you are a modernist with a sense of appreciation then be sure to visit...........well worth the time.this was my second visit.",
          "A bit disappointed there was no major work on display. Nice grounds, outhouses are still being used as he used them and facilities for art students.",
          "As a painter and printmaker, visiting the Fundacio Miro was one of the reasons for going to Mallorca. I was hoping it would be a major improvement on the Fundacio Miro in Barcelona, and it is. Superior in every way. And very beautiful. It rivals the Fondation Maeght in St Paul",
          "Staying in Cala Major I took the short walk up the hill to this gallery. I don't claim any understanding of abstract art but found some interesting work in a pleasant gallery. Outside the gallery are two small studios - nice short stroll with good views over Cala Major. Pleasant",
          "We had a lovely morning visit to the Foundation. We both like Miro and it was good to see his studios and try to understand how he worked. His inspiration and the development of his sculpture was very evident. His paintings were, as always, interesting and the tapestries",
          "Visited here on a Saturday afternoon and compared to other places we have been; Barbara Hepworth House, Eduardo Chillida it seems a little under the weather. There was barely any staff and no buzz about the place. The water features outside were algae ridden ( poor fish) and",
          "I generally like Miro, but found the contents of this museum uninteresting and not especially representative of the artist's most famous works. My wife, who is more of a fan was more enthused. My 3-Point rating is an average of our two points of view.",
          "Some nice works by Miro. Well worth the trip if in te area. Opposite a #46 bus stop so easy to get there.",
          "Excellent venue take a bus 3 or 46 from Palma and then a steep walk up hill but its well worth it. There is Joan Miro's studio and house and a gallery too.",
          "This place is stunning, not only does it contain loads of brilliant works by Miro, but also the building is amazing. The space, lines, atmosphere, light, all combine to compliment the fantastic work of Miro. It's so tranquil and restorative, I wanted to stay there all day and",
          "Great visit, fantastic view. Good exhibition with lot of space, silence and inspiration. Mir\u00f3 atelier and house.",
          "The collection of Miro's works is not as extensive as the one in Barcelona but it is very impressive. The gallery building is enormous and provides rooms with the necessary dimensions to enjoy his works. Miro's studio though is something else. The light that it enjoys can",
          "It's a little way from the centre of palma - 30 mins on the local bus number 3, but very well worth the effort. The art collections are magnificent and the buildings and grounds beautiful - you can see why Miro chose here to create his works. We have visited the Miro museum in",
          "This is the perfect monument to Mir\u00f3's life and work. The location is stunning with great views over the city from the garden. Inside, there is a wonderful selection of the artist's work. His studio, with his unfinished canvasses, is particularly moving. The building is",
          "The place where Juan Miro and his wife Pilar lived and worked from 1956 (till his death in 1983) extended in 1992 by additional building (by Rafael Moneo) provide visitors with nice collection of artworks that are so special to Miro. Plus the atmosphere of the surroundings,",
          "This is a cavernous gallery with a large collection of Miro's works. It also has his studio, preserved in it's working state. This was an intriguing space. The architecture of the foundation and studio are of interest in their own right and the setting is pleasant, up on the",
          "We were disappointed. The collection in the exhibition buiding is poor...too bad.The architecture of the building where his studio is located is very interesting, especially where the windows were located in order to provide the needed daylight, the painter needed.",
          "As a Miro lover, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. Not only are there many of his great works to be admired, but the views over Palma are amazing as well! The highlight for me was seeing his studio. Unfortunately the museum closes at 3pm on Sunday and the shop at 2.45pm.",
          "A highlight of our holiday! The collection is housed in a series of buildings that will delight you. On the day of our visit it was glorious weather with only a handful of visitors - magical! I would recommend taking a taxi to and from the foundation.",
          "We loved this small but beautiful exhibition. Saw sculptures as well as a selection of Miro's work. Saw his studio too. The space is interesting. The shop is good too.",
          "Handy car park opposite the entrance, with a free entry to the exhibition which is housed in a building designed by Rafael Moneo. The surrounding area isn't much to talk about but the gardens and studios are worth a visit",
          "Worth the effort to get to this museum. The art will not disappoint. Transport required as outside the city. Parking limited. Cafeteria on site.",
          "Excellent gallery, his studio astonishing and the old house even more so. Cafe ok but poor food offer.",
          "Terrific small museum housing some very good examples of Miro's work. Plus you can visit his studio and see the breathtaking views from his garden. You can access this museum by public transport, but if you do plan on using the bus I recommend not going on a Sunday when the",
          "We have visited the Miro Foundation 8 years ago and did look forward to visit the museum again, but frankly we were disappointed because the collection was rather poor this time. Of course many of Miros \"highlights\" are spred over the world, but this is a Foundation. Anyway the",
          "An impressive collection of paintings and sculpture. Fascinating to wander around the place where the artist lived and worked. The foundation have clearly decided to let the works speak for themselves as there are no knowledgeable guides on hand to answer questions so visitors",
          "This is hard to find, and outside the main city, but is well worth a visit. Miro isn't actually my favourite painter , but the opportunity to see his studios and wander in the grounds of this beautifully designed complex overlooking the bay is really worthwhile and quite",
          "This is a fantastic attraction, there are 3 individual sights, the gallery, the house and the studio. The gallery has a fabulous display of various aspects of Miro's work in various media. Very well laid out in a modern building. The house has drawings on the walls as well as",
          "If You are interested in modern art You must go there. You will see a good variety of Mir\u00f3's work together with his workshp. Besides You could admire the innovative construction of the museum building and may look and the splendid view on the sea.",
          "Great museum and one of those exhibitions that awakens you to what the artist really represents and how important he is in the history of art.",
          "This is a quiet spot on the south west side of Palma, easily reached off the motorway. What must have been a beautiful site on the hill overlooking the bay now has flats and houses right up to its walls, but there is still a good view over the sea and the size of the site means",
          "Well worth a short taxi ride from the centre but it was slightly more confusing getting back from there. You need to take a bus it was quite circuitous. The gallery was lovely and in the most beautiful setting. Young ticket selling gentleman pl stop rolling your eyes at the",
          "Spent a lovely morning here - well worth the visit. Fascinating artwork, lovely buildings and peaceful garden. On site cafeteria with outside seating. Parking opposite. Bus route from Palma centre. Steep hill to climb.",
          "It's a long way for not a lot. If you like modern art the paintings and tapestry are interesting but I found it difficult to understand what Miro was trying to say. A lot of the work was either unlabelled or had incomprehensible titles. An interesting building that has been",
          "Located in a residential area (very well served by public transport from Palma Old Town), this fantastic centre is split over 3 locations, the purpose built studio, a traditional house used as a sculpture studio (with graffiti!) and the main foundation building. An oasis of",
          "Lovely buildings and worth a visit if you want to view miro's paintings,tapestries and sculptures.good views",
          "This is a very nice meseum that has some really good pictures and artistic things. lovely gardens to and free parking go go go!!!!",
          "If you're a fan of Miro, this is a must see museum. Although the collection consists primarily of his late period (mostly 1970s), you also get to see his studio, designed by Josef Sert and built in the mid 1950s. The studio has been left more or less intact as it was found when",
          "An interesting open-plan museum where you should go and see some great work if you like the subject. Here you can also visit two of his studio. The exhibition also includes some of his small personal belongings.",
          "Located in a side street off the main motorway around the sea edge from Palma it is an interesting collection of different works of Miro from his bronzes and vibrant textile works to his sketches and the graffitti found in the reconstructed Majorcan farm style building. The",
          "Beautiful museum. Features many structures and miros workshop with paintings. The architecture is beautiful, nice gardens. Most of his famous pieces are not there, but in paris, ny etc. his later work is here, the rugs were rad.",
          "A wonderful experience.really enjoyed the display of Miros work in a n unusual building. The staff were friendly and helpful.Seniors get a reduced rate. Public transport was a bit difficult so we used the hop on hop off tourist bus which stops at the door.",
          "Loved visiting the place where Joan Miro worked. Take the bus from Palma and get off at Miravent. Walk back on yourself and you will see signs for the Fundacio up a steep road. There is a car park across the road. Great if you want a leisurely browse and love art.",
          "Visited in the hope of learning more about the life and work of Miro. The exhibition is very small with none of Miros major pices present. The architecture nice but not worth a visit in itself. The studios (2) are sparsely furnished and you are not allowed to move around",
          "Absolutely beautiful. Romantic location, incredible view and a large number of unique art pieces on display. Can recommend journey by bike, it's a nice trip from town beside the beach",
          "Lovely gardens with feral cats and kittens. Seeing the artists studio was a treat. A bus stops outside so it's easy to get to. The tourist bus goers here too. A good cafe as well...",
          "I'm not mad on Miro but as I was staying nearby it was only polite to visit. It's worthwhile just for the artcitecture and pleasant gardens/ good cafe bar.",
          "WE were not told that we had arrived here on the Hop on Hop off bus so we returned by taxi but were able to take the HOHO bus back! We enjoyed the Miro gallery in Barcelona when we were there the year after the Olympic Games so were eager to see this foundation. Here we were",
          "Located just off the Porto Pi to Cala Mayor road up the hill at sign for Hotel Dahli and C/Joan de Saridakis. This is an excellent gallery representing the work of Joan Miro and the site includes his working studio and many works of art including paintings and artistic models.",
          "This place is worth the visit to see Miro' 's atelier, a unique experience that gets you into the artist's life. Not a typical museum!",
          "A great collection of paintings and sculptures, plus a chance to visit Miro's studios, enjoy the vistas he saw from this place, get closer to his creative process. The buildings are also very impressive and fit the nature of Miro's work extremely well.",
          "There is nothing not to like about this wonderful gallery. Interesting collection of paintings , drawings, tapestries and sculptures.. Fascinating look into Miro's earlier and later studios. Everything housed within beautiful architecture. Really nice little cafe serving",
          "Anyone who follows Miro's life would be inspired to see his home and the studio from which he worked when he lived in Palma. The contrast of his home, traditional in style, to his modern studio creates a dichotomous energy that can only work because they belong to Miro. They",
          "The collection of works includes paintings, drawings, sculptures and prints. The three unique buildings offer one of the most striking architectural ensembles on the island. Joan Mir\u00f3 used to live and work there.",
          "This place is a quiet and serene oasis surrounded by apartment blocks. The Gallery itself (reasonable entrance fee) is cool and spacious - an excellent showcase for Miro's work - paintings, wall-hangings and sculpture which is completely 'off the wall', quirky and fun.",
          "This gallery is a bit off the beaten track but if you like modern Art it's well worth the visit. Miro's paintings are vibrant and whilst simple and very stylised they ear well worth seeing. The gallery is housed in an amazingly designed building that shows off the art",
          "Miro museum in beautiful architectural building Museum in beautiful architecture specially build for the Miro legacy collection, don\u2019t miss the house Miro actually lived in and the studio which has also a beautiful architecture in and the don\u2019t miss this place if you like art.",
          "A little advertised, but essential visit while in Palma is the Fondacion Miro, located west of town. Besides some of his beautiful works one can see his studio as he left it and interesting sight. Also a unique studio building and some gardens.",
          "Just a delight! Spend as little or as long as you like. Good views too from the infinity pool. Good presentations.",
          "This gallery complex is outside the town. The leaflets say get the 3 or 46 bus. Get the 46 - it stops outside. We got the 3 which doesn't and had to hunt for it! You really get a feel for Miro here and I particularly enjoyed seeing the studios he worked in but I did feel a bit",

          "This is a great day out - a very enjoyable experience to see such an amazing art collection. We went by bus which was an incredible easy journey as it turned out. Don't miss it.",
          "This is a lovely museum, the art work displayed is obviously amazing but so is the environment. The location is beautiful, the workshops are so inspiring and the original house is just beautiful. There is sufficient history, data and background information available so you can",
          "What an experience seeing so much of his work in one place. Actually being at his studio and being able to peek in was amazing. The studio was left as he left it so you see it with canvasses and art supplies lying around. Do not miss it. It is a rare chance.",
          "It's a little difficult to find and the parking lot across from the museum is only marked 'private' and did not specify it was for the museum. The artist's works were interesting but I wish there was more explanation for the meaning of all his symbols. If you visit the small",
          "Very interesting to see this place where Miro actually lived and worked for so many years. Beautifully situated, wonderful houses. Only drawback was that it was rather hard to find your way among the different houses, very poor directions. Luckily, we found our way found in the",
          "An interesting building houses a small collection of Miro's work. It was quiet when we were there, so conducive to an unhurried and calm visit with no crowds jostling for a view. It is some way out of the city centre and not well sign posted. Take a number 46 bus from the",
          "Lovely small museum at a good price. Small collection, interesting architecture and personal interest in the artist is a great bonus and a good cafe as well. Excellent morning spent here, great atmosphere and feel for the area and the artist. Easy with a map or GPS to reach and",
          "The Miro museum is worth visiting. It is nice walk from hotels in Cala major and it is not too big. Also interesting to see the artist's ateljee and of course the paintings. The staff is very helpfull and kind. I recommend, it takes max 1,5-2 hrs.",
          "Really worth a visit for anyone with even a passing interest in Miro, Spanish art or interesting modern architecture and sculpture. Lovely little cafe too. See where Miro made his pieces. Recommended.",
          "We arrived on the bus (no 46) with high anticipation after seeing the Miro in Barcelona but were disappointed. The display of Miro's work was not very inspiring. The Centre was badly signposted and looked in need of some TLC especially in the grounds outside. If you go make",
          "walked to cala major from palma and took a detour to visit this place....up a hill but the sightseeing bus will stop there. A very informal atmosphere reasonably priced. Knew very little about Miro.........interesting!!!!",
          "The building was so good it almost took attention from the artworks displayed. Lots of Miro's 60s and 70s masterpieces, although not a chronological permanent collection. Great to see the inside of his studio too. The whole place feels almost like a small campus. Get there by",
          "Was such a treat to visit the Joan Miro gallery and studios. To see his paintings in person was amazing and even more interesting was able to see his studio and workshop on the premises and get an inside view of how he created his amazing works. At the south end of Palma you",
          "We were on an MSC Musica cruise and had read about the Joan Miro Museum as a place to go to get away from the 'tourist' spots. We caught a taxi from the terminal cost about 10 euro. The museum was very quiet, only us at one stage. It is just a super little museum with heaps of",
          "Unfortunately we were underwhelmed by all aspects of the Miro foundation. The grounds are unkempt, the lighting inside poor and the access to the studio and workshops limited. Go to admire the Miro art but don't expect a great art experience",
          "The exhibition is housed in a fabulous building. A work of art in itself. The sculptures are situated in the garden/terrace and surrounding grounds. The studio and villa with Miro's graffiti scrawled on the walls is a 'must see'.",
          "As a fan of Joan Miro, it was a privilege to visit his house and museum in Palma, Mallorca. To see his studio, his works, his house, was a wish comes true.",
          "A wonderful museum that was well worth a visit. Very close to our hotel. Lovely, air conditioned cafe bar - much needed as it was an extremely hot day. Loved the paintings and particularly sculptures. We had a picnic in a shady spot we found in the gardens - perfect.",
          "Very educative and inspiring museum providing a good insight into the live and works of Miro. The view over the sea and its coastline are an additional benefit. Easy to reach by bus.",
          "The art Gallery of the works of Miro are stunning as a building whether you like Miro's modernist style or not. His studio is also there and open to view which also is a \"Grand Design\" There was a complimentary exhibition of the works of Albers the bauhaus artist. I was",
          "We took the city bus to here (1.50 Euro) and it droped us off right at the front. The ride on the bus was nice because we got to city the city of Palma outside the center. The complex consists of Miro\u2019s actual workshops and a modern museum building that contains a lot of his",
          "The studio and farmhouse are stunning; the new gallery that houses the foundation is beautiful as is the immediate setting and garden and simple cafe. Alas, the area has been built up. Ignore that and enjoy the atmosphere and the uncanny feeling that the studio has been left for",
          "What I liked best about this museum was to be able to see the two buildings where Miro worked. One was his painting studio and the other one was the building for his sculptures. The museum itself has some good paintings by Miro, but the best museum for his work is the Miro",
          "A little out of the way but on the tourist bus after castle. Great set of sculptures paintings and.drawings by both Joan.Miro Jorge Albers. Nice little cafe with a little gang of cats for.company.",
          "Rather out of the way; we went on bike and although slightly losing our way found it in the end. Situated in what looks like a large social housing complex it is, as one might expect, a lovely building set in a really nice garden. The expedition we saw was great, if your not a",
          "If you like the work of famous Mallorqu\u00edn artist Joan Mir\u00f3, then This is surely a \"must see\" on your travel agenda and makes a change from the beach! Excellent for winter visitors on a grey day (yes, we get them here, too!!!) Both permanent and temporary exhibitions. WELL",
          "Very modern art gallery, and an opportunity to see the studios where Miro worked. Also some interesting pieces in the gardens by Miro",
          "Interesting and attractive place. Have been a couple of times and enjoyed it. Will be going again. Caf\u00e9 pretty dreadful though.",
          "A word of warning - this is not easy to find if you are under your own steam. We had initially hoped to use our sat nav, but, as it couldn't find satellites, we looked up directions online and noted down the names of the roads we needed (i.e. Ma-20, Ma-1c, etc.). However,",
          "There is a 6 \u20ac entrance fee, but it is needed only for some rooms. You can see the majority of the fundacio for free! It has a very nice surroundings and a panoramic view. There is also a nice coffee bar to relax and enjoy the visit!",

          "Ok, so this spot is a bit of a way out of Palma's city centre (not really within walking distance, even for the heartiest of hiking souls). But is it ever worth the bus trip! Fabulous wee gallery, lush gardens, and Miro's authentic studios. A must-see for any arts buff. And I",
          "I visited on a Saturday when admission is free and I enjoyed it. There is not much to it, but it was a pleasant way to start the day.",
          "I had hoped to see more of Miro's museum quality work so was disappointed at how little of his high quality work was on view. It was interesting seeing his studio but it was hard to get an idea of what it must have been like for him to work there as his studio, and the related",

          "Lots of Miro but especially good to see his studios almost as if he had just left a few minutes before.",
          "I absolutely love Miro so was very excited to be able to spend some time somewhere that he chose to live. I particularly liked seeing his drawings on the walls of his house. The indoor collection is very nice, although unfortunately there were about 60 school children running",
          "We took a number 3 bus to the bottom of the road. Up the hill is quite a steep climb if you are elderly, but definitely worth the climb. The paintings are quite Picasso like, with a definite Gaudi influence in his sculptures - I am a fan of Guadi. Worth visiting the cinema",
          "Easy to get to by bus, this place is a must-see in Palma. Fascinating collection of Joan Miro's art, both inside and in the garden. The view over Palma from the garden is beautiful! The cafeteria makes a very nice cup of coffee and delicious pastries!",

          "I had previously visited the Miro Foundation in Barcelona, which was disappointing. This was very much better, having a larger and more varied display of the author's work. Included is the studio in which Miro worked in later life, still containing a number of easels with work",
          "I recommend a half Day prior to your Visit geht some Info on the exhibit so you know what you are Looping at. I saw Similar miro paintings and arg in Barcelona already. Meutermedia",
          "A 2nd visit here after several years. One of the most famous 20th Century artists. We decided to take the bus, missed the stop, and had to go back . At the top of a hill his last residence, and studio, where many of his paintings are kept. A must do trip if you love art and",
          "While staying at the Mirablau Hotel in Cal Major, I was advised to walk up the hill to see the Foundation. A stunning modern building, it housed paintings and sculptures of Joan Miro as well as an insight into his life. Note that entrance is free on Saturdays!",
          "A short bus trip from Palma, this is a lovely place to visit if you are a Miro fan. The main exhibition area is beautifully curated with a fine selection of work and the Sert workshop is wonderful as is the house with Miro graffiti. Add a lovely garden walk with more scuptures",
          "Although not particularly a lover of Miro, I felt I needed to educate myself a little more about this icon of modern art and to try to understand more. I had the honour of being guided round by an expert from the Fundacio. It's not quite as representative as Barcelona, in that",
          "Worth the effort to find and good value at 6 euros entrance. Wonderful location which gives an great insight on Miro' lifestyle at home with fab Exhibition space to show his work. interesting Workshops, Art & Architecture, plus bonus of a lovely garden to enjoy in the sun.",
          "So representative of Joan Miro aesthetics, and so reminiscent of the Miro foundation in Barcelona although not so well maintained. Nevertheless, the exhibition was rich and very explanatory of the print processes the artist endorsed. Lovely selection of early works, a must see",
          "First visit was close to an earlier than usual closing so we just had a snack at their excellent cafe. Second visit was earlier so that we had time to enjoy the excellent museum and tour of Miro's studios. Unusual residential location, but it is well worth setting aside a few",
          "One of our principal reasons for subjecting ourselves to four days in Palma Nova and boy was it worth it. What should you mention first? The breathtaking architecture, ranging from traditional Majorcan, through high fifties modernism to the triumph of the recent main gallery;",
          "Very pleasant 2hour visit, seeing the location of Miro's home and workshop. VERY good value. Take a 46 bus from Palma... to right outside.",
          "If you are fond of Miro and in Palma this is a must see. There is also a beatyfull garden with a great view.",
          "Nice museum near cala major. Bus 3 and 40 and 46 stops down the hill about 300 meters from museum. Very beautiful site and garden and many nice paintings. Well worth visiting a couple of hours.",
          "It's located just outside Palma near Cala Mayor, accessible on the 46 bus or there is a car park for drivers. It's worth a visit for art lovers even if you're not keen on modern art. The site is beautiful and includes his studio and a nice walk around... not just a museum",
          "Empty and slightly removed from the town but plenty of Miro on show and the added advantage of seeing where he worked for the last 30 years or so of his life. Uplifting.",
          "Even though we stay for one week in Mallorca , this visit was so fantastic for the whole family , my 4 year old son likes Miro , and this House/ Studio is fantastic to grow in our cultural level. I trully recomend this .",
          "We thought the exhibition itself was rather mixed but he space, light and layout of the site were outstanding, The access to Miro's studio was particularly interesting.",
          "It's been 3 years since our last visit and it was every bit as moving as the first time. My husband and I were thrilled to return to Foundation in Mallorca, this time with with our teenage boys. We are huge fans of Miro's work and have had the opportunity to see it in a number",
          "I hadn't realised the breadth and depth of Miro's work. The museum is excellent with commentaries in English as well as Spanish. The studio space is lovely and the cafe does drinks and light snacks. Not easy to find, but worth the effort. The 46 bus goes past it, or there is a",
          "I spent a pleasant hour at the Miro Foundation, although it was a bit of a trek from the centre of Palma! It was good to stand where the great man stood and explore his working environment. The architecture was impressive too. However, I found the quality of work on show",
          "Interesting art institution outside Centra of Palma. A bit difficult to find but beatifully situated with a fantastisc view of the sea. Many wonderful coulorful paintings done by Miro. I loved it",

          "The museum was not so easy to found, I took a taxi. Later I found out bus 46 (a circular line from the centre of Palma) stops 150 meters down on Saridakis road (close to Cala Mayor). The museum is not only the modern building (by Rafael Moneo), it\u2019s also Miros old workshop,",
          "Reasonably entry fee of \u20ac6. Obviously art is a personal thing but I imagine this would appeal to most folk whether they are in to fin/modern art or not. Just don't try to walk to this place - get a taxi.",
          "Beautifully appointed overlooking the bay of Palma, \"La Fundaci\u00f3 Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3 a Mallorca\" is both a gallery and museum, dedicated to the work of Miro and Mallorca. Highlights (for me) include the exquisite gallery and the opportunity to see the studio and house - to see",

          "Costs about \u20ac4 entrance, takes about 20mins to see. Go to see the wor of Rodin and Dali. Worth a stop if you're in the area.",
          "The Miro Foundation is not easy to get to. If travelling on the No 3 bus from Palma, get off at Palau Marivent (the Kings, closed, palace by the sea) & walk up Saridakis, the hill opposite. The No 50 Tourist hop-on hop-off bus and the No 46 go right past the entrance. When we",
          "We had been to see some of Miro's work at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park and were inspired to see the \"home\" they had come from. Fortunately it was located quite near to our hotel (Luabay Marivent) so a gentle walk was all that was needed. Well worth the effort. Easy to spend",
          "The Fundacio Miro is an absolute must-see for art lovers. Miro lived and worked here from 1956 to 1983- his large studio is here, a graffiti-filled studio nearby, and a separate beautifully curated museum of Miro's paintings, prints and sculptures is just dazzling.",
          "A couple of miles outside Palma, accessible by public transport and a walk up a steep hill. Based in Miro's studio-home-workshop. Masses of his work on display, inside and out. Delightful gardens - empty when we went - and interesting buildings all looking across to the sea. A",

          "Very beautifull place for all who likes modern art (painting and sculpture) and rest out of city. Situated near Cala Major. You can go to this museum by city bus from the centre of Palma (about half an hour from the centre). Museum (house and studio of Miro) is situated in the",

          "This gallery/museum is such a treat. I was there many years ago and it has enlarged and improved remarkably. I agree with all other reviews and will suffice to say it is well worth a visit. The woman at the ticket desk was extremely helpful. We caught a taxi out (save the steps)",
          "Situated slightly out of the centre of Palma on a hill the site displays a good range of Miro's work and also has his studios to view although you look in rather than walk around (understandable with valuable artwork lying around!). The studios are at the top if the hill so be",

          "I wasn't as keen as my wife on Miro's work, so went along more out of loyalty - and how glad I am that I did. The foundation is dedicated to showing his works, and working life, and does so very effectively. To see so much of his work so sympathetically displayed had a profound",
          "The foundation occupies the site of studios used by Joan MIro when he was living and working in Majorca. There is a decent modern building below the studios in which there is an enjoyable exhibition of some of Miro's work, a cafe and a shop. The range of cafe food is limited",
          "I still don't know if Miro (and Picasso) were great artists or great con merchants. Either way elegant art and architecture with nice gardens too. The bus stop is Marivent and a short walk up the hill. Pensioners half price too!",

          "Worth the visit- take a taxi or bus. Once you are there, the grounds are lovely to walk around. My only criticism is that it could provide more information about Miro and his life. Although there was some info around, it was minimal and assumes you already know alot about Miro",
          "Joan (Juan/John) Miro purchased the building in 1959, that now houses the Miro Foundation & Museum. This was his second studio and eventually became his primary residence, where he lived until his death. The collection of statues and the architecture of the building is worth",

        "wiki": "Palma, unofficially known as Palma de Mallorca ( or , Catalan: [\u02c8palm\u0259], Spanish: [\u02c8palma]), is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands in Spain. It is situated on the south coast of Mallorca on the Bay of Palma. The Cabrera Archipelago, though widely separated from Palma proper, is administratively considered part of the municipality. As of 2018, Palma Airport serves over 29 million passengers per year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPalma was founded as a Roman camp upon the remains of a Talaiotic settlement. The city was subjected to several Vandal raids during the fall of the Western Roman Empire, then reconquered by the Byzantine Empire, then colonised by the Moors (who called it Medina Mayurqa) and, in the 13th century, by James I of Aragon.\n\n\n=== Roman period ===\nAfter the conquest of Mallorca, the city was loosely incorporated into the province of Tarraconensis by 123 BC; the Romans founded two new cities: Palma on the south of the island, and Pollentia in the northeast \u2013 on the site of a Phoenician settlement. Whilst Pollentia acted as a port to Roman cities on the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, Palma was the port used for destinations in Africa, such as Carthage, and Hispania, such as Saguntum, Gades and Carthago Nova. Though present-day Palma has no significant remains from this period, occasional archaeological finds are made in city centre excavations.  For example, the remains of the Roman Wall can be seen at Can Bordils, the Municipal Archive, and below it, at the Maim\u00f3 ben Faraig Center.\n\n\n=== Byzantine period ===\nThough the period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Muslim conquest is not well understood (due to lack of documents), there is clear evidence of a Byzantine presence in the city, as indicated by mosaics found in the oldest parts of the Cathedral, which was in early medieval times part of a paleo-Christian temple.\n\n\n=== Muslim period ===\nBetween 902 and 1229, the city was under Islamic control. It remained the capital of the island and it was known as Medina Mayurqa, which in Arabic means \"City of Majorca\".\n\n\n==== Under the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba ====\nThe arrival of the Moors in the Balearic Islands occurred at the beginning of the 8th century. During this period, the population developed an economy based on self-sufficiency and piracy, and even showed evidence of a relative hierarchy. The dominant groups took advantage of the Byzantine withdrawal due to Islamic expansion across the Mediterranean, to reinforce their domination upon the rest of the population, thus ensuring their power and the gradual abandonment of Imperial political structures.\nIn 707, a Muslim fleet, under the command of Abd Allgaht ibn Musa, son of the governor of Ifriqiya, Musa ibn Nusayr, stopped off at the island. It appears that Abd Allah convinced the powers of the city to accept a peace treaty. This treaty was granted in exchange for a tax, respect for social, economic and political structures to the communities that subscribed to it, as well as the continuity of their religious beliefs.\nAfter 707, the city was inhabited by Christians who were nominally in allegiance to the sovereignty of the Umayyad Caliphate, yet who, de facto, enjoyed absolute autonomy. The city, being in Mallorca, constituted an enclave between western Christian and Islamic territories, and this attracted and encouraged increased levels of piracy in the surrounding waters. For wide sectors of the city's population, the sacking of ships (whether Muslim or Christian) which passed through Balearic waters was a source of riches over the next fifteen decades. Eventually, continued piracy in the region lead to a retaliation by Al-Andalus which launched a naval fleet against the city and the whole of the Islands.\nThe Islands were defended by the emperor Charlemagne in 799 from a Muslim pirate incursion.\nIn 848 (maybe 849), four years after the first Viking incursions had sacked the whole island, an attack from C\u00f3rdoba forced the authorities to ratify the treaty to which the city had submitted in 707. As the city still occupied an eccentric position regarding the commerce network established by the Moors in the western Mediterranean, the enclave was not immediately incorporated into Al-Andalus.\nWhile the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba reinforced its influence upon the Mediterranean, Al-Andalus increased its interest in the city. The consequence of this was the substitution of the submission treaty for the effective incorporation of the islands to the Islamic state. A squad under the command of Isam al-Jawlani took advantage of instability caused by several Viking incursions and disembarked in Mallorca, and after destroying any resistance, incorporated Mallorca, with Palma as its capital, to the C\u00f3rdoban state.\nThe incorporation of the city into the Emirate set the basis for a new society. Commerce and manufacturing developed in a manner that was previously unknown. This caused considerable demographic growth, thereby establishing Medina Mayurqa as one of the major ports for trading goods in and out of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba.\n\n\n==== D\u00e9nia\u2014Balearic taifa (1015\u20131087) ====\n\nThe Umayyad regime, despite its administrative centralisation, mercenary army and struggle to gain wider social support, could neither harmonise the various ethnic groups inside al-Andalus nor dissolve the old tribes which still organised sporadic ethnic fighting. During the 11th century, the Caliphate's control waned considerably. Provinces broke free from the central Cordoban administration, and became effectively sovereign states \u2014 taifas \u2014 under the same governors that had been named by the last Umayyad Caliphs. According to their origin, these \"taifas\" can be grouped under three broad categories: people of Arab, Berber or Slavic origin.\nPalma was part of the taifa of D\u00e9nia. The founder of this state was a client of the Al-Mansur family, Muyahid ibn Yusuf ibn Ali, who could profit from the progressive crumbling of the Caliphate's superstructure to gain control over the province of D\u00e9nia. Subsequently, Muyahid organised a campaign throughout the Balearic Islands to consolidate the district and incorporated it into their \"taifa\" in early 1015.\nDuring the following years Palma became the main port from where attacks on Christian vessels and coasts could be launched. Palma was the base from where a campaign against Sardinia was launched between 1016 and 1017, which caused the Pisans and Genoese forces to intervene. Later, this intervention set the basis for Italian mercantile penetration of the city.\nThe Denian dominion lasted until 1087, a period during which the city, as well as the rest of the islands, was relatively peaceful. Their supremacy at sea was still not rivalled by the Italian merchant republics, thus there were few external threats.\n\n\n==== Balearic Taifa (1087\u20131115) and Western Mediterranean ====\nThe Banu Hud conquest of D\u00e9nia and its incorporation to the Eastern district of the taifa of Zaragoza meant the destruction of the legacy of Muyahid. The islands were freed from mainland dominion and briefly enjoyed independence, during which Medina Mayurqa was the capital.\nThe economy during this period depended on both agriculture and piracy. In the latter 11th century, Christian commercial powers took the initiative at sea against the Muslims. After centuries of fighting defensively in the face of Islamic pressure, Italians, Catalans and Occitans took offensive action. Consequently, the benefits of piracy diminished causing severe economic stress on the city.\nThe clearest proof of the new ruling relation of forces, from 1090, is the Crusade organised by the most important mercantile cities of the Christian states against the Islands. This effort was destined to finally eradicate Muslim piracy mainly based in Palma and surrounding havens. In 1115, Palma was sacked and later abandoned by an expedition commanded by Ramon Berenguer III the Great, count of Barcelona and Provence, which was composed of Catalans, Pisans and other Italians, and soldiers from Provence, Corsica, and Sardinia, in a struggle to end Almoravid control.\nAfter this, the Islands became part of the Almoravid dynasty. The inglobement of all the taifa to a larger state helped to re-establish a balance along the frontier that separated western Christian states from the Muslim world.\n\n\n==== Period of the Banu Ganiya (1157\u20131203) ====\nThe situation changed in the mid-12th century, when the Almoravids were displaced from al-Andalus and western Maghreb by the Almohad. Almoravid dominions, from 1157 on, were restricted to the Balearic Islands, with Palma again acting as the capital, governed by Muhammad ibn Ganiya. Massive arrival of al-Andalus refugees contributed to reinforce the positions of the last Almoravid legitimatists, the Banu Ganiya, who, conscious of their weakness in the Western Mediterranean context, started to get closer to the growing powers represented by Italian maritime republics. Genoa and Pisans obtained in this period their first commercial concessions in the city and the rest of the islands.\nThe Banu Ganiya, taking advantage of the great loss suffered by Abu Yuqub Yusuf in the Siege of Santar\u00e9m, attacked Ifriqiya, where the Almohad dominion had not been consolidated yet, in the same year. However, this attack was repelled and the Almohad authorities encouraged anti-Almoravid revolts in the Islands. The city was captured by the Almohads in 1203.\n\n\n=== Christian reconquest and late Middle Ages ===\n\nOn 31 December 1229, after three months of siege, the city was reconquered by James I of Aragon and was renamed Ciutat de Mallorca (Mallorca City). In addition to being kept as capital of the Kingdom of Majorca, it was given a municipality that comprised the whole island. The governing arm was the University of the City and Kingdom of Majorca.\nAfter the death of James I of Aragon, Palma became joint capital of the Kingdom of Majorca, together with Perpignan. His son, James II of Majorca, championed the construction of statues and monuments in the city: Bellver Castle, the churches of St. Francesc and St. Domingo, reformed the Palace of Almudaina and began the construction of the Cathedral of Majorca.\n\nIn 1391, anti-Jewish riots broke out. The Jewish community of Inca was completely wiped out, as were those of S\u00f3ller, Sineu, and Alcudia. In spite of the governor's prohibition on leaving the island, many Jews fled to North Africa. The remaining Jews were forced to convert under threat of death.Abraham Cresques was a 14th-century Jewish cartographer of the Majorcan cartographic school from Palma; Cresques is credited with the authorship of the famous Catalan Atlas.\nThe river that cut through the city gave rise to two distinct areas within the city; the \"Upper town\" and \"Lower town\", depending upon which side of the river one was situated.\n\nThe city's advantageous geographical location allowed it extensive commerce with Catalonia, Valencia, Provence, the Maghreb, the Italian republics and the dominions of the Great Turk, which heralded a golden age for the city.\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, the Rebellion of the Brotherhoods (a peasant uprising against Charles V's administration) and the frequent attack of Turkish and Berber pirates caused a reduction of commercial activities and a huge inversion in defensive structures. As a consequence, the city entered a period of decadence that would last till the end of the 17th century.\n\n\n=== 17th to 19th centuries ===\n\nThe 17th century was characterised by the division of the city into two sides or gangs, named Canamunts and Canavalls (from Majorcan Catalan \"the ones from the upper/lower side\"), with severe social and economic repercussions. During this period, the port became a haven for pirates. During the last quarter of the century, the Inquisition continued its persecution of the city's Jews, locally called xuetes.\nThe fall of Barcelona in 1714 meant the end of the War of the Spanish Succession and the defeat and destruction of the Crown of Aragon, and this was reflected on the Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip V of Spain in 1715. These occupation decrees changed the government of the island and separated it from the municipality's government of Palma, which became the official city name. By the end of the 19th century, the name  Palma de Mallorca was generalised in written Spanish, although it is still colloquially named Ciutat (\"city\") in Catalan. In the 18th century Charles III of Spain removed interdiction of commerce with Spanish colonies in America and the port and commercial activity of the city grew once again.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Palma became a refuge for many who had exiled themselves from the Napoleonic occupation of Catalonia and Valencia; during this period freedom flourished, until the absolutist restoration. With the establishment of contemporary Spanish state administrative organization, Palma became the capital of the new Balearic Islands province in the 1833 territorial division of Spain. The French occupation of Algeria in the 19th century ended the fear of Maghrebi attacks in Majorca, which favoured the expansion of new maritime routes, and consequently, the economic growth of the city.\n\n\n=== Modern period ===\n\nSince the advent of mass tourism in the 1950s, the city has been transformed into a tourist destination and has attracted many workers from mainland Spain. This has contributed to a huge change in the city's traditions, its language, and its economic power.\nThe boom in tourism has caused Palma to grow significantly. In 1960, Mallorca received 500,000 visitors, in 1997 it received more than 6,739,700. In 2001 more than 19,200,000 people passed through Son Sant Joan airport near Palma, with an additional 1.5 million coming by sea.\nIn the 21st century, urban redevelopment, by the so-called Pla Mirall (English \"Mirror Plan\"), had attracted groups of immigrant workers from outside the European Union, especially from Africa and South America.\nMore than half of the population works in tourism, approximately 80%, therefore being the main economic portal of Palma. Tourism has affected the rapid economic growth of Palma, making the island of Mallorca wealthier compared to other regions in Spain.\nThe second economic portal of Palma is agriculture. Main exports of Palma's agriculture are, almonds, oranges, lemons and olives. The island is also gifted with a wide variety of natural resources, such as mines of copper, lead and marble.The city also has several surrounding neighborhood communities including Establiments, Nord, Son Espanyol, Ces Cases Noves, and Sa Creu Vermella.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPalma is a major city and seaport located in the southwest of Mallorca, a western mediterranean island belonging to the Balearic Islands archipelago. The land area of the city is about 21.355 square kilometres (8.245 sq mi) with an altitude of 13 metres (43 feet) above sea level.\nThe city center of Palma is located north of the homonymous bay (Badia de Palma in the local Catalan language). The area that extends eastwards is mostly a flat fertile plain known as Es Pla. To the north and west, the city borders the Serra de Tramuntana, the island's major mountain range and a Unesco World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs of the 2009 census, the population of the city of Palma proper was 401,270, and the population of the entire urban area was 550,000, making it the twelfth largest urban area of Spain. By the start of 2019 the population of the city had risen to 416,065. Almost half of the total population of Mallorca lives in Palma.\nAs of 2017 over 60,000 non-Spanish foreigners registered with the town hall lived in Palma; the registered foreign population from 2016 to 2017 declined by 832, the numerically highest decline in the Balearics.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPalma has a Mediterranean climate, the climate classification named after the sea surrounding the city. There is a significant maritime influence to the mild winters, but summers are warmed by the surrounding continental landmasses. These warm up the offshore sea surface temperatures compared to in an ocean and as a result the small confines of Mallorca are still able to build up and sustain heat in spite of being on an island. There is vast seasonal lag, especially in late summer courtesy of the sea water peaking in temperatures long after the summer solstice.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya ===\nThe Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya is the transport hub of Palma. The Estaci\u00f3 Intermodal caters for buses and trains (the latter controlled by TIB). The two old buildings are home to the tourist information centre and several caf\u00e9s sit either side of the two large escalators which lead into the Estaci\u00f3, which sits underneath a large and popular park. On the lawns are several glass boxes, which let in light and ventilation to the station below ground. There are also train-themed playing structures, each one shaped like a train carriage and named after towns along the line of the Ferrocarril de S\u00f3ller, a railway dating back to 1911 which has its Palma Station right next to the park. Just down the street from here a new bus station is under construction. At the centre of the plaza is a statue of James I, Conquistador of Majorca.\n\n\n=== Cathedral area ===\n\nPalma is famous for La Seu, its vast cathedral built on a previous mosque which was built atop an original Christian church. Although construction of the present Cathedral began in 1229, it did not finish until 1601. Local architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed was drafted in to restore the building in 1901. The Parc de la Mar (Park of the Sea) lies just south, overlooked by the great building which sits above it on the city's stone foundations. Between the two are the town walls.\n\n\n=== The Rocks ===\nThe rocks located a short walk from the cathedral are a place of calm and tranquility.\n\n\n=== Old city ===\n\nThe Old City (in the south-east area of Palma behind the cathedral) is a maze of streets clearly hinting at an Arab past. With the exception of a few streets and squares which allow traffic and are populated with tourists most of the time, the walkways of this city quarter are fairly narrow, quiet streets, surrounded by a diverse range of interesting buildings, the architecture of which is comparable to cities such as Florence. The majority are private houses, some of which are open to the public as discreet museums or galleries. The Old City is also home to the Ajuntament (or Town Hall), the Convent of the Cathedral and the Banys \u00c0rabs.\n\n\n==== Banys \u00c0rabs ====\n\nThe Banys \u00c0rabs, or Arab Baths, one of the few remnants of Palma's Moorish past , are accessed via the quiet Ca'n Serra street near the Convent of the Cathedral, and include the lush gardens of Ca'n Fontirroig, home to Sardinian warblers, house sparrows, cacti, palm trees and a wide range of flowers and ferns. The small two-roomed brick building that once housed the baths is of Byzantine origin, dating back to the 11th century and possibly once part of the home of a Muslim nobleman. The bathroom has a cupola with five oculi which let in dazzling light. The twelve columns holding up the small room were pillaged from an earlier Roman construction. The floor over the hypocaust has been worn away by people standing in the centre, mainly to photograph the entrance and the garden beyond it. The whole room is in a rather dilapidated condition. The other room is a brick cube with a small model of the baths as they once were in the corner.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nNotable people who were born in the city include the following individuals.\n\n\u00c1lex Abrines, basketball player for the Oklahoma City Thunder\nMarco Asensio, footballer for Real Madrid\nConcha Buika, singer\nRudy Fern\u00e1ndez, basketball player for Real Madrid\nRamon Llull, philosopher and writer\nJorge Lorenzo, motorcyclist and five time MotoGP champion\nJoan Mir, motorcyclist and moto 3 champion\nGuillermo Pont, footballer\nLuis Salom, motorcyclist\nAgust\u00ed Villaronga, filmmaker\nRossy de Palma, actress\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nFootball is the most popular sport on the island, led by the Palma-based Segunda Divisi\u00f3n club Real Mallorca, who play at the Estadi de Son Moix, and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B club CD Atl\u00e9tico Baleares.\nBasketball is also a popular sport. Palma's top team is CB Bah\u00eda San Agust\u00edn, which plays its home games at the 5,076 capacity Palau Municipal d'Esports Son Moix.\nBecause of its maritime location all sea sports have also a big presence in Palma. Maybe the most important sporting event in the city is the Ciutat de Palma Prizes.\nRoad cycling is very popular in Mallorca. An international race for professional cyclists, the Vuelta a Mallorca, is held in February, the first day of which consists of a circuit race around the streets of Palma. The city is also home to the Palma Arena, a multi-platinum venue featuring a velodrome. The arena also hosted the Battle of Surfaces tennis event.\nIn June 2016, the city of Palma participated in the First World Company Sports Games which included five days of culture, sport and inclusivity within the community of Mallorca as a whole. It was operated through the World Federation Company Sport and was promoted for both local people and tourists to come together in the city. It became a large business venture by offering packages including accommodations close to the events and additional tourism information for future events.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPalma de Mallorca Metro\nMajorca rail network\nPalma de Mallorca Airport\nThe city bus system, which includes a loop line through the historic centre, is run by the EMT (See external link below).\nThere is also a bus system run by the TIB. This includes routes to and from the municipalities Calvi\u00e0 and Palma.\nIn the City of Palma there is a fleet of 1246 taxis. All equipped with air conditioning and most of them have a radiotelephone station, with four existing companies: Taxis Palma Radio, Radio-Taxi Ciutat, Taxi Tel\u00e9fono and Taxis adapted for users with reduced mobility. Until the change of colour regulated through the Municipal Decree No. 19985 of 15 October 1999, the taxis of Palma for 50 years had been of the characteristic black and ivory colours. Currently they are white.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nPalma de Mallorca is twinned with:\n\n Naples, Italy\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDuchess of Palma de Mallorca\nEdwin Lewis Snyder, \"Spain's Magic Island\", The Architect and Engineer, 110:10, 37\u201345, August 1932\nList of municipalities in Balearic Islands\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPalma sightseeing guide\nPalma de Mallorca\u00b4s city council\nOfficial Website for Tourism in Mallorca",

          "I have been to more exciting garden centres.. not much to see, although the fee to enter is relatively small (\u20ac2.50), I still believe you could better spend your money",
          "Well signposted in the immediate area and only \u20ac2.50 entrance fee. Interesting in that these are thought to be the small private baths of a wealthy family used for themselves and their friends rather that the larger baths that seem to have survived in other places. Once you",
          "Incredibly old -10th century- remains. 2 Euro 50 entrance fee. A very prettily planted courtyard with some seating. Only two rooms to look at, but well preserved. Short video in Spanish, English and German.",
          "Worth the visit singe the ticket is only 2,50\u20ac. Couple of rooms and artefacts on the walls. Pretty little garden also.",
          "The Arab Baths are what remain of a 10th century bath house what was then the Arab city Medina Mayurqa which is now Palma. The baths are hidden back in the old part of town in a small street which is worth visiting as well. There are numeous signs that point the way. The baths",
          "Couldn't say we didn't expect more, but magnificant history behind this place is still enough to visit it. Great little garden in the middle of the building, great place to relax.",
          "Stopped off here during a day of walking around exploring Palma, disappointed there wasn't more to see here, however it was a great place for a drink and sit down. Not worth the 5 euro entry fee though.",
          "This bath we found in a little street with an entrance of 2,5 euro. To relax after walking is possible inside where a nice garden is located. Inside of the bath is to see its history and who knows what hammam is, will have the opportunity to see other historic perspective of",
          "This place is not so well advertised, but it is so worth it! The bath themselves are not very big, just a couple of rooms, which are beautifully conserved. The inner garden adds to this special place. Many plants are offering a lovely view and if you are lucky there may be even",
          "A small garden set in the back streets. Peaceful and secluded ,bring your lunch and have a rest.....",
          "This is a most interesting place steeped in history and interest well worth a visit. The gardens around the bath house are very tranquil.",
          "This is right in the centre of Palma but you may be underwhelmed by the entrance and lack of commercialisation but this makes it worth the visit. It\u2019s a little oasis with a garden area and the original baths. There\u2019s some seating and if you want time to reflectthen this May well",
          "Really enjoyed visiting the Arab baths it was tiny but really worth seeing & only 2-3 euros to go in it had a lovely little garden with seating lots of history.",
          "quite nice place. You have to pay less than 5 EUR per person. I think it was 3. There is a small garden with some interesting plants as well",
          "This small enchanted garden is a hidden oasis a few steps from the cathedral. There was a musician in the garden who made the visit unique. The anique Arab baths, very small but full of charm",
          "Quite hard to find but worth persevering as this is a lovely little building with an interesting history. It sits in a tiny shady garden which, when we visited had a musician playing a beautiful hand drum creating a highly appropriate atmosphere to the moorish baths.",
          "Was nice to see something so old and preserved but a little disappointing at the same time. Expected to see a sunken square bath in the floor, was 12 stone pillars in a domed room.",
          "Nice garden with a few archaeological finds in little rooms. The garden is well looked after and relaxing but seats are all taken and fills up quickly so you cannot take your time to enjoy it. For this reason I don't think it's worth the price. I would have expected a box for",
          "A great place to walk about and look at the Arab Baths. Equally you can just sit in the court yard in the shade of some amazing planting and relax.",
          "It\u2019s cool because it\u2019s so old but it was literally one room of ruins. It was cheap to enter but I\u2019d skip it and eat more tapas :)",
          "Pretty gardens and interesting ruins. Half an hour is enough time to see this attraction. It is cheap to get in.",
          "These ancient baths are located in the lovely maze of streets of the medieval quarter near the church. For your money you get a short video, the baths and a lovely little garden. Well worth a visit and the wander around the old city to get there.",
          "Not much to see here but for 2.50 euros it was interesting and the little walled garden had a few seats and was calm and peaceful there was a man playing music it was very pleasant until he told us off because he thought we were filming him obviously because he had his bowl out",
          "We were passing the Arab Baths so we decided to have a look. It was only \u20ac2.50. Not much to see really but it was interesting none the less. There\u2019s a beautiful courtyard outside where there was tables and chairs so we decided to sit for a while. In the courtyard there was a",
          "Located in the old city, this place is not very visible but there are indications how to get there. The ticket costs Eur 2,50. The visit takes a short time but it is nice then to sit in the quiet garden. I went around 2pm and there were very few visitors. I'd suggest to go if",
          "It costs only 2.50\u20ac to enter inside, and you get to see an amazing garden, peaceful place, the old building which gives you an amazing experience! Worth seeing it.",
          "At only \u20ac2.50 per adult is worth popping in. Nice little garden and video in english/spanish/German talking about the baths.",
          "If you like a tranquil place to sit for a little while, do seek out Banys Arabs. It is located in Career de Can Serra, off of Passeig Salt Murada although a map would be useful as there are many other places of interest in the area. When we visited it was quiet and very",
          "Although not very large, extremely old and interesting tucked away in a back street in Palma. Good value at 2.50\u20ac admission.",
          "Visted on 12/6/18. 2.5 euros per adult entry cost. Is a very quiet and small area from Arab times. Not much to see about from garden area and the old original baths, but it is worth visiting just to sit and a=have some time relaxing and thinking. Best time to visit is early",
          "10th century Arab bAths . Found down a little side street but worth the visit when you discover it.. smAll but the history is fascinating. The construction so clever and beautiful ceiling . Read the description and get the full facts . Wonderful still there after all those",
          "The name is misleading as there is no water here, simply the remains of the former Arab Baths. Despite this, the gardens in which the Baths are located are delightful and an ideal spot for rest and reflection. There is a small entrance charge.",
          "Although this is only a small place to visit and you will only stay around 30-40 mins it is well worth it, wander through the little narrow streets from the direction of the Cathedral. There is a small cover charge but worth it, a short video and lovely little peaceful garden",
          "These baths make a great small attraction. It\u2019s quite small (did I mention that?) - probably only takes 30 mins to look around tops - but the entry price of \u20ac2.50 made it reasonable value for money. There was a short video (available in several languages), the three steam bath",
          "A small site with a lovely garden & well preserved Arab architecture. We were lucky the place was quiet on our visit so had time to appreciate the surroundings. A nice walk as well from Palma cathedral through the alleys of the old town. Worth a visit.",
          "It doesn\u2019t take long, perhaps 10 minutes, to walk the gardens, discover the baths themselves and read the limited description of the history. Given the history of Palma it is a shame that only these baths remain to offer a glimpse of Medina Mayurqa, and, if for no other reason,",
          "It might be small but it makes a point. Palma has a history of the moors and this is a living proof of the era. The garden is beautiful oasis in the stone city and equally interesting as the baths alone. it is interesting how this was never pulled down and the stones re-used",
          "As I believe, these are the only remaining buildings from the Arab occupation of the islands. Although small, you can see how they were used, and how the Arabs resused the stones from Roman buildings. This is a very quiet and tranquil spot and I\u2019m sure it would be lovely in",
          "This is a short walk from the waterfront through the old town of Palma. There is a 2.50 Euro entrance fee. The bath itself is an a bit of a state of disrepair but if you are an archaeological buff it is worth seeing. The gardens are quite nice as well.",
          "We checked the website opening hours before walking to the arab baths, as it was a bit of a trek and our last day in Palma, a Tuesday in January. We followed the helpful signs throughout the windy streets and arrived at about 10.30am. It was shut. No sign or explanation or",
          "For the ridiculously low entry fee of 2.5 Euros each, you get to see a fascinating relic of a bygone era, with some lovely architectural features, as well as sit and daydream in a small but beautiful garden for as long as you like (or until they throw you out at the end of the",
          "Small but interesting place where you can see the remains of an Arab bathhouse which are the last remains in Palma of Arab occupation. There is a small quiet garden and some rooms from the former Arab Baths A short video shows the history of the place It takes about 20",
          "A two-bit private operation that should be a significant piece of the island's history, but sorely neglected. Very hard to find in the winding streets, it consists of 2 ill-preserved rooms off a courtyard surrounded by a bunch of pretty plants. Costs 2.5 Euros, no senior",
          "Lovely gardens and very old baths. Not maintained to the standard of other Arab baths we have visited but a pleasant area.",
          "The Arab Baths are down a quiet street in the Arab Quarter of the city. The gardens themselves are not the biggest but it's a little slice of tranquil peace and quiet. The actual baths are a step back in time. It's worth the trip, although you'll only be in there for about",
          "Well worth a visit. Interesting and courtyard garden to walk around and admire the plants. Toilets are also located here. We spent about 30 mins here",
          "I must confess I thought it would be bigger, small entrance fee\u20ac2.50, but still not worth it. Interesting just not a lot too it.",
          "We spent a lovely couple of hours here in these interesting, quiet and tranquil gardens. Really recommend a visit.",
          "Because you need to pay small fees to get inside, its less crowded. Real Oasis. Very well preserved.",
          "A real insight into what Palma might have been like a thousand years ago. Well-preserved, authentic bath house in lovely small garden, with fascinating accompanying film about the Arab lord whose house this was.",
          "You can explore this place in 10 minutes and that includes waiting for the video to roll round to the description in your language of choice. They could have made more of the history as there weren\u2019t enough artefacts or explanations. Strange kitchen area to one side of the",

          "Banys Arabs is a short walk East of the Cathedral in the Old Town area of Palma. The Old Town has lots of narrow windy alleyways nooks and crannies, with some beautiful buildings nestled around. The Arab Baths are well signposted and after a short walk from the Cathedral you",
          "Fascinating to see how the Romans and Arabs used the same technology for cleanliness and relaxation. These can be found all over Spain, but the Palma ones have a lovely quiet garden as a bonus. - And there are seats!",

          "Follow the well signposted route from the cathedral to find the last remains of the arab occupation of Palma. The gardens are delightful and there is a welcome drinks machine tucked away in one corner. Whilst we were there, there was a man playing a hand drum. The gentle music",
          "We more or less stumbled on these as we left the cathedral. They are fascinating and the gardens surrounding them are quiet and so peaceful. Good video giving the history and a real oasis of calm.",
          "Possibly the best \u20ac2.50 I spent in Mallorca! An oasis of cool calm in the hot bustling city. The Banys Arabs comprises a pleasant, shady garden with a 10 century private bath house. Take your time over this visit, sit and enjoy it.",
          "We visited the Arab Baths with our teenage children yesterday afternoon, having being recommended it by a family member. It was 2.50 E each, which is about the cheapest thing we did all holiday. Of course there's not a huge amount to see (it is a ruins), but the pillars in the",
          "If you are interested in history or architecture then this is a must! Small but perfectly formed with a lovely garden it it best suited to adults rather than families. When we visited there was a man playing an unusual instrument which was very relaxing.",
          "Very little left here to see, so you need to use your imagination. The garden / courtyard is small but pleasant enough for a short break especially in the heat of the day. It's worth watching the video for some context and background information about the Baths. Decent toilet",
          "It's interesting to see where the baths were. The view of the garden where the Arab Baths are located is beautiful.",
          "Nice walk when trying to find these but when you are finally in, after paying the entrance, there is nothing really to see... Rather focus on what is outside.",

          "There is not that much to see but everything (including the attached garden) is very beautiful. It's not very expensive either (2,50\u20ac / children free) so I recommend visiting if you're nearby.",
          "We paid 2,50 \u20ac/person to get in. I saw the images of the Garden online and thought I finally found a peaceful, green park where you can enjoy different plants and flowers, but everything is seen in 5 minutes and there is only one bath left you can visit. I expected more and I",
          "A lovely gem of a place. Not very big, really just the ancient steam room to see, but set I some lovely gardens. When we were there a guy was playing music in the garden, the sun was shining and it was so peaceful.",
          "The baths themselves are not really much to look at, but the small walled, garden with dappled shade is a delight and I found myself, just sitting and contemplating the day, despite having no intention of doing so. I then realised what a lovely place it would be to relax with a",

          "Nice place to see, but wasn't worth of money what cost to get it there. Difficult to find without good maps.",
          "Absolutely fascinating, well worth the entrance price, perhaps showing signs of being slightly neglected.",
          "Nice little place to visit,on reflection I'd not go out of my way to visit it,unless baths are your thing. There's not a great lot to see, but the gardens were nice and the ruins are interesting we stretched out the visit for 20min, 5 of it sat down. \u20ac2.50 to get in ain't bad",
          "This is a simple attraction but has something of the mystique of centuries of use. The baths are lovely and the little garden is worth a visit too.",
          "At Euros 2.50 per person, this is well worth a visit. Similar to an old Roman baths, it is well kept and has a beautiful courtyard garden, where sometimes there is a bar open but not on the Monday when we visited.",
          "Waste of 5 euros, no baths in sight just empty room, spent 5 minutes there and walked out, pointless attraction and waste of time and effort finding it",
          "it is an interesting place. You don't expect that in Palma. The information is also in English, and there is playing a film. Little garden.",
          "Lovely half hour spent in the tranquil baths. We sat in the garden and whiled away some time listening to the birds sing and the gardener clipping vegetation. It was nice to watch someone else maintaining a pretty garden and not doing it myself (at home that is). 2.5 euros a",
          "A lovely short visit to the baths. A few small rooms and a brief information board, Bellever Castle had more information about the baths. The gardens had seating both in shade and sun. There was a very well behaved school group visiting when we visited. It cost 2 euros 50 each",
          "If I just paid \u20ac5 for myself and my wife then that would have been ok. But to pay for my teenage kids as they were over 10 years (another \u20ac5) felt too much. You could be in and out of this attraction in 3 minutes. There is a small courtyard with palm trees and geraniums with a",
          "Worth a look at the Arab past, and not off the beaten track easy to walk to. Pretty central location",
          "For this city this is a nice small green pocket. But yes, it's small and the maintenance in the vegetation was poor, maybe it was to early in the season. But still a nice small historic garden.",
          "Follow the signs to this small attraction in the old town, not far from the cathedral. Amazing it's still here after so long! 9th century! The columns still hold up the original vaulted ceiling. TV with a brief description running in English, German and Spanish. Small sunny",
          "I expected something interesting or impressive, but really it was neither. It was a 5min visit and while the small garden area is relaxing, the baths themselves were far from impressive. For the very low entrance fee of 2.5 euros, if you want to see for yourself, go and have a",

          "Easy to find in the meandering streets of the old town by following the signs. Pay 2.50\u20ac entry for 20 mins peace in this little green oasis. Not much remains of the 9th C Arab baths but it is the last remnant of Muslim culture in the city. Well worth a look.",
          "The arab baths are well signposted in the old town of Palma. The entrance fee is 2.5 euros which includes a video presentation (Spanish/German/French/English) and a model of how the baths were originally built using the Roman underfloor heating approach. The building has great",
          "The site is small but very interesting and with a lovely garden. Going in February, we had the whole place to ourselves, which was just great. It is worth a visit!",
          "Unless you find yourself right around the corner, as we did, the Arab Baths are really not worth the visit. It's tiny, there are no baths, and there are no views.",
          "This is a well presented oasis, acting as a reminder of the cultures that have enjoyed all that Palma offers.",
          "It all depends on your expectations. The Arab baths, first of all were never baths, but more like a spa - hot and cold rooms with treatments. Often just private like these, they are small. This particular example gives a small window into the life of Palma during the Muslim era,",
          "We decide to find the actual Arabian baths and do . The walk to the, through ancient alley ways turn out to be the best part .We pay our a few euro and go inside. Just see a little square smelly room with a couple of stone jugs. The garden outside was better.",
          "It's a very nice little place with a pleasant tiny garden. It's really nice to sit down for some ten minutes in a shady garden. But there's not too much to see and learn",
          "Very few ruins left but the history of the baths speaks for it shelf. A giude can explain how the buildings were being used and how luxurious they were at the time. There is also a beautifully maintened garden outside where you can sit and relax.",
          "The Arab baths are accessed via a narrow entrance into a garden courtyard off which various rooms open. The gardens are pretty and there is plenty of places to sit. The antiquity of the boathouse is undoubted but there isn't any great explanation of what is what so you have to",
          "An interesting place to get a sense of history. Very small, even if you sit through a video that explains (Spanish, French, English and German) its history, it won't take more than 30 min to tour the entire place. If it's nice out and you have some time, you can just sit in a",
          "I wish there were more explicit explanations in each room. There was a movie explaining the baths, but afterwards, we wandered from basically empty room to basically empty room........I would have wanted to learn more.",
          "This is a small place to visit with some lovely pieces of old architecture - it is located in the middle of the town and very reasonable price to get in. It doesn't take long to get around the site, but it is worth a visit.",
          "Take a few minutes out to visit the baths tucked in a back in Palma. For a small charge view the remains of the baths and sit in the quiet garden enjoying the shade and calm. Not exciting or large but charming in their way",
          "Lovely garden setting for these old baths, the only Arabic structure extant in this town. Take a look at the columns in the baths, all are different.",
          "I was expecting to see some baths but the rooms just show the outline, and to help you visualise how it might have looked there is a video loop running to tell you about the history. It was a little disappointing but the gardens around the building were lovely, and it was a",
          "Hey if you happen to be in central palma/ old city and you are close by why not visit this place? Its only 2,50 Euros. Now, I actually thought I'd see some sort of pool but no, by baths they really mean this was used as a sauna. Its cool but nothing too impressive.",
          "We didn't even know about the Arab Baths in Palma, we just followed some street signs. It was a lovely surprise. A small walled garden and the Baths themselves were well worth the small entrance price.",
          "I wouldn't have searched for the Arab baths but it was well signposted from the cathedral and an interesting detour through the small streets of old Palma. Built on the same principles as Roman baths with a hot and cool room it's very well preserved. It clearly doesn't appeal to",
          "Nice garden and well maintained rooms, where you can see how life was so many years ago. It is a small place, don't expect an enourmous place to visit.",
          "A small area, 2 rooms and a garden but it's pretty and only 2.50 euros. Near the museum so a trip to both is a half day out.",
          "Unless you are a fan of the twee and quaint or a devotee of Arab Baths you may be disappointed for paying \u20ac2.50 to see this attraction. There is a small garden, and an even smaller bath house (room) and not much else. See it but don't expect the wow factor.",
          "I had never noticed this before but this time kept spotting the signs, and being nosy, I thought I'll see what this is. It was a true hidden gem, dating back tot he 10th century. So green, tranquil and quiet. It code 2.5 euros entrance but worth it to see the sheer history",
          "a quiet , lovely space in a busy city . Interesting video tells you the history of the building . Only 2.50euros admission , so tells you not very big.",
          "We kept following the signs sometimes they disappeared as back alleys take you on a journey, after just under 10 mins come to a small sign it is \u20ac2.5 entrance the bath areas are small but lovely peaceful garden, there is a drink machine, seating and decent toilets",
          "Based on TripAdvisor we visited this place. It has a beautiful garden and on one building you can see a arab arch above the entrance. Inside there is indeed a very old bathing area. All together not so impressive, but as it is one of the few if not the only arab heritage in",
          "There is not much left of the baths but there is a good video explaining their usage and in the main room it is easy to imagine them years ago. There is a sweet garden in the courtyard where you can rest awhile.",
          "A lovely glimpse of times past with remains of a bath house and a small peaceful garden with shady trees.",
          "This nice little gem is a little bit hidden, but I think was worth the walk and the 2EUR we paid. You can see the some of the rooms of the baths and then relax in the amazing gardens.",
          "It is a little bewildering that this is a tourist attraction. If this is all you need to charge gullible tourists money then I am flabergasted. It is literally a bit of a depression in a small stone build structure which takes seconds to take in. If you need to find peace and",
          "2 smallish rooms and a smallish garden. Can be seen n a couple of minutes. Expensive for the amount of time spent.",
          "I wouldn't recommend spending money to get in as there is not much to see. We were in and out within 5mins.",
          "High walls enclose these lush gardens and entry to the old Arab steam bath house. Nice break from the crowds.",
          "It's ok here to understand a bit of Palma history but hardly essential viewing. If you are in the area it is cheap to visit. Not worth a special effort.",
          "Easy to find by following the signs dotted around the cathedral area. This is a hidden gem - quiet, relaxing and with a beautiful garden to sit in.",
          "Charming and beautiful, this small and ancient Arab bath house is a cool and restful place to visit with a pretty garden attached.",
          "It's an interesting place, but quite small. You can visit a room that's formed like an orange with bulging ceiling and a couple of pillars holding it up, which was the actual bathing house. It's about 5x5 meters. Except that there is a garden outside of it. It's quite cheap,",
          "Interesting place to visit for a quick rest while in Palma. However a \u20ac2.5 entrance fee makes it a disappointment.",
          "A secluded, but awesome place in the heart of Mallorca. A unique atmosphere will enchant you with its garden and the ancients arabic ruins.",
          "Cost 2.5 euros to enter. Pretty gardens and interesting old baths, but only worth a 10 minute visit. Not worth a special visit",
          "Unless you are really bored or have an unnatural inclination towards Moorish architecture, I would suggest an ice-cream is a better bet for your 2.5 Euros. Fair enough, it is a tranquil corner, but the photos at the top of this page cover it entirely. You also get a short video",
          "Really interesting to see these Arab baths, right in the middle of the old quarter of Palma. The whole area is lovely to wander around although can be very hot in the summer",
          "I expected more per that price than just small park, wee room and nothing else. Better to spent these money for ice cream or whatever else.",
          "We first visited the Arab Baths on a trip to Palma in 2011, and were enchanted by it. This time, however, it appeared that there were less flowers and plants, and somehow lacked a bit of colour and charm, which wasn't helped by the bored, uninterested attitude of the ticket",

          "Although this place is small and won't take long to get around, it's worth a visit. The fact that it's is still standing is a marvel in its self. Just stand in the structure and consider the history of the place and the intelligence and engineering excellence of the Moors who",

          "Really interesting building that is full of history hidden away behind the cathedral. In truth though there are only two rooms to see but it is only \u20ac2 to enter. History is not well displayed. Small pretty garden that is crying out for a cafe.",

          "We love exploring the old Islamic parts of towns such as Palma - so many interesting buildings - and the Arab baths are fascinating. We made it part of a wider exploration of all the beautiful patios to be found dotted around the town, with a large concentration of them in this",
          "We decided to visit the arab baths whilst strolling around the old town. We had visited the baths in Ronda last year and these were very similar. It was only 2.50 euro which I thought was good value. There is a little courtyard there if you want to sit down with a cool drink",

          "So it may be tiny and you would struggle to drag out a stay beyond 30 minutes, but they charge next to nothing to get in and the Baths are at least interesting. The garden is lovely and it is like a little oasis in the town. But honestly, call in if you find yourself in the",

          "We knew of this place but found it by accident after we had been to the cathedral. Its worth a visit and the inner courtyard is a real haven of quiet. The baths are well looked after and show how they would have been used with some information panels to explain. Don't expect",
          "These modest Arabic baths are worth a visit if you have the time. The site consists of just two small underground chambers (the caldarium and tepidarium), but the gardens alone are worth the small admission price (2.50\u20ac). Although visiting the baths may only take a a few",

          "It only cost 2.50 euros to enter, which is just as well as really there is not very much to the Arab baths. Pretty much it is just a domed room with a few amphora lying around. The gardens are small but very attractive, and in early November it was very tranquil but I can",

          "The baths are located in the old quarter of Palma and a fascinating insight into what lies behind this narrow street climbing up from the harbour. A small fee gains access to a small courtyard furnished with palms and bedding and some seating. The baths are split between two",
          "This place requires a major restoration. Whatever is left is enough to understand how the structure was built. There is a very nice garden with lemon trees. It makes a good resting spot. I wouldn't change my plan to see this, but if you are in the area it is a nice visit.",

          "Walking into this oasis was the highlight of our day in Palma. The baths are 1100 years old, and the only remnant left from Moorish occupation. The gardens were as beautiful as the baths, and we found it hard yo leave!",
          "We had previously visited the Arab Baths in the Spring of 2014 so it was interesting to see how it looked later on in the year. While many of the citrus trees were not as heavily laden with ripe fruit as on our previous visit it was still a very relaxing experience. The entrance",
          "Wandering around, I followed the signs and came across the arabic baths. For a small entry fee, it was definitely worth it. There is a lovely, fairly small, peaceful garden full of various flora and fauna, to wander around. The baths themselves are also fairly small but there",
          "Not even worth the 2.5 E admission. Go anywhere else. Don't follow the signs. Old run down place that stands out for it not being appropriately prepared for tourist to visit and appreciate. You'll be out of there in 10 minutes, even if you go to the toilet.",
          "Went there during a hot day. Great garden to enjoy with a variety of plants. Banys are nothing special, not that big at all, but a nice example of Arab advancements in that day of age.",
          "The place was hard to find. A small fee is charged before entering. We were surprised to realise that in 10 minutes we had been all around. You need a lot of imagination to figure how the installations were in the old days.The gardens are quite ordinary. It's a peaceful little",
          "This is a small ruin, with not really a lot to get excited about. On the plus side, the garden offered quite a bit of shade on a very hot day.",
          "There's not a lot to see - in fact we met some Spanish visitors from Gerona and agreed that the baths in that city are much more spectacular. But, these baths are still interesting and the gardens are very restful. There is little other remaining evidence in Palma of its Muslim",
          "For a very small charge, we found this 'oasis' close to the city centre offering shade and a respite from the normal tourist activities in Palma. The informative video was short enough to get an idea of the history of the place. The gardens are well kept and gave us an hour's",
          "Don't miss this on your visit to Palma, it is a beautiful oasis in the city and a wonderfully preserved building. Fascinating. A short video explains the history of the baths and the gardens are a delight. Small but perfectly formed!",
          "There's not much to see and it'll take you 10 minutes to look around; but it's hundreds of years old and it's amazing it's still here, tucked away and surrounded by tight city streets. Worth a look if your interested in Palmas history",
          "The Muslim baths, nearly 1000 years old, are highly unusual medieval remains in Majorca. Take a trip back in time and get a sense of what the island was like under Muslim rule. Introductory video, room with columns, garden with foliage and exhibits.",
          "A beautiful, peaceful oasis, charming gardens, fascinating architecture and seats to sit and enjoy it. Slightly odd to see a drinks machine in the corner but in fact this is a kindness to hot thirsty tourists who can sit and enjoy a cool drink in wonderful surroundings, well",
          "A small but interesting remains of Moorish history of Mallorca. Lovely walled garden included in the reasonable entrance fee (2,5 euros for adults). Cool off in the shade for a while!",

          "I can understand some visitors being disappointed by how small this place is, but I loved it and found it an inspiring place for photography. The arches and the colours of the walls were a delight to me. The admission price of 2.50 euros is well worth paying. I enjoyed the",
          "This is a small attraction costing 2.50 euros. As the name suggests, it has the ruins of the arab baths with a video in English Spanish and German. There is also a nice walled garden where you can sit and relax. Overall this was a really pleasant way to spend about an hour",

          "We visited the Arab Baths not really knowing what to expect. At the ticket office we were charged \u20ac2.50 each. We were disappointed to find that there wasn't really anything to see and wasn't really worth the money we paid. Only for enthusiasts.",
          "Well worth the visit to the Baths. Wonderfully informative and the most beautiful gardens. Was so interesting to learn about the history of them. Lot of little sitting areas in the gardens and they run a video in different languages so you can see how the baths were when in use.",
          "OK we went because it was a rainy day and we needed to fill our time in Palma. It is a shame that they don't try to improve the small garden area which was untidy therefore I think that 2.50 euros per person is a little steep especially when there is very very little to see.",
          "The previous reviews say it all, small baths, untidy gardens, unimaginative lighting, but still interesting to see if you have never seen one before. Can't grumble at 2.50\u20ac admission. We went in January and had it to ourselves, so we could imagine the place when it was in use.",
          "1\u20ac entrance fee would be a more realistic price to pay to see the baths rather than the current 2:50\u20ac charge. Although they are worth seeing there is very little to them. Set in a tiny garden there is a small room where a video in 3 languages is shown which lasts just under 5",
          "I have been reading a lot of criticism on TripAdvisor about the arab baths, but the fact is you get what you pay for! It is only 2,50,- euros to enter and given that it is the last remaining piece of Muslim history on the island of Palma de Mallorca, I would say that's a small",
          "The Arab Baths are a small site of one-time baths. There is a 5 Euro admission, which is high for what you are getting. Probably not worth seeing, if time is short.",
          "Well, I expected something better, different, better curated. The Banys \u00c0rabs consist of 2 rooms and a big patio in where a video in English, German and Spanish explains how arabs used baths a social, hygienic and communities meetings. Unless you're into archeology of the",
          "After visiting Bath, England and the baths there, I was interested in visiting Banys Arabs in Majorca. It is very inexpensive and it doesn't take long to see, but it was fun having a destination as we wandered the small streets and allies. I highly recommend reading the",
          "On the plus side, this is a pleasant and tranquil spot deep in the alleyways of Palma, and its cheap (2.5 Euros) to get in. The garden area is lovely albeit rather unkempt. However, there's not really much to see of the baths, the sound quality of the video is poor, and there is",
          "If you like history. If you like getting off the beaten track of restaurants, bars and tourists. If you like going \"off piste\" along Palma's mediaeval backstreets. Then I'd certainly recommend you search out the Arabs Baths (the only remaining Moorish building in Palma). 10'",
          "Follow the signs and enjoy the wander around some really quiet and lovely alleyways to get to the Banys Arabs. It's only a couple of Euros to go in to see them and it takes about 15 minutes max to see all there is to see. Take a book and sit down under the trees to chill out for",
          "The baths themselves are just one room. They are unique and interesting looking. These are the only remains of the time that the Arabs were in Palma. The baths are well preserved and when you think of all the other destructions that has taken place over the years, it is kind of",

          "It's all been said before. The baths are in the old part of Palma close to the cathedral. There are lots of beautiful narrow streets to explore in the area as well as interesting independent shops. It can be quite tiring wandering about on a hot day so if you are in the area",
          "This isn't a big attraction but worth visiting to experience a Moorish feature in Palma. Originally a Roman bathhouse, it was taken over by the Moors so still has the underground heating system on show, and lots of columns and pictures explaining the history. The gardens are",
          "I know it's only 2.50 EUR but it really isn't worth it at all! It's a tiny place which takes 5-10 minutes to walk around. There is a video which plays in 3 languages in a loop. We waited for the English translation but was so disappointed as you could barely hear it, the sound",

          "It's nice to see Arab baths, but the facility is very small and you can see it in 10 minutes. The entrance fee of 3 \u20ac is a little bit too expensive, because there is a parc of 10 x 10 m and three smaller old chambers within the object. It's nice to see but it should be cheaper.",

          "Part of the pleasure of visiting these ancient Arab baths, a reminder of the Muslim conquest of most of Spain, is the walk through and along Palma's narrow ancient streets. Mind you, the renovators and bijoutifiers have moved into this town but it is still redolent of its",
          "Unfortunately the ruins of the arabian bathes have not much left. We went there for a afternoon and where a little disappointed on the size and what to see. It is a very beautiful place but in 15 minutes you have seen all. In summertime it is for sure a gem due to the location",
          "It's 2.50 euros to enter the baths, and the lovely gardens which are well maintained and provide shade on a hot day. There is a film which tells you the history of the baths and a model to show how they worked. The different styles of columns are interesting to see and with the",
          "While tucked away down a number of narrow winding streets the pedestrian route to the Arab Baths is very well signposted. The entrance charge of 2 euros 50 is very modest indeed. There may not be a lot to see but the plants are well maintained and there are plenty of chairs for",
          "If you are from a country in the world without \"old\" then you will probably enjoy this small place. However compared with all of the old historic treasures of Europe this is very minor, which makes the 3 Euro entrance price seem expensive. It is over a 1000 years old so needs",
          "You'll take less than one hour to visit the arabian baths in PAlma, but seen that visit them is very cheap I think you should go. The garden in the terrace is beautiful and the small ancient rooms very suggestive. I really appreciate them.",
          "Stumbled upon the baths during my last visit. Entry is reasonable and there is a lovely little garden you can relax in. It was very quiet and a nice change from the busy city centre.",
          "Tucked away in a marry alley in the old town of Palma, this is well worth a visit. It's tranquil and peaceful, a hop back into history and times gone by.",
          "Worth the \u20ac2.50 entrance fee for the gardens alone! The baths are ok, not a huge amount to see as it is just one room left and it hasn't been restored so is bare brick and stone but the atmosphere and tranquility of the garden make the trip worthwhile. The baths are about 5-10",
          "Lovely tranquil garden and the baths which are effectively two tiny stone rooms but well worth the effort.",
          "This is a quick review for a small site. I enjoyed seeing the baths. There is not much to see but it is a part of history and the price is only \u20ac2. If you\u2019re in the vicinity you can stop by for a quick visit and take some pictures.",
          "Very small and hidden away, but i thought that hunting them out just added to the experience as going off the beaten track in a new city is always a bit of an adventure. Very quiet and secluded garden when we were there, perfect for a little respite in a bygone age before",
          "These baths are quite difficult to find, and once you get there, they are a bit disappointing. Although it is an interesting site, the baths are very small, and there is not a lot to see. It's worth the effort if you have the time and have already visited the main attractions.",

          "I understand that some will think this isn't worth the effort but I found it pleasant and relaxing. But I was the only one there! If you like photography you can find some great shots. It is quite a small space so don't expect to be here for more than 30 minutes.",
          "Among the several things that you can visit in Palma, it is worth spending your time to visit these two rooms only if you have already finished seeing the whole island! You have to pay 2 EUR per person without any leaflet or guide and honestly you have the feeling that the",

          "Nice cultural visit to see 1 small room (bath place) and another one attached to it surrounded by small garden. If you don't have something else to do try the place. 2\u20ac entrance fee",
          "A peaceful place to visit: the old baths building is full of history, beautiful in it's simplicity. The garden by the baths is a perfect place to have a picnic lunch and have a little rest during a busy day of exploring Palma.",
          "A beautiful place to see,well worth 2euro fee situated in a quite area close to the Cathedral.Not too many people there at the time of our visit",

          "What a lovely place to have a look around. You cannot imagine how it used to be. In the grounds around the cathedral.",
          "We expected a little more to this than there was. The entry price was 2E each and for that there was the arab baths area with a small video show playing (it was in German at the time of our visit, although we didn't stay long enough to see if it was in English afterwards) and",
          "We came across these baths by chance whilst walking around the cathedral. We found the baths interesting and the pretty garden was relaxing.",
          "There is really not much to see once you are inside. There is a video explaining the history of the place in different languages,which when I walked in was in German. The place is small and difficult to find .",
          "It's only little but the entry fee is low and it's a pretty little garden site. It's tucked away but worth a visit; interesting and relatively quiet compared to the cathedral & other central Palma sites.",
          "This is a nice site, but really small and it makes you wonder... Interesting overall, but we mostly enjoyed having a refreshment in its garden. Wouldn't have missed it if I hadn't visited it.",
          "Everytime I visit the Port of Palma, everyone talks about the Ancient Arab Baths and this time I took it upon myself to visit this place. You have to walk quite a distance from the Cathedral Complex and the signage is quite good. The place charged 2 Euros for entry and with much",
          "we came out of Palma cathedral and began heading for the front. we saw signs for Banyos Arabes and became intrigued as to what it was. Before coming up on it and realising Banyos was for Baths. Set it gardens the ruin is in good shape and offers soem explanation on what they are",
          "Ok so it was a small garden but the plus was it was E2 to get in, but there was some shade, some benches to rest a while, a free toilet and a cold can vending machine. I wouldn't make a bee line for it but if you happen to be going past its a nice place for a pit stop with some",
          "The Arabs Baths in Palma de Mallorca is small but impactful site. It is tucked away on a side street in Palma, but it can be found by following the signs that lead you directly to it. The court yard is very tranquil and if you are looking for some serenity this is the place.",
          "Stepping through a stone archway turns back the clock to a time when bathing was a social event and enjoyed in a building surrounded by a beautiful garden",
          "It takes just around 10 minutes to see Banys. But you can enjoy the garden and greenery for hours. Price is just 2 \u20ac and there are not huge crowds inside in May",
          "We paid 2 euro each to visit the Arab Baths. The gardens were lovely - not massive in size but typical of a Moorish garden. The actual baths consisted of a single room, and there was also an information board and short video presentation, but they weren't very large in size. 2",
          "The Banys Arabs are compact but fascinating, very ancient with a gorgeous courtyard garden with tables and chairs, cheap too (2 euros i think).",
          "The Banys Arabs are well signposted from the Cathedral in Palma Mallorca and although take a little finding through the back streets of Palma they are worth a visit. The baths represent life in Mallorca during the Moorish period and have a video loop, in various languages, to",

          "Great little garden to go with a quaint little building. If you're hoping to come and get a steam bath, forget it. It's just an old building to look at.",

          "Would probably not recommend making the effort to visit the Arab Baths. Very little to see and very little information provided. The gardens are pleasant for a quiet break.",
          "Very small and 2 euros. Interesting if you like Arab architecture. Lovely little garden in the middle to take a well earned rest after a day on the hoof!",
          "Had I known what was inside I probably wouldn't have gone in despite the measly 2 \u20ac entrance fee. It's basically a very small, unspectacular garden and two small rooms only one of which is somewhat interesting.",
          "The best about this so-called museum is to walk through the backstreets of the Cathedral, following the signs to the Banys Arabs. 10 minutes after I paid the entrance fee of 2 Euro I felt robbed. There is practical nothing to see and lack of information. There is also a small",
          "OK - it's only \u20ac2 to go into this place but you'd be better spending it on a beer. The baths area itself is only the size a small living room - there's no water to see and the attraction is just an old room with some columns. There is a small courtyard/garden adjacent that might",
          "If wandering around the centre of Palma, this is a lovely spot to nip into to sit quietly in the gardens and watch a film showing how the two rooms were used. Only two euros",
          "It was a little hard to find--But, on every corner, the signs leading to it were well marked. It was fun strolling the Medieval Quarter looking for it. It was smaller than I had 'imagined'. There was a small fee. This is a great historic 'find' 10th century Moorish bath",
          "The remains of the small Arabic Baths are well worth a visit to get a glimps of the only real reminder of the Islands moorish past.",
          "I have visited this site more than once over the years and each time find its peace and tranquility beautiful. Well worth a visit",
          "2 euros gets you into this tiny little musuem. There's an informative video about the origins of the Arab baths then the remains of the calderium with its domed roof. there is also a wonderful little garden that you can while away the time soaking up the sun and atmosphere.",
          "An interesting little place for 2 euros admittance. Whilst this is a short stop visit the gardens are pretty and peaceful. There are some very uncomfortable chairs available. I think more could be done to spruce up the gardens but even so it was good to experience.",
          "well signposted,sweet little garden area in the old town, shady sitting areas & the old baths are interesting. Only costs a couple of Euro. Well worth a visit!",
          "As per title. Baths are deeply uninteresting but the lush courtyard garden was a delightful place to while away an hour on a windy March Friday. In high season I imagine less so!",
          "2 Euro entry is about right for a visit to a small walled garden and the very ancient moorish showpiece circular room",
          "It is interesting to see the gardens , and the former Arab baths. But, it is not worth paying a admission fee .",
          "Great for a quick look, peaceful gorgeous garden, area to sit and have a soft drink and relax, in a hidden corner of Palma near cathedral. If you love history, check it out, worth 15 minutes of your time.",
          "it is easy to follow the signs from the main Cathedral. has got few ropoms with a video display how it used to be used. has got beautifl garden. no wheelchair access as far as i sow. has a restroom.costs 2eu",
          "This precious little building is worth a visit if only to see the beautiful gardens in which they are set. We went in January and it was still blooming.",
          "Just two small rooms with a video and a lovely connecting garden. Not very interesting and you really do not get a sense of what arab baths must have been like as compared to the romans.",
          "hidden in the backstreets, is hard to find. After walking a long way one hopes it is worth while !! While the architecture is interesting, it is not a mind blowing place to visit and is much smaller than expected. They could do more to upgrade the interest factor.",
          "Once inside its a little disappointing, though the small garden is a nice place to sit amid the shade of the trees and is tranquil if there are not many people around",
          "The Banys Arabs is a small museum. There is one main room to the baths and one additional smaller room. There is also a very lovely garden. When there it is easy to imagine that this was a family's private bath house, which is much more intimate than most of the bath houses",
          "Not really a great deal to the interior, although set in very nice gardens. Worth a visit if strolling round Palma.",
          "Not a lot to see, but lovely grounds to sit and enjoy. Television giving a short informative film on baths",
          "If you haven't seen many ancient bath houses, Roman or otherwise then this is very good. If you've seen many it's still worth a visit at the price . Cool and intimate.",
          "This is a pretty little spot in the city. A nice place to take a break during the day. The gardens are lovely. The vidoe about the Arab Baths are brief. And the actual Arab Bath is underwhelming to say the least.",
          "The baths themselves don't take very long to view, but the little garden with fragrant plants was a peaceful little oasis to sit in and rest weary legs.",
          "These old Arab baths are a good way of taking a step back in time and visualising what it would have been like to visit these baths in years gone by. It's only 2 Euros and is worth a visit.",
          "Interesting old baths, but the best thing is the lovely tranquil gardens - a great place for a rest as you wander around the city...",
          "The admission price at \u20ac2 each is admittedly not a lot, however with a small garden area and a small building comprising the main feature, personally we did not think this was worth it. Perhaps on a quieter day we might have been able to sit and enjoy the peaceful surroundings,",
          "We were visiting Palma and exploring the city when we saw the signs to the baths. It was a bit of a walk from the cathedral but showed us a different part of town on the way. The baths were interesting and surrounded by a nice garden but not worth a special trip...",
          "One of the few remaining signs of the historic Moorish presence in Majorca. The grounds are lovely and provide some precious shade on sunny Majorcan days, but the structures themselves are less than impressive for anyone who's visited a traditional roman bath anywhere around the",
          "A must visit and well worth the 2euro entrance fee.There are places to sit while you take in the surroundings.",
          "Tucked away amidst the old city streets, this place was like stepping back in time. There are seating areas amidst the small gardens area so you can stop & have a drink or eat something in the welcome shade (there is no cafe on site). This is a very small attraction, but well",
          "Keep the faith and follow the signs - my hubby thought we were on a wild goose chase! Tiny little attraction, 2 euros entrance fee, kids free....wander around neat little garden, watch video and then marvel at 10thC architecture! Then treat yourelsves to lunch/snack/drink at Las",
          "Our time in Mallorca was spent up in the mountains, but we had a few hours to kill before our flight and with luggage in tow museums are not a good option, so we thought we would visit La Seu and Banys Arabs. The walk between the two on the streets of old Palma is wonderful,",
          "There is no a lot to see here, just a small indication of where the baths were, but the gardens are charming, cool and relaxing.",
          "It's only 2 euro and rather charming along with the small garden. If you come from a place rich in ancient structures then it might not appeal but otherwise it's worth a visit whilst wandering the streets of old Palma.",
          "We wandered through the back streets near the Cathedral, following the signs to the Banys Arabs. The baths themselves are fascinating and there is a DVD running in several languages explaining the history and layout. But the garden adjacent to the baths is a jewel in the crown",
          "the way you are told about the\u2026",
          "the surrounding garden is nice, but the place itself is disappointing. almost nothing left of the baths.",
          "the baths themselves are of interest but the intimate little shady garden is even better on a hot afternoon.",
          "Only costs 2 euros to go in and well worth it, tranquil oasis",
          "If you will go there, you will see just one room for 2\u20ac. Total waste of money",
          "Quite hard to locate but this small site was well maintained and allowed us to spend a pleasant and tranquil half hour in historical surroundings",
          "There is nowhere better to sit and relax in the heat of the day than here, just a stone's throw away from the busy Palma centre it is a little piece of perfection. A small garden full of refreshing green plants and really old and interesting architecture. Excellent value for",
          "Sorry to say this, but honestly it is nothing special. Do not waste your money going there",
          "Entering the site you meet on your right a very nice garden where you can relax. On the left there are two ancient rooms, used in the past by a rich arabian family, for thermal treatments. There's a Calidarium and a Tepidarium, where you can watch a video in different languages",
          "We picked up the sign for the baths when we were randomly walking around Palma. It was good to see the original structure of an often much forgotten period of the regions history. Small in size the garden is lovely.",
          "I was hoping from more from this venue. While its pleasant to visit and not too expensive (2 euros per person as at April 2012) there was little left of the Baths. The walled garden was very peacful though and an nice way to spend an hour. Don't plan a whole day around the",
          "Actually there is not much to see as it is onlyu one room",
          "Tiny but ancient - is probably a lovely cool spot in the Summer. Good news - it has a toilet!",
          "There is not a lot to see here, but that doesn't mean it's not worth a visit. The bath area is small but well-preserved and is all that's left of the Arab occupation of Mallorca. The outside gardens are lovely and tranquil.",
          "Follow the signs in the old town and they will lead you to the Arab Baths - it only takes 5 minutes to walk around, but it's worth it. One of the oldest places in Palma, it's like a walled garden bursting with colour. The history is very interesting too",
          "Although small, it is worth paying the small fee to visit. There is a short video presentation describing what went on in the baths. Then you go through into the bath area with it's vaulted ceiling and arches. The small gardens are tranquil, and although you'll probably only",

          "Okay, I should have listened to the other reviewers on Trip Advisor, but I figured, what the heck, for 2 euros how bad can it be? Well, pretty bad. A VERY small courtyard with two rooms off of it, one empty and one with columns, which I guess was the bath. I think my 40 sq m",

          "WE took the train at 10.50 and went Back at 18.30. It is easy to kill the time. Especially because you can take the tram to port de soller. There u can take a nap or a bath at the beach. The water is clear and the senery at the Port is beautiful. Soller itself is a beautiful",

          "I did the half day trip to Soller then Port Soller. The coach took you to Palma where you got the vintage train . The scenery on the journey was beautiful and there was a short break in Soller to look round the centre. From there you got the tram to Port Soller which was",
          "It was really nice to ride on this train and feel the nostalgia for train travel as it would have been 100 years ago. You can save money by buying a one-way ticket and catching the bus home (also faster than the train!)",
          "The popular little trams still continue to devour thousands of tourist a day at 7\u20ac a ride (compared to less than 2\u20ac on the bus) but it has to be done at least once during your stay. Just eight of these little trams with the trailers run every half and hour between Soller and",

          "I've visited Palma several times, but only just got around to taking the train to Soller, and the tram to Soller bay. It really is worth the ride. We paid 32 euros for the complete return trip. Get to the station around half an hour before you want to travel, as it gets really",
          "We went as part of an organised excursion which is probably the best as the train fills very quickly and is a bit unorganised. Whereas part of an excursion your carriage is already pre booked. We spent 30 minutes in beautiful Soller and then travelled by tram to Port de Soller",
          "Did the old train and the Soller tram as part of a TC excursion. The excursion had a carriage reservation. The tram was a tight squeeze (three was a bus load of us) but the views across the marina helped. Out of town the tram stalled for 10 mins as 3 trams came down from Soller.",

The tram to the port costs \u20ac7 one way. Buy a return train ticket and a return tram ticket for \u20ac32 per person. The train journey",
          "Loved this old train journey! Amazing views and a real trip back in time! That said, the 18 euro price tag is way more than the 2.95 air conditioned bus so wouldn\u2019t do the trip a second time!",
          "It was very disapointing. I will not try it again. If you want to go to Soller you better go there by car. These were the most regretful 4 hours in Mallorca!",
          "To be honest, the stretch from Palma to Bunyola is pretty awful, with views of industrial wastelands. The leg from Bunyola to Soller is stunning with great views across the valley. Big tip - DON'T attempt to drive into Soller centre, it's full of very narrow streets and one way",
          "If you do nothing when you go to Palma you must leave and do this. The Tren de soller was an amazing look back at how you travelled in the past. Soller itself was an amazing place. A step back in time and well worth getting the ticket for both the train and tram. A must when",
          "We missed the train the first time we tried this as we couldn't park in Soller for more than two hours. Also it takes at least ten minutes just to go round for a second look as it's a nightmare of one-way streets. On our second attempt we just parked by the side of the bypass",
          "My daughter and son-in-law and I booked a trip with a local \"attraction\" shop in Palmanova. It included a coach pick-up and return to the hotel. We had to transfer to another coach in Palma but this was not really a problem. However on arrival at Porto Soller we were informed",
          "After many previous visits to Soller and its surrounding area, this was our first trip to and fro to Palma. The trip takes about an hour with much of it in a tunnel The views in the mountains are worth the money, but we thought that at \u20ac25 it was a little expensive.",
          "We did Soller to Bunyola, had an hour in Bunyola which is lovely-especially as we were the only tourists! Then returned back to Soller where we\u2019d left our car. This is the best part of the ride as you do the longest tunnel and the viaduct. I loved standing between the",
          "After having been asked for over a year if we had taken the train already we finally did it this time round. You need to go to the Tren de Soller station above ground which is next to the train station below ground. It takes about an hour to get to Soller. Take a return ticket",
          "We were told that this was a must while in Palma, so the train we took. You need to pay with cash at the ticket box the same day, so come early but not too early. I believe the ticket office opens 30 min ahead of each departure but you can book for later in the day. Beautiful",

It\u2019s not the most exciting thing I\u2019ve ever done but it\u2019s pleasant enough. We went from Soller to a station just outside Palma main city where our tour bus picked us up.",
          "Hi! I wouldn\u2019t really recommend to take the train because of the following reasons: 1) It is very costly!!!! One way ticket is 18\u20ac and if you buy the return, I guess it is 25\u20ac. If you include tram in the whole package, it is way too costly. In comparison to this, the bus is",
          "A must thing when you are in Mallorca. Lovely landscape. When arriving in S\u00f3ller don\u2019t miss out taking the tram to Port de S\u00f3ller.

          "Our family loved the day trip to S\u00f3ller. It was one of the highlights of our stay in Mallorca. In Palma there is a little train station and it only takes cash for tickets (Although I\u2019ve heard there are plans to change that). The train is made of wood and is over 100 years old,",

          "Stayed in Soller, so got a bus to Palma (less than 3 euro). Spent a few hours in Palma, then back on the train. Got robbed by a pickpocket getting on the train, caught the guy but he had already handed it on. The train staff were not interested and just looked away.",
          "We caught the train from Bunyola station, which has much of its original charm. The ticket window opens a few minutes before the first train . There are very few return trains, so you need to plan your time wisely. Bunyola is an unspoilt town north of Palma and benefits from",
          "Brilliant day out , excellent sight seeing and worth the money . Train and tram both great ! It was \u20ac32 each . Got the train at 10.10am",
          "After a bit of research we decided to go on this train as something to do on holiday which would suit everyone in our family group. We would have taken an organised tour but as we're not morning people, we opted to do this ourselves but took a cab from our hotel to the train",
          "Both places are very beautiful and so picturesque. In the evening Both come alive with families and couples enjoying the atmosphere and restaurants. The tram ride is unique, albeit a little pricey, and is something that you will always remember. So the ride is worthwhile. We",

When in Soller port at 3pm we waited for the next one, \u201cevery 30 min\u201d they said... well after 3 hours we still waiting BUT the ONLY AGENCIES are coming without a problem, being the same trains! What a disgusting service. Staff werw not boce as",
          "We went as a family of 2 adults and a 5 year old. Lovely train, well preserved and maintained. Quite magical at its station in Palma too. Really nice for about 10-15 mins but once novelty wears off its a little bit naff. It\u2019s really slow and noisy and once you have seen some",
          "Got on the tram thinking that it was a tour only to find it was 7 euros to go 1 station which was in town then had to pay again if me and my wife wanted to see the whole line it would have cost us 42 euros for a total of 10 kms so please don\u2019t get on halfway as you will be",
          "Wonderful old train and a stunning scenic train ride from Palma to Soller takes around one hour but it was THOROUGHLY RUINED by the idiotic passengers who kept sticking their heads, hands and arms outside of the carriages - despite the warning signs everywhere. So when the man",

          "We travelled as a couple on the train - the train and tram combo. For a return for both of us it cost 64 Euro. The train itself is lovely. Beautiful vintage wooden train with original lamps etc inside. The windows open fully which is lovely as the breeze is definitely needed.",
          "We travelled from Soller to Palma but to be honest, I think it would have been better the other way around. We bought our ticket from the ticket office in the very charming little station in Soller, which is easy to find - just at the back of the tram stop. The ticket office",

          "We loved this trip many years, but this is the last time we made it! Not only, that i remember the price of the tramway going up from 5\u20ac to 7\u20ac in the last years, but also the price and service of the train went bad. We are 3 adultes and two kids (6 and 9) and wanted to go to",

          "The train ride from Palma to Soller was okay, but not memorable. There were very few parts with nice views and, in fact, we spent quite a bit of time inside tunnels. It was fun and a novelty for about 15 minutes, then became quite monotonous. The trolley ride from Soller to",
          "A bit crowded and not particularly running to the timetable but this didn\u2019t matter as the slow paced views and the quaint carriages more than made up for it. Good value if you come from Palma by train with the joint tran ride, otherwise its \u20ac7 each way from Soller to the port",
          "The old train runs between Palma and Soller in the mountains. It runs several times a day and you can get on in both cities plus a few stops along the track. We did our trip from Palma to Soller and back. There is a nice little caf\u00e9 at the train station in Palma where you can",

          "Rule 1. Check the timetable before you go. To its credit you can only book on the day at the station. This guarantees a seat on the return journey. The journey is relaxing with superb views and a train journey in old carriages with windows that actually open. Riding at the",

          "Lovely tram and ride... but at \u20ac7 each way each for a family of 4 where the kids are above the child rate it\u2019s just insanely expensive. Also late afternoon it is rammed - more akin to a busy Indian train than a leisure tram. I get supply and demand forcing prices up but",

It is a little bit pricey but it\u2019s a lovely journey so worth it for me.",

          "We were part of a No Frills Train to Soller. Of the 4,5 hours given to this tour, only 1 hour was on the train and tram from the Port of Soller. The remainder time was waiting for people or on the bus listening to the guide speak in 5 different languages giving directions. No",
          "This 95 year old tram winds it way rather majestically through the villages it has been immaculately restored and is in beautiful condition well worth the trip.",
          "Is is the most fantastic little train through all the tunnels down to,Palma this train is superbly maintained a perfect little gem",
          "We enjoyed riding the historic tram to make the journey to Port de S\u00f3ller. The tram stops just outside the train station in S\u00f3ller so the connection is easy if you\u2019ve travelled out of Palma on the vintage train.",
          "We took the tram from Soller to the Port and loved the experience,one way was enough though ,took the bus back to Palma !",
          "We took the train to Soller and it was absolutely stunning - mountains and tunnels and a beautifully restored train. A great way to travel and good value too.",
          "The timetable for the tram is by the stop and if you have time, it's worth timing it for one that doesn't coincide with the arrival of a train. Otherwise, all for 1..., usual tourist mentality in rushing/pushing to get on first. Once on, a nice trip down to the port although",
          "Great old fashioned train running from Palma to Soller. Wooden seats but lovely views. Expensive though compared to the service bus.",
          "Food at the port is the main attraction and it is full of restaurants specialising in fish (not surprising).",
          "We took the tram from the port to the train station prior to catching the little Soller train.The tram is quite a fun way to travel around the bay and for 6 euro not too expensive,",
          "Coming from Wales I have always been a fan of little trains and this one is a beauty.We traveled from Soller to Palma as part of the No Frills island tour.This lovely vintage train winding its way through the mountainous terrain through tunnels,past olive groves and orange",
          "Its a train that takes you through villages around Soller - can hop on and off. Was a welcome relief on a hot day from the beating sun.",
          "After a 3 hour walk/hike from where we were staying in Port de S\u00f3ller to Soller, this was just what was needed to get us back by a more direct route. For us it was more functional than a \u2018must do\u2019 but enjoyable nonetheless.",
          "A charming, back in time, trip from Soller to Port de Soller and/or back although the price seems to go up each year! Take the well marked footpath walk, through the countryside, one way and the tram back. You will need good footwear for the footpath which can be rough in places.",
          "It can be a bit crazy since seating is first come first served and be very careful not to board a tram specifically set up for travel agency use!! You will be removed unless you are a part of that group. It was just a fun ride from the train station in Soller to the port.",
          "We had a great time and enjoyed our 45 minute train ride from Palma to Soller. The early morning ride can get a bit cramped with tourists but the return at 18:30 was wonderful and relaxing. The ticket office only accepts CASH so be all the wiser to have your euros ready. I",
          "Not the fastest service, but a must if your in the area! Spectacular scenery! Ensure you get to the station in good time because could become crowded at specific times. Not a very regular service so keep an eye on schedule!",
          "Stunning views but a bit pricey at 6 euros each way. Always late departing but hey you're on holiday",
          "It\u2019s a tourist trap. old tramway between Soller and the Port of Soller beach. ~30m slow ride each way, (runs every 30m), 7\u20ac per person each way",
          "Our train journey was part of a day excursion, and also included a tram ride from Soller to the train station. Both are in old traditional carriages, the train carriages having been manufactured in the 1920\u2019s and maintained really well. The seating on both is a little cramped,",
          "My cousin and I enjoyed a lovely day on the Inca to Soller excursion. The guides looked after us and was very good with me to make sure I was safe because I'm unsteady on my feet. At the end of what was a perfect day a mini bus picked another couple and us up to take us back to",
          "An amazing journey on a tram/train from Soller to Palma. The journey goes by houses and villages as it climbs the mountain out of Soller. Several tunnels through the mountain rock along the journey. Spectacular views to both sides at different times. A lot of nostalgia inside",
          "I had a ride with them back in the 50\u00b4s and it is still much like what it was then. Recommended for it\u00b4s authentic experience.",
          "Great little ride into S\u00f3ller for the market. Some say it\u2019s expensive but I thought it was good value and it pays for the upkeep of something that is very unusual. We enjoyed it.",
          "The tram is a fun thing to ride but at \u20ac7 per trip it is expensive. You must do it once but the bus is so much cheaper.",
          "Beautiful train ride to Soller and then tram down to the port which is amazing. It's a must do trip but I would recommend getting a one way ticket and returning to Palma by bus. You have to book return trip on train and we found it was a bit too long to wait. The information",
          "We took a bus to the Port of Soller walked around, very lovely small town. Took a tram to the town of Soller and walked around there also a very nice little town. Then we took the train to Palma, fantastic view when it climbed upward and trough 10 tunnels.",
          "This is one of the must do things when you are in Majorca. It was an interesting ride in an electric narrow gauge old wooden train, with one opportunity to stop in the mountains to take pictures. Longest ride I've ever had through the tunnels in the mountains. The town",
          "We took the trolley to the port from town, we were traveling as a group of 6 (including a toddler) and it was great. Convenient way to get to the port and not have to worry about parking. A word of caution, the return trip was crazy. The train was super full and there was no",
          "We took the tram as it is one of the attractions. It is enjoyable as a one-off but the scenery is not spectacular and it is expensive.",
          "I\u2019m afraid it should sound great however like others have said it\u2019s a free for all fight till you drop to get on. Don\u2019t expect polite tourists literally is a free for all cram on and it\u2019s overpriced for what you get. Sorry to say I\u2019d prob drive next time. Probably a once only",
          "Catch the tram from Port de Soller up to the town of Soller you can buy tickets on board @ \u20ac7 per person (single). The journey is lovely in open backed wooden tram carriages. Have an explore and meal in Soller before returning home again. The trams run regularly and there are",
          "What a great trip. Thoroughly enjoyed the train trip through the outskirts of Palma through orange grove up to Soller. Great engineering trip and then on to Port Soller.Right up there as one of the best harbours in Mallorca.",
          "This is a wooden electric train so don\u2019t expect comfort, it is over 100 years old. Having said that it was a most enjoyable experience. You board next to the main bus station in Palma so very easy to find, select your outgoing train and return, on a cash only basis. It is",
          "My partner and I decided to take the day trip to Palma from our hotel in Cala d\u2019Or to experience this historical treasure to the island.   The cost was 32 Euros each for both the train and the tram experience that would take you completely from Palma to Soller then Port de",
          "We rode the train from Soller to just outside Palma as part of a day trip arranged through our TUI rep. What you've got to remember is that this train and track has remained virtually unchanged for 100 years so don't expect all the modern trappings of luxury. It is absolutely",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed this replica wooden train. Electrified narrow gauge railway. Reminded me of the streetcars in New Orleans, Louisiana; except instead of wooden benches, these cars had leather type cushioned seats. We were taken by bus to Soller in the morning. Then enjoyed",
          "Photos of the wooden tourist train which runs between Soller and Palma looks great on the tourist promotion but as with many \" tourist attractions\" it dissapoints. Why? Well 1. Cost:\u20ac18 single 2. Unnecessary pushing with poeple getting on the train and off 3. Scenery is nice",
          "The tram connects the old town of Soller and the beach of Port de Soller. Absolutely beautiful! Oneway ticket costs 7\u20ac, can be bought onboard. From the beach back to Palma city we took the bus nr 211, which was also charming and was only 2.90\u20ac per person.",
          "My husband and I visited Port de S\u00f3ller and S\u00f3ller in June but this time, we made a return trip to the Port so we could take the tram to S\u00f3ller. It can get busy but the tram takes a lot of people and is only \u20ac7 each which you pay on the tram. The ride up to S\u00f3ller gives you a",
          "At the end of the cycling holiday we had a trip on the tram and then train. The tram takes in lovely views along it\u2019s short journey and made a nice end to the trip for our son. \u20ac7 per person and \u20ac3.50 for our three year old.",
          "We travelled using the old train to visit Soller and the port. We were able to walk easily to the train station from our apartment and bought return tickets for the first journey in the morning including tram from Soller to the port. Once out of Palma the views were lovely. It",
          "Overall, I enjoyed this experience. I purchased the combo ticket (train and tranv\u00eda) for \u20ac32 (cash only). You decide for yourself if that is expensive or not. I advise you to get to the station early to purchase your tickets. I arrived at 9:00 AM for the 10:10 AM train. I",
          "At risk of being critical of this tourist experience, be aware that it is almost an open fight to get onto the tram. Absolutely no control of over excited tourists, all determined that they WILL be first on, and they WILL get a seat ! The staff do not control the access in",
          "The wooden train to Soller leaves from the small station to the left of Palma's main station at Placa Espana. There aren't many trains each day, and there are more to Soller in the morning than there are trains back in the afternoon which makes planning your day a bit tricky.",
          "The tram ride from Puerto de Soller to Soller town was a lovely way to spend around 15-20mins on our TUI Western Isle Discovery tour. (It usually costs \u20ac7 one-way.) Quaint, pretty, very busy - a Sunday in mid-September. Definitely recommended.",
          "Great day out on the old train from Palma to Soller. Nice scenery and very long tunnel. Be aware if the return journeys are sold out you are only allowed to travel on the one you are booked on which meant we had to kill four hours in Soller but there are plenty of bars!! You",
          "Take a trip on this 100 year old system. See Gardens, orange and lemon trees , horses and fruit trees. T takes about 20 minutes. Note there is not an 1100 tram from Porto to Soller. Great fun on saturday the market day.",
          "What a fantastic way to travel between the two towns. You should try it at least once. The trip from Palma to S\u00f3ller costs 17\u20ac, but it was worth every c\u00e9ntimo!! There were great views and the breeze was lovely.",
          "The train is caught at the top of the steps out of the bus station,it,s a nice run out of Palma and the scenery is nice but I feel the cost is slightly high better to get a single up to Soller and bus back down to Palma.The tram to the port from the station is expensive for a",
          "Only \u20ac7 and puts a smile on everyone's face, so why not spend a short time trundling along packed in with everyone else hanging outside to take the cute cheesy shots We loved it!!",
          "We travelled from Can picafort to Palma independently the train station is right next to the bus station so that was easy.The train ride was so enjoyable the views amazing it was a great day we went on the tram down to the port which is nice and quaint well worth a visit we",
          "We took the train and tram package that cost \u20ac25. Lovely scenic route through the mountains although this does mean going through 12 tunnels. The train stops to let you take photos on the route down which is a nice touch. Once in Soller we transferred to the tram for the run",
          "From Palma to Soller takes an hour through the mountain tunnellsto the west coast and great views when the train stops halfway",
          "It is totally unfair that locals are allowed to get huge discount on this tram. I understand the need for higher prices for one-off users but when you are staying in Soller and wish to visit the port frequently, the price is extortionate - it is also contrary to EU law.",
          "Booked the train to return to Palma after our stay in Soller. Lovely train journey takes about an hour. Train was quiet at time of day we travelled 11.50 am. 18 euro each for single trip. Will take train again but think price could be cheaper when it\u2019s only 5.80 euro for 2",
          "Taking the Tren De Soller on a weekday in September I expected an easy ride. Having travelled an hour by bus to Palma, that\u2019s just what we needed. It was not to be. Utter chaos, this train is so popular we were lucky to get a ticket. Of course you can\u2019t buy ahead, but need to",
          "Took this train from Palma - \u20ac64 return for two for train/tram seemed expensive but it became apparent that to preserve this historic feat of engineering, completed in 1912, it is a bargain. 914mm narrow gauge track seems odd until you learn it is exactly 36 inches to match the",
          "OK, it's 7 Euro's however you will save the money in gas, frustration and parking. Park in one of the public lots and you can take the Tranvia between the Town of Soller and the Port of Soller, with stops along the way. A must do if you have Kids.",
          "Great train trip the oldfashion way. From central Palma you move through the suburbs towards and through the Mountain. Very scenic. It is a bit expensive so the bus could be recommened for the returntrip.",
          "This is something that every visitor to Soller does. It's fun but over priced. Seven Euro one way is a lot for a ten minute experience - it must be a huge money spinner. Wouldn't use it otherwise, taxis are cheaper and quicker.",
          "We went on this train from Palma To Soller. It was a lovely ride with lovely views of the countryside, mountains and villages. We found a seat no problem and i understand they make sure everybody has a seat by counting the sale of tickets.",
          "Charming, yes but 7 euros a head for a few km. There were four of us. I bet a taxi would have been quicker and cheaper. A taxi would have saved us the waiting and the scrum to get a seat.",
          "The perfect way to enter Porto de Soller. It is a bit costly but it is worth every penny. You get close to the city.",
          "After driving through two tunnels through mountains you arrive at this beautiful coastal town with its own little rail system. Stroll along the beach and take in refreshments in one of the many restaurants.",
          "We got a return ticket from Soller to Palma. The trip went by fast and we enjoyed it a lot. The best views are between Soller and Bunyola. From Bunyola to Palma it's mostly either rural areas, or the outskirts of the city. The only complaint is that the old service guy was sort",
          "We visit Soller regularly and often travel on the trams. A self-confessed tram enthusiast, I have a great admiration for, not only the original three trams hailing from 1912 but the additional trams bought from Lisbon that have been transformed, one each year, to look like the",
          "Just love this tram. It takes the pace out of life. Don't get on the tourista one by mistake. Sardine job.",
          "After reading reviews we got the bus to Soller, which is a nice little town to walk round with an amazing church. Then we got the tram down to the port with the mind to catch the bus back to Palma from the Port. Well for 7 Euros a head you fight with fellow passengers to try and",
          "Went from Port de Soller to Soller, and then returned soon after !! This was great fun and all the trams to Port de Soller were full up !!! If you are there give it a go :)",
          "After reading about the train journey, through beautiful scenery I thought it would be much nicer. There are a lot of tunnels to go through and after the initial view of S\u00f3ller you are just going through olive trees. It is one of those things which you should do when in S\u00f3ller",
          "The train ride was very nice passing through lemon and orange orchards at the end, the carriages with the wooden seats are more comfortable, do not chose the leather ones. In the summer it's quite warm inside but with plenty of nice breeze from the open windows. The train",
          "Ok so to start \u20ac32 return. We took tram up to Soller from port then train to Palma 12.15. Assuming times back would be hourly. Be very careful as arrived Palma 1.15 to be told next train back was 3.10pm or 7.40!! This is because excursions take precedence over stand alone",
          "Sorry to write this review but this trip was slow light of holiday. Train from Palma to Soller is cramped uncomfortable and dangerous. Seats are tiny. Loads of people on the 10.15 which we took. No toilets on train. Only one decent view. Can\u2019t look out of train going forward as",
          "Worth seeing for a few local shops. Church is beautiful and for a donation of 1 euro should not be missed.",
          "It was a mixed experience. First thing to note is that you have to pay by cash, 25 Euros per person for a return ticket with the option of paying 32 Euros pp if you want to include the tram ride from Soller to Port du Soller. The train is a beautiful wooden train, and it makes a",
          "We read some of the reviews before deciding to commit to the Tui Western Encounter tour, the guide Paulo was brilliant and knowledgeable with clear passion and sense of humour. The visit to Valldemossa was well worth it, with great views from the coach, truly a unique and",

          "While on our visit to Port de S\u00f3ller we had the joy of the tram 7euro each way well worth going on. Trip is about 20 minutes long each way but offers spectacular scenery even for a 20 month old.",
          "Lovely way to spend 20 mins, the journey through the middle of the town of Soller is fantastic. But 7 euros per person each way? Come on. That ruined it for me. Half price for kids, but only if aged 3 to 6. No prices advertised on the platform edges, you only find out once in",
          "My husband and I took the 1.30pm train on Saturday 25 August to Soller. We paid 60 euros for a return train and tram ride. We had to pay in cash as they do not accept card payments. We were in the front carriage by the engine and going through the longest tunnel the train broke",
          "Enjoyable day out with great scenery on route to S\u00f3ller. Picturesque old town and beautiful port. We paid \u20ac32pp from the train and tram which was a little pricey but worth it.",
          "Lively short trip from Port a Sollier to Sollier. Very pretty and relaxing although a little expensive at 7 euros each way. No return ticket option and tickets cannot be purchased in advance, they are sold on the tram.",
          "Purchased tickets at the train station in Palma and boarded the little antique train within 20 minutes. Simple, convenient and quick process! The train itself is old and quaint and the journey through the countryside is ripe with scenery. The mountains are majestic and the",
          "Last minute decision to do this, glad we did. Took the train then the tram down to the port. Menu of the day lunch and then took the tram back to S\u00f3ller. Chilled and shopped, back to palma exhausted. What a day.",
          "Had a two week holiday in Santa Ponsa (to the west coast). Decided to fit in the Soller visit on a Sunday so ended up getting a taxi to Palma to reach the terminal for the wooden train ride to Soller. Paid for two adults and one child (6 yo) and our 2 yo went free. The wooden",
          "We stayed in Soller and the tram was definitely the best way to get to the port. We got a pass for the week that was from memory around \u20ac25 and then a few more to get your photo printed for the pass which was good value as it gave you a total of 10 trips. Hard to beat sticking",
          "Worth doing once but consider joining at Bunyola as the scenery is better from there onwards. The final tram to the port is more expensive \u20ac7 per per person each way, worth considering to substitute for a taxi. It is not possible to easily walk as quite a few miles.",
          "The best way to get to Soller from the port. Great attraction for all. Mysterious, like a time travel. Must try.",
          "I took the train again recently, and it is still as good as I remember. As it slowly trundles through the countryside from Palma to Soller and vice versa, the views are stunning. The old train is from 1912, and is so quaint. In my opinion this is one attraction that you must",
          "took the tram wooden seats with open carriages on return to Soller good fun cost 7euros each way same for kids but fun trip and good bit of history",
          "Today I went as a family group of 5 on the train from Palma to Soller. We are 2 adults and 3 children 10,12 & 15 or so I thought. When I got there I found out that the operators of this service consider a child between the age of 3 & 6 years and older are adults......absolutely",
          "Nice trip to port de Soller. About 20 minutes ride. Way too expensive - 7 euro one way is a bit out of it, I think",
          "Despite the cost, we have travelled on the tram at least 7 times this holiday. We love to stand at the back and wave to everyone taking photos and waving back at us. It's a fun experience and such a cute way to travel to the Port. Efficient with their timings and friendly staff.",
          "I hope the following tips are helpful for traveling into the Port de Soller for a few hours. We traveled from Palma. Take a cab from Palma directly to the Port de Soller and then take the train back. This will save more than an hour (more time in this wonderful area)! Our cab",
          "This was one of my favourite trips I took on my visit to Mallorca recently. The train itself is beautiful and really fun. It was incredibly busy when I went and from the other reviews I get the impression it nearly always is, but if you're at the station/stop early enough then",
          "Enjoyed the train and views very much, not everyday you get to ride on a train 100 years old. S\u00f3ller was lovely and well worth a visit. Would not do again as done now but well worth seeing.",
          "The train ride was very enjoyable but we couldn\u2019t sit together on the way back which spoilt it somewhat. This was because of the disorganisation at the station as 2 carriages were for the sole use of tour groups.",
          "We have been on the railway twice, it is well worth doing and the views are great however the timetable was designed by a lunatic. No matter how we tried we could not get a sensible amount of time in either Sollier or Palma so have found the best way to enjoy a great day out is",
          "Having got the train down to S\u00f3ller we fought the team down to the port. Fantastic old fashioned tram. Journey takes about 25 mins but highly recommended. You can buy your tram return journey when you purchase your train tickets too.",
          "A lovely day out. Leave from Palma and arrive in S\u00f3ller about an hour and fifteen minutes later. The most beautiful scenery you can imagine with the mountains and villages. When you arrive in S\u00f3ller you can get the tram \ud83d\ude8b down to S\u00f3ller Port. Again beautiful and breathtaking",
          "3 km of tram road. It is a part of train road. It was built to receive a funding. Great experience. Very old tram but in good condition",
          "27 km of train road. It is very old train. Great view during the trip. I liked it. Should be a part of each excursion. If a correctly understood it is available for clients of travel agencies only",

          "If you visit Soller this is a must to do thing, to jump on the tram down to the port. This was one of the highlights of the holiday- beautiful resorts, great beach and a fun trip on the tram (although at \u20ac7 per person each way I did think this a bit expensive).",
          "Soller was recommended to us by a couple of people and was a pleasant activity on a warm, cloudy afternoon. The return journey from Palma to Soller at 25\u20ac is quite expensive but it was nice to sit back and relax and enjoy the views of the countryside from the clean,",
          "The trip from Palma to Soller is about 1h30min, plus 30min if you take the tram from S\u00f3ller station to the port, which is the most valuable part of the trip for me. Even though I didn't find it that special, the idea is right and you get to see and enjoy the different landscapes",
          "nice different way to go to Soller, easy to enjoy scenery and fresh air on the way to the town no need to book in advance did like other people rcommend, took the train to soller, tram to the beach and bus back to Palma value for money",
          "This train trip is a bit pricey, but we enjoyed doing it with our family. The scenery is lovely, and it's nice to smell the grass and get the breeze through the open windows. It goes through different terrain, and it's relaxing and interesting. We enjoyed standing on the",
          "This is a well run tram along the seafront where there are lots of boats and a small beach, plenty of eateries and cafe, plus the usual tourist shops",

          "Take the tram from Port de Soller into Soller on a Saturday for the market. Go hungry as there are lots of stalls selling local cheese and meat. A really pleasant way to travel through orange groves and little back alleyways. Great mountain views. \u20ac7 for an adult each way.",
          "A railway was one of the last things I expected to find on an island, but having discovered that Mallorca has one, it was a must-do for me. And what a trip. We started in the Port of Soller on an ancient but obviously well-kept and well-loved tram before transferring onto the",
          "The ferrocarril to Soller is an old fashioned train put in place to make it easier for people in Soller to get to Palma rather than take a boat to France! It\u2019s great fun starting in the quant Palma station with beautiful scenery, a steady climb into the hills, lots of tunnels",
          "We love riding on these trams but over the years the cost has got ridiculous \u20ac7 each way even for any child over six The price should be \u20ac3/4 at the most",
          "The train itself is nice, the ticket selling is well organized. Beside this, the trip itself is quite boring and the main part of it is running trough of the industrial part of Palma or trough tunnels. Only some parts are providing nice views, but for the price it is not a good",
          "Nice 25minute journey. Friendly staff and cost 7 e one way. Stood at the back for nicer views. Doing it once is probably enough, got a taxi home after dinner which was quikcer and cheaper, but was a nice to do the one time",
          "The journey is nice and peculiar. However, the tickets are quite pricey and it is not that easy to change the time. Some of the personnel weren\u2019t that friendly either. There are a lot of tunnels during the way but you should be able to take some nice pictures.",
          "The train itself was really lovely and old fashioned, noisy and bumpy. The scenery once outside of Palma was delightful and the tunnels great fun - one of the tunnels is very long, and takes about 5 minutes to pass through. Really enjoyable. The train is expensive at \u20ac25",
          "The tram from the train station to Port de Soller is very overpriced at \u20ac7 per person each way with children discount stopping once they reach 7 years old. The first part of the journey through the very pretty town of Soller is great, then you hit the main road and just travel",
          "A lovley senic view from the lively town to the wonderful port you simply just get on and pay the conductor \u20ac7 or\u20ac3,5 for a child under 6 the timings are every half an hour until 20:00 then 1 every hour If you do go you will enjoy it this tram is also good with the train",
          "This vintage train \ud83d\ude82 is spectacular,amazing and a great \ud83d\udc4d sight a great place for train \ud83d\ude8a spotters and enthusiasts going over a small viaduct and the beauty spot was spectacular a good value for your money one problem they only accept cash",
          "Excellent to have chance to meander on an old tram to see the scenery and old town. Makes a nice relaxing break from the beach. Lovely n such scenery.",
          "We really enjoyed our day trip on the train out to Soller and then the tram to the Port. At first it did seem like an expensive trip, but it was around 3 hours of transport on what was a quaint and scenic ride (1 hour each way on the train plus another 25mins on the tram each",
          "It was pretty expensive for what it is but I think you should do it once in your life . Journey was quite cute once you\u2019d got out of palma as it went through industrial areas etc . The later part of the journey being the best . It isn\u2019t the quickest form of transport to soller",
          "This is expensive and over crowded for what it is . \u20ac7 to go down a hill from soller to Port de S\u00f3ller . If it was a couple of Euro\u2019s I\u2019d understand",
          "Thoroughly recommend: great views of the countryside from the train. S\u00f3ller small but perfectly formed - worth walking a circuit around the village (beyond the street of shops). Shops sell \u2018tasteful\u2019 souvenirs.",
          "Lovely way to travel to Palma. Down the mountain and back and see the tunnelling works of the original construction",
          "Don't quite know how many times we've been on this train but it never fails to excite. A lovely rickety train ride through lovely landscapes and through long tunnels, absolutely love it.",
          "The train ride itself is very nice, we took the train from Soller, to Port De Soller. But its very expensive, and the kids discount stops at 3 yrs. (I think)",
          "Travel from Palma to Soller and Puerto Soller on old fashioned trains. The best things are the absolutely fabulous views as you travel through the mountains, pausing for a photo shoot. Make sure you explore the town of Soller (not just the port) it's absolutely wonderful with",
          "Not sure about previous reviews? Drive through orange groves and by the water/scenic/?? Not really. Most of the ride is along the main road from soller to the port. Took a taxi back as cheaper and quicker. Dont mind costs but 35 euro for family of 5 one way bit steep for wheat",
          "We took this small charming train with old wooden carriages from Bunyola, and off course its noisy when you go through the tunnels, but the scenery going through the Tramuntana Mountains is beautiful, and the ride is lovely. Then when you get to Soller, a very elegant old train",
          "Beautyful View along the way ridding right on the beach at Port de S\u00f3ller. We spend a few hours on the beach then went back. To the train from S\u00f3ller instead of palms that way it doesn\u2019t take that long and is a bit cheaper.",
          "We took the tram into the port and return. As others have said it is rather expensive but it is also quite scenic and it was nice to have the experience of a tram ride instead of just jumping in a taxi.",
          "We took the wooden railway train to Soller from Palma. The train ride is lovely for the experience but it is expensive for what it is. We bought multi-tickets which covered return trip to Soller and the tram tickets to Port de Soller and back, it cost 64 euros for 2 of us which",
          "Began our trip with a coffee in the lovely little Soller railway cafe on Playa Espania, Palma before boarding the train to Soller. The railway has been well maintained in its authentic style and while the seats are padded and reversible, the ride is a little rickety but still",
          "Got the train from porta S\u00f3ller to S\u00f3ller , it was expensive 7\u20ac per person each way and not a lot to do in S\u00f3ller alert from people watch",
          "Visited Soller and then caught the tram down to the port. This was one of the highlights of the holiday- beautiful resorts, great beach and a fun trip on the tram (although at \u20ac7 per person each way I did think this a bit expensive).",
          "There\u2019s no denying the Tram is beautiful and quaint but I cannot understand WHY it has to be so expensive... at 7\u20ac one way and no special Family rate, this is an expensive ride. There is a child\u2019s price of 3.50\u20ac for 2-6yrs but after that children pay full price! I found this",
          "A lovely trip around Soller! Very scenic and a great way to get from the town to the port, didn\u2019t take long and we sat in the open air carriage which was great to get a breeze on a very hot day.",
          "We bought return tickets in Soller at 25 euros return. Unlike others have said, we weren't asked to choose a time to return, but there wasn't much choice anyway. Its another 7 euros to get a tram to Port de Soller, which is also well worth a visit. The scenery from the tram was",
          "Interesting trip on vintage railway from Palma to Soller. Climbs through orange and lemon growing areas. The ride experience is similar to being on a London Underground train: shaky and quite noisy. Part of the journey is through the outskirts of Palma before heading across open",
          "A quirky and lovely way to get to and from beautiful Soller to a very pretty marina Port de Soller. The open sides carriage is better as its cooler. The only negative was it gets very busy and unfortunately people can be very rude and push in",
          "Well worth the time it takes to get to Port Soller. The train is quaint and the views from certain points make the whole experience worthwhile .",
          "A great step back in time on this authentic tram ride to/from Port Soller to the town of Soller. With great views arriving in the port.",
          "Not worth the 18 Euro price tag, slow rickety wooden train that ambles through the countryside get the bus it\u2019s quicker and only 4 euros",
          "Lovely little trip (as part of a tour) probably about 20 mins from the port to the town. Both of which are worth the visit in their own right. Lovely experience.",
          "Great town to visit . The best church I have seen in a long time well worth a viisit. Lovely boutique shops . Lovely square pleasant place for lunch. Meandering quait little streets with hidden gems.",
          "The train and carriages are nice and old. Except for that, and the noisy ride ,it is quite an ordinary journey. You don't get to see the railway construction, except for the dark inside of the numerous tunnels.",
          "Gorgeous atmospheric journey. Personally don't think it's worth \u20ac160 and conductors were unfriendly with tourists but Soller is worth seeing.",
          "Great train wonderful views and it was really worth it. It is a very short and pleasant trip with the train ! A must I would say because by car it is hard to find a parking space",
          "We had heard so much about this trip so as we decided to travel to Soller Port on the train and Tram from Palma. We got return tickets at a cost of 32 euros each and you had to give the time of the train you wished to return on, only two 2pm and about 5 pm, we were advised to",
          "This delightful tram system operates at regular 30 minute intervals between central Soller and its seaside sibling, Port Soller. It can get packed, but it's always a relaxing way to travel between the two. You can walk instead, but allow at least an hour or so if you do.",
          "Trip review for 27th June 2018. In my personal opinion, this experience is only good for two sorts of people: 1. People heavily obsessed with old trains or trains in general. 2. People who have no need to ever think about money. Yes, the train is in very good maintained",
          "We have now done this train journey several times as it is an enjoyable day out with our two grandchildren who live in Majorca. However, we were horrified when we took the trip yesterday at the price we were charged. We bought 4 return tickets to Soller only, not including the",
          "If you are visiting Majorca & get a chance to take a trip on the wooden train to Soller it is definitely worth the money. The scenery on the hours train ride is absolutely stunning. Soller is beautuful, with a lovely church which is worth a visit & pavement cafes in the",
          "I don't think the photos you see do it justice. That said, it runs on the half-hour and makes much more sense than waiting taxi stand every time. (Btw, it's now 7 euros)",
          "travel on this century-old tramway through 'forgotten' Majorca as you experience the sights and smells of orange groves up close and arrive (if coming from Palma) at the head of a little valley down to the pretty bay of Puerto de Soller",
          "Lovely journey to Soller beautiful scenery. The journey reminded me of the St Kitts Railway swaying and ambling along.",
          "Pretty but way too overpriced at \u20ac7 a single ticket. You can take the pram on, no ramp! Buy the ticket on-board, can be super busy. We took the bus back \u20ac1.5. The views are nice but not life changing.",
          "Travelled to Port de S\u00f3ller to S\u00f3ller on a Saturday which was market day , S\u00f3ller is such a lovely place to visit with some great architecture. Very busy because of market day which made it more interesting. Scenery on the journey was lovely .",
          "The tram ride is the best thing about the trip to Soller! Lots of restaurants with people crowded together. Quaintish streets and the usual gift shops.Not our choice!",
          "The little tram is a novel ride down to Port de Soller. But we thought the price of \u20ac7 pp one way was a bit pricey.",
          "This train journey is a must do activity if you are within reach of either Palma station or Soller station. As you leave Soller the train rises up into the hills and goes through some tunnels and this can be rather confusing as one minute the view is on one side and when you",
          "Caught this train from Port De Soller for the ride to Soller on Saturday as it was market day. Rode this train many years ago and was impressed, however, this is nothing special these days, it wasn\u2019t scenic, upkeep of property and gardens along the way left a lot to be desired",
          "Honestly, I really did enjoy the tram ride from S\u00f2ller to the port. Its a lovely route and is great for a visitor to the area... But... if there is more than one of you it is the most expensive way to travel. A taxi is cheaper at 10 euros!!! And for this reason I can only give",
          "Having gone to the olive grove by taxi, walked back into S\u00f3ller to get the tram back to Port Soller Magical to climb onto this sweet little tram (it does get very full) and the gently chug along taking in the beautiful scenery en route Unhurried and totally quaint",
          "Being in Malloca this is almost a must. Behind the central station in Palma there is an other railway station. From there will the old train to Soller leave. And arrive back,in you won't take the bus back. The railway goes way up in the hills, with stunning sights both",
          "The ride down to the port of Soller from the Soller train station through the orange groves is a must for anny one coming to the Soller valley. It is not cheap but considering what it costs to maintain this antique tram in pristine shape and that it is an experience riding not",
          "It was a memorable tour up to the interesting village of Soller. We got in contact with nice people and the view was lovely. Recommendable!",
          "Very fun ride on a nostalgic trolly, about 25 minutes each way, worth it for the destinations, each of which are hard to park otherwise.",
          "After being in the mountains and Soller for a few days, we took the train into Palma. It\u2019s a nice train ride, though a bit pricey at \u20ac25 round trip. If you are a train aficionado, you will definitely like the narrow gauge train. If possible, go all the way to the front car, the",
          "This is a lovely nostalgic way to see the port and Travel to Soller. You are literally within touching distance of the oranges and lemons. Winding through the village and the people. A little expensive but worth it for the experience.",
          "As many say it's quite expensive for a return with tram and views not great as lots of tunnels ....... HOWEVER far better done just one way using organised tour with ferryboat from Sa Calobra and coach to there from Palma along amazing twisting road through the mountains &",
          "The tram from the port of Soller to the town is worth taking. In my opinion it offers more than the train. It has the same old charm, travels through some orange and lemon groves and is much better value than the train to Palma.",
          "Just got off this train and can quite honestly say it is my opinion that this is a pricey tourist trap. Yes the train is quaint, it should be its old enough and yes it does go through some scenery but most of the time you are travelling through tunnels (and there are lots of",
          "Ferrocarril railway from Soller to Palma. Whereas I suspect most tourists travel from Palma to Soller there are many who wish to start their journey from Soller arriving in Soller by car. This report is for them. The Ferrocarril railway service is completely under promoted or",

          "We were in Port de Soller for the day and decided to take the old style tram into the town of Soller on our way back home as we could then go from Soller to Palma by bus. The tram costs \u20ac7 each way, and while I initially thought this was expensive (if you were doing the round",
          "We were staying in Port de Soller and travelled into Soller for lunch and to see the sights. The tram was really enjoyable. Fortunately, because we were travelling in the opposite direction to the crowds, there was no pushing and shoving and lots of spare seats. The crowds",
          "Would definitely recommend people doing this. A nice break from Palma. An old train takes you on a 45m-1h journey through lovely countryside. I would suggest giving yourself time. We ended up rushing. So I would get an early train and probably the 5:30pm or 6:30pm train back so",
          "Wonderful experience of a tram ride. Breezy, good views, comfortable. Queues for it can be long but get everyone on and it's pretty spacious. Decently priced",
          "A pleasant train ride up through the countryside to S\u00f3ller. The train is an old narrow gauge train and moves at a steady pace. Buy your tickets at the station - holiday reps over charge! It costs (May 2018) \u20ac25 each for a return and an additional \u20ac12 for the tram journey from",
          "The trip around the bay and then up into Soller gives you some great views but it's expensive a return trip for 4 people will cost you 56 euros, it's much cheaper to take a cab or the bus, only worth a single trip if you haven't done it before.",
          "I took the tram from Soller train station to Port De Soller and it was an excellent way to see the sights. We passed very close to the main square in Soller where people were eating and drinking before heading out into the country for our journey down to the sea. The tram was",
          "I did the trip from Palma to Soller as part of a tour group. The journey was very good although the train was rather crowded. The engine itself had two small compartments, one first class and the other third class. We were seated in a second class carriage just behind the",

          "This was one of the highlights of our holiday in Port de Soller. We went on the tram several times to the village of Soller and really enjoyed the experience. All the drivers and staff were really friendly. We then went on it to Palma - lovely scenery and very relaxing). At the",
          "We took the tram from Soller to Port de Soller. While it\u2019s worth the experience it is pricey. I hope they have rates for families.",
          "We drove to Soller and took the little train down the mountain to the Port for the day. What a glorious little town and port with shops and a beach and marina. Tons of restaurants .This village is a jewel . I would love to come back and stay for a long time. The Train was slow",
          "Went on the old train from Palma to S\u00f3ller in May. Very novel pleas t way to have views of the mountains and the orange and lemon groves. Certainly worth a small investment to include the tram. Give yourself at least half a day to look around S\u00f3ller and port S\u00f3ller.",
          "I love riding trains so when I saw this in the travel guide I had to try it. There were three problems with the trip. 1. Finding parking near the train station. There is a small parking lot around the corner on the east side of the station. The tracks are just on the other side",
          "We got on the train in soller and travelled through countryside with lovely views. It went through lots of tunnels and was a bit like a roller coaster. It went to Palmer where we picked up our coach. It was an exciting trip and I really enjoyed it",
          "We booked a island tour which included this tram ride. We went through back street and through scenic country side and ended up at our next destination which was the train trip. It gets busy but worth the ride.",
          "We caught this small tram down to the port from the town of Soller. It is cute and the ride is pretty. Just check on the times - it comes every half hour or so and less frequently in the evening. If you miss one you could be in for a wait.",
          "This train was everything it was billed - slow but not too slow - a nice scenic ride up the mountain but not too high - and gets you to the destination in too long a time - a worth it trip to a beautiful place",
          "We took the train from S\u00f3ller to the Port de S\u00f3ller. It was pretty slow with plenty of orange/lemon gardens along the train line. Easy for kids. We had the closed carriage so also safe for little kids. There is another type of carriage, more open one.",

Pros: It\u2018s a cool way to ride Pleasant view Start/stop directly on the beach in Port Soller Starts/stop directly next to train from Palma (in Soller) Runs regularly Cons: The bus is like 1.30\u20ac per person Wooden seats Rough ride...duh, it\u2019s",
          "so romantic or family friendly. takes about an hour each way and is a magic experience. the views on route are spectacular. amazing how different Soller and Palma are.",

          "On our last visit to the Palma we drove to Soller and Porta Soller, but one our 5 days in the city it was one of the things we must do. It is a must to be at the station early to purchase tickets which are not cheap - cash only - and get a window seat in one of the carriages.",
          "The fare from Soller to Port Soller is 7 euros each way per person. There is no discount card for frequent travel. It is delightful but rather expensive for families or frequent users. You might want to share a taxi instead.",

          "An interesting experience travelling between Soller and Port Soller on this old wooden tram. The cost is 7 euros each person for each way and worth every cent. Yes, it's a bit 'rickety' at times but an enjoyable trip through the town and 'back gardens' of the local people, on",
          "We had read about the beautiful scenery on the train trip between Soller and Palma so our expectations were high as we set off. The train is an antique train and interesting for train enthusiasts and was comfortable enough. I have to say that we did not find the journey very",
          "Travelling down from Soller to the port via tram is a must do on your vacation. We arrived from Palme station via train and at the Soller station you can catch a tram down to the port. A fine view and experience.The port is worth going to if only to have a drink, something to",
          "One of the most enjoyable attractions in the Soller valley is the delightful mountain train journey between Palma and Soller town. It's not cheap but for one hour of heavenly mountain views and a wholly novel experience riding on a rickety, century old wooden train, it's well",
          "Well worth a trip as great scenery but take something warm. I was in summer clothes as it was a fairly warm day and I froze. The wind whistles through and the tunnels are freezing.",
          "This train has to be done when in Mallorca. Its small, narrow and elegant. You feel like you are in late 1800s. I enjoyed every bit of it. The train also stops for 5 minutes for a photo opportunity. I went to Soller but en route, on board this train, I saw amazing Mallorcan",
          "The tram runs around every half hour and costs \u20ac7 each, each way. The seats are a bit tight for space. Boarding the tram at each end is a bit of a rammy! You just have to put your elbows out and go for it. It takes about twenty minutes and is a nice trip. Our biggest problem was",
          "As an annual visitor to Majorca I was finally persuaded to handing over \u20ac18 + \u20ac7 for a tram ride to the Port of S\u00f3ller rather than driving. There was no problem getting a seat in Palma as mid May avoids the summer crowds. The scenery looked pretty much the same as having toured",

          "I have travelled on this train many times in the past and it is a memorable journey so an absolute must for visitors to Mallorca. So, I persuaded my husband that we had to go. I have mobility difficulties and need to use a walker. We arrived at the station to book and did not",
          "This a must do trip if staying in Palma. The train itself is delightfully quaint, made mostly of varnished wood, the carriages are small but the seats are comfortable. The route begins through the streets of Palma and very quickly rolls into open countryside. The best is yet to",
          "Good old fashioned fun hooting all the cars and pedestrians in the way of the tram. Staff friendly - guess made up for the pricey short journey of 7 Euros each whilst the bus back from Soller to Deia was just 3.50 Euro\u2019s for 2. Despite the cost have a go",
          "We did the return trip including tram to the port for only @32 each. Train was full but reasonably comfortable and able to enjoy the fantastic scenery. Soller is a great place to spend an hour or so before the tram to the port. The town is busy but quiet - no blaring music",
          "Bit pricey and not that scenic if you only go between Soller and Port de Soller. Maybe more scenic if you go to Palma. Still if you want to go between the two it\u2019s a nice way to travel!!",
          "Pricey for what it is but still a very enjoyable trip on a little bit of history. Not a huge amount to see or do in Soller, maybe an hour here before the return journey. Port de Soller is a lovely little spot to walk along the sea front and stop off for some lunch or a drink.",
          "Don't count on the timetable as they come and go as they please. \u20ac7 each each way. So if more than one person cheaper in a taxi. Taxi only \u20ac9. If you can find a taxi that Is! Pleasant trip and worth the ride o say been there done that.",
          "Lovely friendly cafe on the station in Palma. Lovely quaint train ride to Soller. Amazing views, well worth the cost of \u20ac18. Better than a taxi or bus ride on this 100 year old railway. Seats change into chosen direction. You could almost pick off the lemon and oranges on the",
          "Interesting tram ride. An old tram rides from Soller to Port de Soller. The price of the ticket is 7 euros one way, but it is an experience as if it had fallen into the old days, the tram is a logging and an old technique with wood, but a genuinely genuine that drives you along",

          "The little train runs from Soller to Palma and back, a journey of a little over an hour. It is over 100 years old and comparable to some of the narrow gauge steam railways in the UK, although it is powered by electricity. It is wonderful to see the engineering that went into",
          "This little tram is a super trip from Soller to Port de Soller and back. Some reviews have said it is expensive. But it is well worth the price to experience some old fashioned transport. Staff are friendly and well accustomed to dealing with tourists in several languages. I",
          "The Tren is good value with regular trains to and from Soller. A 30 minute journey to Soller stopping in a lovely plaza by the Church. Lively side streets with quaint shops and restaurants. There are sign posted walks back to Port De Soller that takes about 1.5 hours.",
          "Highly overrated and overrpriced! We choosed train & tram one way, expected to see beautiful landscapes and smell blossoming orange trees. In fact most of what you can see during this one hour train trip are old warehouses at the suburbs of Palma and the trees that grow along",
          "The tram costs 7 euros one way and 14 for return . It's not like the trip of your life but it costs a fortune. Don't think about walking as the route isn't too straightforward! Well, I would say one time experience, but nothing other than that.",
          "Let me begin with the way this started for me. I read up about this train ride like a zillion times before I boarded the train. I was expecting something totally different and I got an average experience. Yes the scenic beauty is mesmerising but the price doesn't justify it.",

          "Lovely historic train.",
          "Really enjoyed the train ride ~ didn't get to take the tram ride, but it was recommended by several other passengers. Not cheap ~ child prices stop very young, but that seemed to be common throughout Mallorca, and cash only. Beautiful scenery.",

          "Best enjoyed from the open platform at the end of the coach. My son found the many tunnels that make up the line all the more thrilling from this vantage point.",
          "A really beautiful, scenic ride across the mountains of mallorca. The wooden train is from the 1900s and gives it a really nice atmosphere. It stops along the most photogenic places so you can get your memories on camera and Soller itself is definitely worth a visit!",

          "Very nice experience. Bought tickets one way only. Coming back by bus will be much cheaper.",
          "The idea is good. Because you travel in a small wooden train. The hard truth is that the trip is not that beautiful. If you don't decide to go to the Port of Soller, then 2 hours are fine to check out this town.",
          "A beautiful trip on the train. Worth the money. Lovely",
          "This trip by train to S\u00f3ller was a real experience. First, we were confronted to very unfriendly people when buying the tickets in the train station from Palma side, very annoyed and not willing to give more info about the trip (luckily you \u2026",
          "I beautiful way to go from Soller to Palma",
          "The train and tram were both packed standing room only for 32\u20ac not worth it, the bus is 2.95\u20ac each way. We came back by taxi 39\u20ac. If you pay 32\u20ac you would expect a seat, just another example of ripping off the tourist.",
          "So much fun. Se.dp this ride every time we are in mallorca. The market on the other side is amazing",
          "Excellent train trip in old fashioned carriages. Go on a clear day, to maximally enjoy the view. Take the tram at the end to visit the port and the beach (don't forget to bring swimming gear).",

          "Great for kids if you want to avoid 1h ride take the train from Bunyola. Well worth it",
          "Beautiful views and a unique experience. However, the price per ticket is high at \u20ac7, especially when you are only travelling a short distance (we went from S\u00f3ller to Port de S\u00f3ller). It would have been cheaper to take a taxi for \u20ac9. Photo from the tram into Port de S\u00f3ller.",
          "Very expensive \u20ac18 each and has to be cash not worth it, go in the public bus for \u20ac3,50",
          "Expensive \u20ac25 just to go to another another town. But I think it's worth a try. At least once. Then getting the \u20ac1.50 bus back to Palma.",
          "Nice experience, should sit back, relax and enjoy :).",
          "Fun, s\u00f3ller is really nice, I'd get the train there and the bus back though. Don't bother going to the port in summer, it's so busy/overpriced and s\u00f3ller is much nicer. Maybe try getting the tram there when it's quieter to see the views?",
          "!!!Please be aware of this scam:\nWhen you ask for a combi ticket to Palma on board of the tram, they will charge 25\u20ac (=7\u20ac tram + 18\u20ac train), but give you a return ticket for the tram.",
          "Been twice now, the best way to see Mallorca.",

          "Very nice but we'll over priced!!! half the price would of been more realistic.",

          "Nice",
          "It's a classic. I suppose all kids will love it. It has got a minimum service during November-February.",
          "It was a nice ride with the train and tram, you pass through nice areas. However, i think it is so much overrated. Especially because of the price you pay:16\u20ac for the train and 6\u20ac for the tram was definetely too much. I did it because so many people talked about it but overall only 3 stars. The train itself is good for nice pictures.",
          "Lovely old train. Took aong time to clear Palma - the boring part. But views of Sollers and a photo opportunity are delightful.",

          "Not massively comfortable but it's old so that's expected. The trip is a nice length and takes in some impressive views. Well worth a trip down to the port on the tram. A nice change of pace from Palma",

Otherwise an interesting lesson in how to operate 1929 equipment in a modern context. Beware of the missing rush hour trains in the afternoon to Soller.",

        "wiki": "Palma, unofficially known as Palma de Mallorca ( or , Catalan: [\u02c8palm\u0259], Spanish: [\u02c8palma]), is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands in Spain. It is situated on the south coast of Mallorca on the Bay of Palma. The Cabrera Archipelago, though widely separated from Palma proper, is administratively considered part of the municipality. As of 2018, Palma Airport serves over 29 million passengers per year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPalma was founded as a Roman camp upon the remains of a Talaiotic settlement. The city was subjected to several Vandal raids during the fall of the Western Roman Empire, then reconquered by the Byzantine Empire, then colonised by the Moors (who called it Medina Mayurqa) and, in the 13th century, by James I of Aragon.\n\n\n=== Roman period ===\nAfter the conquest of Mallorca, the city was loosely incorporated into the province of Tarraconensis by 123 BC; the Romans founded two new cities: Palma on the south of the island, and Pollentia in the northeast \u2013 on the site of a Phoenician settlement. Whilst Pollentia acted as a port to Roman cities on the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, Palma was the port used for destinations in Africa, such as Carthage, and Hispania, such as Saguntum, Gades and Carthago Nova. Though present-day Palma has no significant remains from this period, occasional archaeological finds are made in city centre excavations.  For example, the remains of the Roman Wall can be seen at Can Bordils, the Municipal Archive, and below it, at the Maim\u00f3 ben Faraig Center.\n\n\n=== Byzantine period ===\nThough the period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Muslim conquest is not well understood (due to lack of documents), there is clear evidence of a Byzantine presence in the city, as indicated by mosaics found in the oldest parts of the Cathedral, which was in early medieval times part of a paleo-Christian temple.\n\n\n=== Muslim period ===\nBetween 902 and 1229, the city was under Islamic control. It remained the capital of the island and it was known as Medina Mayurqa, which in Arabic means \"City of Majorca\".\n\n\n==== Under the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba ====\nThe arrival of the Moors in the Balearic Islands occurred at the beginning of the 8th century. During this period, the population developed an economy based on self-sufficiency and piracy, and even showed evidence of a relative hierarchy. The dominant groups took advantage of the Byzantine withdrawal due to Islamic expansion across the Mediterranean, to reinforce their domination upon the rest of the population, thus ensuring their power and the gradual abandonment of Imperial political structures.\nIn 707, a Muslim fleet, under the command of Abd Allgaht ibn Musa, son of the governor of Ifriqiya, Musa ibn Nusayr, stopped off at the island. It appears that Abd Allah convinced the powers of the city to accept a peace treaty. This treaty was granted in exchange for a tax, respect for social, economic and political structures to the communities that subscribed to it, as well as the continuity of their religious beliefs.\nAfter 707, the city was inhabited by Christians who were nominally in allegiance to the sovereignty of the Umayyad Caliphate, yet who, de facto, enjoyed absolute autonomy. The city, being in Mallorca, constituted an enclave between western Christian and Islamic territories, and this attracted and encouraged increased levels of piracy in the surrounding waters. For wide sectors of the city's population, the sacking of ships (whether Muslim or Christian) which passed through Balearic waters was a source of riches over the next fifteen decades. Eventually, continued piracy in the region lead to a retaliation by Al-Andalus which launched a naval fleet against the city and the whole of the Islands.\nThe Islands were defended by the emperor Charlemagne in 799 from a Muslim pirate incursion.\nIn 848 (maybe 849), four years after the first Viking incursions had sacked the whole island, an attack from C\u00f3rdoba forced the authorities to ratify the treaty to which the city had submitted in 707. As the city still occupied an eccentric position regarding the commerce network established by the Moors in the western Mediterranean, the enclave was not immediately incorporated into Al-Andalus.\nWhile the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba reinforced its influence upon the Mediterranean, Al-Andalus increased its interest in the city. The consequence of this was the substitution of the submission treaty for the effective incorporation of the islands to the Islamic state. A squad under the command of Isam al-Jawlani took advantage of instability caused by several Viking incursions and disembarked in Mallorca, and after destroying any resistance, incorporated Mallorca, with Palma as its capital, to the C\u00f3rdoban state.\nThe incorporation of the city into the Emirate set the basis for a new society. Commerce and manufacturing developed in a manner that was previously unknown. This caused considerable demographic growth, thereby establishing Medina Mayurqa as one of the major ports for trading goods in and out of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba.\n\n\n==== D\u00e9nia\u2014Balearic taifa (1015\u20131087) ====\n\nThe Umayyad regime, despite its administrative centralisation, mercenary army and struggle to gain wider social support, could neither harmonise the various ethnic groups inside al-Andalus nor dissolve the old tribes which still organised sporadic ethnic fighting. During the 11th century, the Caliphate's control waned considerably. Provinces broke free from the central Cordoban administration, and became effectively sovereign states \u2014 taifas \u2014 under the same governors that had been named by the last Umayyad Caliphs. According to their origin, these \"taifas\" can be grouped under three broad categories: people of Arab, Berber or Slavic origin.\nPalma was part of the taifa of D\u00e9nia. The founder of this state was a client of the Al-Mansur family, Muyahid ibn Yusuf ibn Ali, who could profit from the progressive crumbling of the Caliphate's superstructure to gain control over the province of D\u00e9nia. Subsequently, Muyahid organised a campaign throughout the Balearic Islands to consolidate the district and incorporated it into their \"taifa\" in early 1015.\nDuring the following years Palma became the main port from where attacks on Christian vessels and coasts could be launched. Palma was the base from where a campaign against Sardinia was launched between 1016 and 1017, which caused the Pisans and Genoese forces to intervene. Later, this intervention set the basis for Italian mercantile penetration of the city.\nThe Denian dominion lasted until 1087, a period during which the city, as well as the rest of the islands, was relatively peaceful. Their supremacy at sea was still not rivalled by the Italian merchant republics, thus there were few external threats.\n\n\n==== Balearic Taifa (1087\u20131115) and Western Mediterranean ====\nThe Banu Hud conquest of D\u00e9nia and its incorporation to the Eastern district of the taifa of Zaragoza meant the destruction of the legacy of Muyahid. The islands were freed from mainland dominion and briefly enjoyed independence, during which Medina Mayurqa was the capital.\nThe economy during this period depended on both agriculture and piracy. In the latter 11th century, Christian commercial powers took the initiative at sea against the Muslims. After centuries of fighting defensively in the face of Islamic pressure, Italians, Catalans and Occitans took offensive action. Consequently, the benefits of piracy diminished causing severe economic stress on the city.\nThe clearest proof of the new ruling relation of forces, from 1090, is the Crusade organised by the most important mercantile cities of the Christian states against the Islands. This effort was destined to finally eradicate Muslim piracy mainly based in Palma and surrounding havens. In 1115, Palma was sacked and later abandoned by an expedition commanded by Ramon Berenguer III the Great, count of Barcelona and Provence, which was composed of Catalans, Pisans and other Italians, and soldiers from Provence, Corsica, and Sardinia, in a struggle to end Almoravid control.\nAfter this, the Islands became part of the Almoravid dynasty. The inglobement of all the taifa to a larger state helped to re-establish a balance along the frontier that separated western Christian states from the Muslim world.\n\n\n==== Period of the Banu Ganiya (1157\u20131203) ====\nThe situation changed in the mid-12th century, when the Almoravids were displaced from al-Andalus and western Maghreb by the Almohad. Almoravid dominions, from 1157 on, were restricted to the Balearic Islands, with Palma again acting as the capital, governed by Muhammad ibn Ganiya. Massive arrival of al-Andalus refugees contributed to reinforce the positions of the last Almoravid legitimatists, the Banu Ganiya, who, conscious of their weakness in the Western Mediterranean context, started to get closer to the growing powers represented by Italian maritime republics. Genoa and Pisans obtained in this period their first commercial concessions in the city and the rest of the islands.\nThe Banu Ganiya, taking advantage of the great loss suffered by Abu Yuqub Yusuf in the Siege of Santar\u00e9m, attacked Ifriqiya, where the Almohad dominion had not been consolidated yet, in the same year. However, this attack was repelled and the Almohad authorities encouraged anti-Almoravid revolts in the Islands. The city was captured by the Almohads in 1203.\n\n\n=== Christian reconquest and late Middle Ages ===\n\nOn 31 December 1229, after three months of siege, the city was reconquered by James I of Aragon and was renamed Ciutat de Mallorca (Mallorca City). In addition to being kept as capital of the Kingdom of Majorca, it was given a municipality that comprised the whole island. The governing arm was the University of the City and Kingdom of Majorca.\nAfter the death of James I of Aragon, Palma became joint capital of the Kingdom of Majorca, together with Perpignan. His son, James II of Majorca, championed the construction of statues and monuments in the city: Bellver Castle, the churches of St. Francesc and St. Domingo, reformed the Palace of Almudaina and began the construction of the Cathedral of Majorca.\n\nIn 1391, anti-Jewish riots broke out. The Jewish community of Inca was completely wiped out, as were those of S\u00f3ller, Sineu, and Alcudia. In spite of the governor's prohibition on leaving the island, many Jews fled to North Africa. The remaining Jews were forced to convert under threat of death.Abraham Cresques was a 14th-century Jewish cartographer of the Majorcan cartographic school from Palma; Cresques is credited with the authorship of the famous Catalan Atlas.\nThe river that cut through the city gave rise to two distinct areas within the city; the \"Upper town\" and \"Lower town\", depending upon which side of the river one was situated.\n\nThe city's advantageous geographical location allowed it extensive commerce with Catalonia, Valencia, Provence, the Maghreb, the Italian republics and the dominions of the Great Turk, which heralded a golden age for the city.\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, the Rebellion of the Brotherhoods (a peasant uprising against Charles V's administration) and the frequent attack of Turkish and Berber pirates caused a reduction of commercial activities and a huge inversion in defensive structures. As a consequence, the city entered a period of decadence that would last till the end of the 17th century.\n\n\n=== 17th to 19th centuries ===\n\nThe 17th century was characterised by the division of the city into two sides or gangs, named Canamunts and Canavalls (from Majorcan Catalan \"the ones from the upper/lower side\"), with severe social and economic repercussions. During this period, the port became a haven for pirates. During the last quarter of the century, the Inquisition continued its persecution of the city's Jews, locally called xuetes.\nThe fall of Barcelona in 1714 meant the end of the War of the Spanish Succession and the defeat and destruction of the Crown of Aragon, and this was reflected on the Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip V of Spain in 1715. These occupation decrees changed the government of the island and separated it from the municipality's government of Palma, which became the official city name. By the end of the 19th century, the name  Palma de Mallorca was generalised in written Spanish, although it is still colloquially named Ciutat (\"city\") in Catalan. In the 18th century Charles III of Spain removed interdiction of commerce with Spanish colonies in America and the port and commercial activity of the city grew once again.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Palma became a refuge for many who had exiled themselves from the Napoleonic occupation of Catalonia and Valencia; during this period freedom flourished, until the absolutist restoration. With the establishment of contemporary Spanish state administrative organization, Palma became the capital of the new Balearic Islands province in the 1833 territorial division of Spain. The French occupation of Algeria in the 19th century ended the fear of Maghrebi attacks in Majorca, which favoured the expansion of new maritime routes, and consequently, the economic growth of the city.\n\n\n=== Modern period ===\n\nSince the advent of mass tourism in the 1950s, the city has been transformed into a tourist destination and has attracted many workers from mainland Spain. This has contributed to a huge change in the city's traditions, its language, and its economic power.\nThe boom in tourism has caused Palma to grow significantly. In 1960, Mallorca received 500,000 visitors, in 1997 it received more than 6,739,700. In 2001 more than 19,200,000 people passed through Son Sant Joan airport near Palma, with an additional 1.5 million coming by sea.\nIn the 21st century, urban redevelopment, by the so-called Pla Mirall (English \"Mirror Plan\"), had attracted groups of immigrant workers from outside the European Union, especially from Africa and South America.\nMore than half of the population works in tourism, approximately 80%, therefore being the main economic portal of Palma. Tourism has affected the rapid economic growth of Palma, making the island of Mallorca wealthier compared to other regions in Spain.\nThe second economic portal of Palma is agriculture. Main exports of Palma's agriculture are, almonds, oranges, lemons and olives. The island is also gifted with a wide variety of natural resources, such as mines of copper, lead and marble.The city also has several surrounding neighborhood communities including Establiments, Nord, Son Espanyol, Ces Cases Noves, and Sa Creu Vermella.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPalma is a major city and seaport located in the southwest of Mallorca, a western mediterranean island belonging to the Balearic Islands archipelago. The land area of the city is about 21.355 square kilometres (8.245 sq mi) with an altitude of 13 metres (43 feet) above sea level.\nThe city center of Palma is located north of the homonymous bay (Badia de Palma in the local Catalan language). The area that extends eastwards is mostly a flat fertile plain known as Es Pla. To the north and west, the city borders the Serra de Tramuntana, the island's major mountain range and a Unesco World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs of the 2009 census, the population of the city of Palma proper was 401,270, and the population of the entire urban area was 550,000, making it the twelfth largest urban area of Spain. By the start of 2019 the population of the city had risen to 416,065. Almost half of the total population of Mallorca lives in Palma.\nAs of 2017 over 60,000 non-Spanish foreigners registered with the town hall lived in Palma; the registered foreign population from 2016 to 2017 declined by 832, the numerically highest decline in the Balearics.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPalma has a Mediterranean climate, the climate classification named after the sea surrounding the city. There is a significant maritime influence to the mild winters, but summers are warmed by the surrounding continental landmasses. These warm up the offshore sea surface temperatures compared to in an ocean and as a result the small confines of Mallorca are still able to build up and sustain heat in spite of being on an island. There is vast seasonal lag, especially in late summer courtesy of the sea water peaking in temperatures long after the summer solstice.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya ===\nThe Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya is the transport hub of Palma. The Estaci\u00f3 Intermodal caters for buses and trains (the latter controlled by TIB). The two old buildings are home to the tourist information centre and several caf\u00e9s sit either side of the two large escalators which lead into the Estaci\u00f3, which sits underneath a large and popular park. On the lawns are several glass boxes, which let in light and ventilation to the station below ground. There are also train-themed playing structures, each one shaped like a train carriage and named after towns along the line of the Ferrocarril de S\u00f3ller, a railway dating back to 1911 which has its Palma Station right next to the park. Just down the street from here a new bus station is under construction. At the centre of the plaza is a statue of James I, Conquistador of Majorca.\n\n\n=== Cathedral area ===\n\nPalma is famous for La Seu, its vast cathedral built on a previous mosque which was built atop an original Christian church. Although construction of the present Cathedral began in 1229, it did not finish until 1601. Local architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed was drafted in to restore the building in 1901. The Parc de la Mar (Park of the Sea) lies just south, overlooked by the great building which sits above it on the city's stone foundations. Between the two are the town walls.\n\n\n=== The Rocks ===\nThe rocks located a short walk from the cathedral are a place of calm and tranquility.\n\n\n=== Old city ===\n\nThe Old City (in the south-east area of Palma behind the cathedral) is a maze of streets clearly hinting at an Arab past. With the exception of a few streets and squares which allow traffic and are populated with tourists most of the time, the walkways of this city quarter are fairly narrow, quiet streets, surrounded by a diverse range of interesting buildings, the architecture of which is comparable to cities such as Florence. The majority are private houses, some of which are open to the public as discreet museums or galleries. The Old City is also home to the Ajuntament (or Town Hall), the Convent of the Cathedral and the Banys \u00c0rabs.\n\n\n==== Banys \u00c0rabs ====\n\nThe Banys \u00c0rabs, or Arab Baths, one of the few remnants of Palma's Moorish past , are accessed via the quiet Ca'n Serra street near the Convent of the Cathedral, and include the lush gardens of Ca'n Fontirroig, home to Sardinian warblers, house sparrows, cacti, palm trees and a wide range of flowers and ferns. The small two-roomed brick building that once housed the baths is of Byzantine origin, dating back to the 11th century and possibly once part of the home of a Muslim nobleman. The bathroom has a cupola with five oculi which let in dazzling light. The twelve columns holding up the small room were pillaged from an earlier Roman construction. The floor over the hypocaust has been worn away by people standing in the centre, mainly to photograph the entrance and the garden beyond it. The whole room is in a rather dilapidated condition. The other room is a brick cube with a small model of the baths as they once were in the corner.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nNotable people who were born in the city include the following individuals.\n\n\u00c1lex Abrines, basketball player for the Oklahoma City Thunder\nMarco Asensio, footballer for Real Madrid\nConcha Buika, singer\nRudy Fern\u00e1ndez, basketball player for Real Madrid\nRamon Llull, philosopher and writer\nJorge Lorenzo, motorcyclist and five time MotoGP champion\nJoan Mir, motorcyclist and moto 3 champion\nGuillermo Pont, footballer\nLuis Salom, motorcyclist\nAgust\u00ed Villaronga, filmmaker\nRossy de Palma, actress\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nFootball is the most popular sport on the island, led by the Palma-based Segunda Divisi\u00f3n club Real Mallorca, who play at the Estadi de Son Moix, and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B club CD Atl\u00e9tico Baleares.\nBasketball is also a popular sport. Palma's top team is CB Bah\u00eda San Agust\u00edn, which plays its home games at the 5,076 capacity Palau Municipal d'Esports Son Moix.\nBecause of its maritime location all sea sports have also a big presence in Palma. Maybe the most important sporting event in the city is the Ciutat de Palma Prizes.\nRoad cycling is very popular in Mallorca. An international race for professional cyclists, the Vuelta a Mallorca, is held in February, the first day of which consists of a circuit race around the streets of Palma. The city is also home to the Palma Arena, a multi-platinum venue featuring a velodrome. The arena also hosted the Battle of Surfaces tennis event.\nIn June 2016, the city of Palma participated in the First World Company Sports Games which included five days of culture, sport and inclusivity within the community of Mallorca as a whole. It was operated through the World Federation Company Sport and was promoted for both local people and tourists to come together in the city. It became a large business venture by offering packages including accommodations close to the events and additional tourism information for future events.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPalma de Mallorca Metro\nMajorca rail network\nPalma de Mallorca Airport\nThe city bus system, which includes a loop line through the historic centre, is run by the EMT (See external link below).\nThere is also a bus system run by the TIB. This includes routes to and from the municipalities Calvi\u00e0 and Palma.\nIn the City of Palma there is a fleet of 1246 taxis. All equipped with air conditioning and most of them have a radiotelephone station, with four existing companies: Taxis Palma Radio, Radio-Taxi Ciutat, Taxi Tel\u00e9fono and Taxis adapted for users with reduced mobility. Until the change of colour regulated through the Municipal Decree No. 19985 of 15 October 1999, the taxis of Palma for 50 years had been of the characteristic black and ivory colours. Currently they are white.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nPalma de Mallorca is twinned with:\n\n Naples, Italy\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDuchess of Palma de Mallorca\nEdwin Lewis Snyder, \"Spain's Magic Island\", The Architect and Engineer, 110:10, 37\u201345, August 1932\nList of municipalities in Balearic Islands\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPalma sightseeing guide\nPalma de Mallorca\u00b4s city council\nOfficial Website for Tourism in Mallorca",

        "wiki": "Es Baluard Museu d\u2019Art Modern i Contemporani de Palma, located in Palma and inaugurated on 30 January 2004, has a reserve of more than 700 works of art linked to artists from the Balearic Islands and/or of international renown.\nAs well as conserving and publicising its collection, Es Baluard runs a programme of temporary exhibitions, cultural activities and educational and training cycles. The main artists and movements related to the Balearic Islands form a body which took shape after the initial presentation of the collection which was made in the year the museum opened. \nSince then, the original nucleus of the museum\u2019s reserves \u2013 made up of donations and the deposit of works by the Art Serra Foundation (Fundaci\u00f3 d\u2019Art Serra), as well as works deposited by Palma City Council (Ajuntament de Palma), the Council of Mallorca (Consell de Mallorca) and the Government of the Balearic Islands (Govern de les Illes Balears) \u2013 has been added to as a result of the introduction of further works that have been acquired, donated and temporarily ceded by artists, collectors and entities.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe main building was designed in 2003 by Llu\u00eds Garc\u00eda-Ruiz, Jaume Garc\u00eda-Ruiz, Vicente Tom\u00e1s and Angel S\u00e1nchez Cantalejo. It has a total surface area of 5,027 m\u00b2, of which 2,500 are used as exhibition spaces. It is divided into three storeys which are connected to the outside, to the city walls and to each other by means of ramps, skylights and large interior balconies, in an attempt to reflect an indoor street concept.\n\n\n== The collection ==\n\nThe Collection of Es Baluard Museu d\u2019Art Modern i Contemporani de Palma includes works of art by the most significant artists and movements that have converged in the past and continue to converge in the Balearic Islands, from the late 19th century to the present.\nIt begins with the works of pictorial modernism and the renovation of the landscape genre in Spain, showcasing the importance of Mallorca in its development. Joaquim Mir, Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol, Hermen Anglada-Camarasa, Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla, Antoni Gelabert and Tito Cittadini are some of the key artists from this period, placed between the late 19th century and the 1930s; alongside them are two female creators, Pilar Montaner de Sureda and Norah Borges, who were associated to the artistic and literary trends of the day.The early years of the 20th century, meanwhile, bear witness to the emergence in Europe of the different avant-garde movements which rebelled against the hegemony of western figurative art, a state of cultural crisis that was heightened after World War One and which would continue in the 1940s and \u201850s, advocating a questioning of the artistic object. The artists represented include Mar\u00eda Blanchard, Wifredo Lam, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Roberto Matta, Joan Mir\u00f3, Robert Motherwell, Jorge Oteiza, Picasso, Juli Ramis and Antoni T\u00e0pies, among others.\nNew figuration, pop, minimalism or conceptual art are just some of the tendencies that arose from the \u2018sixties onwards, a period in which social and cultural ensued and which would later be called \u201cpostmodernism\u201d. Erwin Bechtold, Joan Brossa, Err\u00f3, Juan Genov\u00e9s, Hans Hartung, Rebecca Horn, Antoni Miralda, Pablo Palazuelo, Antonio Saura and Rafael Tur Costa, for example, precede the new generation of recognised painters: Miquel Barcel\u00f3, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Broto, Miguel \u00c1ngel Campano, Maria Carbonero, Ramon Canet, Luis Gordillo, Anselm Kiefer and Juan Usl\u00e9.\nA wide diversity of languages shapes today\u2019s artistic panorama, with creators such as Lida Abdul, Marina Abramovi\u0107, Pilar Albarrac\u00edn, Christian Boltanski, Daniel Canogar, Toni Catany, \u00d1aco Fabr\u00e9, M\u00f3nica Fuster, Alberto Garc\u00eda-Alix, N\u00faria Marqu\u00e9s, Jorge Mayet, Joan Morey, Michael Najjar, Marina N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Bernard\u00ed Roig, Francisco Ruiz de Infante, Amparo Sard, Antoni Soc\u00edas and Nicholas Woods as examples of this evolution of contemporary artistic practice.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Es Baluard museum website",

          "Lovely museum for its architecture and calm spacious feel, with views from the roof and a walk way, cleverly constructed in combination with the old building. Interesting exhibitions when we visited, and some good Spanish art in the permanent exhibition. We also ate outside",
          "... incorporated into an old fort, but hardly any art to see! No temporary exhibition and only a small amount to see in the permanent collection - mostly Joan Miro pieces. Having said that, the staff are very welcoming and helpful, and we didn\u2019t have to pay to enter. The walk",
          "Nice building, friendly staff, amazing rooftop views but the art itself is super limited and in our opinion not very good. Don't bother with the permanent collection unless it's not for the art that you go",
          "Hoped for more if I\u2019m honest, but if you like Miro definitely worth a visit. Upstairs floor wasn\u2019t open and downstairs was just plan odd, so got the feeling that in peak season they up their game.",
          "We never made it inside, ran out of time during our time in Palma but did manage to check out most of the pieces on the outside that are simply magical. What a setting too, its incredible and worth at least a walk around. We hope to come back and check out the rest",
          "The exhibition is inside the fortress, which stands at the east side mouth of the small river running through the city. It is not clear how old the fortress is, but it seems several centuries. Very well preserved walls and ramparts, and the grounds have a few sculptures, some",
          "Not being an art lover at all but after walking around the city and seeing all the varied sculpture's dotted around it is well worth a visit and it is in a great location.",
          "Nice surrounding with the castle walls which co yeast with the contemporary modern art. Quite and interesting- worth a look.",
          "On our last day of vacation, we were basically wandering around trying to find something to do because it was a religious Feast day and many sites and locations were closed and I was so excited we happened upon this place. It was very cheap, had air conditioning, the exhibits",
          "Really enjoyed our visit here, sadly the lower floor was closed but we loved the permanent exhibits especially the interactive aspects of the museum. A lovely view of Palma from the top of the museum as well that is definitely worth paying entry for!",
          "A superb gallery where everything well displayed if of course the exhibition suits. I enjoyed part of it and it was a little quirky which is fine but it should work! One floor not available and an upper floor with next to nothing on it so in fact quite a small exhibition. I am",
          "My Wife and I loved this place. It was without doubt a highlight of our visit to the Island. Even if Modern Art is not your bag,the Building and its surroundings are wonderful.We also enjoyed the current exhibition,but we do go to the Venice Biennale, so know what to expect.The",
          "If you go to the museum on Fridays, then you can pay what you like (subject to a minimum of 10 cents). That\u2019s probably a good day to go, assuming that your visiting day is flexible. The museum is spacious and easy to navigate around. On the day of our visit \u2013 exhibitions may",
          "Not worth visiting here. View from the terrace was the only bit worth seeing. Spend your time elsewhere.",
          "As with all modern art galleries there is always something interesting or surprising-here it is the outside.",
          "This is a very peculiar place. The museum is an open-air space which fusions the ancient defensive bulwark and contemporaneous art.",
          "This is well worth a visit - witty and innovative pieces of art that challenge and excite. One piece made a range of suggestive noises as you hugged it !! The gallery staff were most helpful and informative. There is a stylish architectural integration of the old city walls",
          "Stunning historic setting to have lunch overlooking the Marina. Service was profession and food was nicely presented and delicious. San Miguel beer on tap.",
          "If you like that sort of thing, you'll see quite an array of it. Things like an installation that instantaneously creates a portrait of you made out of flies. But whether you like that or not, be sure to go outside and see the view from here. Spectacular.",
          "Right in the heart of Palma, you'll have a nice walk from the city centre and then when you get to the top of the museum, go to the terrace and you'll get a nice view of the city. As a museum it was OK, some rooms were closed due to oncoming exhibition, so we haven't seen",
          "Some great installations - some truly awful installations - some good art - some bad art- architecturally awesome and views to die for",
          "I probably visited at a bad time, as there was no exhibitions on the first floor, and only one room open on the ground floor. I find it strange that they don\u2019t plan the changes better. However they did inform me when I bought my ticket and the price was reduced. In the basement",
          "This is the \"Museum of contemporary Arts\" in Palma de Mallorca, which has (with abundant financial means from the European Union) been _really carefully_ embedded into the ancient harbor-fortifications of the Port de Palma de Mallorca. Alike many other Museums of contemporary",
          "An amazing space with contemporary art of all sorts. Very spacious galleries with places to sit and contemplate. Welcome external spaces around the old walls with good marina and harbour views. Cafe area, rest rooms. It is a must even if you are not sure about the art.",
          "This outdoor area surrounds the Modern Art Museum and the bar /restaurant. Great examples of modern architecture to observe and fantastic views of the Cathedral ,marina and coastline on Palma. Seating for sunbathing and a drink at the bar is smart and one of the best places to",
          "Some quite wacky contemporary art here but interesting. The building itself is up against the old walls of the city and there are some amazing views from the top. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "An imposing space, large enough to hold monumental sculpture on the grounds and give it space to express itself. An eclectic selection inside with a permanent collection of Spanish and Mallorquin art and a temporary space of quirky bits. Great views across the bay.",
          "If you are fond of modern art, you will enjoy this broad spectrum indoor-outdoor experience. If you have never been to a modern art museum, this is a great place to start.",
          "Imaginatively accommodated in a bastion that once formed part of Palma's defences, this is a a spacious gallery on different levels. The collection of contemporary art is generally underwhelming, but the views over the city and towards the sea make any visit worthwhile.",
          "A beautiful contemporary building wedged into the ancient ramparts of the city - lots of striking angles and textures and deiberate open sections where you glimpse sections of the ancient walls. A huge roof terrace too with great views of the city. There is a lot of Miro Miro on",
          "We were recommended to try this Museum's terrace area for lunch... what a great venue and fabulous views over the port. Food and service were very good, highly recommend anyone who wants to chill out to visit.",

          "Me and my wife went there the other day during our vacation. We were attended by a very nice young lady with curly hair who helped us decide our drinks. Thanks to her I tried a Majorcan drink I didn\u2019t know existed. Couldn\u2019t be more satisfied with the staff and the place is also",
          "We had very high expectations for this modern art museum and were completely disappointed. There were not many works of art on display, poorly laid out with lots of walking between galleries. As far as I am concerned it is one of the worst art museums I have visited in Europe.",
          "This gallery is housed in a brilliant building which is in the old town and a great mix of contemporary and historic architecture. The art pieces inside and outside are a fantastic mix of contemporary works including many by Miro but also pieces by a variety of other artists. I",
          "Spent most of the morning in Es Baluard last Friday. Superb Miro collection and the Bernardi Roig exhibition was exceptional. We also loved the outdoor spaces giving some cracking views of Palma",
          "Walking around in the old town, we decided to visit this museum in a cloudy but hot day in Palma. The building is very interesting, with sharp angular lines and lots of glass. Inside it is interesting too, with a concept of modern gallery. There was an exhibition of modern art,",
          "Exhibition in the basement is not for the faint hearted, certainly unsuitable for families and mixed age groups. There are no warnings about this, certainly not in English. If you want to be disturbed and possibly offended and shocked as I am told by those in the know, is the",
          "We have been here many times before and a visit to Mallorca would now not seem complete without an afternoon visit to this establishment! Only a short walk out of the city centre is the museum of modern and contemporary art and alongside is this wonderful little bar/restaurant.",
          "Really enjoyed this modern art museum - interestingly presented collection really well curated in a great space. Also recommend the cafe/bar/restaurant with its amazing views from the terrace.",
          "Relatively quiet when we visited and some interesting pieces around including the original (miniature) upside down church - the large one is on a piece of land outside the front entrance and has its own entry on TA. The outside terraces give you a great view of the city and",
          "Having been to contemporary art museums all over the world, this is one of the best. This is because I wasn't expecting too much from a relatively small museum in a city not particularly associated with massive artistic achievement - though Spain should never be overlooked in",
          "In a city so laden with history, and in a climate so conducive to relaxation and leisure, it would seem easy to miss a museum of contemporary and \"modern\" art. However it would be a mistake to miss out on a such an opportunity. The permanent collection is from the 19th and 20th",
          "Excellent museum with a variety of art works and installations on display Closed Mondays FREE FRIDAYS !! ( hidden in the small print ) you can leave a donation if you like , excellent views from the terraces and nice cafe Well worth a visit ( lots of steps !!! Uneven surfaces",
          "It is reasonably priced at 6 euro per ticket and it is easy to find. While I enjoyed the works of Miro, I did not fully appreciate other exhibits - but this is modern art. What I loved the most is the building, the space and how it is used and the location of the museum.",
          "Collection is not that interesting if you are not very into Miro, but building is great, modern, pretty and has good views from the top terrace. And they have nice restaurant with food served all day (not that common in Spain).",
          "This wasn\u2019t busy when we went so we were able to just wander around and enjoy what was on offer. There was a series of films by Angela Horn which were fun on the upper floor. By comparison, there were more films by Roig in the basement. These were interesting, shall we say.",
          "A journey of contrasts and discovery with the ancient walls juxtaposed with stark concrete, vaulted galleries and flat rooftops with amazing city views, sculptures demanding both investigation and curiosity, and other works ranging from whimsical to heart-wrenching. As",
          "This museum of modern art is build inside the walls of the old city. A lot of concrete was needed to make this modern construction. Unfortunately when I visited, there was no temporary exposition. So it was rather a short visit along the permanent collection which is rather",
          "Free entry into the site but a modest fee for the art gallery. While we enjoyed the site which has some interesting large pieces the gallery for us held few attraction being mainly contempory and a bit too contempory for us. It was pleasant to sit outside at the cafe but rather",
          "The original sea wall is now inland but has been beautifully integrated into the urban landscape. At the South West of Palma The Es Baluard complex is a fusion of modern design of the Museum and Restaurant with the original fortifications. It has a panoramic view of the Royal",
          "Not only contemporary Mallorcan artists, but a few Picassos, Leger and others but also a stunning roof which is quite unmissable with wonderful views of the city. Treat yourself to lunch whilst there on the outdoor terrace. You won\u2019t regret it",
          "Great area next to the harbour. Lovely modern design, and thought provoking exhibits. Good views as the building is stylized with the existing fortress. So good for a walk and a relax.",
          "Some really interesting exhibits which were quite thought provoking. A video of migrants fleeing Turkey in the pouring rain with their belongings. Names of people from around the world fled to San Pao in Brazil.",
          "Stunning views of the Harbour area, the cathedral etc from the top of the gallery. Delicious lunch, sitting outside in November -we were very fortunate -but the inside is equally smart and attractive and most inviting too.. Food beautifully presented and charming staff.",
          "My wife and I loved this museum. The outdoor areas offer breathtaking views and the contemporary art displayed is high quality. It offers a delightful experience.",
          "Nice collection. Some lesser known and dark Miro, funny art in the Ciutad de Vacances. The Shirin Neshat was a revelation. But the building itself outrivals the collection as a piece of art. Absolutely recommended.",
          "We visited the rooftop bar at the museum which has amazing views over the port. It is a lively bar with nice seating area. They serve food in the restaurant which looked really good but we just had drinks. We were there on a Friday evening so there was a really good athmosphere.",
          "We like the museum and it's exhibits. Each time we visit there's something new to see. We also like the restaurant that overlooks the harbour. Great for a relaxing afternoon with a drink and some simple food.",
          "An ideal bit of culture on a wet day, interesting permanent exhibits and a large temporary one. Nothing too foreboding.",
          "We visited here for lunch with my daughter in law, her mum and our 14mth old grandson on a very,very warm day (39c). It was reasonably busy but not full and we initially thought it would be best to sit outside in the shade on the terrace. This was air-conditioned and much",
          "don't miss it during your holiday, nice exhibitions, friendly staff, many Miro paintings, loved the view from the terrace",
          "Had drinks & tapas in an amazing setting with a good friend while visiting Majorca. Beautiful rooftop patio overlooking the cathedral and waterfront was a great place to have leisurely drinks and snacks while watching the sunset. Very reasonable prices and excellent server!",
          "This very fine building in an original way integrate parts of the old city walls and modern architecture. Do not miss the rooftop walkway with a very fine view to the Palma bay and the lowest level of the building \u2013 the Aljub, a former water reservoir, now used for among other",
          "This gallery has been built in to the old city wall so from the outside you would not realise it was there. It houses different exhibits of a modern/contemporary nature. My son aged 12 really loved seeing the Miro and Picasso on display. It is a small gallery but worth",
          "Incredible building...the museum is exquisite. A mix of old and new, Es Baluard is an example of what happens when smart design is applied to architecture. Form and function at its best here. I loved the rooftop...don't miss this part!",
          "Ingeniously built into part of Palmas old city wall, this gallery has few works of great interest and costs 7 euros to enter. There are a number of Miro works and a small Dali drawing underneath an interesting photo of a man holding a revolver. The rooftop gives a good view of",
          "Great place to visit. The fix collection is really nice. It's small but worth the visit for us. And the architecture is a must see for us. The restaurant with fabulous view on the harbour is really good!",
          "interesting architecture, make sure you walk on the top of the building to get the full impact of the place, as well as viewing the art inside - and the terrace outside for a drink to take in the views",
          "Although the location is very special indeed, the evening food on offer was dreadful. Returned chicken twice, and walked out after pointing out the dangers of raw chicken.",
          "Art is very subjective and this is a museum that, for me, does nothing. Watching a video of a man who looks like Uncle Festa dragging an illuminated candelabra round his g8arden at night baffles me. Looking at the reviews, Kings new clothes syndrome , I think .",
          "An interesting building and attractive cafe. The view from the walkway worth the trip but sadly, the Art work was strangely exhibited and in our opinion totally underwhelming. The pile of ? wood shavings on the floor of one gallery caused amusement even amongst the members of",
          "The buildings are architecturally very successful, perfectly designed for the function. You can see quite a few great Miros, some Picassos, Tapiese and others. The outside sculptures contribute to the great overall impression. And so does the walk on the roof, you can see the",
          "We were a family of 5 and there is an entrance cost but 13 euros which is reasonable when you are : Getting culturally enlightened Keeping out of the sun, in aircon Keeping the kids entertained with some thought-provoking pieces which have left an impression on my lot(guns, an",
          "Any gallery review will be highly subjective - all depends on your own tastes - personally, I loved our visit to this art space last week. The building has used its space pretty well and what is on display is quite a mix - from the cavernous space in the lower part to rooftop",

          "I wish all those responsible for the cultural life in Palma to continue on this path. It's a beginning, with a couple of well-known classics (L\u00e9ger, Picasso and - of course - Mir\u00f3) and a \"local\" surprise or two from the end beginning of the twentieth century. I do hope that the",
          "A decidedly average gallery in every respect. Miros by the mile but you'd expect that, and they are far from his best work. Everything else is derivative and not what you'd hope to see. The architects did a spectacular jobbing fitting this inside an old fort and it is worth",
          "..and a really nice (and small) collection of modern art. The terrace of the cafe is reserved for eating. If you are only in for drinks you will not be able to enjoy the magnificent view over the port and city, but during your visit to the museum you will get plenty of that.",
          "A lovely place to relax outdoors in the sun... we stayed an hour or so.. the sofas and the bamboo screens make you feel cool and rested. We didn't eat here, just coffee but the food looked good and the indoor restaurant looked inviting.",
          "Worh visiting just to be able to have a view from the towers, nevertheless he have an amazing collection of Miro's paintings and sculptures and some Picaso's paintings and Vases that are very interesting and beautiful , had a great time visiting and after go to the roof and have",
          "Gentle walk along the Marina to the museum. Very minimalist museum with not that many exhibits. Smart restaurant and coffee shop. Depends on whether you enjoy trips to the Guggenheims!",
          "This place is great for a nice romantic meal or a large group of friends. The food is great and has not disappointed me yet. It's also a great place to sit back relax with a gin in the sunshine after work, or to start a big night out. An all round great place!",
          "A bonus of Es Baluard is that several areas and terraces are open freely without buying a ticket to the museum. The museum itself is a serious contemporary gallery with some challenging and fascinating exhibits including a group of video exhibits on for just a few more days.",
          "Walked around Museum, very interesting and the modern architecture integrates well with the old stone walls. We did not go into the museum itself but instead enjoyed a relaxing lunch in the restaurant, with its outdoor area and very pleasant setting. Having read some reviews we",
          "The architect turned this place into a gem. Within the ancient fort they were able to create a 3 floor modern museum with museum shop and added a coffee shop and restaurant with a terrace and splendid view of the bay and the cathedral.",
          "This contemporary art gallery has been constructed within the old city walls of Palma. The exhibition spaces and outside features are beautiful, on lots of levels, and on the top, affording magnificent panoramic views. The art work there is not quite so impressive, but we loved",
          "They sure did things right in building the Es Baluard. We enjoyed the current exhibit of video art downstairs and much of the permanent collection. And of course a walk on the ramparts above.",
          "This small collection of modern art is worth the visit, with ever changing visiting pictures and well arranged collections it provides a nice hour of art appreciation. The coffee shop/ restaurant overlooking the sea is a definite treat afterwards with great B views and service.",
          "An amazing building that houses fantastic artwork and installations over two different levels. Do not miss if you love modern art.",
          "This is primarily an Art (my Capital A) gallery / museum but it offers so much more. Stunning architecture, Panoramic views, a rooftop walk, a very hip restaurant cum bar and paintings new and old. Oh, and 'installations'. There is a Picasso and Miro or two but the bulk of the",
          "It's more just a gallery, with a small collection of modern art. Most of which is terrible. Gobsmacked at how dire a lot of it is, very much the emperor's new clothes However, only 6 Euros to get in, and it was raining....",
          "Little did we know but Tuesday visits are free for tourists! A museum dedicated to modern art and well spread out also exhibits outside where you get great views of cathedral and surrounds. There is a good looking restaurant and outside bar, well worth a visit. The entrance is",
          "went to museum for my birthday beautiful building and eye opening exhibits, also lovely cafe bar with friendly staff",
          "Worth visiting for the views of Palma from the building. The architecture of the building is exciting with monumental concrete interior walls and space as a lining to the old stone walls of the city. The art collection itself is bitty and uncoordinated with presentation notes",
          "We enjoyed an a evening drink on the gallery courtyard several times on holiday at a nearby hotel. We have visited here in previous years. The views are stunning as the sun goes down, highlighting the cathedral on one side and castle Bellver lit up on the other side. Sadly,",
          "The museum is perfectly located in the old interior of the fortress... It is so amazing to see the great city at your feet when you're on top of the old walls! The exhibitions and paintings are some of them strange, some of them beautiful - very personal... Bou is really so",
          "This could be something fantastic but the service was poor and they all looked a bit grumpy. My partner had chickenburger for dinner and the chicken was still raw and bloody inside. I had tuna and this was good. I would not go back mainly because of the service. Ok for a glas",
          "The gallery is an interesting space but some of the installations/exhibits were rather ''out there\" even for my taste. The paintings are worth a look and as we bought tickets in the afternoon we got a reduced rate. \u20ac4.50 each. The views from the roof are excellent. We were going",
          "Large, clear and well laid out the exhibition is a joy to walk around. The old fort is the keeper of the art, and it has a wide range. Plenty of chances for some great photos from the high viewpoint and a good cafe for lunch. So pleased we made a visit. Excellent.",
          "An interesting gallery set in an attractive building. As well as the main collection don't miss the views from the rooftop. The restaurant/bar has an enviable location and serves good food.",
          "Exciting museum. The building is the old renovated fortress full of contemporary art. Outside there is a sculpture collection and restaurant with fine views.",
          "Well worth looking around this gallery. Great views from the rooftop Finish off with a bite to eat in the fab restaurant / cafe which has a great view over the marina.",
          "The building is jaw droppingly gorgeous and the contemporary art held on show here is well worth a visit. Don't hesitate to pop into the highly aacclaimed restaurant, amazing lunch and outside on the terrace makes it more than perfect. Our fav outing.",
          "the collection included works by many important artists such as Miro, Montigliani, Bourgoise, Horn, Hirschhorn, Mapplethorpe and many many more. There is also a smart game invented by the curators in order to make viewers pay more attention to the works.. ;-)",
          "Large exhibition rooms, well laid out and interesting collections.Changing art work.Stunning views over the bay of Palma from the attractive terrace bar and restaurant.A calm oasis in the centre of busy Palma",
          "Built into city wall fortifications, Es Baluard is a modern and contemporary art gallery. The new structural additions - glass / concrete - have been sensitively inserted into the stone work to create a stunning space on three floors. The permanent collection is worth visiting",
          "Another surprise from Palma. Take a fortification and instead of leaving it as a fort turn it into a modern art gallery. The modern sculpture outside sat vary nicely against the old fort, and it was nice to see such a central location being put to good use. The artworks were",
          "OK- not exactly facing sunset (it faces south south west) BUT here's a tip. If you want to find a good bar with a great view over the Palma Marina/Harbour and atop the old city battlements, head for the Es Baluard Contemporary Art Museum. Walk west along Carrer Sant Pere, up",
          "If staying longer in Palma, worth to visit, but depends on a exhibitions they are happening. Not many pieces as for contemporary art museum. Was a bit dissapointed. Nicely arrange, interesting pieces from Miro and Picasso.",
          "This museum is situated very near the harbour in Palma, there is some interesting works to see, it does not take to long to go through and from the roof top you get a nice view. We had a lovely lunch at the restaurant which I can recommend!",
          "A great development of a modern gallery space within a heritage port fortification. The gallery itself is excellent. A very nice place to spend an hour. Some good works of Miro and some periferal Picasso, plus other worthwhile items. Seems receptive to contemporary exhibitions,",
          "This stunning modern building, carefully constructed within an old beachfront fortress is worth a visit purely for its style and for its excellent restaurant. The art collection is somewhat parochial with only a tiny number of artists of international renown. The Picasso",
          "This is one of the finest galleries I've visited. Well laid out and sign posted. The current Waste Lands exhibit is moving with images of left over war torn lands from ten perspectives. The rest of the museum is bold and very modern in all ways. Do not miss it.",
          "This sits above a very old wall that runs along side Gabriel Roca (waterfront) but has essentially no signage. Walk up the hill via the river and into the upper level and you will find an art center at the top of the all but also poorly signed. The area is quite beautiful and",
          "Reasonable examples of modern art in an open and attractive environment. The area surrounding it offers a peaceful place to wander.",
          "We had tea at the terrace, a great place to rest while touring the city of Palma. The museum is good for people who wish to enjoy art. Just one of those spots where you can relax for a bit and watch the world go by.",
          "The building is great and some of the temporary exhibitions are great. There is a good shop within the museum. The walk around the old city walls is great with fantastic views of Palma. There is a great restaurant on the terrace overlooking the city walls and port of Palma.",
          "Worth a visit if you like modern art, but the combination of the modern architecture of the gallery built within the fort walls was almost more interesting to me. There is also a great outdoor caf\u00e9 terrace beyond the gallery which serves very reasonably priced cocktails and has",
          "Well worth visiting , also has a cafe , which serves food and drinks If visiting early evening it is still in the sun. Lovely views",
          "My husband and I and our two sons (10 and 7) visited this gallery to escape from a very rainy day in Palma. It is quite small in terms of exhibits but it is in an amazing building that I think could be better appreciated on a dry day. None of us are experts on contemporary art",
          "Modern art museum that as is so often the case is outshone by the building, or in this case, the views from the roof top terrace. Lovely terrace cafe.",
          "Assumed this would be Majorca's flagship gallery for contemporary art but found ourselves distinctly underwhelmed. There is a lot of empty space. The permanent collection is mainly small pieces. Very little colour. In addition a couple of lacklustre temporary exhibitions.",
          "This is an amazing building, stark concrete and shining steel mixed effortlessly into ancient stone walls. And the views... Worth going just to admire the vista. Lovely cafe/restaurant on the lower terrace too.",
          "Was a bit disappointed - the building is nice and large but the exhibition space is smaller than you expect. On a Friday it's a you decide price - donations basically from a minimum of ten cents. Otherwise it's six euros and I found the exhibits a bit emperor's new clothes. If",
          "Nice museum, kind of small and could do with a few more pieces, but it's nice to spend a couple hours wandering through the corridors. Try the restaurant and go up to the terrace on the 2nd floor, the views are lovely.",
          "I went in free as an art teacher others have to pay E6 - very little art really but a great space. Picasso, Miro etc are here but just a few of each and some other more contemporary artists and videos too.",
          "Fabulous and unusal pieces of art work to view and the best bar and restaurant next to it! A must to visit",
          "Interesting gallery, well worth a visit. The building itself is fantastic with wonderful views from the observatory and terraces.....worth calling just for the views. Also lovely terrace top cafe peaceful and relaxing with views of the bay and cathedral above the palm trees. The",
          "I'm not a fan of modern art but as it was raining as i passed by the museum, I went in. I was pleasantly surprised by the work on show and actually bought postcards of some of thr pictures,. The sculptures were fascinating and as entry to the museum is free it was a wonderful",
          "This striking modern building was erected on the site of a former barracks. it is only a few minutes walk from other popular attractions such as the cathedral and the royal palace. Inside it is exceedingly spacious. One gallery contains paintings by artists from the Balearic",
          "One of the nicest small contemporary museums I have seen. The architecture modern and old works perfectly together with the artworks. Superb view from the roof terrace towards the cathedral and sea side.",
          "It was a wet day and we went for a great meal at the restaurant...befor going to the art gallery. Lots of weird stuff...but fund to see. The useless boat full of holes, strange video installations...Miro, Picasso, changing exhibitions and a great rooftop walkway aaround",
          "Visited recently by bike.. if you go there by bike you only pay 2 Euro entry fee. That was good as was really disappointed by the exhibitions. Apart from a few Miros there was little enough there to inspire or make me gasp in wonder! I like contemporary art but prefer more",
          "The Museum is great. I loved the Architecture, its history and contemporary design. I loved the Art works, too. The outside Cafe Terrace, so relaxing and appealing. I wish to go back to experience the culinary aspects of the Restaurant.",
          "I usually like contemporary art, however found this to be very disappointing. Went on Friday which is a day you can decide what you would like to pay to enter (min.10 cent). Glad I didn't pay the full fee.",
          "We visited today because unfortunately it's raining but enjoyed the building and the contemporary art in it. However don't rely on the trip advisor map to find it as the pinpoint is in the wrong place. It is over the road from the harbour, adjacent to the park in the building",
          "If you like contemporary art - you'll like it. If you prefer more traditional art - you might want to bypass. Lovely building, sets off the art well. Restaurant on terrace was lovely with good food at world city prices.",
          "We visited on Boxing Day morning. Took our time looking at the exhibits on the three floors. Floor one was for us the more way-out exhibits that required more imagination. Floor two was a little more conventional and therefore easier for us to try to interpret. The top floor",
          "This is a modern building tucked inside the medieval city walls. It houses an uneven collection including some masterpieces, but also some \" student\" art as well. The staff are helpful, and some speak English, which is convenient. There is a discount for those over 65,",
          "Staff were helpful, but there isnt much art on display. Fairly large open rooms, but very little of significance, not even much Miro (local) on display. Beautiful building, better to see this as architectural art due to limited canvas and sculpture. Not expensive thankfully.",
          "Museum is architecturally interesting being built within historic city walls.pleasing but not extensive collection of art displayed.",
          "As well as ever changing temporary exhibitions and a very impressive permanent collection..... the cafe restaurant is excellent, serves great quality and value food. Sunny terrace overlooking pleasure harbour and cathedral. one of the most chic places to sip a chilled Albarinho",
          "Stunning place to visit with a very nice collection of contemporary art and the building iis so interesting. You can walk around on the roof and enjoy the stunning view. Lovely restaurant too.",
          "Beautiful view of the harbor and large yachts. The food and service are quite good. Super finish to a museum visit.",
          "The museum was once a fort so architecturally, very interesting and grounds have many sculptures. Permanent exhibition houses some crazy Miro and other interesting pieces easily do-able in 30 mins. The best part was the terrace restaurant overlooking the Marina and excellent",
          "I am a big fan of Palma and its many attractions but this is really poor. Very little art to see and what is there looked like rejects from other galleries. The film section in the basement was laughable. I gave two star rating not one because the staff were helpful, it isn't",
          "We did look forward to visit Es Baluard again and the view from the terrasse and rooftop was as always very beautiful. Inside more concrete to be seen than paintings and sculptures and the museum seemed a bit neglected. The top-rated museums Miro and EsBaluard was a",
          "We visited between shows so I can't give a full review. The building is amazing and perfect for a morning or afternoon wandering through the galleries. The works we saw is part of the permanent collection paintings by Barcelo and other accomplished Mallorcan artists. Picasso",
          "Modern art isn't usually something that I enjoy, but the set out of Es Baluard inspires creativity in one's mind. I found plenty of spots to sit relax and write whilst inside. There is also a great cafe attached to the Museum.",
          "I'd always been curious as to what was behind the high walls that rose from the Ronda Migjorn before crossing the footbridge over the main Palma torrent. Now I know having discovered the Art museum on a cooler day. Es Baulard from an architectural stance with its sweeping",
          "Great location and wonderful views so make sure you look around the outside terrace. I would not consider myself to be the arty type so maybe this place was just to Contemporary for me. Didn't really get the film section downstairs to be honest...probably just me but neither did",
          "The museum was easy to find and not far from the cathedral... Had a drink at the outside bar was a lovely area with fabulous views The art works were not very amazing There weren't that many of them and the whole place seemed a bit jaded. There was an over zealous security",
          "We and our friends ate here quite a lot.Delicious food, efficient, friendly staff, and very good value for money.Beautiful position overlooking the Fort, and fabulous terrace.Best gin and tonics in Palma!",
          "Whilst one can understand the need to change exhibitions and thus close part of the building temporarily, but the complete lack of interest shown by staff and the total absence of english language information about the layout and exhibits is really poor. The building itself is",
          "We had the place to ourselves, just 4 euros each for 4 large gallery rooms with some astounding modern pictures and sculptures by many Catalan artists. Well presented in modern surroundings, along with significant pieces by both Joan Miro and Picasso. Also fabulous outside",
          "We're only in Palma every few years so dramatic improvements or deterioration in the places we visit are obvious. Our first visit to Es Baluard was just after it first opened. It was impressive, fresh and the exhibits were wonderful. It's been a 'must go again' on our list of",
          "A wonderful setting on the old city walls of Palma. The restaurant is contemporary Spanish and the food is excellent. My wife and I shared the beef for two people; it was a a rib of beef roasted and carved on the bone - really delicious. There is an outside terrace bar and you",
          "We were having an after dinner stroll when we came across this museum. While it was closed for the day the outside area contained a number of interesting modern sculptures which were well worth spending the time to look at.",

          "There is sadly no designated parking for the disabled nearby, but there are spaces in the street close to the entrance where you'd probably be okay. However, there is a wheelchair to borrow (most welcome after the necessary hike (for me)/ short walk (for the rest of the family)",
          "Interesting variety of well prepared and presented dishes. Nice location for a sunny lunch overlooking the harbour and within the city walls.",
          "Great building. Some very good, interesting prices mixed with the indulgent rubbish that you find on the contemporary arts scene. It is definitely worth a visit even if just to enjoy the space. It is pretty cheap to at \u20ac6 for adults.",
          "Very modern museum, architecturally interesting, tucked into the old city walls and over looking the sea. On three floors with works from Miro, Picasso and one Mogdiliani. In the lower floor is a rather striking montage of photographs of Majorca arranged in a thematic colour set",
          "This place is one of the corners of the old wall of Palma. Now is dedicated to a Museum and Coffe and Restaurant for events. The museum is small although have interesting pieces that in many cases are donated. The facility was converted into a public space not many years ago,",
          "A really interesting place to visit. Very close to the Cathedral and other popular tourist venues.not a lot of info about it and found it by accident.really enjoyed the displays and the building. Cafe was also very acceptable.on certain days, entrance is free.Seniors take note.",
          "I volunteer at the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco and have visited many Museums throughout the world. By any reasonable standard it was a disappointment. I noticed one review called it a \"great Modern art museum\". One must wonder what their baseline is in making a statement",
          "We visited when there were no exhibits inside, but got a different view at old town Palma and the port. Meh...",
          "We love contemporary art but were disappointed here. There really is not much on display and there is very little available that has an English translation. The museum shop was also closed! Nice view of the harbour from the terrace.",
          "Lots of Miro, lots of modern art, and a great restaurant next door. This is a fantastic option when you are tired of the heat and the beaches of Mallorca.",
          "This place is for people who are interested in contemporary art. I loved the building - the mixture of old and new styles. Inside you can see various modern exhibitions. There is a lovely shop with good books and souvenirs. Tickets are 6 euro per person and for a 4 years old",
          "This is a great location for the museum inside the city walls with fantastic views of the harbour & Cathedral. Great use of space & we liked the outside sculpture. But unless you're really into, and knowledgable about, abstract modernist art (with little or no translations into",
          "Very little art on show - a few well known artists such as Miro. A lot of museum for very little content. Some video art if you like that sort of thing.",
          "In this museum you can see works of Pablo Picasso or Joan Miro. Also, there is a terrace with a fantastic view over Palma. In the museum's caf\u00e9 you can order something to drink or some snacks.",
          "Well worth a visit to see the sculptures and contemporary art, which is very modern! There is a wonderful view of the Cathedral and Port from the ramparts. Disappointed that there was no caf\u00e9 for a coffee after our tour of the galleries. The staff however were setting up the",
          "Wonderful view from the terrace cava and tapas in the sun. Peaceful and relaxing. Even better at night",
          "The museum itself is a great connection between modern archtecture and the old building itself. The art and the presentation itself is amazing. The terras serves great food with stunning views.",
          "If you like Miro you will like Esbaluard.The building combines the city walls with modern blocks.The views and walkways above the museum are part of the enjoyment here",
          "Visited a few years ago and was bowled over by the content of the museum. This time I was rather disappointed. Perhaps this was because the previous day, we had visited Can Prunera at Soller which took us by complete surprise and was truly magnificent. However, views continue to",
          "Beautiful gallery with nice restaurant and bar. Amazing views over Palma harbour. Only minutes from central Palma and a must visit.",
          "Housed in an old fort, this exhibition is worth a short viewing on the inside but longer wandering around the ramparts and having a very reasonably priced drink on the terrace. A few decent paintings and a lot of local filler in a very modern gallery set in the old walls.",
          "Fortress converted in the modern cliche with plenty of glass and corridors overlooking exhibition spaces. Splendid views over the harbour and a few interesting pieces inside and outside. Discount entry on Tuesdays.",
          "The best part of our visit was wandering outside, admiring the fusion of old and new architecture. Inside, the gallery is a superb space; the exhibits, however, are disappointing - no major works, and uninspired curating. The cafe with great views is a lovely place to rest",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed coming here and would definitely recommend it to all art lovers. An absolute must for all lovers of architecture too. Lots of excellent sculpture to see also. Go, you won't be disappointed. Stunning architecture: old and new. Paintings, sculpture and video",
          "We had some time to spare and made our way to Es Baluard and were very positively surprised. The complex itself has a fascinating architecture with a fine mix of new elements blending nicely in with the old walls and stone. Nice selection of Miro and other artists including",
          "Interesting modern building with great view from the roof terrace and Camera obscura. The art was not to my taste but that may well be my predudice.",
          "We visited this gallery last year and had a wonderful time. It's free entry on a Friday. The building is extremely interesting to walk around - it is a mixture of old and new architecture. We particularly enjoyed the views over the city and the water from the top of the building.",
          "... and on a different topic, I stupidly left a backpack checked in at the front desk the night before flying back to the UK. The staff were really helpful about helping me to have it sent back by courier, and it arrived safely very soon after.",
          "Interesting collection of mostly Catalan or Balearic artists: the museum has been inserted into part of the old defences of Palma and the architecture is a really interesting adaptation.",
          "They over-charge you to see the limited art-works, which were to my eyes most disappointing. The exhibition / art-gallery space could be wonderful, right inside the old city walls. The best thing about the gallery is getting out of the \"art space\" into the architecture. The",
          "Set in an old castle, this museum is characterised by massive walls into which the curators have assembled a collection of local art. Beautiful interior designs with plenty of large glass panels to contrast with 500 year old walls. A most welcomed cooling retreat from the",
          "Didn't pay to go in, but you can see a few bits for free on the terrace level. Including the \"cube staircase\" thingy you can see from the road below. Intrigingly set in the walls of the old bastion.",
          "Palma's most enjouable place for a glass of wine! The terrace offers great views of the sea and the bill is surprisingly low.",
          "If you come by bike the entrance fee will be just 2 euro. Nice :) Very good presentation, nice view over city from the walls.",
          "Nice chilled out restraunt slightly limited menu but always excellent service and the food is very good definately worth a visit even if its just for a drink",
          "Looking forward very much to our visit, we arrived full of expectations of viewing a superb collection of modern art in this stunning looking building. Unfortunately we left feeling very disappointed - a huge building housing a very small collection, mostly local artist, Joan",
          "Fabulous use of an old fort .. sandwiched between the barrio of Puig de Sant Peter and Santa Catalina, the space, arranged across various levels, really lends itself to the display of art. I can imagine parties in the open air spaces whilst looking out towards the mariner with",
          "This is well worth a hour for anyone interested in modern art. The building is perfect, the space well designed for the exhibits. A handful of well known artists including many Miro paintings.",
          "An art museum cleverly embedded into an old fortress. The building itself and the outdoor sculptures impressed us more than the exhibitions.",
          "The island of Majorca has acquired a certain reputation as a minor center for Contemporary Art. The relatively new Es Baluard Museum in Palma was built in an attempt to enhance this reputation. Alas, it doesn't succeed, mainly for want of its own permanent collection. A visit is",
          "We stumbled into this place while walking around Palma looking for a decent place to sit and enjoy the sun. The bar area has fantastic views of the harbour and offeres a great range of drinks and snacks. The restaurant looked very classy and had a good wine selection to boot.",
          "The Es Baluard Contemporary Art Museum has some very good art, created in the early 1900s and continuing to 2014. The museum opened in 2004 and is a museum of modern and contemporary art. Its collection has more than 500 works of modern and contemporary artists. This includes",
          "The views from here are worth a visit alone even if ,like me ,contemporary art and wrought iron structures are not ones thing.On a blisteringly hot day you can however enjoy a cold beer or sangria and a truly great lunch under a canopy setting and i thik that deserves a visit.",
          "Love this place we went twice for drinks and once to eat and look at the art! Best setting for a relaxed lunch or dinner. Can sit outside or in. Modern style but with traditional Spanish food available. We had the best croquetas here! Much better than some of the small bars",
          "Terrific views of Palma from the roof. Was disappointed as there were not enough pictures. It is rather spartan and could do with more exhibits. However what was there was good if a little to cutting edge for me.",
          "Elegant imposing entrance but grouchy unhelpful ladies on front desk (they had just opened). When I asked if they had any English audio guides or books the answer was a plain no. Although there were no audio guides at all, there were English info sheets in some rooms and a few",
          "Es Baluard was well worth the visit. The situation of the bulding is fantastic and the views are lovely. From a museum perspective it lends itself so easily to the wonderful sculptures. It is not the largest museum but the quality makes up for its size. I would have been happy",
          "Es Baluard is pretty interesting place to visit. This place is especially must-see for those who are interested in sculpture.",
          "We had a really nice afternoon in this great building, seeing famous artists and artworks. It was cool inside and at that day not so many people there. From the roof terrace we got a fantastic view at Puig de Sant Pere, Santa Catalina, the cathedral and the harbour. There was",
          "The building is beautiful and detailing outstanding - the garden is well worth a visit too, with its eclectic and idiosyncratic collection of sculpture. Only annoyance was the very noisy building work going onThe art, however, is a little disappointing, good old Miro aside, of",
          "The building which houses Es Baluard is beautiful, and the view from the roof is spectacular. However, I did feel a bit ripped off by the admission fee. There was really not a lot of art on display, with one level closed off. I am not sure where the artworks of all the",
          "An excellent example of adaptation of historic setting for modern use. This is world-class architecture .",
          "We went for an exhibition and were a little dissappointed on the building itself. You enter a very modern complex and it seems that all the paintings get lost in this modern atmosfere. What a shame, however it is the nicest museum from all on the balearic islands.",
          "The permanent exhibition was extremely poor taking into account the choice of local artist. The museum is small and I do not believe that all the useable areas were put to use. The retrospective was very well presented and lit. The building is beautifully situated overlooking",
          "Loved the terrace overlooking marina surrounded by plants and sculpture. You could sit here all day with a coffee. Didn't visit the gallery itself.",
          "Spent a pleasant afternoon here. Building and surrounding are especially interesting with access to city walls and beautiful views of Palma an the sea. Collection includes many modalities and local and international artists. Pity such a small selection of postcards / info",
          "I'm not a great fan of modern art, but this museum is a great place to visit as it is a combination of art and history combined. The old fortifications have been transformed with a modern space for the art and whilst the collection isn't big, there is enough for a visit of a",
          "Located near the port, this art museum became my favorite place to savor the views over a drink. The building itself is modern, but it's built on the walls of the old 16th century building, which makes for an incongruous blend of modern meets ancient, which you don't readily",
          "I spent a very lovely couple of hours here. The collection is not massive, but the venue is lovely. I particularly enjoyed the rooftop sculptures and peaceful rest area on the top level. The staff was very kind a helpful.",
          "The bar here has stunning harbour & catherdral views without the tourist prices.Great setting altogether with designer chairs & art installations to look at. Everything has been considered.",
          "Having read the reviews, I was looking forward to our visit. However, we kept walking along the corridors, wondering if we'd missed the entrance to the main exhibition...it turned out that we hadn't...I'm still not quite sure what we paid for...",
          "Wonderful pieces and installations. The view from the roof is a superb and there is a lovely caf\u00e9 bat located on the ground terrace. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "We visited twice on our trip to Palma - the first time we had a good look round the exhibits and the lovely roof space as well as having lunch in the cafe and the second time we just went to have lunch. The terrace is beautiful over looking Palma and the marina - the food is",
          "Beautiful building, nice permanent collection, the roof is lovely on a nice day. Visiting exhibitions can be a hit or a miss.",
          "Interesting and spacious museum, but some of the art works were a bit weird. Plus the caf\u00e9 outside had poor service.",
          "Amazing works of art by modern Spanish artists well presented and not too many to take in! The building is integrated into the city wall in a very modern way. We went on a Friday when you are allowed to choose your entrance fee from 10 cents upwards! I would recommend.",
          "A lovely gallery space in the old buildings, very cool and calm in the heat and bustle of Palma. Entry fee was reasonable and some very good pieces of art inside, not just Modern, but mainly Spanish. The roof terrace has great views over the old town and marina too.",
          "Sometimes the size of an exhibition is not the most important, but the combined \"effort\" or effect of the exhibition and the place. The Es Baluard Contemporary Art Museum is such an architectonic pearl that even a realatively modestly sized exhibition leaves quite an impression,",
          "Went there this month, beautifull atmosphere, park for children, restaurants and bars next to it and fantastic view over Palma Port!",
          "The pieces they have here are quite amazing, Picasso !!! Wow seeing is believing. The building is great on its own merit but the whole Museum has been organised so well. Great to see it in such a relaxed pace.",
          "This is an impressive building, mixing old and new. Around the grounds there are some large scale sculptures and these are worth seeing, and it won't cost you anything. Inside, where you pay, there are changing exhibits. Although on my visit they were changing them so two of the",
          "Dont miss this little gem. Quirky mixture of old and new buildings set into the city wall, with spectacular roof views. Art works are an expected modern mix, and include a whole room of Miros and several Picasso works and sculptures. So go on, spend an hour or so on some",
          "another good example of Palma's appreciation of art, don't miss the roof!! and Picaso's works. of course..",
          "Even if contemporary art is not your thing, the beautiful building - a superb blend of the old and new is worth the entrance fee. Be sure to have a walk around the roof for lovely views.",
          "Had a wonderful hour just walking round the museum. The exhibit of what I can only describe as an octopus is unusual to say the least.",
          "This art gallery is worth a visit from at least an architectural viewpoint. The gallery has been ingeniously built into an old fort. The photographic exhibitions in the basement are always interesting and the temporary exhibitions are also worth a look at. Some good Picasso",
          "We want just to see it from outside because we didn't had much time but at the end we made the whole tour. I saw for first time bromoil and daguerreotype :) There are local art and I realized this type of drawings got commercial several year as ago! The ticket fee on Friday",
          "This stunning modern building has been set into the remains of the old town bastion and is a delight to walk around. There is a fairly extensive Miro exhibition and some Picasso ceramics, but the highlights for us were the Broto paintings. A must whether you like modern art or",
          "Not an overly large collection, with the Picasso ceramic exhibit particularly modest. The premises is an interesting blend of history and modern architecture. Recommend a Friday visit when admission price is flexible. Nice cafe with views overlloking the port.",
          "This bvery modern building links the old fortress wall to the upper parts if the city but is divorced from it by the mere fact that it does not flow back into the main streets; you have to go back down the same streets you came from - Passeig de Born. The museum is bitty and has",
          "This small museum is set beautifully on a section of the old town walls, and the modern buildings contrasting with the ancient stone make a great backdrop for the artworks. However, it costs \u20ac6, was a little empty and didn't take us long to walk round - next time I might just",
          "It seems to be a bit out of the path of many tourists so there were few guests there. Enjoyed a drink afterwards on their lovely terrace above the marina.",
          "A lovely simple and very welcoming art gallery, easy to walk around and pleasantly fill the time. The coffee shop/restaurant over looking the marina is beautiful & incredibly chilled and one of my favourite places to go and relax over lovely coffee or a glass of vino. It's also",
          "The building is stylish and cool (both culturally and literally - the air conditioning works well) and displays a significant collection of Miro paintings and drawings, and Picasso ceramics. It also has temporary exhibitions by various contemporary artists. The rooftop",
          "Really nice collection of art in a very contemporary museum - combination of old and new. I love Miro - so superb to see some Miro exhibits, but also interesting to see artists with whom I am not that familiar. Good price and recommended.",
          "An impressive building in a great location. So why not fill it with some impressive modern art? Or not maybe. A very sparse hang of some, frankly, unimpressive art. The Miro room contained some disappointing work (and I'm a fan). The Picasso ceramics were ok and there was a",
          "We spent about an hour here wandering around inside and out - an interesting visit is you are into modern/contemporary art and scuplture.",
          "Went and saw Miro and Picasso (ceramics). It was a wonderful museum, so peaceful and hassle-free. We were able to spend loads of time at each exhibit, and get up close and even take photographs if you like. The outside space was lovely as well, with a cafe and quite a few",

          "Entering via the cloisters, you will be captivated by the serenity, unless it's a break time for the children at the school on the upper levels! The basilica has a magnificent altarpiece. One of the chapels contains the sepulchre of Blessed Ramon Llull, a prominent philosopher",
          "We rarely miss a chance to visit a cloister, so we stopped by the Basilica de Sant Francesc. Alas, we found it just average. All of the parts were there, but we have seen many that had more interesting architecture, decorations and history.",

          "It is a nice church, but 3\u20ac are too expensive to visit. There are lots of other churches in palma that don't charge you.",
          "The visit starts by walking around the cloister that was built in the 14th century. The adjoining facility is still used for a high school. The church is gothic architecture with lots of details. Visiting hours are 9:30 to 1 and 3:30 to 6. I believe the cost for those over",
          "Amazing architecture..can't really help not to be amazed of how this beautiful basilica was built in an Era where they use hardwork labor and no modern machinery that's being use just like nowadays....it's my second time to visit mallorca and this is a place I don't want to",
          "We did a cycle tour of the city and this was one of the many stops. It is full of character and interest, it is beautifully designed and well built a definite asset to the city and a musty to visit",
          "Me & my wife have visited Majorca this December, and we have turned back home absolutely delighted with the island, particularly with venues like this one. The visit includes a wonderful cloister and one of the most amazing churches I've ever seen. Don't miss it if you visit",
          "After visiting the cathedral, we walked around Palma's old town and came upon San Francesc. Not very advertised so we felt like we were discovering something... Indeed we were very pleasantly surprised about what we found inside. Spectacular historic building, impeccably",
          "Located in the city center is a peaceful place to visit. The architecture is fantastic and there's a smell of restness and spirituality that you can breath and enjoy at the very first time you enter to the cloister. I recommend this visit as a must in Palma!",
          "My wife loves visiting churches. This is one of many from many countries we have visited and is well",
          "We discover it as we were walking around, and it was an awesome place full of peace and calm. Highly recommendable if you're visiting Palma. Its architecture breaths history and spirituality.",
          "This is a lovely place to visit and is still used as a school, so expect to hear the children whilst you walk around. It has the most wonderful cloisters and every part of it was interesting and a feast for the eyes and soul. Don't walk by, walk in and you won't be",
          "This cathedral is truly staggering - there is so much history for such a small island and this is the crowning glory. This is a must do if you are in Palma.",
          "We were married in this beautiful Church 50 years ago and returned in October for a special Mass and blessing thanks to the kindness of the priest there.It was a very special time enjoyed by our family for which we were very grateful. It was just as beautiful this time and is",
          "This one of Palma's several impressive basilicas dominating a small square in the heart of the told town.",
          "Looked like a trash place seeing it from outside but was extraordinary to see from the inside. Well worth to spend time on since the atmospgere was lovely",
          "Situated near the centre of Palma old town, this is arguably one of the ecclesiastical pearls of Mallorca, (the others being Palma Cathedral, Valdemossa and Lluc monasteries, in that order, I'm lucky enough to have visited them all, so I can make these comparisons). Like most",
          "Wonderful Gothic style church in the heart of the old part of Palma. It is one of Palma's oldest churches.",
          "A fascinating and beautiful church within a truly peaceful surrounding. A stunning altarpiece just begs you to stand still, admire and think. Well worth the time and space to visit and not too difficult to find.",
          "Nothing really special unless like me you are into architecture then this is a real treasure of the catholic church.",
          "We arrived for our visit on a busy Monday, but upon leaving the busy street, we were met by a quiet cloisters, where you can easily imagine the Franciscan monks going about their duties. Leading off here you enter the amazing chapel. We were lucky enough that someone was playing",
          "We arrived an hour before it closed so they did not give us the free audio guide. However, it was still amazing and we did have a paper guide. The Gaudi chapel was interesting but not to my taste. The sheer size of the building and the stunning stain glass windows are worth the",
          "3 euros to walk round not crowded a lovely old place ,fantastic inside ,take your camera the alter is unbeliveable",
          "Well worth a visit. You can feel the culture and religion as soon as walk in. Some great exhibits of Spain richness due to the discovery of America. Also nice to just sit and contemplate. Be warned, can get very busy with tourists so best to visit early in the morning.",
          "We are not particularly religious but on holiday there is always a pleasure in spending time visiting churches. This one is a great building, gothic splendour with fantastic fixtures and wonderful art. We sat and breathed it all in, left feeling calmer for the experience.",
          "Stunning church with lovely stained glass and fascinating history but a feel of spirituality, a wonderful place to pray quietly where prayers are heard.",
          "One of Palma's oldest churches, in Gothic style. The cloisters are peaceful. However, the main interest lies in the connection with Ramon Lllull, who is credited with being the creator of the Catalan language - you can look for his marble effigy half way up the wall in the first",
          "Very ornate interior. Little of great interest. A medieval church with early modern altars and fittings. Typically Spanish.",

          "Visited this place in June 2015. The Basilica has stood the history of conquest and fall of kingdoms and being taken over again by other kings to be developed. Overlooking the sea, it also provides a beautiful view. Walking through the narrow streets after exiting the Basilica",
          "Breathtaking and more than a little overwhelming. Try a walk around the cloisters if possible to get a feel for what this place must have been like in bygone days.",
          "A beautiful church well worth a visit if you are in the Old Quarter of Palma. It is difficult to describe this Church as there is so much to see. There is also a Cloister which is open during the day for visitors.",
          "After visiting many of the spectacular cathedrals in mainland Spain as well as the Palma cathedral, this look more like the 'common man's' church. It was quite beautiful and worth the visit. It is a short walk from the Palma Cathedral as everything is pretty centrally located",
          "This is just one of the interesting buildings in Palma. We walked everywhere and this was larger inside than outside. Dramatic inside a torch is handy for the details.",
          "It costs three euros per person to get in to view the incredible 12th century church and the patio area of the cloisters. That's all that you see. Bring a flashlight because it's dark inside. Without a flashlight this placed is not worth going into. Also, the cashier,",

          "Reading reviews made me interested in seeing it for myself, so we made a trip especially. The cloisters are so calm and cool, the noise from the streets is strangely muted and you feel a million miles away. I won't rewrite the same words about how lovely it is, you will have to",
          "This is a beautiful simple cloister. The church is a mixture of simple and high baroque with an unusually placed crucifix high up on the altar. The famous Mallorcan mystic Ramon Llull is buried there. Well worth a visit, good for drawing breath away from the busy streets.",
          "This building promises a lot from the outside. The cloisters are superb, but the nave is rather over the top in terms of baroque, which in my view detracts from the simplicity of the main design. There isn;t a lot to see in Palma other than museums and the cathedral - unless one",

          "San Fransisco Church is a beautiful church worthwhile visiting. Its location is a bit quiet off the busy streets close to Born but within walking distance to the Cathedral in one of Europes most interesting towns today. Palma de Mallorca.",
          "Doesn't look much from the outside but the inside is a real revelation. As worth going to see as the Cathedral itself",
          "Beautiful cloisters and a huge church with amazing altar. Not much to see for the eur3 entry fee but well worth it for the peace and quiet. It is very warm inside",
          "This was our 2nd visit to this wonderful Basilica. We can't visit Palma without making a pilgrimage here. The place is so peaceful and to be able just to sit and reflect is perfect. Don't miss the astonishing cloisters. This is highly recommended to both believers and",
          "Walked this way and just had to go in. The cool and calm atmosphere inside is a wonderful change to the heat and bustle of the city. It was a Sunday and a service was being held so we were lucky to get in. Not sure it's always open, so check before you make a special trip.",

          "This is one of the main churches in Palma. Okay it's not the stunning Cathedral, and it's not the prettiest BUT it boasts arguably the best Church Organ in Mallorca and a Concert tradition of the highest order. As a Concert Organist, it's top of my list of places to play in",
          "Really good value admission at \u20ac1.50 which takes you into a lovely calm cloister. But the contrast when you enter the church is astounding as almost the first thing you see is the high altar piece, huge and elaborate. The side chapels have similar if slightly smaller altar",
          "We visited this Basilica in Palma after we had been to the Cathederal. What a difference! No crouds of tour guides and really a house of God. It is a a wonderful place to just sit and reflect in the peace and quiet which is not found outside. There is a small cafe opposite",

          "This was well worth the trip. It's only small but perfectly formed and the side chapels are so beautiful, lots of guilding and eye pleasers. Just make sure it's open, we came on a Sunday and had to come back in the week.",
          "We had some difficulty location the Basilica - or to be more precise - the entrance! It is a door to the right of the front of the main church entrance with a bell marked Cloisters and Basilica. Ring the bell and you will be admitted - price is just 1.50 Euros per person. The",

          "A very small collection on display of modern art, most of it of not very known Spanish artists. Some lovely pieces by Tapi\u00e8s and Chillida and a good sample of Spanish modern art. Not really worth a visit, unless to have a break from shopping or the heat or cold.",

          "Filling a few hours in the afternoon wondering around the shops as raining, noticed the entrance wonders in. Found the place a sea of calm and the exhibition items well worth a look. Not that it rains in Palma that often, but worth a visit for half an hour or so.",
          "Such a pleasant beautifully restored building. The modern art is provoking, just two floors with about 12 smallish rooms of art works, so maybe under an hour to view it all. Just the one Miro and one Dali.",

          "The museum of Fundacion Juan March located in one of the most busy, touristy strets of Palma is a fantastic surprise. You may be forgiven for not noticing the entrance in the myriad of people passing by, but once you are inside the house, in the lobby, you are struck by the cool",
          "The building itself is impressive and there is a fairly small but varied collection of modern artwork. A well signed route guides you through. Entrance is free but do check the opening times. I wouldn't visit Palma especially to see this museum but worth calling into if you are",

          "Lovely Art Deco building, and gardens. The art was mostly not to my taste but maybe I'm in a minority!?",
          "This foundation in the heart of Palma on one of the busy pedestrian streets is ideal for a short break from the busy Palma-life. Since the 1950\u2019s the foundation has had a permanent collection, among other with works by Miro, Picasso and Dali. Do not miss Picasso\u2019s early",
          "Providing a haven for the bustling San Miguel street, this charming gallery within a formal townhouse exhibits several works by Miro, Garcia, Cronica, a Dali painting and a small collection of Picasso including Tete de femme. There are also some sculpted heads. Well worthwhile",
          "This building is in the centre of Palma and is unbelievably FREE to enter. The art is fantastic, with many pieces you will recognise even if like me you forget the names. Enjoyed some of the history too. It was very quiet when we went, so was an amazing experience.",

          "We enjoyed visiting this wonderfully restored mansion and the modern art collection on display. As with a lot of these galleries you have to take it as you find it, some if you will love, maybe not the rest. When we visited there was a small temporary display of Picasso prints",
          "This Museu d'Art was an unexpected find. We had walked past it on more than one occasion without realising what lay inside. If you like you like to have your senses X by modern art then this will gallery will definitely appeal. I would have happily paid a few \u20ac as an",
          "Beautiful vestibule to this old building but for us, there didn't seem to be much we recognised as having been painted/created by people we knew. What we did see was remarkably simplistic, bland or just plain ugly (in our honest opinions)",

          "Stumbled on this small gallery by by chance. Bold works of art by some of the most important Spanish artists of the early 20th century. Housed in a lovely 17th century mansion. We found it so inspirational we went back twice more.",

          "Amid the tourist bustle of the old town, this gallery offers a charming respite. It's free to enter, it's a great building with a feeling of tranquility and space and boasts among its many Spanish contemporary masters a charming Juan Gris,a very pretty Miro and an interesting",
          "Considering we stumbled across this gallery by complete chance, and that it's free and small enough to beat the pace at which we usually get bored by galleries, we were very pleased with our short visit to the Museu Fundacion Juan March. Very pleased indeed. There's some",
          "This took a bit of finding but was worth it. The local people we asked didn't seem to know about it. Free to visit, modern art, all Spanish. An impressive Dali painting, a lovely Mir\u00f3 bird, some confusing exhibits ( of course) Housed in a beautiful palace on a busy shopping",

          "A very well laid out museum with the usual mix of the highly impressive and the unintentionally hilarious. Highlight for me was the sound wave, light and water installation entitled *.Wav, 2004 by Mikel Arce. It's there until 21 May.",
          "This museum is located in a beautiful old building in Carrer Sant Miquel, a few metres from Pla\u00e7a Maior. It\u00b4s an interesting attraction dedicated to contemporary art. Most of the times this kind of art leaves me cold, but as the collection -in spite of not being very big- is",

          "A great experience to visit this stately 17th-century mansion in the old center of Palma. You have a free entrance to Foundation Juan March and you find an exhibition of contemporary spanish artists and discover that Spain is much more than Picasso, Miro and Dali. The lighting",
          "Centrally located and beautifully laid out with aircon that works and staff willing to assist, at least a little. Range of permanent exhibits interesting, though don't expect lots of Picasso's or Dali's. Temporary exhibition was excellent, blending 17th century still-life with",
          "A wonderful building and some stunning exhibits. if you are an art Philistine, don't even go there! Some of the TA reviews of this gallery say more about the Reviewer than the attraction. If you enjoy the diversity of contemporary art, the Fundacion Juan March is a must and",

          "It is a free gallery and well worth an hour of your time. I'm not a huge fan of modern art but there is a wide variety of pieces - paintings and sculptures which make it an interesting place to visit. There are only a handful of the 'big names' so if you want to see Miro or Dali",
          "Down a shopping street, the museum is free and offers an excellent selection of artwork and sculpture ranging from Picasso, Dali and Miro to other less famous artists. Over three floors, it's a great break from the main streets.",
          "Seems to be closed. Took ages to find it only to be disappointed.information was in short supply. Found other tourists also looking for it.",
          "This museum was top of my list to visit as it has a huge amount of modern Spanish pieces. All the big names, Picasso, Miro and Dali. The setting is as interesting, formerly a bank it's a perfect choice for the collection. Well worth the effort and it's free.",
          "We found this modern art museum that had been restored . Very cleverly done. Also sculptures outside, and you could go in and out whilst going round. Paintings there by Miro, Picasso and many other modern artists. Also we did not have to pay that day - it was free entrance!",
          "Great gallery, easy to miss, so seek it out. The art works are spread well around the rooms, so you can really get up close and personal to each of them. The building has been beautifully restored. I loved the floors and staircase to the second floor; art works in their own",
          "We didn't know about this museum and came across it by chance. It is free to go in which is nice! We are not really modern art lovers but went in with an open mind. We were surprised to find that we enjoyed it all. On permanent exhibition there are some paintings by",
          "Artificially lit edifice housing some quite \"difficult\" images which were beyond my comprehension and mixed the surreal with the absurd. It's a good 20 mins of alternative culture which only adds to the wonderful places you find in Palma",
          "We like to visit galleries when abroad but didn't expect to find so many good ones in Palma. This one is free and is right on the main street. The odd Dali and Miro and a lot of local Mallorquin artists. All very interesting and well set out. Recommended.",
          "Don't miss this gem in the center of Palma. Even when you're not interested in modern art! You have nothing to loose except a few minutes. You will find a beautiful building and I'm sure you will find a few art pieces you will appreciate. I loved the Batl\u00f3 art pieces! I highly",
          "Regarding the artists it is splendid. But it has a narrow variation when it comes to the themes. We could live without the visit.",
          "Worth visiting. Some famous names and some I'd never heard of: nice setting in central Palma. Calm, beautiful surroundings.",
          "If you enjoy art, like beautiful building and you like to do it for free then this is the place to go. Small but better than the Muro studios. This is one of the prettiest interiors in Palma and possibly many other cities. Doesn't take long to visit but well worth the time!",
          "We have not been to Palma before so a winter visit is probably not representative. But we found this place with little trouble and parked easily and loved the buildings. It is a lovely location, not many people about and cafeteria not open. It is nice to see a lot of Miro's",
          "The collection of 20th century sculptures by some of the greatest artists including,from an English perspective, Moore and Epstein, are stunning and located in the entrance courtyard of this stunning palazzo. Located next to Palma Cathedral. There is currently an interesting",
          "In my opinion, this is the best museum in Palma, and arguably one of the best on the island. Situated right in the center of Palma's teeming with life pedestrian zone, it is also an oasis of calm among the exuberance of Mediterranean life.",
          "Set in the centre of the city off one of the main shopping streets, the entrance can be easily missed. The whole building is spectacular and has 2 floors of modern art. Highly recommended",
          "Not many things are free, but this was a fantastic gallery. The building is lovely alone and the art is a wonderful mix of modern classics. If you were talking you could walk past, we nearly did. This is not mainstream but if you like educating or seeing inspiring art pieces DO",

          "The art exhibition at this museum is very good and there are many modern art paintings that are very interesting. The building itself is interesting and the stairway to the second floor has good architecture.",
          "You don't expect to find a collection of contemporary Spanish art on a busy shopping street and, because of this and the gallery's restrained exterior, you could easily pass it by. The collection has the requisite Miro and Dali works but it is the later Mid-Sixties to late",
          "Not our cup of tea at all. Think Tate Modern - this is very similar. I don't get the point of most of it",
          "Plenty of space, well laid out art gallery, featuring art by Joam Miro, who lived for some time in Palma",
          "If you like modernist art check this place out. It is unbelievable good. You may not recognise many of the artists but the work on show is as good any thing you will see in a gallery like the Tate Modern, and the building itself is beautifully constructed with doorways made of",
          "This is a place to wander in off the street. We usually go in once or twice a year. There is a permanent exhibition and on the top floor one that changes regularly. Always something new to have a look at. Sometimes you like it - sometimes you don't. As it's free, you can",
          "Not many visitors to this little museum which I personally love. It's in a striking architectural building and sits in a busy narrow shopping street of lovely Palma. If you are in this area, do have a look around, it's free and usually has some interesting paintings/ sketches",
          "The Museu Fundaci\u00f3n Juan March is housed in an 18th century mansion on a busy pedestrian thoroughfare - Carrer Sant Miguel - in the centre of Palma. The doorway to the house is easily missed when walking along the lane, but search it out because the museum itself is a gem. The",
          "This gallery includes some excellent examples of modern art from the last 50-60 years. Look out for the Tapies in particular. We also saw some remarkable Picasso etchings. If you have the least interest in abstract art, you shouldn't miss this gallery -- and it's entirely free!",
          "Great little oasis in the middle of very hot, busy Palma. Beautiful old building, galleries fully air conditioned. Art may not be to everybody's taste, but an enjoyable way to spend an hour. Entry free.",
          "The museum is near Placa Major. The entrance is free. There are two works of Miro, one work of Dali and a special room of Picasso's works. The museum has an excellent shop where you can buy pictures of works.",

          "We were nearby so looked it out as it has such great reviews. First of all the building is wonderful and the sense of calm as you walk around is relaxing. The artworks are nuggets of interest and even if you're not a huge arty fan this is a great collection and is a hour worth",
          "Having a limited knowledge of contemporary art I was unsure how much I would enjoy my visit. My fears were completely unfounded the museum itself is tranquil and calm despite being surrounded by shops and tourists. The collection is varied and organised so as to be striking yet",
          "A simply gorgeous looking building, with some interesting artwork, permanent and temporary exhibitions. We've been several times and it's never crowded so plenty of time and space to enjoy the paintings and an opportunity to relax away from the hustle and bustle of central",

          "Free of charge, you can spend 10-30 minutes staring at pieces of modern art hardly comprehensible to average person. Then you take photo with mouth-open installation at the entrance and make use of free restroom. All rooms are air-conditioned. Such a nice stop in the middle of",
          "We stumbled across this museum by accident as we we wandering around Palma on the last day of our holiday. My children asked to go in and as it was free we thought why not? It was a lovely find giving a nice respite from the heat - larger than expected on the inside with many",
          "Well it's free entry so why not! Actually we had it on our itinerary but it is quiet and atmospheric and not too taxing so no reason not to have a look around. Lovely old building and the usual mix of modern art - some you'll love and some you'll wonder about.",
          "If you have limited time, or just a passing interest in modern art, this is the best art museum/gallery to visit in Palma. I preferred it to Es Ballard and the Miro Foundation. My wife, who isn't a big fan of modern art found it tolerable at least (she was screaming to get out",
          "Nearly walked past without going in but worth turning back. Lovely building is part of the experience and some amazing art.",

          "After a long walk through Old Town it was a lovely stop over to recharge and refresh ourselves. Great views but the service was a little slack to say the least. We got served ok but the situation with other people was not a happy one and a few complained about the",
          "It's easy to confuse this gallery, subtitled Fundacion Juan March & on one of the main shopping streets of the old city near Placa Major, with Palau March - Fundacion Bartolme March - opposite Almudaina Palace and the Cathedral. This gallery is much smaller - but completely",
          "beautiful, not easy to find, quite a long walk from the Cathedral and port where our ship was docked. it is better to get a city map.",
          "We didn't know what to expect. This gallery is beautifully laid out and lit and has some interesting contemporary Spanish art by artists little known outside Spain so worth a visit if you like contemporary art.",
          "If you love art you should not miss this place. An incredibly conversion of a great building into a wonderful, contemporary, high art, gallery. A real feast for the eyes.",
          "We used the hop on/off bus to travel around the amazing city of Palma, and getting up to the gallery was pretty easy; it was surrounded by many shops and bustling with spaniards, you will see how they live up here in these narrow streets, more than you will down in the more",

          "Not the largest gallery but a nice place to spend a little time, and very conveniently located in the main tourist area near the main square. Mainly modern art, but quite a diverse range and probably something that will appeal to everyone. There's a small shop for books, posters",
          "A bit of a disappointment as there was more of Dali's \"Art\" (Litho's) on display than was necessary, in my opinion. House setting was magnificent as was the period furniture. A Nativity scenario that was enormous, that you would have to see as I cant describe it well enough to",

          "Small and very busy beach, all sunbeds and umbrellas taken first thing so we had to put our towels on the sand. There are a couple of beach cafes, one very expensive and the other better priced but not much on the menu. The beach itself is clean and the water is lovely and",
          "This cost about six euro to get to from downtown Palma, had a place with ice cream and some food, nice sand that seemed clean to me. It did get crowded but not unbearably so. It does have waves and some bits of wood debris in the water at the shore, but the water itself seemed",
          "My wife and I visited mid July, getting a taxi from near the Marina. The beach was very busy but we managed to time our visit well as a couple were just vacating two sunbeds and umbrella. We managed to bag them and had a really pleasant day. The cost of the beds and umbrella was",
          "Get there early to rent a space (16 euros). Not a big beach and could get really crowded but it\u2019s the closest nice beach in Palma. There are few shops nearby if you want to get food, accessories while you\u2019re there. There\u2019s no locker room for you to store your important stuffs so",
          "A pretty small beach, not very clean, but close to Palma and acceptable for a 1-2 hour beach visit for the kids to play in the sand/water. I wouldn't spend a whole day here.",
          "First impression was not too bad, stayed at be live complex of 3 hotels on the front. The resort in general is quite small, but as small as it was the beach area was beautiful and well kept, but all sun beds and the rest of the sand was full up by lunchtime with people having",
          "Beautiful small beach. However, too crowded to have a quiet bath. Many amenities. Water and sand seemed to be clean. Difficult to locate if you go by car, for the first time. I get the impression that in summer it must be impossible to move among the people on the beach.",
          "Hey guys. I'm still in cala mayor. We're waking up early every morning because of the baby. Gone out onto the balcony just to look out, and all the locals are down there walking their dogs. On the beach. In the sand. Doing ones and twos. Some of them aren't picking up their",
          "Spent a couple of hours here. There was building work going on around the beach. A cafe with a toilet at one end and lots of places for sun beds at the other end. We were here out of season so the beds weren't put out yet.",
          "The beach is great. Your kids will have the possibility to collect shells. Enjoy the time in family, or with your friends",
          "Midsummer, this beach is super crowded. Hard to find a space. Nice enough but worth paying 20euro for a car hire and going a bit further out of town.",
          "Nice beach with clear, warm water. It's located in a central area, where you can get food and drink, find restrooms, and even stay at a hotel. I loved that the water is very calm. You can swim or wade without having to feel like you're going to get attacked by a wave. I swam all",
          "In the heart of the city centre and close to the cruise port, where better to miander and gaze at the beautiful boats, if not having a stroll along the sandy beach",
          "In July the water was warm. We relaxed and enjoyed our time in the clean sand and water. It is also topless but do not go because of this. Just enjoy the relaxing sun, breeze and warm water.",

          "We spent the day here and alot of people said it may be overcrowded. It was not. It was really clean, relaxing and surprising quiet (maybe due to the October end of Summer season). Highly recommended for a night relaxing trip to the beach.",
          "We (family with daughters aged 6 and 3) got here by bus from the cruise terminal (no. 3) in late october just to take a swim in the mallorcan sea. Well, the beach itself is nice, the kids were frantic about the sand, which is also the cause for a lower grade (sand goes",
          "Busy busy busy. Went there to meet up with some friends from back home and the beach was ok and clean.",
          "Great out of season but I would think high season would be pretty crowded. Water lovely and clear. Lifeguards on duty.",
          "There is a fair bit to do, and the restaurants are fab there. We walked into Cala Mayor had a bite to eat and walked back. Very buzzy and full of life",

          "As per my experience, beaches on the south part of Majorca (near Palma) are more touristy, overcrowded and dirty. The Northern and Eastern parts are the best. It was a mistake to end on Cala Major.",
          "We visited early evening so most people had left. Clean, soft sand and great for a swim. Would visit again.i",
          "Paid a short visit whilst in Palma for the day The area was very clean and well maintained Unfortunately the weather was not good enough to take full advantage of the area",
          "we have a summerhouse nearby and it takes 206 steps to reach the beach, but worth it! A nice beach with a bar to eat or drink something.",
          "Nice beach with only sand. Sunbeds with parasoll for rent and also a free area. Lifeguards in a tower and at the ground. Sweetwater-showers as well. The water was very dirty in the afternoon, with cigarettfilters and other things. Signs saying no-dogs-allowed,",
          "Lovely beach some water sports some sun beds get there early am. Hard to park try and get parked on a side street somewhere",
          "The beach is relatively small and very packed. It might be quite dirty as well, especially after the storm. We tried it twice, but i felt quite upset each time. Playa de Palma or Magaluf are much better of course.",
          "Compared to American beaches, this one is outstanding. The water is pristine and warm. However, it is always packed to the gills during summer hours and doesn't have great dining options like some of the quainter beaches on the opposite side of the city center. It's a great",
          "This is the main beach at Cala Major. To your left the headland hosts one of the summer residencies of the King of Spain although he has gardens and parkland and a private beach, but you are in good company...There are about 150 fixed sun umbrellas and the price for 2 sunbeds",

          "We were told to hit the Beach at Cala Major if we wanted a good beach. 1/2 hour on #3 bus from Paca Espanya. Super convenient!.Good beach but to small and not really picturesque",
          "Fell in love with Mallorca. After a day at the cathedral and old town, we wanted a dip in the water. I'd done research to find this beach and it was definitely worth it! Crowded but not fussy. Protected cove with a couple of restaurants on the perimeter. Cabs will drop you",
          "No sun loungers by the time we got there at about 11am so go early. great for kids as the water does not go deep for quite some time..but always very busy so not much space .",

          "Not far from Palma center by public bus, you will be charmed by this site! You can have a drink or tapas, and enjoy the view",
          "We sat down to enjoy a beer and tapas in the sun. It was nice to watch the street performers and generally people watch in relaxed surroundings",
          "walked here from Palma old town as had heard good things. Nice small little bay with a good selection of bars and restaurants around. Sunbeds pretty much take up the beach, so in peak season imagine you may not have much choice but to rent them. When we visited, the public",
          "Nice beach, with some lunch bars around the area. Lacking water sports rental, that would give top rating.",
          "Love this beach, visit regularly. This year, we noticed a bit of a party scene with sale and open use of hash; this is attracting some unsavory characters which makes areas of the beach unpleasant. Reckon the Nixe Palace Hotel might get involved to sort it out, because this",

          "This is one of the better beaches we have been to The best part is towards the cliff, you're out of the wind if there is one. It is a family safe beach with a lifeguard in the summer. There are two beach bars - the Kokomo I've reviewed. We never used the Pelican. There are at",
          "What a terrible place to visit, there are broken beer bottles everywhere and the buildings look like they are going to fall down. The beach looks nice but it also has pieces of broken glass and litter. I would avoid visiting this place.",
          "Small and very nice beach in a residential area just outside of Palma. Not crowded in April but I guess things are different in the summer. Restaurant and cafe awailable on the beach. A day well spent in the sun",
          "This was the larger of the 2 beaches near our apartment and it was very quiet just before Easter. We had the beach to ourselves. Cafe was good for drinks but pricey for food, subversive extra. Water is turquoise and clear, shallow down the kids and lovely afternoon out.",
          "We stayed in an apartment about 5 minutes walk from the beach and thought it was lovely. In April it is quiet and peaceful, though with enough visitors to give it a lovely vibe. I agree with other reviews that it does need a tidy up and a bit of an investment, though I believe",
          "Lovely beach, not many people in April! The water is still a bit cold this time of year, but beautiful sunsets.",
          "This beach is nice and cozy what is great about Otis that even on a windy day it is protected by the buildings around it. I visited different beaches in the same day when it was super windy and I ended up coming back to the one in Cala Major because of its protection from the",
          "We stayed at the Nixe Palace hotel which sits directly on Cala Major Beach. The beachfront is poorly maintained and has a lot of graffiti. The high street is busy as its the main coast road and has a number of restaurants and bars. The resort feels tired and definitely needs",
          "Nice cove beach 15 minute drive from the city center. Great little neighbourhood with many restaurant options just up the stairs on the main road parallel to the beach. Nice for a stroll after a day at the beach.",
          "We came here in January, actually it was the very first beach of 2017 we have been, on January 1st, just afternoon, with my son. So we enjoyed it, for me perfect, almost empty, just a few people...coming and walking along the water. My son happy, building tunnels and castles.",
          "It is a typical tourist beach and not that good so suggest you head for the old town and walk around and see the sights.",
          "This is a lovely beach that is largely free from the hen party, stag party and works outings tourists.",
          "The sandy beach was clean, but entirely surrounded by hotels. The public showers were turned off - Mallorcas is suffering from a water shortage! We also had to search a bit before we found rest rooms we could use. I suppose for these reasons it wasn't crowded at all. On one",
          "It's not a large beach, being located in s small bay and surrounded by hotels, but it was close to our hotel and the stroll along the main road soon turns off into side paths inbetween hotels and some restaurants. The beach itself is nice and has a boardwalk to a",

          "We have visited this beach many times but were slightly disappointed to find that almost every inch of it was covered in sunbeds and umbrellas. There is also a small lagoon which I guess is meant to be a safe pool for children but has become stagnant and full of algae. On the",
          "Mainly adult only hotels around. However the public toilets are closed so this can be a problem. 4 lifesavers on duty.",
          "Dangerous bacteria was in the sea. Because sewage goes directly to this beach. The beach staff prohibited to swim after 11 a.m. when they had test of the water. They said it was started after the rain that was before . So i was swimming before 11 a.m. and i had uggly allergy",
          "This beach is nice and easy to get to if you ride the bus number three; there are several clubs in the area and many hotels which is why this beach is always very crowded, given its small size.",
          "Gently shelving beach suitable for children and with facilities for disabled with special buggies that can be taken into the sea. Lifeguards helpful . nice and clean, soft sand,sunbeds available and usual beach activities. Couple of beach bars",

          "more suited for couples who want to chill out and sunbathe, not a party beach and not as many bars/restaurants nearby. Easy swimming and lifegaurds on duty, watersporting activities available. There is only one toilet however which was broken when we were there. Loungers can be",
          "This is a really horrible resort which looks like it has been in decline since the 80's, beach packed to capacity, there are a couple of beach bars, one of which plays banging house music: ( tribal house circa 1992 ).....go elsewhere ..:-(",
          "Great small clean beach with restaurants. We got there by bus and spent whole day there. Great music",
          "We enjoyed almost 7 days visiting this beach. The sand and sea beautiful. Very attractive surroundings too. You will need to pay for us beds and umbrella if you do not have your own. Definitely worth it if there for a whole day.",
          "White sand beach with very clear water - so clear you can actually see fish shoal swimming cloase to the shore.",
          "In my summer in my Palma this was the beach we went most. It's reachable with bus, good beach, clean water, toilets close to the beach. There are a couple of cheap shops nearby where you can get cold drinks and bocadillos. Also lifeguards walking up and down the whole day.",
          "Beautiful beach in the southwestern part of Palma, nearby there is a commercial center Porto Pi, where we could make some shopping and make a lunch break.",
          "Not far from Palma and nice beaches with clean sea. Very touristry and much nicer places to visit on the Island.",
          "We got a taxi here from the centre of Palma. It takes 15 minutes and cost \u20ac12 each way. A small beach with lots of people but if you can get a sun lounger it's great. They are \u20ac8 for the whole day and definitely worth it. Also great iced cappuccinos by the bar on the beach!",
          "As are most beaches here, crowded and no one moves for hours. Lots of red bodies everywhere so bit of turn off! No one wants to see sweaty bottoms",
          "We stayed at a hotel practically on this beach. Nice water but sadly much to crowded during the time we stayed at the hotel, almost hard to get into the water... Get there early! Most of the people get there around 10-11 it seems.",
          "Nice beach and quite small, but a bit crowded in summer. It has few restaurants and bars with good cocktails. One disadvantage there are no shadows at all, so you either obliged to rent an umbrella or bring your own.",
          "We stayed in Palma last week for five days, three days we caught the number 3 bus and came to this fab little beach. Sunbeds and parasols were 5.35 euros each, there were a couple of beach bars, toilets, showers and lifeguards on watch too. The waves were great fun and the water",
          "Only a twenty-five minute bus ride from Palma, this lovely gem is tucked behind some popular hotels in the region. It gets really busy in high season as a result, but it is bearable in late June/early July. The waters are warm, gorgeous and shallow for quite a while. Really had",
          "This beach is the most popular and nice close to the town of Palma! You have more nice beaches if you take a taxi to Palmanova!",
          "One of the nicest beaches around with soft sand and clean waters. Sadly its rather busy because of its small size. Definitely agreeable but only if large assemblies don't bother you!",
          "The beach is nice, the water perfect. There are 2 small beach bars to both ends of the beach, people are normally quite young (teens to 40ish), a lot of infrastructure around. Bus number 3 goes there from Palma and from the west side of Palma it is the closest beach. We go there",
          "Playa de Cala Mayor is a small and very crowded beach (during the entire day), but it's understandable as the sand is soft and the water is crystal clear warm.",

          "This is a small beach close to Palma worth a visit but expect the crowds. Lovely sand and the water quality is superb. Paddle boarding and Pedlo hire available as well as sun loungers. One of this places worth getting there early. A couple of places to eat close overlooking the",

          "Situated between Porto Pi and San Augustin neighbourhoods, Cala Mayor beach is a narrow strip of sand (about 200 meters long), surrounded by relatively tall buildings and, despite of its clean sand, can compete for a top position among the ugliest, most uninspiring beaches in",
          "Relaxing, no children. Topless. My only complaint it that the sign on the beach said 5 euros for an umbrella. Some random Spanish guy comes along and demands 16.50 euro for two chairs, and the umbrella. It should have stated that on the sign. Trust no one.",
          "Fabulous little beach with a beach club and several bars. The usual umbrellas and sun loungers for hire at a reasonable price. Loved the little bar at the end of the beach serving the most delicious cocktails at a ridiculously cheap price - who wouldn't like this!! We caught a",

          "Cala Mayor is a walking distance away from Palma, almost hidden behind the multitude of infrastructures built around it through the years. There's a couple of restaurants and a beach bar and it can be very crowdy during the nice season so I'd suggest you to enjoy it in May/June",

          "This beach is easily reached by several bus lines from central Palma, and it appears very clean with fine grained sand and clear water. It is very crowded so getting your hands on a sunbed and/or a parasol can be difficult if you get there at the wrong time. Around 15 o'clock",
          "Cala Mayor was a nice place, a few shops and bars and places to eat, not very good if you are looking for nightlife or anything like that. 20 euros for a taxi to Palma nova or magaluf, and about 5euro into Palma. beach is lovely",

With a population of 1.6 million within city limits, its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the Province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people, making it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid, and Milan. It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s, and bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of which is 512 metres (1,680 feet) high.\nFounded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After merging with the Kingdom of Aragon, Barcelona continued to be an important city in the Crown of Aragon as an economic and administrative centre of this Crown and the capital of the Principality of Catalonia. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed and Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Since 1450, it is home to the University of Barcelona, widely considered the most prestigious university in Spain. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions and also many international sport tournaments.\nBarcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe, as well as the main biotech hub in Spain. As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port, an international airport, Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport, which handles over 50 million passengers per year, an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe name Barcelona comes from the ancient Iberian Ba\u0155keno, attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as , in ancient Greek sources as \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd, Barkin\u1e53n; and in Latin as Barcino, Barcilonum and Barcenona.Some older sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC, but there is no evidence that Barcelona was ever a Carthaginian settlement, or that its name in antiquity, Barcino, had any connection with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as Barchinona, Bar\u00e7alona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona.\nInternationally, Barcelona's name is wrongly abbreviated to 'Bar\u00e7a'. However, this name refers only to FC Barcelona, the football club. The common abbreviated form used by locals is Barna.\nAnother common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport.\nThe city is also referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan, and Ciudad Condal in Spanish (i.e. Comital City or City of Counts), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history ===\nThe origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been \nfound, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC. The founding of Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes the founding of the city to the mythological Hercules. The second legend attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city Barcino after his family in the 3rd century BC, but there is no historical or linguistic evidence that this is true.\n\n\n=== Roman Barcelona ===\nIn about 15 BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred on the \"Mons Taber\", a little hill near the contemporary city hall (Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume). Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia, or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino or Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour. It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens. The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive.\n\nImportant Roman vestiges are displayed in Pla\u00e7a del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the Barri G\u00f2tic (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral. The cathedral, known very formally by the long name of Catedral Bas\u00edlica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called La Seu, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan. It is said to have been founded in 343.\n\n\n=== Medieval Barcelona ===\nThe city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Arabs in the early 8th century, it was conquered in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian \"Hispanic March\" (Marca Hispanica), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.\nThe Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include all of Catalonia, although on 6 July 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor. The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved. In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century.\nBarcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia. It initially fed from eastern and balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.The forging of a dynastic link between the Crowns of Aragon and Castile marked the beginning of Barcelona's decline. The Bank of Barcelona (Taula de canvi), probably the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).\n\n\n=== Barcelona under the Spanish monarchy ===\nThe marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 united the two royal lines. Madrid became the centre of political power whilst the colonisation of the Americas reduced the financial importance (at least in relative terms) of Mediterranean trade. Barcelona was a centre of Catalan separatism, including the Catalan Revolt (1640\u201352) against Philip IV of Spain. The great plague of 1650\u20131654 halved the city's population.\n\nIn the 18th century, a fortress was built at Montju\u00efc that overlooked the harbour. In 1794, this fortress was used by the French astronomer Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9 M\u00e9chain for observations relating to a survey stretching to Dunkirk that provided the official basis of the measurement of a metre. The definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialisation saw the fortunes of the province improve.\n\n\n=== The Spanish Civil War and the Franco period ===\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivised by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'\u00e9tat was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished, and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.\n\n\n=== Late twentieth century ===\nIn 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and two miles of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\n\nThe death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratisation throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government. Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (\u221216.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla in the city, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nBarcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5 km (3 mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the Bes\u00f2s river to the north. This plain covers an area of 170 km2 (66 sq mi), of which 101 km2 (39.0 sq mi) are occupied by the city itself. It is 120 kilometres (75 miles) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France.\nTibidabo, 512 m (1,680 ft) high, offers striking views over the city and is topped by the 288.4 m (946.2 ft) Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanised, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (267 metres or 876 feet), Putget (181 metres or 594 feet) and Rovira (261 metres or 856 feet). The escarpment of Montju\u00efc (173 metres or 568 feet), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montju\u00efc Castle, a fortress built in the 17\u201318th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montju\u00efc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens.\nThe city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adri\u00e0 de Bes\u00f2s to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Barcelona has a maritime Mediterranean climate (Csa), with mild winters and warm to hot summers, while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterised by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as \"Portuguese\" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) found in inland areas such as the Po Valley (e.g. Milan), whose rainfall is greater in summer, a feature of continental climates.\nIts average annual temperature is 21.2 \u00b0C (70.2 \u00b0F) during the day and 15.1 \u00b0C (59.2 \u00b0F) at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F). In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to 18 \u00b0C (54 to 64 \u00b0F) during the day, 6 to 12 \u00b0C (43 to 54 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F). In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31 \u00b0C (81 to 88 \u00b0F) during the day, about 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F). Generally, the summer or \"holiday\" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months \u2013 April and November \u2013 are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of 18\u201319 \u00b0C (64\u201366 \u00b0F) during the day and 11\u201313 \u00b0C (52\u201355 \u00b0F) at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent.\nBarcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (\u2265 1 mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September\u2013November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June\u2013August), with a secondary winter minimum (February\u2013March). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10 hours of sunshine a day) in July.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to Barcelona's City Council, Barcelona's population as of 1 January 2016 was 1,608,746 people, on a land area of 101.4 km2 (39 sq mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 square kilometres (246 square miles) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000. It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it. Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system.\nIn 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000 people, which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialised parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 with 1,906,998 people, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 people, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.\n\n\n=== Population density ===\n\nNote: This text is entirely based on the municipal statistical database provided by the city council.\nBarcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.\nIn the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and Montju\u00efc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 square kilometres (20 square miles) at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.\nOf the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square km. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.\n\n\n=== Age structure ===\nIn 1900 almost a third (28.9 percent) were children (aged younger than 14 years), In 2017 this age group constituted only 12.7; those aged between 15 and 24 years in 2017 were 9 percent; those aged between 25 and 44 years a 30.6 percent. In contrast, in 2017 the aged between 45 and 64 years formed the 56.9% of all Barcelonans; while in 1900 the aged 65 and older were just the 6.5 percent, in 2017 reached a 21.5.\n\n\n=== Migration ===\nIn 2016 about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% respectively 3.9%.The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506). Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.There exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines. There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nMost of the inhabitants state they are Roman Catholic (208 churches). In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCat\u00f3lica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic. This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians. The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined. In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).The province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion. A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain). In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim, which makes 5.6% of total population.\nThe city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city. There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations), and Eastern Orthodox.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== General information ===\n\nThe Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to \u20ac28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177 billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009. Barcelona city had a very high GDP of \u20ac80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat. Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of 2009.Barcelona was the 24th most \"livable city\" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine Monocle. Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on Innovation Cities\u2122 Global Index. At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.\nBorsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.\nBarcelona was recognised as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential, by FDi Magazine in their bi-annual rankings.\n\n\n=== Trade fair and exhibitions ===\n\nDrawing upon its tradition of creative art and craftsmanship, Barcelona is known for its award-winning industrial design. It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona \u2013 the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.\nAn important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona's Port Vell harbour.\nThe city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nBarcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011. By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors. With its Rambles, Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.Barcelona as internationally renowned a tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world, mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016 including 35 five star hotels, and developed tourist infrastructure.\nDue to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. For this reason, most travel guides recommend that visitors take precautions to ensure their possessions' safety, especially inside the metro premises. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of health security and personal safety, mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider.While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report, the city is \"overrun [by] hordes of tourists\". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included \"Tourists go home\", \"Barcelona is not for sale\" and \"We will not be driven out\". By then, number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated \u20ac30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.A May 2017 article in England's The Telegraph newspaper included Barcelona among the Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, \"We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop [like Venice]\". To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb with a \u20ac30,000. The mayor has suggested an additional tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors. One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an \"overtourism crisis\" in several major European cities. \"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success.\", he said. \"Managing tourism more responsibly can help\", Francis later told a journalist, \"but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that\".\n\n\n=== Manufacturing sector ===\nIndustry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region, with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production. The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.Barcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, Art\u00e9s de Arcos, Balandr\u00e1s, Baradat-Esteve, Bisc\u00fater, J. Castro, Cl\u00faa, David, Delf\u00edn, D\u00edaz y Grill\u00f3, Ebro trucks, Edis, Elizalde, Autom\u00f3viles Espa\u00f1a, Eucort, Fenix, F\u00e1brica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga, F\u00e1brica Espa\u00f1ola de Autom\u00f3viles Hebe, Hispano-Suiza, Hurac\u00e1n Motors, Talleres Hereter, Junior SL, Kapi, La Cuadra, M.A., Autom\u00f3viles Matas, Motores y Motos, Nacional Custals, National Pescara, Nacional RG, Nacional Rubi, Nacional Sitjes, Autom\u00f3viles Nike, Orix, Otro Ford, Partia, Pegaso, PTV, Ricart, Ricart-Espa\u00f1a, Industrias Salvador, Siata Espa\u00f1ola, Stevenson, Romagosa y Compa\u00f1\u00eda, Garaje Storm, Talleres Hereter, Trimak, Autom\u00f3viles Victoria, Manufacturas Mec\u00e1nicas Aleu.Today, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city. The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nThe traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably Gaudi Home.Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organisers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought \u20ac100 m to the city in just three days.Since 2009, The Brandery, an urban fashion show, has been held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milano and before Berlin in 2015.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nAs the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the Barcelon\u00e8s comarca (district).\nBarcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006. According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administrates the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level. This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions. It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.\n\nThe Comissi\u00f3 de Govern (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors. The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions. The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary. The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the Gu\u00e0rdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.\n\nThe executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.The seat of the city council is on the Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.\nAfter 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nSince 1987, the city has been divided into 10 administrative districts (districtes in Catalan, distritos in Spanish):\n\nCiutat Vella\nEixample\nSants-Montju\u00efc\nLes Corts\nSarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi\nGr\u00e0cia\nHorta-Guinard\u00f3\nNou Barris\nSant Andreu\nSant Mart\u00edThe districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nBarcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these is the University of Barcelona (established in 1450), a world-renowned research and teaching institution with campuses around the city. It is one of the degree-awarding bodies of the Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals (IBEI), a prestigious interuniversity postgraduate institution for international affairs located in the center of the city. Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and the newer Pompeu Fabra University, and, in the private sector the EADA Business School founded in 1957, became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona.\n\nThe city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as escoles concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (escoles privades).\nThe language of instruction at public schools and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or escola concertada offer International Baccalaureate programmes.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBarcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network. It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nBarcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simf\u00f2nica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue. It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente.\nThe major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers.\nYearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the S\u00f3nar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nEl Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya, La Vanguardia and Ara are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, Ara only in Catalan) while Sport and El Mundo Deportivo (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as Ara and El Punt Avui (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions like El Pais (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and El Mundo (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like 20 minutos and Qu\u00e8 (all bilingual).\nBarcelona's oldest and main online newspaper VilaWeb is also the oldest one in Europe (with Catalan and English editions).\nSeveral major FM stations include Catalunya R\u00e0dio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV stations, BTV, owned by city council. The headquarters of Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are located in Sant Joan Desp\u00ed, in Barcelona's metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nBarcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.\n\nFC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the second richest in the world. It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals. It is the only male football team in the world to win six trophies in a calendar year (in 2009). FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national and/or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona.\n\nBarcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornell\u00e0-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal Narc\u00eds Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000 (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500.\nBarcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.\n\nSeveral road running competitions are organised year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Ingl\u00e9s in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la Merc\u00e8, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and the San Silvestre. There's also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes 85 kilometres (53 miles) through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat God\u00f3, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each Christmas, a swimming race across the port is organised. Near Barcelona, in Montmel\u00f3, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.\n\n\n=== Squatter's Movement ===\nBarcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists. Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services. The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organise various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu. Police have repeatedly tried to shut down the squatters movement with waves of evictions and raids, but the movement is still going strong.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nBarcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about 17 km (11 mi) from the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend. It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009.\nSome low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about 90 km (56 mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77 km (48 mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150 km (93 mi) to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nThe Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013. The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south.\n\nThe Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a most important Mediterranean turnaround base. In 2013, 3,6 million of pleasure cruises passengers used services of the Port of Barcelona.The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums \u2013 Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.\n\n\n=== National and international rail ===\n\nBarcelona is a major hub for RENFE, the Spanish state railway network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona.\nRENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of 310 km/h (193 mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the Madrid\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseilles and Toulouse, through Perpignan\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.\n\n\n=== Metro and regional rail ===\n\nBarcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolit\u00e0 (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.The Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines.\nIn addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nThe city's two modern tram systems, Trambaix and Trambes\u00f2s, are operated by TRAMMET. A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.\n\n\n=== Funicular and cable car ===\nBarcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montju\u00efc up Montju\u00efc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montju\u00efc Cable Car, which serves Montju\u00efc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebasti\u00e0 over the port.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nBuses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as Aerob\u00fas, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.\nThe Estaci\u00f3 del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.\n\n\n=== Taxi ===\n\nBarcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut Metropolit\u00e0 del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.On 22 March 2007, Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station. The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.\n\n\n=== Roads and highways ===\n\nBarcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60.\nThe city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.\nThe city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Gl\u00f2ries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe Barri G\u00f2tic (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan modernista architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015, completion is planned for 2026.Barcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolise modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms \"less is more\" and \"God is in the details.\" The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.\nBarcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture, the first (and as of 2015, only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect.\n\n\n=== World Heritage Sites ===\nBarcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:\n\n\n=== Historic buildings and monuments ===\n\nMinor basilica of Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, the symbol of Barcelona.\nPalau de la M\u00fasica Catalana and Hospital de Sant Pau, designed by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, included in the UNESCO Heritage List in 1997.\nWorks by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, including Park G\u00fcell, Palau G\u00fcell, Casa Mil\u00e0 (La Pedrera), Casa Vicens, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (Nativity fa\u00e7ade and crypt), Casa Batll\u00f3, crypt in Church of Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell. The first three works were inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1984. The other four were added as extensions to the site in 2005.\nThe Cathedral of the Holy Cross and St. Eulalia (Gothic)\nGothic basilica of Santa Maria del Mar\nGothic basilica of Santa Maria del Pi\nRomanesque church of Sant Pau del Camp\nPalau Reial Major, medieval residence of the sovereign Counts of Barcelona, later Kings of Aragon\nThe Royal Shipyard (gothic)\nMonastery of Pedralbes (gothic)\nThe Columbus Monument\nThe Arc de Triomf, a triumphal arch built for entrance to 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition.\nExpiatory church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on the summit of Tibidabo.\nThe Historic Building of the University of Barcelona\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nBarcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, Picasso Museum, and Fundaci\u00f3 Antoni T\u00e0pies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundaci\u00f3 Vila Casas.\nSeveral museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of \"Museo Martorell de Arqueolog\u00eda y Ciencias Naturales\" (Spanish for \"Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences\"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the Laboratori de Natura, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too.\nThe FC Barcelona Museum has been the most visited museum in the city of Barcelona, with 1,506,022 visitors in 2013.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nBarcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest. They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres). The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year, with a proportion of 18.1 square metres (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.Of Barcelona's parks, Montju\u00efc is the largest, with 203 ha located on the mountain of the same name. It is followed by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old military citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and several museums); 31 ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the Guinard\u00f3 Park (19 ha or 47.0 acres), Park G\u00fcell (designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed; 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal Mar Park (13.3 ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central Park (13.2 ha or 32.6 acres), Can Drag\u00f3 Sports Park and Poblenou Park (both 11.9 ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10 ha or 22.5 acres), named after the garden maze it contains. There are also several smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aig\u00fces (2 ha or 4.9 acres). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona. Also, within the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride.\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\n\nBarcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to National Geographic and Discovery Channel. Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5 kilometres (2.8 miles) of coastline. Sant Sebasti\u00e0, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100 m (3,610 ft) in length, are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona.\nThe Olympic Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Ic\u00e0ria, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material.

          "I only visited here because the CitySightseeing bus stops right outside - I would never have heard of it if it didn't! Inside is a reconstruction of a typical Spanish town, except that almost all the buildings are replicas of very famous places from around Spain, all gathered",

          "Not easy to find by public transport,but worth the effort. Buildings from all parts of Spanish mainland, a bit short on explanations, but very photogenic, just enjoy all the visual details! A bit tricky to get around if you are not 100 percent mobile (lack of handrail on some",

          "I like the idea and the architecture was very interesting. But, it cost $6 or 7E to get in and it was deader than a doornail. This was on a Tuesday around noon. It was promoted as being able to see shops and be able to get a bite to eat. But, nothing was open and it appeared",

          "Poble Espanyol is a strange, beautiful phantom town. It contains exact copies of buildings from different regions of Spain (about 25). The buildings are very well made and painstaking. I entered the house of Toledo (copy) of El Greco. I was glad I got (barely) up there. Here is",
          "A hidden gem of a village, beautiful walk around miniature Spanish architecture buildings of the world,lovely cafe inside too, sitting under the trees drinking coffee was idyllic X great stop on the Palma city tour X",
          "We went on a damp Friday hoping for a pootle around interesting buildings. Sadly it had been taken over by an outlet shopping group and despite being told we could still walk around, most of the site was blocked off to focus your attention on the curious wares for sale. I am",
          "The buildings were all copies of originals throughout Spain. Very tastefully done. Good place to get away from the midday sun.",
          "A really good exhibition where you can meander down the streets and see, for example, the Alhambra (Granada) or Moorish buildings. It is well-done and there is always the bar/cafe for a little break. We spent 2 hours here and for just a few euros well-worth a visit.",
          "This place is unbelievable. There is probably more atmosphere on Mars. Admittedly we visited one week before Easter week but there was nothing there apart from some empty and derelict buildings. The girl at reception couldn't have cared less and deserves the sack for her lack of",
          "We went to this place to have a nice visit and after paying the entry, we only found restaurants and shops, there was really nothing to be seen !",
          "We preferred the one in Bacelona but it was still well worth the visit. When we went it was December so there was lot of Christmas stalls selling stuff.",
          "This is an interesting site, along the lines of Portmeirion in Wales. A mini village created in the 1960s within a Palma suburb built to reflect the many architectural styles of Spain from Moorish through to Baroque. It feels a little like a ghost town as the buildings are empty",
          "Built in the 1960's this series of buildings and streets are fascinating. It was our first stop on the hop on hop off bus and we were glad we got off (nobody else did!) We spent around an hour wandering the well presented, pretty buildings which were what I guess were a fair",
          "Quite expensive entry fee at 6 euros per person but in the time it took us to go round just over 15 minutes I wouldn\u2019t make a special trip here.",
          "Absolutely nothing to see. The place do not offer nothing really interesting. Just fake buildings. It is in some places dirty and we feel that nobody really cares to take care of cleaning. Even some places smells bad. It is not expensive, just 6\u20ac, but we spend only 20 minutes in.",
          "Outside the cathedral there are nice shops, cafe and restaurants..if you continue walking in the old city you will definatly enjoy the nice streets, shops and weather of Palma..",
          "If you are an architecture student then this may be for you but we went to see the artisans at work and do a bit of shopping but the only thing - apart from the buildings was a small cafe. The lady in the cafe said that everything was shut because of the Crisis. Felt we should",
          "Probably should have read reviews before going as at 6 euros a head it is a bit pricey for what you get. It was nice to look at the different buildings and styles but nothing special and we'd seen it all within 20 mins. Staff are not very friendly.",
          "If you are staying near the harbour with a couple of hours to spare give this a try. It's \u20ac6 each and features Spanish architecture. We've stayed in Palma a few times so have done lots of trips to Soller and the Cathedral etc so this made a change.",
          "Very relaxing environment. Unique architecture of Spanish history representing famous cities. Beautiful pedestrian streets and squares. Worth a visit as it's worldwide the third best of its kind.",
          "only went here because it was on the city sightseeing tour, otherwise I wouldnt have known about it. Entrance was 6 euros. I went on a sunday it was really quiet, hardly any people there. There's a similar attraction in Barcelona which has crafts shops and peoples in",
          "A great place to visit any time of the year but especially around Christmas time. A very unique way of learning a lot of Spanish history. Different places to eat & drink at reasonable prices. Different parts of Spain in miniature, I really enjoyed the \"Alambra\" which I had",
          "Came here on a Saturday when it opened at 11 am . Inside was also a medieval market which was nice to look around which had an amazing bbq. The buildings had very nice architecture and were so interesting to look at . This is quite big when you get inside and had a variety of",
          "Great way to wile away a few hours\u2026. Spain in miniature\u2026 all the famous buildings you can think of in spain, all in one place\u2026 just a little smaller than the real thing!",
          "This arvchitectural village could be so nice - and so interesting - but as many other reviewers have written, it was over-priced, unfriendly and unwelcoming. The staff were disdainful, and all the point-of-sale facilities were closed. Concrete-mixers and no-access lines.",
          "Poble Espanyol is a small village which portrays architecture of various Spanish areas and the cultural diversity of the country. Inside the village one can find 117 replicas of different buildings in Spain. It is amazing! Most of the European cities have a large square which",
          "Alittle village by architect Fernando Check gotilla. Very interesting if you like architecture. It links different building and famous land marks from around Spain. If you don't like architecture this not for you. We found this by off chance down afew side streets just outside",
          "My husband and I, together with my sons and their partners visited today (Sunday afternoon) around 4.00pm We were charged 6 euros each admission (around \u00a330 in total) by a rather brusque attendant. The place was deserted and no where open. We spent about 20 minutes wandering",
          "The Pueblo Espa\u00f1ol is like a very good architecture museum because there are copies of many of Spain's important buildings, each one representing a province or city. It is a wonderful place to take photos too. I enjoyed this site very much.",
          "Quaint place to ramble - look for authentic souvenirs - chat with artisans - nice pictures. Don't plan a meal around the place but stay for a cup of tea or glass of wine. Subway stop Espanya direct from las ramblas Liceu stop - but it's a (nice) walk from there past the art",
          "It was the nearest hop on hop off point to our hotel for the Palma sightseeing bus so we headed for it and made plans to look inside after the bus trip. Have to say it was a bit of a disappointment and nothing like as good as the Barcelona site. As one reviewer says, hardly a",
          "Escape from the bustle of Palma and visit this country in miniature really interesting to see all the major cities of Spain represented but it is sadly all a bit run down. If it was renovated it could be absolutely lovely",
          "Having visited a similar attraction in Barcelona, and following the promise of crafts workshops and restaurants we visited on an April afternoon. What a disappointment. The architecture and basic built environment is great, but everything is shut. One lousy shop selling pearls",
          "This re-made village gathers architecture from 3 regions of Spain (Cordoba, Toledo, and Madrid) into a mock village. Complete with winding alleys, stonework, and remarkable recreations, this recently-refinished walkable outdoor museum feels like a hidden treasure on the",
          "We went there is Dec, so few visitors. The different locations showing Seville, Granada etc are very true to life. The streets have also been laid out in a particular Spanish location. Well worth a visit. It is an attraction, but a cultural one. There is an excellent shop",
          "Do not just hop off and hop on the tourist bus .... Really spend time here there is so much to see , a hidden gem that is walkable from the harbour and great cafe across the road to meet the locals .",
          "After visiting and being very in pressed with the equivalent attraction in Barcelona I have to say I was very disappointed. Yes it has examples of architecture from all over Spain but there was nobody else looking round, all the shops where shut or boarded up and some of the",
          "Very happy we went here, all of us had a great time .. there are differents architectural works from differents cities from Spain , is like pieces of little towns and not getting bored around them, walking trough and discovering beauty .. not expenssive at all .",
          "Although not as large, or as impressive as the Poble Espanol in Barcelona, this is still worth the visit. The space is well organised, with the differenct buildings gently nestling into each other. When I went, it was surprisingly very quiet - with very few other people. A",
          "We didn't read Rick Steve's Spain book review until after we had gone. He nailed it. Ticky-tacky shops. We did have some good food at the chocolate store and one restaurant where the staff was great.",
          "The entry cost was 6euros but I don't think it was worth it really. There are examples of the different styles of Spanish architecture here but the place was virtually deserted. We learned about this on the Hop On Hop Off bus so took the opportunity to hop off and go see. It",
          "If you want to see cobwebs, weeds, litter and broken fitments, then this is the place for you. A pity, as the idea behind the Poble Espanyol is a good one (and Franco didn't have many...) Who wouldn't want to see the best of Spanish historical architecture in one place? Well, a",
          "I loved this place. It is not a popular attraction as it seems to get no publicity. We came across it by accident. It is very enjoyable to look around. It is a collection of buildings from all over Spain, erected during the Franco era. Well put together - feels like a small town.",
          "This is worth a visit, we used the HOHO bus to find it. The buildings are very stunning and you can enter some of them. well recommended.",
          "I only noticed this place because of the bus tour around Palma, otherwise it's kind of hidden away from advertising etc. I loved this place and wish I had more time to explore it before having to run off towards the airport. It's quaint and adorable and it feels like being in a",
          "If you don\u2019t have anything else to do when you are visiting Palma, you may go here. Entrance fee 6 Euros. This \u201csmall village\u201d contains copies of Spain\u2019s most famous buildings (so they say). They didn\u2019t have information pamphlets in English (run out of?). This is a boring",
          "I specifically remembered visiting this place with my friend at 4.30 PM (30 mins before closing time). The receptionist had told us that we would not be able to cover the whole thing within 30 mins but we paid the entrance fee anyway and went in! Here is what I have to say:",
          "Where else can you go and see some of the most Iconic buildings from Madrid, Toledo, Sevilla, Granada and Barcelona in minutes. With reconstructions of some of Spains most iconic buildings the Poble Espanyol is a crash course in the varied architecture of the country. Perhaps",
          "What an utter waste of money -\u20ac6 for nothing. Ignore the ads or the brochures, it is nothing. Cheap and amateur looking.",
          "We took the HOHO bus to visit the Village. It is indeed a lovely area and lots of photo opportunities of the amazing architecture. However if time is short I think there are more valid places to see. Not impressed by the 50 minute wait for the next bus from the Village.",

          "My family and I have been to Marineland quite a few times. The park is big to walk around especially on a hot day or maybe we just got lost but so wonderful to see all the animals and the parrot show. It's not good for people with disabilities as I was in a wheelchair one year",
          "The Sea lion and Dolphin Shows were amazing. I\u2019ve seen simmular shows in Florida and Tenerife. This one also took my breath away. Definately worth seeing. The Parrot Show, on the other hand is more for younger kids. Cleaver, but once you\u2019ve seen one parrot show, the others",
          "How this is still a major attraction, on a relatively developed island, is beyond me. The pools are far too small for the animals, who wear visible signs of distress. You'd hope local and international pressure closes this dump down soon.",
          "Fantastic dolphin and parrot shows. The other animals are interesting and enjoyable to watch but it doesn\u2019t take long to walk around and see everything . Good decorations for Halloween!",
          "We managed to go here on the last day of their season - they were closing that day. It was quite busy but had a feel of the staff being relieved that they were almost done for the year. I was very disappointed with the actual animals/mammals there - hardly any at all.",
          "We visited day before it closed for season. We had a great time. Dolphin show were excellent. Kids had pictures taken with seals which they loved. Well worth a visit for few hours. Splash pool closed which was a shame as the weather we're beautiful. . Parrots aquarium,",
          "Fantastic day - we did the dolphin experience which was amazing and great value for money. The trainers were lovely and answered all our questions. It is a small place but we also used the private beach for a rest break and had lunch on the veranda which was lovely. The staff",
          "Easy to get to and free parking (collect a voucher when you buy your tickets) and the kids loved it. We were all amazed by the sea lion and dolphin show but we were very glad we didn\u2019t pay \u20ac20 to get a photo with a dolphin. The food was surprisingly good, just don\u2019t get in the",
          "The dolphin show was amazing, the trainers and dolphins were very talented and the show was as good as seaworld in Orlando. The park isn\u2019t big which we liked as it was easy to find everything. The bird show was also fun with parrots riding scooters and bikes. Parking is free",
          "Not enough to do and we was only there 4 hours and we saw everything in 2 hours , to many animals in small cages! Looking very sad , fake plants in the snake and lizard tanks , fish with rotting sores on there head and not enough water for them to swim in some of them barely had",
          "We did a \"NO Frills\" excursion from Alcudia, and had an amazing day. Picked up at 10am and dropped back at 6pm, so a full day. The trip down was about an hour, but still meant we had well over 5 hours after all the pick ups. The park is quite small, but the shows more than",
          "Visited this park on Monday 7th October just my partner and I. We wanted something to do for the day and had seen this had be recommended so thought we would take a look and try out. Was very impressed with the park and we had a great day. The park is small and is said a lot on",
          "Sadly after having to pay \u20ac90 euros to embark on this visit I wish I had hired a car and gone elsewhere. On arrival it soon become apparent that this is a very small park and they are working within what space they have. But with a small child in tow there was really not",
          "We were here all morning with my boyfriend and the shows were definitely worth it. The park is pretty small but there\u2019s enough to see. Watch out, the food and any extra is pretty expensive. It\u2019s worth taking a sandwich if you plan on staying.",
          "We have visited here for the last few years and we love it. The shows are great and we love that its small and we can take our time and not have to rush to fit it all in. This year the dolphins seems to make alot more of a splash than normal and the foor and first couple of",
          "Marineland is quite expensive considering the small size of the place, but the time spent there (2-3 hours) was very nice. Be sure to plan your visit to watch the dolphin, seal and parrot shows that are the biggest attractions of this place. Our two-year-old son was delighted",
          "My partner and I visited Marineland one afternoon. We were out after an hour. 52\u20ac for the both of us. We pretty much walked around in 30 minutes and watched the parrot show for 20 minutes. The enclosures are terribly small. Three sea lions in an enclosure that wasn\u2019t even half",
          "Expensive for what you get compared to other places I\u2019ve been to with dolphin shows, food very expensive for average food. Vodka and coke 9.5\u20ac is an unacceptable price especially when the prices aren\u2019t advertised . Overall dolphin show and bird show was good ( not best I\u2019ve",
          "Well priced for us considering our son is 2 and driver goes free. The dolphin show was amazing. 100% recommend visiting during the times the show is on. Rest of the selection was good, again, get what you pay for. Food prices and selection wasn\u2019t the best but not there long",
          "tell you the truth this place is to go with kids, but as a couple, is good to do something different. We enjoy so much the show with parrots, the show with the dolphins , and the show with the sea lions. You can see also the zoo and the aquarium inside the Marineland. also the",
          "Myself and my boyfriend went here during an afternoon, yes it is small but there is a sea lion show, dolphin show and also a bird show. I would recommend going here for a visit however, we didnt stay much longer than an hour and a half as we had seen everything. If you had",
          "Awful place, very overpriced only takes 1hr if that to see everything, eat before you go extremely expensive to buy drinks and food. Dolphine show was ok seen better didn't do much and only lasted a very short time.",
          "We went to Marineland Majorca today. When we bought our tickets we were told there was a free bus available to and from the venue. Bus stopped at a few stops along the way and only took around 15minutes to get there. The trip if you wanted to use the free bus was 4 hours. The",
          "As other reviews have mentioned, the park is compact but the shows are very good. We decided not to catch the free bus as it gets you there hours before the shows and we didn't want to spend loads on food and drinks there so we got the bus there for 2.30pm and had an hour to",
          "Spent a lot on the day out by the end of the day 450 euros had been spent food is overpriced and not a lot for your money and it is a small place but the shows are excellent and I really enjoyed myself would have loved to do the experience but it was way to pricey",
          "Smaller than expected but great shows, would visit again. Packing swim wear will be great when travelling with young children.",
          "Place suits for small children. Dolphin and sealion shows were great. Stand is big enough to have place for everyone. This place has also good restaurant (pizza, pasta, grill) and seaview.",
          "All in all this was a good day out but the food prices were extortionate, paid \u20ac58 for a pizza and 2 fish and chips I see now why lots of people brought there own food , having said this the kids enjoyed the dolphin show and sea lion show, and also the parrot show. Another",
          "We visited here on a Coach trip from s'illot and the price wasn't too expensive. Lots of places to see from the aviary to the aquarium as well as penguins, rays, flamingo etc. Very good shows both the dolphins and sea lions as is the parrot show also the opportunity to have a",
          "We enjoyed the dolphin show, photo opportunities and the variety of animals. However we felt that some exhibits just don\u2019t look looked after, no water for flamingos, small habitats for monkeys, not a lot of water for stingrays, turtles and penguins and birds trying to get out",
          "Although the entrance fee is pretty high all those shows with animals were gorgeous so you will not regret.",
          "We paid \u00a3190 euros to do a Tui trip for 4 of us to go to Marineland and it was the worst day out we\u2019ve ever had. We had only been in Marineland for 5 minutes when I was SCREAMED at by a member of staff who accused my sister of taking a photo of me with the parrots at the",
          "Bad value for money. The ticket was too expensive (26 euros/per adult) for the zoo's provisions. Furthermore in some cages the animals looked a little uncomfortable due to the small places that they were living. On the other hand the shows were enjoyable and the aquarium was",
          "Wouldn't recommend this. Small enclosures and depressed animals. Should be banned. Won;t be going back!",
          "This place is extortionate! We did this in half a day and this was stretched out as far as it could be. All of the animals looked depressed, particularly the many parrots which have clearly been caged as they didn't make the cut for the parrot show. Which was terrible by the",
          "I don\u2019t normally do \u2018animal shows\u2019 so I\u2019d looked into Marineland\u2019s conservation practises before we went. First we saw the parrots show and that was entertaining. Lots of reviews stated how small the place was and someone said they were done in 20 minutes - rubbish! My",
          "Booked this trip from alcudia which was quite costly so my expectations were high. We arrived at 10am nd left at 4pm. A half day would have sufficed. The shows, parrot, sealion and dolphins were all amazing and impressive. The rest of the park was disappointing, it is quite",
          "Went here whilst on holiday to do something other than lay on a sun lounger or the beach for a whole week! My two boys 9 and 12 were very keen to go. Booked via our TUI rep whilst staying in Palmanova. Cost about \u20ac75 for the four of us. Price included bus which picked us up at",
          "Weekend and I was looking around what to do with a 7 year young girl. Been reading some comments about Marineland here on TripAdvisor an was not sure if I should give it a try or look for something else. We (she) decided to go as she wanted to see the dolphins. Let me express",
          "So we always love to visit Marine, Zoo and animal type places as a family... However this is one which got me very frustrated.. Firstly if you are visiting make sure you arrive in time for the morning show and not what we did and arrive just as it started.. we then have to wait",
          "After seeing this advertised we decided to book the trip. After taking us nearly and hour and half to get there we were very disappointed we expected a lot bigger place with more things to see. Have to say though the seal and dolphin show were amazing and the bond between the",
          "We saw the mixed reviews of the park and was a little apprehensive but had a lovely time,the queues for drinks and ice cream were very long and prices for water \u20ac3.50 and slush high \u20ac7 but this didn't spoil our day. My daughter had the dolphin experience and enjoyed every",
          "One lady who works there called Kristina laughed in my face when complained about people pushing in front of us in the cue we was in for a long time with our child. Spoke to us like children and told us go go else we're, everyone is just pushing in front of each other and not",
          "Ok I'm a bit mixed about this visit, I don't agree with animals being in captivity, but yet I found myself enjoying this day out a lot, the food here is also very good, however, I do believe all the animals would be happier in the wild",
          "We had a lovely few hours here during out recently holiday to calvia. I wouldn't say it was overly small like other reviews though, I thought it was decent for price paid. The dolphin and seal shows were fantastic and informative, you could really see the bond between the",
          "We booked the trip with TUI and had possibly the best day out! There's plenty to do such as seeing different animals, going on the beach and having a 5 minute walk down to the port filled with gigantic yaghts! The dolphin show and sea lion show was absolutely amazing, just",
          "So my kid saw a poster of dolphines upon ariving in Mallorca. Which led to can we see them please. So against my better knowledge we went. What greeted us on entrance was some sickly looking parots screeching in a small cage. Then there was greeters with falconer wristprotectors",
          "This place as money have mentioned is great for younger kids! My two girls(5&7) had a blast! We arrived before the sea lion and dolphin show in half an hour so we had time to look around and see the parrots, flamingos, seals , penguins and sea lions. The place itself is great.",
          "We were staying within walking distance so thought we would visit on our holidays as we had never been to a dolphin show and really wanted to see one. We ordered tickets online through the website to save a little bit of money and showed them at the gate as mobile tickets. We",
          "Drove over from Cala D'or expecting to arrive at a substantial attraction but when we pulled into car park we almost missed it!! A lady was very quick to offer us a free car parking ticket so that was a good start however once inside it was very apparent that it was indeed very",
          "A marvellous day out. They say that small is beautiful and that applies here . The highlights are the shows. The sea- lion and dolphin shows were sheer delight . Comedic but in parts moving. The commentator spoke in a number of languages and her English very good. There was an",
          "Brilliant day we really enjoyed this trip..we paid at a kiosk in Palma nova & was collected & taken by coach..really enjoyed seeing all the different birds & sea life especially the dolphin & see lion show..grab your seat early though as it fills up fast..we also watched a",

          "My wife and I visited Marineland today from Palma. Got the 104 bus directly from Palma which took about 35mins and stopped directly outside the park which was a bonus. Fare was 3.80 euros. To address some of the negative comments posted on TA regarding the size of the park. Yes",
          "Nice little place with amazing sea views and access to a beautiful cove and sandy beach. However, quite a small park and probably best for families with small children. However, we are relaxing and enjoying our down time and love the dolphins.",
          "The park is small and I felt the aquarium was too small for the amount of animals in it. The ticket prices for kids are based on height so we had to pay adult prices for a 11 and 12 year old which I didn't think was fair. But they loved it, they loved the penguins, stingrays,",
          "Travelled with 4 and 7 year old. We liked sea lion and dolphin show (although swelteringly hot), splash area (v cold to start but get used to it quickly )and the reptile / indoors aquariums and (of course) ice cream ! Friendly staff. There was a long break between afternoon",
          "Marineland in Magaluf, Mallorca is a fairly small park. We first planned a day there but ended up with a half day, but this was actually perfect. You couldn\u2019t spend the whole day there, it\u2019s too small. We went with our 13 year old, she thought it was ok. But I guess older kids",
          "Firstly, if you wanna see dolphins and seals living in a bath sized environment this is the place, parrots where kept out in the sunlight for pictures which I think is wrong especially in the heat. The aquarium was as long as a tooth pick. Our 3 euro cups were stolen by staff",
          "Booked via rep at hotel but in hindsight should definitely have booked at home (much cheaper than resort price). Take beachwear or towels as nice cove to spend time in and lovely sea to swim/paddle. Park visit over within 3 and half hours if your operator times arrival to",
          "Reading the comments I have the impression that many were lacking things which had been never promised. Yes, it is a small place and you should not plan a whole day program here. But what you get is on high level: the parrot show, the dolphin show, the surroundings. At least",
          "Reasonably priced and excellent entertainment. Not usually bird fans the whole family enjoyed the parrot show, amusing and educational. The park was impecably clean and well maintained withe reptile House being a surprise bonus. Not just the usual couple of lizards \ud83e\udd8e..... The",
          "The dolphin and sea lion show was very good and lasted about half hour. The childrens pool is a good idea and our son enjoyed it in there. The issue is the park is very small and we were done in under 3 hours. We paid 60 euros for two adults and a 4 year old and found this to",
          "Really not worth the money! The place is absolutely tiny you can walk around it in 10 minutes. They advertise a parrot show on the flyer at 13.00 on one but and 13.30 on another so we got there at 12.45 to get a good seat and was sat there for 45 minutes until it started with no",
          "Visited with 3 year old son. The park is very clean and everything is within easy reach. We saw the parrot, sea lion & dolphin shows and found all thoroughly enjoyable. In my opinion, the way the handlers treated the parrots, sea lions & dolphins showed their close bond, they",
          "Went back to marine land this year. Not been for 5 years. It's ok think but small. The dolphin show was brill. Sealion show didnt go as planned as one of the sea lions wasnt playing ball. The parrot show was good aswell. The hybrid parrots are beautiful. They do have a dolphin",
          "Visited yestersay. We bought tickets in resort and took a taxi from our hotel in Palmanova and this was about 10euro. I've heard the free bus really unreliable and if full drives right past you. If like us small kids and waiting in heat not a good move. Quite a small park, we",
          "Me and my boyfriend thought that this would be a brilliant day out. We got here at 1pm and was finished by 1.20pm having seen everything. It was 52 euros to get in and to see the dolphins was extra on top of that. The pools were very small for the sea lions only a couple of",
          "What a lovely place to visit dolphin show was amazing best I've seen. The place is small but beautiful. It has a rocky beach that you can go into. There is 3 dolphin packages I did the premium one and got to learn how to train them and swim with them was amazing made my holiday.",
          "We visited here last week & the best thing about the park was the dolphin & Sealion show. Its really good to watch for children of all ages & adults. The rest of the park is only ok, there's not a huge amount to see. It's probably better for younger children but my 8 year old",
          "After reading reviews about how the animals were treated we was a little concerned. However the enclosures were clean and the sea lions and dolphins were well cared for. The staff were helpful and the shows were great. My daughters had photos taken with parrots, sea lions and",
          "So overall we were \u20ac26 for an adult and \u20ac14 for a kid I think! We paid \u20ac20 for each child to have their photo taken with the dolphins. Then \u20ac10 for the welcome photo you forced to take when you arrive with someone holding a parrot. Little expensive actually, I paid \u20ac50 for 3",
          "I came here imagining a large spacious area. It is so small. Good to go with children as they do shows etc. But all the inclosures are far far too small.. penguins have an area smaller than my family\u2019s garden pond and all in the sun dolphins kept in tiny area and beach nearby",
          "Upon arrival at marineland we were greeted by a woman who was taking photos , we agreed to have a pic, the woman was pushy trying to hurry us up which we found very rude. The que behind us was massive so in the picture we had 4 people photo bombing the photo so it looked more",

          "We had to travel 1hr on the coach to get here so paid \u20ac43 each and we thought it was worth every penny. The sea lion and dolphin show was truly incredible and something you will never forget! The new parrot show was also really good! The park isn\u2019t really huge but it has lots to",

          "Went here for 4 hours. The parrots and dolphins were amazing. However it was impossible to hear and understand what they were saying. It was clean and nice. Woyld go there again",
          "Great day out for all the family. We went in a hire car and the driver gets in free with hire agreement and driver's licence. Shows were very good and all the other attractions there were good. The restaurant was good but limited selection of hot food. Easy to find and free car",

          "The park itself is very small yet has the audacity to boast as Europe's best! The admission for this tiny place is ridiculous considering it's size. The dolphin and sea lion show was actually really good and quite well choreographed. So much so, that you can't help but feel",
          "We booked tickets from reps at hotel, were told where to stand for free bus outside / opposite aquasol. The bus stop is not that obvious as it is not a normal bus stop which is 25 metres up the road but labelled as a meeting place. We arrived at bus stop at 11 for 11:15 pick up",

          "The dolphin show was great. The rest of the park you see in 20 minutes. Food is outrageously expensive. 3.80 for a bottle of water. The enclosures are too small and there are turtles literally climbing over each other. In tiny areas. Not even slightly worth the money.",
          "Had a great day with the 4 year old daughter. The park is quite small as others have said but the shows where brilliant. Animals seem well taken care of which is nice to see. As to be expected with these type of parks costs are high but nothing at of the realms if others weve",

          "We found this a very expensive day out for the size of the place. It was \u20ac26 per person and you could probably walk round it in half an hour. The shows are quite good though, but we left and went back for the dolphin show as big gaps in show times and wouldn\u2019t really have",
          "I honestly don\u2019t know where to start, dolphins enclosures are tiny- you can watch them during the show and then you are asked to leave ASAP I guess so we don\u2019t ask too many questions about the quality of their existence... we saw 5 dolphins but there is 7 of them on the",
          "we visited here on a day trip while.on a family holiday with 3 kids age 2 6 and 9 the price is brill to get in there are so many animals to see the kids loved it the sea lion and dolphin show was amazing really.magical a must see there is also a little paddling pool with a few",
          "Marineland dolphin / seals shows are really good . It does worth the visit although for the price we find it very expensive for a half a day entertainment . The other animal areas are really not attractive and most of the complex is the restaurant . We visited the whole",
          "While on holiday withh the family we decided to stop at marineland, Amazing place to vist lots of animals, We watched the Dolphin Show and the seal show what amazing shows they were the ability of the animals and the trainers and shows how close the trainers and the animals are",
          "Not to be missed fabulous and entertaining Sealions and Dolphins show for the family, adult or children alike. The parrot show is educational and fun to watch. What the attraction may not have in size is more than compensated by the shows which are fun and highly",
          "We recently visited Marineland, Majorca thinking that it would be a well looked after aquarium but we were shocked when we saw how the animals were being treated. I saw a number of distressed animals in the park. 1) There was a very small enclosure for penguins. Two of these",
          "Great family day out fantastic shows the food is a little expensive. The photo opportunities with the dolphins is a most",
          "Can not fault the park, clean with friendly staff. The shows were good and we enjoyed them very much. The park is quiet small and on our visit we were there for about 2 hours and had seen everything. (Except for the parrot show) The price is just a bit too high for want",
          "We enjoyed our trip to Marineland but it is small for the admission price, you cannot spend all day here. The shows however were worth the money, as they were entertaining & fun. The location is stunning, beside the Pontals Nous marina, with fantastic views of Palms Nova across",
          "The size of the park is very small and can be walked round and view in approximately half an hour so for the price it\u2019s not very good. However, the live shows are very entertaining and really pick up the atmosphere, the dolphins and sea lions are exceptionally good. The parrot",
          "Great shows. Overall a bit small campus for the price but the sea lion and the dolphin show was good. If you have seen this kind of show already then it may not be so great but for those who haven't seen such a show this could be great day out. Online tickets are cheaper. And",
          "I went to Marine Land when I want to Palma Nova back in June and personally we didn\u2019t think it was worth the money. I don\u2019t know how families afford it. The food and drinks inside were so expensive and there wasn\u2019t many animals at all. The dolphin show was good and the only",
          "Marine land on Mallorca is a great little attraction for the family. Make sure to time your visit for the dolphin and sea lion shows ! It\u2019s quite a small park and it only takes about 45 minutes to see everything in it. The shows last about 45 minutes and are very entertaining !",
          "Definitely over priced for the size of the place. Realistically you could go through the full park including the shows in 1 hour flat. They had small monkeys kept indoors in small enclosures where really they should kept outside in a larger enclosure, they looked quite",
          "Too expensive for the size of the park and the amount of animals in it. A lot of the animals you couldn't see unless you paid money or seen the 2 feeding times through out the day. Fish in the koi pond had gammy eyes and the parrots in the show were losing their feathers. The",
          "This is a lovely place especially for little ones and animal lovers we bought our tickets online before we went for a great price and were said for the whole season so could choose when to go. The dolphin, sea lion and parrot shows are great and the highlight of the day. there",
          "We visited here the weekend before Halloween and it was really enjoyable. The park is quite small and doesn't take a long time to visit, and the prices of food etc is quite pricy if you are bringing the family. That being said, the dolphin and sealion shows were amazing, and the",
          "We went here by accident as it happens as our first location was closed. It was well worth the visit, the kids loved the parrot and dolphin shows as well as looking at all the other animals.",
          "Definitely a lovely programm with kids.Our kids they really enjoyed the sea lion and dolphin shows.They are amazing animals and also the staff is really nice. They have also parrot shows, small pool area for kids. From the seats of the dolphin shows you can get an amazing view.",
          "Came here last minute and couldn't have been happier. Absolutely amazing place to spend a few hours. All the enclosures were great and all the animals seemed really happy and looked after well. Not everything is stuck behind barriers and cages either! There's a bird enclosure",
          "Second time here and it was still entertaining, there is quite a lot to see with a Sea lion show, a dolphin show, a parrot show plus an aviary and a small aquarium plus small enclosures with Penguins, Flamingos etc. You do get a free bus but the times between pickups I felt were",
          "If you are in Palma region with young kids this place is a great option. Decent assortment of animals with a really good parrot walked through and the dolphins are amazing. My 3 year old too small for dolphin experience but we did get a photo with dolphin, it\u2019s \u20ac20 extra but",
          "Firstly, don't bother with the free bus. We we're told it set off from peguera at 09.20am however it actually set of at 10.20 luckily and oddly! The driver arrived at 09.30 to tell us this. It the took over an hour with all the other stops to get there for a 15 minute journey",
          "We visited marineland today with our 2 children aged 2&1, this was made to sound as if you needed a full day to visit but it is only going to waste half of a day. The show's were spectacular (parrot, sea lion & dolphin) other than that it is not worth the money. Our children",
          "An o.k place to visit. The plus points are its not far from Magaluf, the shuttle transfer is free from the resort and the sea lion, dolphin and parrot shows are great and worth seeing. The negatives are that its not very big and can't see how families can spend a whole day",
          "We went here this week it was good, dolphin show was fab, sealion show and parrot show both very good, not much else there, free bus was a faff to get there but straight forward to get back, our 1&3 year old were abit young for the shows but we still enjoyed it i prob wouldnt",
          "Visited here with my partner and 2 young children 5 and 3 and had an amazing few hours the place itself is not very big but if you wanted to you could stay all day... Loads of animals to look at and the view from the restaurant over palma bay is amazing. The dolphin show was",
          "Very good place friendly staff. Not so big only takes up half a day restaurant really expensive. Also shame can also only have 1 person per picture with the dolphin so family of 4. 80 euro was really disappointing we couldn't get a family photo with the dolphins.",
          "We visited the park with a 15 week old baby (very accessible for pushchairs and wheelchairs) and a 7 year old. We travelled from the other side of the island in Cala Bona, and as nice as the park was, I didn\u2019t feel it was worth the 75 minute drive there and 75 minute journey",
          "Marnie land was a brilliant half day visit only. We really wish we had of done the option at being here for half day and gone into Palma with the rep for the rest of the day! Booked this trip with our jet2 rep in the hotel and it cost us \u20ac85 and then \u20ac3 for drinks then \u20ac30 for 2",
          "This place is ok if u want to kill a couple of hours nothing awefull (except the price of food) nothing great",
          "This is a fun day out for families especially if you have young children. The park isn\u2019t massive so don\u2019t have to worry so much about them walking all day. The parrot show, sea lion show and dolphin show were great fun and my 2 year old was amazed. There is also lots of other",
          "We all thoroughly enjoyed Marineland, I would recommend this day out to anyone the Dolphin show was fantastic. My little boy enjoyed every second he was of this park. We had dinner at a bar outside the park as very the park is Very expensive, but we returned after dinner to",
          "Was on holiday in mallorca and thought to check out marineland, what a boring place to come if your on holiday, hardly any animals to see! Direct access to a private beach was advertised yet the gate to the beach was locked so couldn't even enjoy that, managed to watch a parrot",
          "Had a great time the weather was hot looked around the whole place but my highlights were the dolphin show and the sea lion show. My daughter got to touch a dolphin. I don\u2019t agree dolphins being in captivity they should stop catching them to train. They belong in the sea. That",
          "Have to say this is smallest park been in a long time. Got here around 1130 and seen evening by 1. Mind you the dolphin show is superb but at the 50e for 2 adults not value for money",
          "The animals are not kept in good conditions. The dolphin tank is tiny! Can\u2019t believe these places are still allowed to operate in this day and age.",
          "We visited here while on our family holiday. It was a good day and can\u2019t rate the dolphin show enough. The only thing was it wasn\u2019t somewhere u could spend the day. We ended up getting a taxi to leave earlier than our pick up as we had done everything on offer and also the",
          "First time visiting and will deffo go again loved everything there especially the dolphins! See you again next year! :)",
          "I have visited marine land 4 times now I just love the dolphin show, this year my 1 year old watched and enjoyed it also. There are many other things to look at such as the reptiles, aquarium, parrots, penguins, flamingos and you can bottle feed the fish. When you walk in you",
          "I visited with my partner and although we spent a fair bit of time with each attraction we completed the whole park very quickly. The shows were fantastic, the parrot show seems babyish at first glance but is actually very entertaining. The Sea lions and Dolphins were of",
          "As a family of 4 we visited here today it toom and hour from can picafort which was to ve expected. On entering my son got to hold a parrot so thumbs up at that point. Marine land its self is extremely small' you will get 3 hours fun including shows. The dolphin show is worth",
          "So apart from being able to walk around the park in 10 minutes. YES TEN minutes!!!! The prices for entry and food are absolutely disgusting. We ended up paying just shy of \u20ac100 to get into the park and after watching the dolphin show (which was 15 mins long) we went for",
          "I visited the park today with my sister all I can say is WOW! Most amazing shows, beautiful animals and Amazing interactive moments. The thing that really makes me smile is you can see how much the trainers love the animals and how well they look after them. The animals look",
          "We took our children here while on holiday, the whole family had a fabulous day. The dolphin show is definitely worth a watch & there's loads of other animals to see.",
          "Small not a full day 50 terrapins in a little pond biting each other\u2019s heads cause crowed! Bird Avery tiny no enrichment like a bird cave! Dolphins and sea lions share pool at different times don\u2019t have one each. Zoo not in a nice place in middle of flat type Buildings! We lost",
          "The only downside of this otherwise amazing park is that the star show is just the Dolphins, and the Bird's show is short and unsurprising. There is a gigantic yellow snake -I'd guess 20 ft long and at least one foot wide, to watch and other nice creatures as well. A good way to",
          "Been coming to marineland since I was small and now took my 2 year old for his first visit. It didn\u2019t disappoint and great fun for all ages. If you hire a car and come to the park just show your rental agreement and one adult is free entry and the wee on was free too. Lots to do",
          "\u20ac25 per abult well worth it we had a wonderful day the animals seemed happy enough. The must to be seen would definitely the sealion and dolphin show. There is a lovely restaurant there can be little expensive but it's a day out go for it the restaurant is over looking the sea",
          "Whilst the place is nicely set out it feels like it is only about making money from the visitors. Despite paying \u20ac100 euros (on top of the \u20ac25 park entry) for my daughter to get in the water with the dolphins you are not allowed to take any photographs, they tried to say it\u2019s",
          "Well on holiday in Palma Nova my Daughter,Granddaughter and Great grandson who was 6 had a day at Marineland...They had a brilliant day...My Granddaughter and Daughter both work in schools 1 being a Primarily Teacher and the other a T.A they found the animal shows were very",
          "We came to here on a coach trip from S'illot and saw lovely dolphin performances and sea lions shows which my children loved. Also there is flamingos, an aviary,an aquarium, reptiles, rays, penguin a and experiences to meet and have a picture with dolphins and the sea lions.",
          "We went here with my for year old and she loved it! She ran round everywhere not knowing what to see first. The dolphin and seal lion show was amazing. The parrot show was funny and cute, the male handler seemed to really love and have a connection with the birds. The",
          "We saw all animals and shows during one day. See shows with parrots and dolphins were the best. Nice place for relax during hot wheather for everybody. Being with dolphins and feeling their touch is amazing and unbelievable.",
          "We visited marineland Majorca whilst on holiday in Palmanova. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip here, we spent about 4 hours there as it\u2019s not huge but it was good value for money and the highlight of the trip was the dolphin and sealion show! My boyfriend and I agreed it was one",
          "This place is only very small and you could easy see everything in a few hours but the best thing is the Dolphin experience that they offer. If your child is is over 130cm then they can go in the water with the dolphin trainers for an unbeatable experience. My children got to",
          "Spent two weeks in Santa Ponsa and decided to take a day to visit Marineland. There's a free bus which picked us (two adults, two children, 6 & 2) from near our hotel. It obviously then picks up other guests from other hotels en route but it didn't take too long (allow extra",
          "This is a great place to go if you\u2019ve got kids! The dolphin and sea lion show is mesmerising, even the parrots do good tricks! You won\u2019t fill a whole day being here but definitely a morning. We got our tickets online whilst on holiday and got 30% off so got a family of 3 for",
          "Absolutely fantastic day . The main show is the dolphin and sea lion shows . Well worth the money just for that . Plus you can drag the day out we stayed there for 6 hours and really enjoyed it. If you want aqua land or western water park on your holiday go here first as you can",
          "Visited Marineland yesterday. Although I think the attaction is very overpriced, all the shows are really brilliant. Doplhin show is top-notch. The place itself is pretty compact and I struggled to get through with the pushchair simply because it was quite busy and some people",
          "Very small, over priced. \u20ac60 for two adults and a five year old. We were here for less than two hours.The dolphin show was really good other than that we weren\u2019t very impressed at all. Wouldn\u2019t recommend it.",
          "As other people have stated the trip doesn't last very long and the place is quite small. There were two buses departing at 10.45 and 12.50 from our hotel in palmanova so after reading the reviews we decided to go on the later bus. Didn't take long to walk round and lunch for 3",
          "We visited here while in Magaluf ... Best place we been too in awhile. What an amazing dolphin show, sea lion and seal show and the parrots... all I can say is wow!!! Reasonably priced to get in for a family of 4 ... but the drinks was very expensive .... 4 slushies and 2 mars",
          "I visited here with my partner and his dad and 3 kids I thought the dolphins and seals where amazing to see and the other animals the only down side is there was only a few things to see but I would highly recommend and the kids splash zone was very good!",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed marine land. Have been before a few years ago but show was different. Did the dolphin experience with my 2 daughters and it was so magical and an experience we will never forget. Pink flamingos, parrots, penguins and not forgetting the turtle. My only",
          "took grandchildren what a great day they all had especially the sea-lion and dolphin show then the parrot show they enjoyed the children's play area and the other animals the venue was clean and tidy with plenty of staff to assist if required",
          "The place is tiny and apart from the shows it\u2019s terrible. Even the sea lion and dolphin shows last 40 minutes. It is not a day out so be careful when you book an excursion. Photos are a rip off at \u20ac20",
          "Marineland is quite small and we had done everything including the shows in 2.5 hours despite paying 56 euros to get in! The Dolphin and sea lion shows were very good though and my little boy thoroughly enjoyed them. All in all not a bad day, just very expensive for what it",
          "We visited the Marineland on our last day in Mallorca and it turned out to be our best. The shows were amazing! The sea lions and the dolphin shows left us all speechless. Very entertaining. It was quite expensive to enter but those 2 shows made it all worth it. We couldn\u2019t",
          "It was our first water show for us. We really enjoyed it. The dolphin, the sea dog and the parrot show was really fantastic. If you will go to the Marineland, you need to see these shows. You can buy drink in a dolphin bottle during the shows, it was expensive and not so good,",
          "We visited marineland via no frills excursion! The animals were amazing! My daughter and niece absolutely loved the dolphin and sea lion show and the bird show! I was surprised at how close we got to the animals in the U.k. I think we are somehow used to everything being out of",
          "The park was beautiful, very clean and animals looked very well cared for. The dolphin show was definitely the highlight although there wasn\u2019t much more to fill more than a couple of hours. The parrot show was too full on both occasions due to limited seating. Worth a visit but",
          "We booked online directly with marine land it was probably about half the price of what the trip companies wanted. The animals are very well looked after and the shows were amazing! The only down side was the park isn\u2019t very big and you could very quickly look at everything so",
          "We booked to visit here, my god what a day out the best expirience i ever had watching the seal and dolphin show in my life never have i seen such affection with sea life with humans 100%",
          "We watched all 3 shows which were good the dolphin show was amazing which is what we really wanted to see anyway, whilst watching the show my 7 year old wanted a slush which was 7 euros rediculusly overpriced and not even frozen! When we went in the cafeteria for lunch there",
          "We got the free bus at around 10:00 and arrived at Marineland at around 10:30. When we got off the free bus, the man said we had to be back by 16:00, however we had seen everything there was to offer around 13:00, so we got a public bus back to Santa Pon\u00e7a, which cost around",
          "I visited Marineland with my mother as she really wanted to see the dolphins. I'm always so torn about these type of places, but tried to go with an open mind. It was my mothers birthday so I wanted to do the meet the dolphins experience but this ended up being 100 euros",
          "Perfect for smaller children , our family has children of 18,16 and 14. We stayed at marine land from 9:30am till 1pm . It is a small park and you can soon get round it all in a morning. It\u2019s just your typical aquarium, sea life style place. Dolphin and sea lion shows were very",
          "Another Abusement Park for these poor Animals!!! The dolphin pool is tiny!! It\u2019s a disgrace that these parks are still open!!!",
          "What a rip off! My partner and I went today as I wanted to see dolphins (I really wanted to see dolphins in their natural environment but the trip was fully booked, as the logo for the park clearly shows pictures of dolphins we settled for a visit to the park instead). We got",
          "What a fantastic dolphin and seal show the trainers have such a great bond with them it was heartwarming to watch the bond they have with the trainer. All the animals looked in good condition and looked after and the park was very clean. There is a cafe and a picnic area and",
          "Visited a few days ago and it was a great day had by myself, partner and two children aged 10 & 12. The park itself is a little small and we went round majority of it within a couple of hours. We had to cram everything in little time though because we were being collected by",
          "Nice day away from the pool side, with the parrot, sea lion and dolphin shows being the main attractions. Day excursion that took an hour on a coach both ways, and then being in the park for 5.5 hours before being picked up. Too long a day, easily visited all of the shows and",
          "We went there on the 5th of July with no frills. There was 4 adults and 3 kids. We love it here it's a nice relaxing day. We like taking our time and looking around. We went straight in to the parrot show. We had brought sandwiches with us so we sat and eat them while we were",
          "Sea lion and dolphin shows were very good and very well done by the trainers but the park as an overall is average If you are planning on going here make sure you have a back up plan as it only takes 1 - 2 hours to see the whole park including shows If you arrive here by",
          "We loved marineland. Our boys were very excited to see the dolphins and other marinelife but were equally impressed with the two large \"children's paradise\" splash sections. There are some very big, fast slides for families with teenagers or just thrill seekers with no children",
          "We spent the day at marineland today, it's not a massive place but we got their at 10:30 and left at 16:00 and we had plenty to see and do looking around the site, the sea lion and dolphin show is excellent and the parrot show is fun, though it was abit of a squeeze as place",
          "You pay to get into the park \u20ac25 adult \u20ac15 kids but shop around once in you get handed a parrot they take your photo costs \u20ac10 then asked do you want your photo with sea lion (family photo)\u20ac14 and do you want photo with dolphins (one person) \u20ac30+ then do you want to spend 30mins",
          "Had a great time here!! A bit expensive to get in but you can get money off vouchers from McDonald\u2019s. Lots to see and plenty of shows to watch on regular intervals. Food and drink a bit expensive but to be expected in places like this. A really good children\u2019s activity pool",
          "First went to marine land 30 years ago. It has not changed much. The sea lions and dolphins are a must to see. The parrots are still doing the same routine, I guess they are limited in what they can do! Drinks and ices are as expensive as you would spect at a tourist attraction.",
          "We had a great time here, seeing all the animals and the shows are just fantastic. The staff are very friendly and the animal trainers are really fun and along with the animals made the show really funny and impressive.",
          "We had a fantastic day out. It is a quite small place but the dolphins and seals show are amazing. Has a cafe-restaurant right on the beach front with fab views if you have small children they will enjoy the little pool area with some water slides.",
          "Marineland is very small, we arrived when the parrot show was on so we thought oh it\u2019s not too busy then the parrot show finished and it felt like we were been swamped. It is really small and people start queuing for the dolphin show way before 12 it was around 1115am the doors",
          "It is quite small and there isn\u2019t much to see besides the dolphins and parrots show. The other exhibitions are pretty ugly. Very expensive for what it offers",
          "Our 2nd time visiting Marineland (the 1st being 8 years ago)! We travelled from Alcudia through an excursion we booked!The park itself isnt very big, it has parrots, seals, sealions, penguins, stingrays, carp, turtles and of course dolphins! We had our picture taken on the way",
          "Marineland Majorca has a lot of advertising around the island - so we went along for a looksee whilst on holiday there. The two shows, being the sea-lions and dolphins, are very entertaining and professional. The rest of the animal enclosures at the venue are small and a little",
          "Had a fab time here especially the dolphins and sea-lions show fantastic. Well worth visiting. Food and drinks are expensive as per normal with these places but didn\u2019t mind as money goes back in to the park. Splash park there great for little ones but it is salt water. Would",
          "Excellent. Dolphin show was amazing and reasonably priced and only a short taxi ride from Palma nova ( 5 euros ).",
          "We wanna to see the dolphins show, so please keep in mind that is just 2 times at day(better to Chek the time scheduled for the show). The parrot show is nothing special, maybe just for the kids can be funny. We needed to wait for the dolphin show 3 hours so we went to the",
          "Kids realy enjoyed it here, lovely place and the dolphin show was absolutely amazing! Only downside is the expense of things and it's quite a small park. But other than that amazing place! Kids loved it.",
          "Over priced & very small venue so don\u2019t expect a full day out. Very busy during our trip & only 1 shop open to buy drinks etc. Take snacks & drinks .Animals in very small enclosures & generally a bit sad. Really not worth the entry fee & felt desperately sorry for the animals.",
          "The best thing about this place is the dolphin show!..it was breath taking! The parrot show and sea lion show are also good!.. we paid to have our photos taken with the dolphins and the sea lion with I thought was reasonably priced.. the food on the other hand is ridiculously",
          "I\u2019ll start with the few positives, the dolphins were spectacular, lovely show and really well done... all 20 minutes of them. And the parrots were super clever and well worth a watch. That aside it was a bit of a joke from start to finish. When I booked online, in advance, to be",
          "Free bus is advertised online, however the ticket seller opposite Koppas Music Club where the bus stopped told the driver to not let anyone on the bus who didn't purchase tickets at his shop. The bus then departed without us and many others, not the best start to a very average",
          "We were rather disappointed with how small marine land was. You could walk through the aquarium in under 5 minutes, same with the aviary. The splash park is only suitable for very small children, under 5, and again is compact. Most of the food stalls were closed and we were",
          "We had an enjoyable visit to Marineland today. We only stayed a few hours but in this time we enjoyed what the park had to offer. The dolphin sealion and parrot shows were fantastic and these alone were worth the entry money. It was lovely to see what a good relationship that",
          "We visited Marineland just last week with our 3yr old daughter. It cost \u20ac50 for entry to the park as we had a \u2018child free pass\u2019. The Parrot show followed by the sea lion and dolphin show were great but once these 15 min shows were over you could pretty much see everything else",

          "We paid \u20ac163 entrance alone, we were assured we needed the plus entry to get a good place to see the dolphins, this wasn't true at all. The plus also entitled us to a photo with a parrot. Besides the shows, which are 10/15 mins each, we only really needed another 20 mins in the",

          "Lovely place fantastic shows but half a day is more than enough. Once you've had a nice walk around, seen the sea lions the pirate show and the Dolphin Show, also all the other animals. There's not a lot more to see or do. We booked this with Thomas Cook and it was an all day",
          "Me and my partner went here for a day out. As we arrived it was quite a lot smaller than we originally thought. It didn't take the expected 6 hours to complete the whole attraction. The sea lion, dolphin show was great but the parrot show was a little boring. ALOT of spanish",
          "We visited with two children aged 3&7. Highlights are the parrot, sea lion and dolphin shows, these are all brilliant. There are plenty of other animals to see too, and a small splash pool for kids to play in. However, the park is quite small and a day here is too long. We were",
          "We went for the day and I am so glad that we did. It was amazing here. The dolphin show in particular was a firm favourite. You get the chance to have your photo with a dolphin for 20 euros which is good but my kids had a half hour experience with a dolphin where they learned to",
          "This was a wonderful experience the sea lion shows and dolphin shows were incredible. There is a private beach where you can relax. However food was a little expensive but delicious.",
          "Good place to visit, overall there isn\u2019t that much for a full day unless you take it slow but the shows they put on through the day are great (parrot, sea lion and dolphin). The dolphins are the main attraction and they are fantastic.",
          "The shows are absolutely brilliant, very family friendly and good value for money! My daughter had all the photo done and would've stayed all day long if allowed. We travelled by bus from alcudia and it didn't disappoint!",

          "We came to Marineland with our son and his 3 children. We all had a lovely day especially enjoyed the shows and the kids loved getting up close and personal having a photo taken with a dolphin. Always fun and educational added bonus of fun pool for the kids. Beautiful sandy",
          "Went for a visit the dolphins and sea lions show is the only thing worth seeing was amazing. Place is tiny and was very confusing as to where to go for tickets for having pictures done with animals . Wouldn't of been worth it if it wasn't for the dolphin show",
          "Went with my boyfriend for a day trip and we were shocked by how tiny the place is - The free buses give you 6 hours in the park but we had seen everything in under 2. The dolphin and sea lion show was honestly spectacular, the tricks the dolphins do were insane and definitely",
          "Kids really enjoyed the shows. Get there early for the parrot show to make sure you get in. Dolphin and sea lions were the highlight. I would rate ahead of sea world. Good splash pool area for the kids too with slides, along with a nice quiet beach. Per some other reviews,",
          "The tickets to the place are on the steep side and it's definitely worth it to look up the internet deals on their website. We had a luck and bought online family + 1 package for \u20ac49 and saved approx. \u20ac12. However, after watching the show we felt that the price was justified.",
          "Nice dolphin and sea lion show as well as parrot show. Could also have a look on some parrot (and some other birds) species in a walk-in cage. My daughter (6 years old) had a dolphin encounter ordered. Glad I've read lots of info about this service before coming to be aware of",

          "This place was a nice place to visit. We where a group of 8 and everyone had a good time. The parrot show, sea lion and dolphin show is the best part. Though you must keep track yourself so u dont miss it. Shows are recommended for all ages. It is that fun. The parret show was a",
          "Lovely place, not very big but we enjoyed a few hours exploring and chilling with a cold drink admiring the view. Pretty costly inside for drinks/food/slushies etc but I guess you expect that at these places. Immaculately clean and animals well cared for. Dolphin show is",
          "Great day out,not a massive centre but so much to do the animals so well looked after and so many beautiful photo opportunities the food options also beautiful and private beach adds a lovely touch we as a family had a truly memorable experience",
          "Love love love Marineland! We return every single year and the dolphin show still puts a smile on my face! It is a fantastic park. It is not massive; half a day is loads but you can also visit the beach which would be great to cool down on hot days! The aviary is another",
          "Visited Marineland with my Partner and two of my children.Such an amazing place!!It's not huge which is quite nice really.The shows are totally amazing.I love the bond between the trainers and the Dolphins and Sealions.Its a beautiful thing to watch.My Daughter and myself were",
          "In marineland ther is excellent dolphin show. I have never saw something like that. Also sea lion ahow is very good. On other side if you are expecting to see large numer of animals like in Zoo or aquarium you will be dispointed- like me.",
          "We went as part of an excursion from our resort. Price was reasonable compared with other venues. The main attraction is the dolphin and sea lion show (same place same time), this is the main thing to sea so get seats. The trainers are very good The rest of resort doesn't take",
          "We arrived just in time to see the parrot show. Then we got to se the sea lion show and the dolphin show. The dolphin show was absolutely the best entertainment this day. We really enjoyed it! The park also has a small aquarium and a mini reptile zoo. Marineland is absolute",
          "Good price for a family at \u20ac64 and we paid an extra \u20ac20 each for photos with the dolphins. Live dolphin and sea lion shows we're very good but get there early - the shows are in the same place so ignore the misleading advertised times that you can only watch one AM and one PM.",

          "We had booked a trip to marineland with a local excursion centre. Bus journey took 1hr from Playa de Palma. Upon arrival all excited we are offered a photo with a dolphin for \u20ac20. I paid this for myself and my 5 year old daughter. The place was so small we lapped it twice in",
          "We found this place before we left for holiday and visited on our first day. It is quite small and doesn't take very long to walk round but is well worth it! The view across the sea from the sea lion part was fabulous. The best part is the sea lion and dolphin show. Having",
          "Visited here as a family of 4, cost \u00a354. The shows were amazing, especially the dolphins my children loved them. Feeding the fish with baby bottles filled with food was so good too. Didn't have any hot food available when we went ( at 4.30pm) but we did have ham and cheese",
          "This isn't a place where you will spend all day, so there is no rush to get there when it opens. It's a lovely place, and the shows are what make it. The zookeepers are very good and loving towards the animals. Nice place.",
          "A really good set up. We got our tickets online and saved 30% so paid about \u20ac40 for 2x adults and 2 children 1x4 year old and 1x18month old. We also paid \u20ac28 to have photos taken with the dolphin and sealion which was an experience. We loved the parrot show was very funny.",
          "Spent the day with kids here, we all loved the dolphin and sea lion shows along with the parrot show. Food prices in out of the outlets is pricey ( near to the kiddie pool ) but otherwise a really good day",
          "Whilst on hols in Cala Millor, we booked tickets to visit Marineland. It was an hour away from our hotel but sounded like a nice day out. We arrived about 11.30am and joined the queue even though I had purchased tickets online before hand. On arriving, they encourage you to have",
          "My wife and I visited Marineland whilst on honeymoon in Mallorca and whilst we walked around the park about 3 times in half an hour were beginning to wonder what we'd paid for. We missed the parrot show but managed to watch the seal and dolphin shows and were blown away by them,",
          "We came here on our last day of our family holoday in mallorca. We had to vacate our accommodation early and had a late flight so took the opportunity to visit as it was much closer to the airport than our resort. We have 3 children 8, 5 and 3 who each thoroughly enjoyed the",
          "Very small park and not worth the travel from the other side of the Island. We also booked through tui who gave you 5 hours in the park. You can litteraly walk around the park and do all the shows in adound 2 hours. Not worth the money.",
          "Took our young child here and it was very enjoyable. I purchased the tickets on the internet the same day although if you read the purchase policy, it should be the following day. Luckily, this was not an issue. We enjoyed the sea lion and dolphin show very much and while it",
          "We visited the with our 2 children and had a nice day out. My son 9 had a great day and loved the shows. My daughter was too young to appreciate it really at 11 months but she did enjoy looking at the animals. The shows are very good and worth seeing. Some people have an issue",
          "Great dolphin and Parrot show. The zoo they put it is small so an average time there is 2 hours. Most of the shows are over with by 1pm there is nothing then until 4.15 when there is another dolphin show. There is not much to do there there. There is however a small water play",
          "Not very easy to find things to do besides bathing when traveling with two very different boys at 12 and 14 years. We decided to try the Marineland outside Palma. The visit was a success! The park was not big, but boys at this age don't require a big park to walk in the whole",
          "Mainly interesting are the sea lion and dolphin shows. If you have the chance, I recommend you to see them. They are worth it! Minus of this space is the bar area: everything (in my opinion) is expensive...",
          "\u20ac25 entry and you can literally walk around the \"park\" in 30 mins. The shows were fine but as people have said the food and drinks are extortionate and this is not helped with marineland staff standing inside the theatre where the show is with popcorn at \u20ac3 and dolphin bottles",
          "My husband and I took out 3 year old when on holiday. We had a great day out. The shows were really good. The little pool for children was a hit of the day.",
          "We were so disappointed by this place! We were all excited about our day trip, the cost us 200euros for a the family and I wish we hadn't of bothered. The place is tiny! The aquarium, if you can call it that is basically an alley way with a few little fish tanks, then one larger",
          "Do not visit Marineland Majorca. An absolute rip off. An extremely small park, probably the smallest I've ever seen, which I found extremely distressing when seeing the marine animals living in what I can only describe as a swimming pool. Dolphins and Sea Lions should not be",
          "Magical place. The children were thrilled with the sea lion and dolphin show. Truly amazing. Parrot show so good. Don't miss it.",
          "Great for kids, can get busy. Hint - go early as first show is at 11am - parrot show then straight to Seals & Dolphins at 12 noon. Local bus stop outside that runs approx every 20-30 min.",
          "Had the best time at Marineland! Been visiting Portals for 8 years and always wanted to go here, but only managed to visit this time thanks to my wonderful boyfriend. The Dolphin and Sea Lion shows are bloody fantastic! We couldn't stop clapping, smiling and gasping at the",
          "Ok so I will agree with a few comments on here - yes the actual physical square footage of the place is small however i didn't find the enclosures to small for the animals. In fact I would of said the living conditions of the animals is very good and the staff clearly care for",
          "Animals have very little living space and thats mostly made of just concrete. Some of the animals not feeling well, dead fish floating on aquarium apathetic birds etc. Also dolphins and sea lions live in a very limited pool area. Ordering a bier took 30 minutes. Friendly service",
          "If you are staying in Mallorca with kids you must visit the park. It is a nice, clean park with a beautiful show with sealions and dolphins and parrots. The staff at the park is really nice and helpfull. You can get photos with dolphins and sealions for a good price you can swim",
          "We booked this through the hotel \u20ac24 per adult \u20ac15 per child. Dolphin show was the best, it was worth going to see that alone. Splash area for younger children and access to the beach if you want to prolong your visit. Restaurant was a bit pricey but the food went down well.",
          "Visited as trip organised tour operator. A little too small for a whole day but they do have a private beach which we used to finish the day. Good selection of marinelife and birds. Family enjoyed how close you can get to animals. Good selection of shows parrot, seals and",
          "Although the park is quite small it is well worth a visit, the dolphin and sea lion shows were absolutely fantastic and we would definitely recommend a trip to marineland. The only downside is that the food and drinks were very expensive and it cost us \u20ac25 for 4 non alcoholic",
          "It's probably ok if you are staying near the resort. I wouldn't travel from the other side of the island, if I'd know how small the place was. Under 5s were getting too hot and crying. The organization with getting your photos taken with the dolphin and sea lion was poor. Sent",
          "We purchased tickets online and used the electronic tickets. We arrived the park in the morning and there was no que at the entrance. The park was small and therefore it was easy to keep an overview of the area and this was quite nice. It was not crovded at all, even for the",
          "Had a fab day with a 12 year old and a 3yr old something to do for all ages We also paid extra to see the dolphins close up it was amazing would definitely recommend",
          "Although the trip, entry, free bus and prices for photos were a good price, the size of the place let it down with not much to do with a lot of time to the earliest bus home. Food was very expensive too! But throughly enjoyed our time here and would visit again to do the dolphin",
          "Take a chance and make the visit and you will not be disappointed. It offers children a life time experience with the dolphins. We tried to do the visit in half a day but had spent the whole day there as there was so much to do, especially for children though adults will also",
          "We booked the excursion through Thomson and I think It was worth it there are quite a few attractions here and we watched all three shows. The first one we watched which I thought was the best one was the bird show, there was lots of different birds doing many different things",
          "My family visited (wife, two boys 6 & 2 and I) Marineland hoping for lots to see. The kids I must say loved it all and couldn't stop talking about it (which was the main point in going) The dolphins were amazing and the parrot show was good but apart from that, nothing else to",
          "We were unsure wether to visit marineland but so glad we did...our two young children loved it as did my husband and I. Of course the dolphins were the stars of the show but there was so much more. We spent the whole day there but we're able to leave with a stamp and 're enter",
          "This park is very small and seems quite expensive. However, witnessing the absolute joy and love that each trainer and dolphin especially, display for one another is incredible. The audience cannot fail to feel the love. It is captivating and engrossing. If you consider that",
          "Our hotel was the other side of the island to Marineland so we tied in a visit there with a visit to nearby Palma, and found that half a day at Marineland was plenty of time. As other reviewers have said, it\u2019s fairly small \u2013 the map probably makes it look bigger than it is \u2013",
          "Had a Fabulous day here. The sea lion and dolphin shows are in the same arena, one straight after the other. The pool used was good because you can actually see the sea lions/dolphins under water. I have seen a couple different types of these shows but the amount of time the",
          "Great place for a day out with the kids, the sea life shows where great the rides are ok but do have have height restrictions 4ft, the water parks for the little ones was great the only downfall is the price for the food and drink \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac . And if you go by bus book the 6pm",

          "I took my 4 year old daughter for a day trip, I had read a mixture of reviews on it but where I do agree it's smaller than you would think and doesn't take long to get around, for my 4year old it was probably just the right size. We loved the Dolphin show and Penguins were a",
          "Brilliant, we paid extra for the dolphin expierence and it was truly amazing, lovely time spent with all the animals across the park, highly recommend a visit x",
          "The whole place is a bit to small for the money. The dolphin and parrot shows are good, but the amount of room they have, in my opinion, is not enough. Same goes for the seals and sea lions.",
          "A must see attraction that will entertain children of all ages. Parking for Marineland is available but spaces can be few depending upon time of holiday season especially school holidays and there are nearby shops, bars and eateries that share the same free parking area. As",
          "We were in Marineland in 2013. Dolphin and Parrot show was really good back then. Now it's really really poor...Parrot show was annoying because they pushed too many people in, so we were sitting basically in each other's laps... The show was less than 10' long. Dolphin show",
          "Amazing day to look the lots of attraction with dolphins-parrots and more-have a small water park for kids+bar",
          "I really enjoyed the aquarium and the learning side of the whole park. Otherwise I was unimpressed to say the least. The food prices were, as you can expect, expensive in relation to the quality. The pool is too small for the amount of little kids plodding/sliding/falling",
          "We went for the dolphin and parrot show. They did not disappoint. Otherwise there is not so much to see. So check the time schedule for the shows on the web site so that you do not have to spend several hours waiting with your kids.",
          "This is the second time we have been here, and it has had a bit of a facelift since out last visit. The thing I like about this park is that it is not overly massive, the main attraction being the dolphins and sealion shows. Along with this they also has the parrot shows along",
          "If you want to experience a fun day out then head to marine land they encapsulate the commitment to looking after the animals as well as teaching them skills to amaze the audience. Between a sealion show a parrot show and of course the dolphin show the audience are entertained",
          "Eight of us went to the Dolphin, sea lion and parrot shows, they were very entertaining and the trainers were terrific. Great day out with family.",
          "We went to Marineland as the end journey of our vacation. We spent about half a day there, since its not the biggest of Places. You have the chance to take Pictures With Dolphins and Sealions, the price is a bit high (20 euro for just the Dolphins, and 28 euro for both). They",
          "We had a brilliant trip to Marineland. Parrot show, Sealion show, Dolphin Show, we bottle fed fish, saw excitable sting rays and walked round the aviary and reptile houses. Food was expensive, but the portions where large. We purchased 3 meals for the five of us and it was",
          "We visited Marineland as an excursion offered by our hotel. We were on holiday with our 16 month old son at the time who loves anything to do with animals. We were picked by from outside our hotel in the morning and taken to Marineland. We got there in time to have a quick look",
          "21 of us came here with children from 4 to 14years. The dolphin show was great and the sea lions. The splash area was very strong salt water but this stuff really stand the kids they had to get out and dry off. The beach is ok, sea was rocky and full of seaweed. I came here 10",
          "It isn't a massive place but there is enough to see for a couple hours. It definitely kept us entertained for the afternoon, although it is overpriced, especially the food and drink!! But this is just like most other parks. There were some good shows, parrot show and a sea",
          "I have been to much better parks in and for a trip which you can only drag out for a half a day it was expensive. the kids loved the dolphins and sea lions but the shows are very close tighter so you are rushing between them. If you had never been to one before then it",
          "We did not have big expectations, just stopped by, but we loved it. They have a very great sea lion & dolphin show, a cool aquarium and a parrot show. If you are in Palma with children don't miss it.",
          "Absolutely loved the sea lion show, dolphin show and parrot show. One of the sea lions decided not to play but still didn't spoil the day. The dolphins were absolutely fabulous and graceful. The parrot show was hilarious. The shows were ran fairly close together so you",
          "we visited as a group of 4 Adults and a toddler, it was very hot so some of the smaller children struggled. The show's facilities are all top quality and great entertainment, would happily recommend.",

          "We only got about 4hrs here, but it was ideal. The parrot, Sea Lion and Dolphin shows were great. Photos are expensive. We paid 30 euros for a photo with a dolphin (20) and a sealion (12). However the dolphin was only allowed to be one child and one adult which was a shame. The",

          "Marineland is a perfect place to spend time with your kids when you're a little too tired of sunbathing all day. It took 40minutes to reach it by a car. All information about the dolphins and sea lions can be found on the marineland's website. We paid 85\u20ac for tickets (2 adults,",
          "Really enjoyed our trip to Marineland! Yes it's small, you don't need to be there all day but you can eek it out a bit by having a play in the splash park and a relax on the beach. Dolphins were fab and it's well worth \u20ac28 euros for a photo. For that price you get to have a",

          "Visited with my partner on our holiday expecting to spend the whole day (entry 24\u20ac per person) but really you could get round the whole park in an hour if you took your time. The dolphin and sea lion shows were the highlight of the day, but when those are done after 20 minutes,",

          "We were looking forward to a day out in Marineland and initially disappointed our return coach was leaving at 4 pm. No need to have worried very little to do for the money. The parrot show lasted about 20 to 25 minutes. Then there was the sea lion and Dolphin show which were",

          "This was my 3rd time at marine land I love it! The dolphin and sea lion show is really good my favourite part but also I love going in to look at the snakes and stuff aswell and going in the Avery with the birds. It was raining this year so was quiet and we got better seats for",
          "Great little attraction, one of the best dolphin displays we have seen. We visited on a rainy day but because of the size of the site it didn't cause us any problems going fron one display to another",
          "This is our second visit to Marineland. Came last year and it was more or less the same thing. Dolphin show was slightly different this year. You can see the bond the trainers have with their dolphins, it shows in their performances. Dolphin experience was good. They give",
          "When we went to Marineland it's was a great day out. I was just wondering if they still do the swim with dolphins and how much it would be",
          "Wonderful day out. All animals were amazing. Dolphin show spectacular. Animals appeared well looked after. Very clean and tidy. This is our 3rd visit and it still amazes me. Food and drinks good.",
          "Recently visited Marineland with my family. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit, but would highlight that 3 hours is probably sufficient as apposed to an all day visit, as it is rather small inside. Once you have seen a couple of shows and seen the other exhibits there is not much else",
          "So not very big place, and not much going on. Dolphin experience 100euro for two which was good and nice people. No single photos you have to buy a pack ridicules wanted one picture of my daughter and it cost 35euro when the entrance pic was 10euro complete rip off!! The shows",
          "Have to say first of all the dolphin show and sea lions show are fantastic absolutely loved it but apart from that there is about another 20-30 minutes of stuff to do so around an hour and a half we spent in there wich worked out very expensive would I go again probably not but",

          "We took my 2 year old for his birthday and he had the best day. We saw all the shows and they were fantastic and after we'd seen the other animals he enjoyed a play in the children's pool. We were there for around 3 hours which was about the right amount of time, and then we",
          "I've not been here and would not. Cetaceans belong swimming wild and free in the oceans not stolen from families and made to do tricks for the entertainment of humans and to be fed. Please watch the cove!!!! You will change your mind. If you love dolphins, don't go here!!!",
          "Dolphin, Sea Lion and Parrot shows are good but cant say this was the best trip we booked and certainly wouldn't visit again. Not overly impressed with conditions that the monkeys were kept in but everything else was pretty good.",
          "A good few hours to spend looking at the wildlife and sea creatures All ages would find this interesting",

          "Marineland is an ideal place to go with loved ones, not only families but couples too, I went here with my partner for a day trip, there is lots to see and even an opportunity to swim with dolphins and get your photo taken with either a sea lion or dolphin also; really enjoyed",
          "Stayed for several hours and saw the parrot show, seal show and the dolphin show. Although I'm conflicted whether it was morally right they were all very enjoyable and the animals are well trained. The shows were the highlight as the exhibits are not the best I've seen but",
          "Let me start with the dolphin show omg it was amazing you could see the interaction between them and the trainers.. truly cared for each other. Highlight of the visit Now the negatives. The animals behind the glass looked so miserable and bored there honestly isn't alot to see",
          "Booked through the hotel Adults 24 Kids 15 93 in total Free bus included from lots of hotels in santa ponsa Palma nova etc check before booking You can book online cheaper and probably use free bus as driver doesn't check your tickets Bus pickup was 940 Returning at",

          "We had a brilliant time at Marineland. Even though the coach trip seemed long and tedious as we were the first pick up and last drop off which meant being on the coach two hours there & two hours back. However all of the different animals there to look at were fab. The Sea Lion",
          "Booked through jet2. Paid 42 euro each with travel from Alcudia. Expected a full day but there's only really enough for a couple of hours. The sea lions and dolphin show was truly excellent as was the parrot show. The rest seemed quite small. All though every was clean and",
          "We never planned on coming here but one activity we had planned didn\u2019t work out and was changed and we came here instead, not really worth the money very small and got everything done quick the shows are worth a watch and they have private beach access, come with a fair bit of",
          "Had a fantastic time, afew more things would of been abit better, but loved the shows. Food Abit expensive",
          "Well, it's hard to rate this place highly. The dolphins and sea lions, were fantastic, the shows they put on are great, it's the rest of the park that seems a bit, stuffed in. The aviary was pretty bad, the birds don't have enough space, and you can see a lot of them are",
          "The tickets cost us 24euros each for entry and travel (we stayed in Santa Ponsa and it was only 20 minutes on the coach) As you enter you have the chance to have a picture with a parrot and to buy the picture was 10euros. We had a walk around to see when all the shows where on,",
          "Had a good wee afternoon at marine land It is a relatively small place but its fun. Absolutely wonderful views across the med!! Cute wee animals Great dolphin show and a good parrot show. We missed the sea lion show but of recommend u try n see the dolphins its awesome,",

          "Have passed Marineland several times over the years and having no small children never went in. Had lunch at Moods beach club next door and decided to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised. Having been to SeaWorld in the US several times this is obviously on a much smaller",
          "perfect place to visit, dolphin show was absolutely fantastic and the parrot show was hilarious. Sea lion show was also very good. Definitely would recommend visiting here and paying the 20 euro for Dolphin photo 12 euro for sea lion or 30 euro for the both obviously you are in",
          "Really good marine park, although quite small. Good dolphin and sea lion show. Spent about 4 hours here. Small kids pool - suitable for under 8s. Access to a pretty beach, restaurant to sit and enjoy view of bay. Food available here or you could bring a picnic. Got a taxi from",

          "My family and I which consisted of 3 adults and two children aged 4 years and 6 years visited on a Monday in the hopes it would not be so busy. However, there were several local school outings who also decided a Monday would be best, it did not affect our enjoyment of the park.",
          "The sea lion and dolphin show was really good, well done, and very entertaining. Once that was over, we were longing for our coach to come and pick us up....there were a few (very few) other things to see, but not enough to occupy a half day let alone a full one. All in all it",
          "My children, 2, 4 and 6, loved this place! A real gem and very clean and well kept. The seal and dolphin shows are a must. If you can, I would take food and drink with you as it is very expensive to eat in the park. Pizzas and drinks for 5 cost us over 80 euros! !! There",
          "After waterparks are closed this time of year(April) based on reviews we decided to visit Marineland. It is a small place with few animals but the shows are very worth it. Both the dolphin and sea lions were very entertaining and the kids loved it. We went to the parrot show",
          "Worth a visit but not enough to keep you going all day and make sure you eat before you go as the food is mega expensive",
          "with a party of 11 6 adults and 5 children we came here as its what the children wanted to do as a day out. Our coach broke down on the way and a new one was quickly dispatched. The staff put the parrot show back half an hour so we didn't miss the show which was nice. After the",
          "Remember to take swimming clothes for the kids. The park is too tiny to spend the whole day. We missed the dolphin when we arrived, so had to wait until 16.00. The parrot show was all right. Kids liked it.",
          "Don't miss these shows as otherwise the marine zoo itself is tiny. The dolphins and the seals were crowd favourites.",
          "Was a fantastic family day out, kids really enjoyed having their pics taken with the parrots, dolphins and the sea lions, the parrot show was good, funny at times, the sea lion and dolphin show was great aswell.",
          "Excellent place all good the service good the decorations of the place are good and the food good I recommend arriving in advance the place is beautiful",
          "Horrendous! the parrots that are not seen by the visitors are kept in 4 cemented walls, no sun and no greenery many of the parrots do not have feathers! The smell that comes from these cages is intense!. This needs to be reported to the animal rights urgently!!",
          "Typical dolphin and sea lion show. It's by no means the best and will keep the kids entertained. However it's not a full day out which disappointed us. Once you've seen the shows there's not a lot to do. There's beautiful views of the sea however.",
          "A great day out for all the family we've been 3 times now and never tire of the shows great for kids..\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
          "This was our younger daughters 1st visit & our eldest daughters 6th visit we love coming back every year as we love the dolphin show. My eldest daughter did a dolphin encounter on our last visit which she had always wanted to do it was truly amazing no doubt we will be returning",

          "We visited 27th October had a brilliant day. Kids and I enjoyed the dolphins and they loved having their picture taken and meeting the dolphins. Which does come at a cost. You can also pay more and go in with the dolphins for 30mins which when the children are older would be",

          "Travelled here as a family with young children. It's a great day out. There are dolphin shows a parrot show and sea lion shows. All of which were performed brilliantly. Just only negative comment is it's quite expensive.",
          "Fantastic shows of the sea lions, dolphins and parrots! We all enjoyed these. Only downside was we didn't have long enough at the park, bus pick up was 10.15 but we didn't arrive till 11.15 the had to be back at the bus by 3pm. Maybe because of the time of year. Kids got 30",
          "we decided to take the kids 4 and 9 to see the animals and was they only thing we intended on doing but lovely day and helpfull staff we found the dolphin encounter the lady was very nice we was told later on would be better smaller group and it sure was we loved the time with",

          "Pre booked our visit & we were very impressed by the variety of animals. Lots to do & see and all in a lovely location. Downside was the price for food and drinks. Also we sat in the splash zone for the dolphin show & there was no splashing!! Overall a fab visit",
          "The place is really nice, there are fish,birds, sealions, dolphins, parrots ... so a lot to sea. It is located in Portals Nous and they have a restaurant with sea view really nice. The dolphins and sealions shows were amazing and my girls have enjoyed it. It is really worth",
          "This is a small park that offers a few sea life shoes each lasting 15 minutes there is lots of birds fish etc it is worth the visit and 3 hrs is more than enough time any longer and your board.They have a small self built beach otherwise there is nothing outside the park.",
          "For what they have its very good, the sea lion and dolphin show was very good, parrot show and a couple of other bits, all good but within 2 hours and that includes a coffee. Food is very nice as well. It's definitely worth seeing but I would urge you to consider where you are",

          "We visited here last week September and had a great day. You can pay at the gate it cost is 24 euros but you can purchase the tickets from the excursions shops in the resorts. We took the local bus down but you can get the excursion bus from various pick ups around the resorts",
          "We went in October and it was lovely and quiet. The dolphin and sealion show was amazing! Food by the waterpark cafe was \u20ac6.50 for a meal (without drinks), \u20ac12.50 for pizza. Only bad point is the same as most reviews, it's very small. Don't forget to pack swimwear for little",
          "We visited here as we had heard good reviews. We booked through a Thompson rep so got a bus included with our tickets. The bus journey was an hour and a bit away from where we were staying in Sa Coma, and being 5 months pregnant it didn't go down too well with me and my tummy",
          "Try to visit Marineland every time we are staying in Palma Nova. Easy access to all the animal exhibits and plenty places to just stop and take it all in, which is important for someone like myself with poor mobility. The aviary birds are stunning, and to be able to walk amongst",
          "Now as you may have already seen from the other reviews, this attraction is rather small (and a bit pricey) but don't let that put you off. At a price of entry of \u20ac23.00 it isn't exactly cheap but the shows definitely made up for it. My wife and I turned up at around 10:30 so it",

          "As a family of four but paying for 3 as we had an infant, we paid around 120 euros. The dolphin and Sea lion shows were brilliant but lasted maybe 20 minutes. After that there wasn't much more to look at so we spent time on the beach.",

          "We found Marineland to be quite small, but there was plenty to keep us busy - animals, shows, a kids pool and a beach. Without the beach I think you would struggle to fill the day, but it was well worth a visit. Food was typically a bit pricey. You can also get tickets for other",

          "The animal park itself is rather small, but very well taken care of. Clean. Would have given it a lower rating as there seemed to be very little to do, but then the dolphin show started. We were entertained. Our eldest daughter loved it. It was a little bit too loud for our",

        "wiki": "Joan Mir\u00f3 i Ferr\u00e0 ( mi-ROH, also US:  mee-ROH, Catalan: [\u0292u\u02c8am mi\u02c8\u027eo j f\u0259\u02c8ra]; 20 April 1893 \u2013 25 December 1983) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, and ceramicist born in Barcelona. A museum dedicated to his work, the Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, was established in his native city of Barcelona in 1975, and another, the Fundaci\u00f3 Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3, was established in his adoptive city of Palma de Mallorca in 1981.\nEarning international acclaim, his work has been interpreted as  Surrealism but with a personal style, sometimes also veering into Fauvism and Expressionism. He was notable for his interest in the unconscious or the subconscious mind, reflected in his re-creation of the childlike. His difficult to classify works also had a manifestation of Catalan pride. In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Mir\u00f3 expressed contempt for conventional painting methods as a way of supporting bourgeois society, and declared an \"assassination of painting\" in favour of upsetting the visual elements of established painting.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn into a family of a goldsmith and a watchmaker, Mir\u00f3 grew up in the Barri G\u00f2tic neighborhood of Barcelona. The Mir\u00f3 surname indicates possible Jewish roots (in terms of marrano or converso Iberian Jews who converted to Christianity). His father was Miquel Mir\u00f3 Adzerias and his mother was Dolors Ferr\u00e0. He began drawing classes at the age of seven at a private school at Carrer del Regomir 13, a medieval mansion. To the dismay of his father, he enrolled at the fine art academy at La Llotja in 1907. He studied at the Cercle Art\u00edstic de Sant Lluc and he had his first solo show in 1918 at the Galeries Dalmau, where his work was ridiculed and defaced. Inspired by Fauve and Cubist exhibitions in Barcelona and abroad, Mir\u00f3 was drawn towards the arts community that was gathering in Montparnasse and in 1920 moved to Paris, but continued to spend his summers in Catalonia.\n\n\n=== Career ===\n\nMir\u00f3 initially went to business school as well as art school. He began his working career as a clerk when he was a teenager, although he abandoned the business world completely for art after suffering a nervous breakdown. His early art, like that of the similarly influenced Fauves and Cubists, was inspired by Vincent van Gogh and Paul C\u00e9zanne. The resemblance of Mir\u00f3's work to that of the intermediate generation of the avant-garde has led scholars to dub this period his Catalan Fauvist period.A few years after Mir\u00f3's 1918 Barcelona solo exhibition, he settled in Paris where he finished a number of paintings that he had begun on his parents' summer home and farm in Mont-roig del Camp. One such painting, The Farm, showed a transition to a more individual style of painting and certain nationalistic qualities. Ernest Hemingway, who later purchased the piece, compared the artistic accomplishment to James Joyce's Ulysses and described it by saying, \"It has in it all that you feel about Spain when you are there and all that you feel when you are away and cannot go there. No one else has been able to paint these two very opposing things.\" Mir\u00f3 annually returned to Mont-roig and developed a symbolism and nationalism that would stick with him throughout his career. Two of Mir\u00f3's first works classified as Surrealist, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and The Tilled Field, employ the symbolic language that was to dominate the art of the next decade.Josep Dalmau arranged Mir\u00f3's first Parisian solo exhibition, at Galerie la Licorne in 1921.In 1924, Mir\u00f3 joined the Surrealist group. The already symbolic and poetic nature of Mir\u00f3's work, as well as the dualities and contradictions inherent to it, fit well within the context of dream-like automatism espoused by the group. Much of Mir\u00f3's work lost the cluttered chaotic lack of focus that had defined his work thus far, and he experimented with collage and the process of painting within his work so as to reject the framing that traditional painting provided. This antagonistic attitude towards painting manifested itself when Mir\u00f3 referred to his work in 1924 ambiguously as \"x\" in a letter to poet friend Michel Leiris. The paintings that came out of this period were eventually dubbed Mir\u00f3's dream paintings.\nMir\u00f3 did not completely abandon subject matter, though. Despite the Surrealist automatic techniques that he employed extensively in the 1920s, sketches show that his work was often the result of a methodical process. Mir\u00f3's work rarely dipped into non-objectivity, maintaining a symbolic, schematic language. This was perhaps most prominent in the repeated Head of a Catalan Peasant series of 1924 to 1925. In 1926, he collaborated with Max Ernst on designs for ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev. With Mir\u00f3's help, Ernst pioneered the technique of grattage, in which one trowels pigment onto a canvas then scrapes it away.Mir\u00f3 returned to a more representational form of painting with The Dutch Interiors of 1928. Crafted after works by Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh and Jan Steen seen as postcard reproductions, the paintings reveal the influence of a trip to Holland taken by the artist. These paintings share more in common with Tilled Field or Harlequin's Carnival than with the minimalistic dream paintings produced a few years earlier.\nMir\u00f3 married Pilar Juncosa in Palma (Majorca) on 12 October 1929. Their daughter, Mar\u00eda Dolores Mir\u00f3, was born on 17 July 1930. In 1931, Pierre Matisse opened an art gallery in New York City. The Pierre Matisse Gallery (which existed until Matisse's death in 1989) became an influential part of the Modern art movement in America. From the outset Matisse represented Joan Mir\u00f3 and introduced his work to the United States market by frequently exhibiting Mir\u00f3's work in New York.Until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Mir\u00f3 habitually returned to Spain in the summers. Once the war began, he was unable to return home. Unlike many of his surrealist contemporaries, Mir\u00f3 had previously preferred to stay away from explicitly political commentary in his work. Though a sense of (Catalan) nationalism pervaded his earliest surreal landscapes and Head of a Catalan Peasant, it was not until Spain's Republican government commissioned him to paint the mural The Reaper, for the Spanish Republican Pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exhibition, that Mir\u00f3's work took on a politically charged meaning.In 1939, with Germany's invasion of France looming, Mir\u00f3 relocated to Varengeville in Normandy, and on 20 May of the following year, as Germans invaded Paris, he narrowly fled to Spain (now controlled by Francisco Franco) for the duration of the Vichy Regime's rule. In Varengeville, Palma, and Mont-roig, between 1940 and 1941, Mir\u00f3 created the twenty-three gouache series Constellations. Revolving around celestial symbolism, Constellations earned the artist praise from Andr\u00e9 Breton, who seventeen years later wrote a series of poems, named after and inspired by Mir\u00f3's series. Features of this work revealed a shifting focus to the subjects of women, birds, and the moon, which would dominate his iconography for much of the rest of his career.\nShuzo Takiguchi published the first monograph on Mir\u00f3 in 1940. In 1948\u201349 Mir\u00f3  lived in Barcelona and made frequent visits to Paris to work on printing techniques at the Mourlot Studios and the Atelier Lacouri\u00e8re. He developed a close relationship with Fernand Mourlot and that resulted in the production of over one thousand different lithographic editions.\nIn 1959, Andr\u00e9 Breton asked Mir\u00f3 to represent Spain in The Homage to Surrealism exhibition alongside Enrique T\u00e1bara, Salvador Dal\u00ed, and Eugenio Granell. Mir\u00f3 created a series of sculptures and ceramics for the garden of the Maeght Foundation in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, which was completed in 1964.\nIn 1974, Mir\u00f3 created a tapestry for the World Trade Center in New York City together with the Catalan artist Josep Royo. He had initially refused to do a tapestry, then he learned the craft from Royo and the two artists produced several works together.  His World Trade Center Tapestry was displayed at the building and was one of the most expensive works of art lost during the September 11 attacks.In 1977, Mir\u00f3 and Royo finished a tapestry to be exhibited in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.In 1981, Mir\u00f3's The Sun, the Moon and One Star\u2014later renamed Mir\u00f3's Chicago\u2014was unveiled. This large, mixed media sculpture is situated outdoors in the downtown Loop area of Chicago, across the street from another large public sculpture, the Chicago Picasso.  Mir\u00f3 had created a bronze model of The Sun, the Moon and One Star in 1967. The maquette now resides in the Milwaukee Art Museum.\n\n\n=== Late life and death ===\nIn 1979 Mir\u00f3 received a doctorate honoris causa from the University of Barcelona. The artist, who suffered from heart failure, died in his home in Palma (Majorca) on 25 December 1983. He was later interred in the Montju\u00efc Cemetery in Barcelona.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Early fauvist ===\nHis early modernist works include Portrait of Vincent Nubiola (1917), Siurana (the path), Nord-Sud (1917) and Painting of Toledo. These works show the influence of C\u00e9zanne, and fill the canvas with a colorful surface and a more painterly treatment than the hard-edge style of most of his later works. In Nord-Sud, the literary newspaper of that name appears in the still life, a compositional device common in cubist compositions, but also a reference to the literary and avant-garde interests of the painter.\n\n\n=== Magical realism ===\nStarting in 1920, Mir\u00f3 developed a very precise style, picking out every element in isolation and detail and arranging them in deliberate composition. These works, including House with Palm Tree (1918), Nude with a Mirror (1919), Horse, Pipe and Red Flower (1920), and The Table \u2013 Still Life with Rabbit (1920), show the clear influence of Cubism, although in a restrained way, being applied to only a portion of the subject. For example, The Farmer's Wife (1922\u201323), is realistic, but some sections are stylized or deformed, such as the treatment of the woman's feet, which are enlarged and flattened.The culmination of this style was The Farm (1921\u201322). The rural Catalan scene it depicts is augmented by an avant-garde French newspaper in the center, showing Mir\u00f3 sees this work transformed by the Modernist theories he had been exposed to in Paris. The concentration on each element as equally important was a key step towards generating a pictorial sign for each element. The background is rendered in flat or patterned in simple areas, highlighting the separation of figure and ground, which would become important in his mature style.\nMir\u00f3 made many attempts to promote this work, but his surrealist colleagues found it too realistic and apparently conventional, and so he soon turned to a more explicitly surrealist approach.\n\n\n=== Early surrealism ===\nIn 1922, Mir\u00f3 explored abstracted, strongly coloured surrealism in at least one painting. From the summer of 1923 in Mont-roig, Mir\u00f3 began a key set of paintings where abstracted pictorial signs, rather than the realistic representations used in The Farm, are predominant. In The Tilled Field, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and Pastoral (1923\u201324), these flat shapes and lines (mostly black or strongly coloured) suggest the subjects, sometimes quite cryptically. For Catalan Landscape (The Hunter), Mir\u00f3 represents the hunter with a combination of signs: a triangle for the head, curved lines for the moustache, angular lines for the body. So encoded is this work that at a later time Mir\u00f3 provided a precise explanation of the signs used.\n\n\n=== Surrealist pictorial language ===\nThrough the mid-1920s Mir\u00f3 developed the pictorial sign language which would be central throughout the rest of his career.\nIn Harlequin's Carnival (1924\u201325), there is a clear continuation of the line begun with The Tilled Field. But in subsequent works, such as The Happiness of Loving My Brunette (1925) and Painting (Fratellini) (1927), there are far fewer foreground figures, and those that remain are simplified.\nSoon after Mir\u00f3 also began his Spanish Dancer series of works. These simple collages, were like a conceptual counterpoint to his paintings. In Spanish Dancer (1928) he combines a cork, a feather and a hatpin onto a blank sheet of paper.\n\n\n=== Livres d'Artiste ===\nMir\u00f3 created over 250 illustrated books. These were known as \"Livres d' Artiste.\" One such work was published in 1974, at the urging of the widow of the French poet Robert Desnos, titled Les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s de l'enfer ou les nouvelles H\u00e9brides (\"The Penalties of Hell or The New Hebrides\"). It was a set of 25 lithographs, five in black, and the others in colors.\nIn 2006 the book was displayed in \"Joan Mir\u00f3, Illustrated Books\" at the Vero Beach Museum of Art. One critic said it is \"an especially powerful set, not only for the rich imagery but also for the story behind the book's creation. The lithographs are long, narrow verticals, and while they feature Mir\u00f3's familiar shapes, there's an unusual emphasis on texture.\" The critic continued, \"I was instantly attracted to these four prints, to an emotional lushness, that's in contrast with the cool surfaces of so much of Mir\u00f3's work. Their poignancy is even greater, I think, when you read how they came to be. The artist met and became friends with Desnos, perhaps the most beloved and influential surrealist writer, in 1925, and before long, they made plans to collaborate on a livre d'artiste. Those plans were put on hold because of the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Desnos' bold criticism of the latter led to his imprisonment in Auschwitz, and he died at age 45 shortly after his release in 1945. Nearly three decades later, at the suggestion of Desnos' widow, Mir\u00f3 set out to illustrate the poet's manuscript. It was his first work in prose, which was written in Morocco in 1922 but remained unpublished until this posthumous collaboration.\"\n\n\n== Styles and development ==\nIn Paris, under the influence of poets and writers, he developed his unique style: organic forms and flattened picture planes drawn with a sharp line. Generally thought of as a Surrealist because of his interest in automatism and the use of sexual symbols (for example, ovoids with wavy lines emanating from them), Mir\u00f3's style was influenced in varying degrees by Surrealism and Dada, yet he rejected membership in any artistic movement in the interwar European years. Andr\u00e9 Breton described him as \"the most Surrealist of us all.\" Mir\u00f3 confessed to creating one of his most famous works, Harlequin's Carnival, under similar circumstances:\n\nHow did I think up my drawings and my ideas for painting? Well I'd come home to my Paris studio in Rue Blomet at night, I'd go to bed, and sometimes I hadn't any supper. I saw things, and I jotted them down in a notebook. I saw shapes on the ceiling...\nMir\u00f3's surrealist origins evolved out of \"repression\" much like all Spanish surrealist and magic realist work, especially because of his Catalan ethnicity, which was subject to special persecution by the Franco regime. Also, Joan Mir\u00f3 was well aware of Haitian Voodoo art and Cuban Santer\u00eda religion through his travels before going into exile. This led to his signature style of art making.\n\n\n=== Experimental style ===\nJoan Mir\u00f3 was among the first artists to develop automatic drawing as a way to undo previous established techniques in painting, and thus, with Andr\u00e9 Masson, represented the beginning of Surrealism as an art movement. However, Mir\u00f3 chose not to become an official member of the Surrealists to be free to experiment with other artistic styles without compromising his position within the group. He pursued his own interests in the art world, ranging from automatic drawing and surrealism, to expressionism, Lyrical Abstraction, and Color Field painting. Four-dimensional painting was a theoretical type of painting Mir\u00f3 proposed in which painting would transcend its two-dimensionality and even the three-dimensionality of sculpture.Mir\u00f3's oft-quoted interest in the assassination of painting is derived from a dislike of bourgeois art, which he believed was used as a way to promote propaganda and cultural identity among the wealthy. Specifically, Mir\u00f3 responded to Cubism in this way, which by the time of his quote had become an established art form in France. He is quoted as saying \"I will break their guitar,\" referring to Picasso's paintings, with the intent to attack the popularity and appropriation of Picasso's art by politics.\nThe spectacle of the sky overwhelms me. I'm overwhelmed when I see, in an immense sky, the crescent of the moon, or the sun. There, in my pictures, tiny forms in huge empty spaces. Empty spaces, empty horizons, empty plains \u2013 everything which is bare has always greatly impressed me. \u2014Joan Mir\u00f3, 1958, quoted in Twentieth-Century Artists on Art\nIn an interview with biographer Walter Erben, Mir\u00f3 expressed his dislike for art critics, saying, they \"are more concerned with being philosophers than anything else.  They form a preconceived opinion, then they look at the work of art.  Painting merely serves as a cloak in which to wrap their emaciated philosophical systems.\"In the final decades of his life Mir\u00f3 accelerated his work in different media, producing hundreds of ceramics, including the Wall of the Moon and Wall of the Sun at the UNESCO building in Paris. He also made temporary window paintings (on glass) for an exhibit. In the last years of his life Mir\u00f3 wrote his most radical and least known ideas, exploring the possibilities of gas sculpture and four-dimensional painting.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThroughout the 1960s, Mir\u00f3 was a featured artist in many salon shows assembled by the Maeght Foundation that also included works by Marc Chagall, Giacometti, Brach, Cesar, Ubac, and Tal-Coat.\nThe large retrospectives devoted to Mir\u00f3 in his old age in towns such as New York (1972), London (1972), Saint-Paul-de-Vence (1973) and Paris (1974) were a good indication of the international acclaim that had grown steadily over the previous half-century; further major retrospectives took place posthumously. Political changes in his native country led in 1978 to the first full exhibition of his painting and graphic work, at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid. In 1993, the year of the hundredth anniversary of his birth, several exhibitions were held, among which the most prominent were those held in the Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, Barcelona, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, Madrid, and the Galerie Lelong, Paris. In 2011, another retrospective was mounted by the Tate Modern, London, and travelled to Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3 and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.. Joan Mir\u00f3, Printmaking, Fundaci\u00f3n Joan Mir\u00f3 (2013). And two exhibitions in 2014, Mir\u00f3: From Earth to Sky at Albertina Museum, and Masterpieces from the Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich, National Art Center, Tokyo.\nExhibitions entitled Joan Mir\u00f3: Instinct & Imagination and \"Mir\u00f3: The Experience of Seeing\" were held at the Denver Art Museum from 22 March \u2013 28 June 2015 and at the McNay Art Museum from 30 September 2015 \u2013 10 January 2016 (respectively), showing works made by Mir\u00f3 between 1963 and 1981, on loan from the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid.In Spring 2019, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, launched Joan Mir\u00f3: Birth of the World. Running until July 2019, the exhibit showcases 60 pieces of work from the inception of Mir\u00f3's career, and including the influence of the World Wars. The exhibit features 60-foot canvasses as well as smaller 8-foot paintings, and the influences range from cubism to abstraction.\n\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\nMir\u00f3 has been a significant influence on late 20th-century art, in particular the American abstract expressionist artists such as Motherwell, Calder, Gorky, Pollock, Matta and Rothko, while his lyrical abstractions and color field paintings were precursors of that style by artists such as Helen Frankenthaler, Olitski and Louis and others.\nHis work has also influenced modern designers, including Paul Rand and Lucienne Day, and influenced recent painters such as Julian Hatton.One of Man Ray's 1930s photographs, Mir\u00f3 with Rope, depicts the painter with an arranged rope pinned to a wall, and was published in the single-issue surrealist work Minotaure.\nIn 2002, American percussionist/composer Bobby Previte released the album The 23 Constellations of Joan Mir\u00f3 on Tzadik Records. Inspired by Mir\u00f3's Constellations series, Previte composed a series of short pieces (none longer than about 3 minutes) to parallel the small size of Mir\u00f3's paintings. Privete's compositions for an ensemble of up to ten musicians was described by critics as \"unconventionally light, ethereal, and dreamlike\".\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 1954 he was given the Venice Biennale print making prize, in 1958 the Guggenheim International Award.In 1981, the Palma City Council (Majorca) established the Fundaci\u00f3 Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3 a Mallorca, housed in the four studios that Mir\u00f3 had donated for the purpose.In October 2018, the Grand Palais in Paris opened the largest retrospective devoted to the artist until this date. The exhibition included nearly 150 works and was curated by Jean Louis Prat.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nToday, Mir\u00f3's paintings sell for between US$250,000 and US$26 million; US$17 million at a U.S. auction for the La Caresse des \u00e9toiles (1938) on 6 May 2008, at the time the highest amount paid for one of his works. In 2012, Painting-Poem (\"le corps de ma brune puisque je l'aime comme ma chatte habill\u00e9e en vert salade comme de la gr\u00eale c'est pareil\") (1925) was sold at Christie's London for $26.6 million. Later that year at Sotheby's in London, Peinture (Etoile Bleue) (1927) brought nearly 23.6 million pounds with fees, more than twice what it had sold for at a Paris auction in 2007 and a record price for the artist at auction. On 21 June 2017, the work Femme et Oiseaux (1940), one of his Constellations, sold at Sotheby's London for 24,571,250 GBP.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJacques Dupin, Joan Mir\u00f3 Life and Work, Harry N.

        "wiki": "Santa Ponsa (Catalan and officially: Santa Pon\u00e7a) is a small town in the south-west of Majorca. Located in the municipality of Calvi\u00e0, it is 18 kilometres from the capital Palma.\n\n\n== History ==\nSanta Ponsa derives its name from a Roman villa called Sancta Pontia. Santa Ponsa is where King James I of Aragon (Jaume in Catalan) landed on September 12, 1229 in his successful quest to conquer the island and take it from the Moors after more than 300 years of Muslim rule. Majorca became part of the Crown of Aragon following James's conquest, and was later annexed to the Monarchy of Spain. A cross at the sea entrance to the marina marks the spot where James landed. Every September there is a grand fiesta to commemorate the landing with a mock battle between the Moors and Christians on the beach. It is a two-week fiesta which incorporates a pop concert and firework display.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe town is a popular holiday destination and attracts people from countries with colder climates such as Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and Great Britain, especially from May to October. Some have bought villas and apartments in the hills on each side of the bay. In recent years, it has become a popular party destination among youths due to its great nightlife and its close distance to Magaluf, another party area.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nSanta Ponsa has two 18-hole (I, II) and one 9-hole golf courses (III). Santa Ponsa II has hosted a PGA European Tour event and is open only to club members. Its 18th green is in the shape of the island of Majorca within a pond, reached by a bridge.\nThe Baleares International College, an English school founded in 1956, is located on the road to the nearby village of Magaluf.\nSanta Ponsa also has a private marina, Club N\u00e1utico Santa Ponsa (Santa Ponsa Yacht Club), built in 1975 within the natural cove known as \"Sa Caleta\".  The marina can accommodate up to 522 boats from 7m to 20m in length as well as offering dry dock services.\nSanta Ponsa hosts the Balearic Islands node of the COMETA electric power transmission system from the Spanish mainland.\n\nSanta Ponsa is a well known holiday location for people of all ages, However, it is especially well recognised to be a holiday location for teens of the age 17 and up and was listed as the top ten holiday spot for older teens.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSanta Ponsa tourist information\nSanta Ponsa tourist information UK\nSanta Ponsa - Mallorca\nVideo \"Santa Ponsa: Beaches & Golf\" in Mallorca TV Teleweb+\nSanta Ponsa - Majorca",

          "Over 300 hundred years in the making and it still looks fantastic, Apparently 300 years after completion Mr Gaud\u00ed was asked to give it an upgrade and after 12 years of indecision was sacked, love Gaud\u00ed but I love this cathedral as it is",
          "It is a very nice place. I know this Covid has turned us upside down. But the entrance to the cathedral is charged at \u20ac 8 as if you had a guide accompanying you, I think that to promote culture it should be at a more reasonable price.",
          "Amazing place to.see...a must do when visiting Palma. Architecture and history of building breathtaking.",
          "The structure from outside is quite impressive. This year was even more enjoyable since not many people around in full season.",
          "Beautiful cathedral-well worth a visit. Very accessible and easy for families. Fantastic stained glass windows",
          "Great couple of hours spent... have an ice cream afterwards outside .... we wandered around, saw the audio tour on the way out (oops)... was lovely and quiet as we visited in the middle of covid .... most enjoyable few hours of a morning.",
          "The magnificent Cathedral in the heart of Palma. A masterpiece of Gothic Architecture. Highly recommend the audioguide.",
          "Very impressive atmosphere thanks to the light that comes through the window mosaics. It is worth staying here and perceiving this amosphere. Admission costs 8 euros if you do not visit the cathedral during the divine service.",
          "I would highly recommend coming, this is one of the most beautiful architectural strictures I have seen. You can take a step back in time and really see and feel the history. Located on a beautiful hill overlooking the ocean this is a must experience. Make sure to bring a mask",
          "What can I say, it is truly fantastic place. it feels as the time has stopped. It is a must see place when in Palma.",
          "The guy selling tickets made all the tourists wait while he chatted on his cell phone to his girlfriend. Highly unprofessional. After 10mins wait we left hoping to return the next day. The next day, same problem but eventually he graced us with his attention and told us we could",
          "We heard people complain about entrance fee - 8 euro but we thought worth it considering the superb maintainance of the cathedral and the grounds. Very gothic, Gaudi, history, lots of info - just visit for yourself, its worth it!",
          "The cathedral is no doubt very nice ,old and an amazing experience. But we felt the entry fees are more for that. We felt the cost includes visit to palace as well. But it's only to see inside cathedral. There is no separate museum .little disappointed with the price they are",
          "Well worth a visit - I found this stunningly beautiful church a very spiritual experience & a great example of local artisan work. It's also a great view of the sea. I would have visited a second time had I been there longer.",

          "Beautiful Gothic cathedral containing art and architecture dating from the 1300s. One particular point of interest is the chapel designed by Gaud\u00ed. There are informative readings at each chapel.",

          "A really lovely area, the cathedral was very interesting and the local cafes were great. One concern was the Carriage Horse Rides being sold, these horses were not In good condition and when not working they were tied to a lamppost without hay/water. Spend your money elsewhere.",
          "Lovely cathedral. We loved the Gaudi touches, especially the baldachin. The windows are beautiful. The signage helped, but we couldn\u2019t find the brochure or guide they told us was available inside, which would have helped us better understand what we were seeing and also helped",
          "Really amazing structure and beautiful place. Nice catholic church. Old and historical. Love the windows. Worth the visit",
          "Lovely grand cathedral, cafes around the cathedral over looking the lake was nice, market stalls as well.",
          "Fabulous Cathedral. Beautiful stained glass windows lots of history displayed around for you yo read. Highly recommend a visit.",
          "Okay there are a lot of historic buildings about. And once you have seen a few it can get tiresome and repetitive but if you are going to see one, I would recommend this one. It is awe-inspiring in its scale and the religious works inside are epic",
          "Amazingly large cathedral for a small island. Find out about the chulta - banners of their family names once hung down throughout the cathedral.",
          "Absolutely beautiful and peaceful. I have visited twice and both times were amazing. Better to get there earlier to avoid long queues. Can\u2019t take photos inside but the history is so interesting.",
          "Don\u2019t miss visiting if you are in Palma. Simply stunning. Not advertised, but there is a discount on entry fee for senior citizens",
          "I tried to days in a row to get in, it has crazy hours to visit. This was a little disappointment. I really wanted to see what took almost 400 years to complete\u2026. Outside is impressive, a remarkable structure. Nobody misses that, you can see it tall and graceful from everywhere.",
          "An amazing rose window and very interesting interior. Quite a bit to see. The height of the nave is indeed breathtaking, as are the colors cast by sunlight streaming through the rose windows. Helpful explanatory placards throughout. Many centuries of art and architecturre.",
          "What we found amazing was the height of this cathedral. It is definitely worth a visit, the minute you walk in it just seeps you in totally. The cathedral also brings with a certain calm. A must see!",
          "To look at the cathedral with dark blue sky and not a cloud! So lucky to see this stunning building at its best",
          "Beautiful cathedral and surroundings. Entrence is 8Euros. Regular church services at 9am mon-fri and 7pm on Saturdays.",
          "Stunning cathedral, took your breath away when you enter. Enormous, so much to see. Only problem is it is difficult to photograph from outside as it\u2019s very close to the palace. Best view is from the road next to the sea on the way into the city.",
          "Have visited here, many times before. It really is beautiful. We walked all over and everytime we love to see this place",
          "Awesome gothic cathedral with beautiful stained glass windows creating wonderful internal light across nave. Artwork around Alter by Gaudi is unique and well worth seeing. Modest admission charge but well worth it.",
          "For some reason the cathedral was closed on the day we visited. I am sure I would give it a 5 if we could just go inside. The exterior of the cathedral is beautiful, just perfect for a place of worship.",
          "A visit to Palma can't be completed without exploring this beautiful cathedral. You can spend a beautiful afternoon in this cathedral and surrounding area. A walk around the cathedral will make you fall in love with it as views of the city will capture your eyes and you would",
          "We both enjoyed our visit to the cathedral, which dates back to 1229 and is the islands main church. The cathedral was not completed until the 17th century and is a massive place with its 21 chapels. It has lots of beautiful stained glass windows and one of them, the great rose",
          "Lovely, picturesque and breathtaking in parts - but costs 8\u20ac each - you can get deals for a slightly cheaper visit",
          "I have seen many other cathedrals throughout Europe and this one is up there. The heights of the sprawling cathedral and the ornateness of the design is incredible. And the view of the city and the countryside from the spot is worth it on it's own. I walked around on my own",
          "Fun and interesting cathedral to visit. The grounds are spectacular. The views are great and the gardens very beautiful and relaxing. We did not go inside.",
          "Love old Palma town and the stunning imposing cathedral building overlooking the seafront. Palma town is a stunning place to visit outstanding range of upmarket shops and boutiques department stores plenty of cafes,restaurants to cater for all tastes. So if you have a few hours",
          "Not as impressive as other cathedrals. It is expensive to get into, yet there is not much to see apart from the stunning gothic structures. Far more interesting is the historic surrounding areas san the historic walks of Palma.",
          "We visited on one of only two opportunities each year to see the reflection of the rose window at one end of the cathedral as the sun shines through it to form a figure \u20188\u2019 when combined with the rose window at the other end. The queue starts at around 7am and entry is from",
          "Whatever your religioos beliefs, even if you have none, walk around the Cathedral and wonder at the archiecture and fine art on display here. The atmosphere is palpable and something of interest around every turn. Take the double-decker tour from outside. 45-50 minutes will show",
          "this place is so beautiful, on the outside and also on the inside! definitely worth a vist! unfortunately the museum was closed.",
          "Magnificent building and definetly worth a visit! Although already visiting a lot of cathedrals/churches this was definitely a highlight and really impressive!",
          "Most important attraction in Majorca, we unfortunately did not book a tour and we saw a large group there on tour and overheard what they were saying and the explanations and we regretted not booking a guide as there is a lot to learn and see. We took loads of photos, there was",
          "My partner and I spent a couple of hours in the cathedral. The light was shining through the stained glass windows, and it was truly magnificent. I sat quietly taking in my surroundings, and even said a prayer as the moment just called for it. Architecturally the cathedral was",
          "One of the most beautiful mediterranean cathedrals, you cannot pass Palma without stoppinh by this monument. The old town passages are amazing, too.",
          "This cathedral is stunning and the location just by the sea makes it quite unique - I would highly recommend.",
          "Beautiful cathedral both outside and inside. The stained glass is incredible and rest of the inside amazing. Well worth a visit.",
          "Looks fantastic from the outside and the same on the inside. Great stained glass windows, a contribution over the main altar by Antoni Gaudi and an interesting interpretation of the miracle of the loaves and fishes in ceramics in one corner of the cathedral. Entrance is 8",
          "This is one of the highlights if staying in Palma city! Steps away from the shopping area and a must visit.",
          "Very beautiful place, both in daylight and at night.... Five times were passing by and each time could not look back from the most beautiful view!",
          "Stunning cathedral and definitely worth a visit. Although 5 stars, I found the audio guide poor, so definitely something to improve.",
          "Palma has quite an interesting history that I had know clue about before going. This is a land mark that can be seen from really far. It's huge and sort of on a hill, we even saw it from the mountains. Definitely worth a visit. We didn't go inside though. I'm sure it's amazing",
          "If in Palma you have to visit the cathedral; it\u2019s fantastic! Queues can be long in the high season so choose your time carefully.",
          "We cruised into Palma port and got a shuttle to a drop off by the Cathedral it's a long walk if your going to trek it so be wary before you try it but there are plenty of cafes en route. Yes its all been said what a great building and in a lovely area well maintained and cared",
          "Beautiful site,Amazing and a must visit place in Majorca/Mallorca. Lots of restaurants and designer shops outside the cathedral.",
          "I loved this place when I saw it. It's majestic. Is an excellent front page cover for Palma. Inside, is very spacious and colourful. Coloured glazign and gothic architecture makes this place a piece of art.",
          "Too many people, to the point that taking pictures of the cathedral itself becomes a hassle. Go on weekdays.",
          "Average priced tickets to enter the Cathedral, the walk around the exterior costs nothing as does entry to the Arab Baths if the gate has been unlocked. It\u2019s a beautiful place to visit. If you wish to pay extra for the audio guide you can but entirely up to you. We didn\u2019t bother.",
          "a visit during the low season is of course preferable as you can enter the cathedral without crowds and waiting time.",
          "Enormous interior is enhanced by the light effects of the sun through the stained glass windows. Allow at least an hour to appreciate the detail of the chapels.",
          "Whilst on holiday in Majorca we went to see the Magnificent Cathedral in Palma , it\u2019s a must see place . Stunning building , helpful staff ,. You can sit a while and just soak up the statues , pictures and icons . I\u2019m not a particularly religious person but have to admit that",
          "A very interesting sculpture with very good views of the city. However, it was quite annoying to know, you can only see the cathedral from outside. All doors are closed a d no one is allowed entry. I think it would have been nicer if one could see the cathedral from the inside.",

          "Incredible. Majestic. Scintillating. Spent three hours earlier this week at the Cathedral. Totally worth it. Had the opportunity to follow this up by attending midnight mass on 24DEC. Superb. Once in a lifetime.",
          "One of the most impressive structures I have ever seen. I would like in it to the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca, for striking beauty when you first to see it. Gigantic, but in a good way. An architectural masterpiece.",
          "Easy walkable distance! Mabel at the interior architecture. Beautiful views of the harbour, from the grounds. Worth the visit.",
          "The Mediterranean Sea, the wonderful city of Palma with its pride in the Cathedral, do not miss the opportunity to visit",

          "A must see when you are in Mallorca! There was a line up to get in (and I don't do line ups) - but it was worth it. Very interesting. Gorgeous. The kind of cathedral that makes you want to be religious.",
          "one of the best places on the island. highly recommended . i enjoyed a lot in such a wonderful place. the best in europe",
          "Leave majorca to the young nice place but if you're over 50 go to a more quiet place choice of entertainment for the mature is limited",

          "Fantastic and welcoming, we sang as a choir at a Holy Week service they were welcoming and the architecture and history absorbing",
          "the Catedral is very big and very impressive both outside and inside,there are certain hours, when you can visit the place inside",
          "You are restricted as to when you can enter but worth the wait- stunning. Not difficult to locate as it dominates the skyline in Palma.",
          "am hindu , but i like to go in churches , this church is very beautiful , peace in mind , positive energy best",
          "This is simply a must do experience if visiting Palma, this cathedral dominates the city and walking around and inside just has to be done. \u20ac8 per person entry, allow a couple of hours to do the visit justice, enjoy the light shining through coloured glass windows and the",
          "The color crystals are impressive. Very high roof and a design that took years to make. Beautiful inside and outside.",
          "Highly recommended! You must see this beautiful place and you should know that it took 800+ years to build it up",
          "but once is enough. The Cathedral is of course incredible and THE tourist attraction but it is still a cathedral. I've been to Mallorca a few times and of course I went in but once is enough for me.",
          "Beautiful church , everyone have to go there and look this church , you will relief there , God bless all of us !",
          "One of the most beautiful church\u2019s that I have visit I took bunch of pictures. #1 place in the isle not for children\u2019s",
          "I meant to review this a while ago. I normally am not a fan of cathedrals, finding them oppressive and dark. This cathedral is full of light and life, the architecture a joy to behold. We were there around 10.30am on 6th August when the sun burst through the stain glass",
          "Went on an organised tour which happened to coincide with two or three cruise ships arriving the same morning. Thus the tour was rushed, the cathedral was heaving with people and not a particularly enjoyable place to be.",
          "Must to see if you are visiting Mallorca! The most famous building of Mallorca and number of 1 sighseeing goals on the island. Cathedral La Seu is a breath-taking place, so you also need to plan more time for sightseeing of it. Nice option is to buy the skip the line ticket",
          "Majestic cathedral in the city center. Nice surroundings, architecture and well worth to pay for an entrance ticket as the interior definitely matches the exterior, with its massive rose window, huge central dome and other art. Worth a visit when in the city.",
          "We visited in November. It was late afternoon and the low sun was blazing through the stained glass. The colours were beautiful. This is a really lovely cathedral, well kept, beautiful architecture and a momentous visit.",
          "If you like Gaudi work (and even if you don't:-)) you should visit to see a baldachino, an enormous heptagonal crown, that he created for the altar. This enornous heptagonal crown carries a dozens of candelabras and wrought iron lamps that gives the cathedral a delicate light.",
          "Beautiful cathedral..lovely stained glass windows.Really worth a visit. Entrance fee is 9 euros per person.",
          "A very nice cathedral from the outside at least. We didn't go inside, but it's very nice to talke a walk around it. There are tonns of sellers, but they are not very annoying, so they don't bother you that much. Would love to take a trip inside also at another occasion.",
          "The Catedral de Mallorca was stunning. I have visited a lot of cathedrals in Europe over the years but this is in my top three. The individual old chapels were amazing and each of them had a description easy to read. The Gaudi Chapel was a surprise and an added attraction",
          "We saved this for our last day with rain forecast. It was \u20ac7 for 65+ and we spent about 30 mins in there. It was a visit we enjoyed, it\u2019s an amazing building and a very calming experience away from the hustle & bustle of the city. The stained glass windows are really beautiful.",
          "A truly amazing cathedral with architecture to match. The stained glass windows are so colourful which make for nice travel photos. The religious art is very interesting and gaudy had a strong influence on parts of the architecture.",
          "It is not surprising that the cathedral is ranked the number one attraction in Palma. The start of its construction dates back to 1229 and its floor to ceiling height is 44 metres. The entrance tickets cost 8 Euros, which also includes access to the cathedral museum and",
          "The Cathedral is a stunning building but we didn\u2019t get the chance to visit the inside however the outside and surrounding buildings are amazing. This is more however. On returning one evening from a walk we heard music and saw lights around the bottom of the Cathedral. We",
          "The building from the outside is imposing but inside it's even more stunning than you imagine. Artworks, marble statues and the ultra modern section is breathtaking. Loving Palma.",
          "If you do anything in Palma, you have to see the Catedral! The outside alone will take your breath away.",

          "Free entrance on Sunday mornings. Beautiful cathedral part of a great wander around town on a Sunday morning. Worth a visit.",
          "One of the most beautiful cathedrals I have seen. The colored lights as a result of the stained glass windows, and tall ceilings give a wonderful feeling. I opted not to take the 4 \u20ac audio guide and just enjoy the ambiance and architecture, but there are multiple plaques",
          "Truly beautiful. Each side chappel has facinating history and details written in English making it easy to enjoy and learn. Amazing at every turn. Set aside about 60-90 min inside. Nice area to walk around and grab a lite bite or gelato.",

          "beautiful building and surroundings. great market stalls in the grounds, lovely gardens, fountains etc. Photo opportunities aplenty.",
          "Waited for mass to finish before entering. Its amazing to see on the outside, even better on the inside. Each section is well looked after and beautiful. Great stained glass throughout. Cathedral is filled with amazing items from the ceiling draped. Free too. Well worth it.",
          "Catedral de Mallorca a most magnificent building, you could spend hours and hours and never get bored",
          "As one of the main sites in Palma the cathedral is understandably busy but well worth a visit. There are some strange modern additions but the main body of the building and the ceiling are good examples of the period.",
          "Not to be missed and it is also centrally located. A lot of activities there and around it. Good shopping nearby too.",
          "We decided to spend the day in Palma, and took the open top bus around the city. This is a very informative trip and well worth a try. We then went to the Cathedral. I was amazed at the interior - it is stunning. You must make the time to see the Cathedral. You won't be",
          "Visited last week, very impressive and imposing architecture, lovely entrance grounds/ gardens upon approach, we sat on the grass in some shade! Once dark and the Cathedral is all lit up looks majestic from the roadside. Worth an hour or so of time to visit if in Majorca",
          "Wonderful place , great for taking photos as the structure of the building is very extravagant and unique. Enterance fee is excessive though at 7Euro per head, Compounded with high tourist tax Majorca is becoming an expensive place for holidays. For those on budget,",
          "Lovely day at Palma Cathedral well worth a visit. Very beautiful architecture inside and interesting history. Managed to go around without audio and could read all the cards around the inside. A must on a visit to Palma.",
          "Excellent photo external opportunities with both the cathedral, and of the ocean from the vantage point that the raised level of the cathedral provides. Beautiful views.",
          "The cathedral is probably the largest landmark of Palma de Mallorca with many places to relax. Unfortunately, on my visit, the building was closed.",
          "We visited this stunning building and was truly gob smacked with the utter beauty of the place. Lots of stunning chapels and wonderful stained glass windows that makes the inside of the building dance in colour. Some nice artifacts to look at and a place that will stay in your",
          "Lovely Cathedral building, a must see when in Palma. Costs \u20ac8 to get in but it costs extra if you want to go on the terraces, we didn't do this.",
          "We loved our visit to the cathedral and found the audio guide interesting and essential to our visit. The stained glass windows were extraordinarily bright and truly beautiful cascading light across the interior of the cathedral as the sun is lower at this time of year I think",
          "It\u2019s a must to see a fantastic place overlooking the city easy to walk around lovely gardens to relax in",
          "Though I've visited Majorca many times it was on Monday that I visited for the first time at my wife's suggestion. I was awestruck from the moment I entered the building. It was a day of strong sunshine and I was awed by the way sunlight hitting the stained glass windows",
          "We enjoyed walking around the exterior and interior of this beautiful gothic Cathedral which is the symbol of Palma. We made the mistake of not paying for an audio headset or a guide and as a result we didn't get the best out of the experience. Written information in English is",
          "What struck me on the outside was the absence of one or two high bell towers. The inside is beautifully decorated, occasionally a bit too much. I am not conviced that the colored lighting adds to its beauty. Other cathedrals abstain from doing this and can be as beautiful.",
          "We were visiting Palma de Mallorca as part of our cruise and someone recommended that we visit the cathedral. We were glad that we did! It is magnificent, with beautiful stained glass windows, statues and carvings, and filled with history. We rented the headphones which were",
          "One of the world's biggest Gothic cathedrals and an outstanding protuberant on the hill dominating Palma's skyline, visible from far afield. Entry is 8 Euros and worth it to experience this superbly maintained cathedral. It stands magnificent when viewed from below, across the",

          "First the moan very noisy and it was not very busy.People should remember this a church. That out of the way the Catedral de Majorca is amazing, little chapel to the side, fantastic windows,really worth the entry price. Memorable couple of hours. A walk outside gives you",
          "Beautiful and awe inspiring. 8 euros entry but well worth it. Lots of side chapels. Amazing windows and lights.",
          "On an organised tour of Palma with this as the main highlight we spent 2 hours taking photographs and admiring the workmanship involved in the structure of this fantastic building. Our young guide was full of detail and still respectful of her church giving us everything to make",
          "Amaizing building outside and inside, we visited it in october, it wasn't crowded. There is also beautiful view on the port, when you are standing in front of the cathedra.",
          "This imposing building stands tall on the waterfront and has those arching buttresses that remind you of Notre-Dame, together with the famous circular rose window. It\u2019s orange hued stone walls contain carved statues of people gone-by and the decorative wood work is amazing. Be",
          "A truly beautiful building with great works of art and architecture. Stained glass windows are amazing. Take your time to take in all of the artifacts you won't regret it. Worth the \u20ac9 entry fee",
          "We took a self guided tour and it was well worth it. The history and the architect is impressive. I believe they started work in the 1300 and didn't finish till 1500s. The location, the height and the surroundings are beautiful and well worth the visit.",
          "A giant cathedral with a unique gothic style right on the water seems more Star Wars-esque than thirteenth century to me. I love how the cathedral is in harmony with its seaside location. While not as tightly bound to the water as Falling Water or Mont St Michel, it is in the",
          "We have visited Mallorca many times with the kids over the years but as they have deserted us we decided to absorb a bit more culture. We spent a quiet 2 1/2 hours exploring this Gothic Architectural gem. 800 years old and still being crafted in the last century. This is one of",
          "Like many cathedrals of Europe.. the outside space and vacinity to other sites makes it a great part of a walking tour",
          "From the cruise ship across the water this cathedral is absolutely stunning. You can\u2019t miss it because it is so huge and wonderfully gothic. We walked a good distance from the port and then took a city bus to the old town area. From there walking is pretty easy and the best",
          "The Cathedral is the definition of a tourist honeypot \u2013 a must see when in Palma \u2013 from the outside it is impressive \u2013 standing high above the Marina with views out to sea \u2013 inside it is cavernous steeped in history with evidence of Gaudi\u2019s influence \u2013 we tried to visit in the",
          "Lovely peaceful atmosphere in the church and a beautiful hanging altar piece that was illuminated from time to time as I admired it from the pews. We did not queue to long to get in and there is a stunning view over the sea from outside the cathedral.",

          "A must see place in Palma, beautiful and close to the sea. easy to get to via public transport. The stained glass windows and the Gaudi chapel were my favourites",
          "We visited early in the morning so didn\u2019t have to queue, we didn\u2019t have a tour guide, however there is a lot of information on display. Thoroughly enjoyed this experience.",
          "Such a beautiful and historic building, very much worth a visit when in Palma, on a sunny day the lighting through the stain glass windows is incredible.",
          "A must in this lovely city. I could sit for hours just to enjoy the views from the cathedral. Though not much savings, it is worthwhile to buy the tickets online.",
          "Stunning architecture and loved the Gaudi contributions. The audio guide is worth having for an extra 4 Euros.",
          "We visited in October, so probably less tourists then in summer, but quickly to in after 30 min wait. One surprise, they accept cash only, so we had to do a quick run to an ATM. The cathedral is very impressive! Good visit with kids, easy to wander around and enjoy at your own",
          "Stunning building and well worth a visit. Only 8 euros and children free. Would definitely visit again.",
          "Not only is this church gorgeous, but the entire setting is captivating-- the grounds, the stauary and the pond.",
          "The actual inside and outside of the Cathedral were beautiful, the inside is not as big as expected but stunning and I did enjoy going in an looking around. Bought tickets online before but no great saving and on the day I went the queues were not bad. On a down side there was",

          "Visiting the catedral was one of our highlights in Mallorca! Beautiful inside and out. The gardens and surroundings are just as beautiful. Highly recommended!!",
          "Visiting the cathedral is a must. I was confused that they only offered entrance tickets to the cathedral AND the museum, but the museum is pretty small ad in direct connection to the cathedral.",
          "I can only describe the cathedral as spectacular. The cathedral dominates the harbor with its impressive size and scale. The get up to the Cathedral and you walk the cobbled streets surrounded by Gothic and Arabic inspired buildings. Then you go in the building and again I am",
          "The cathedral is amazing , even from the outside, The architecture is fabulous. there are performers in the streets which was amazing with great statues it\u2019s very historical. I strongly recommend a visit.",
          "The cathedral is breathtaking. It is 8euro for the tour inside the cathedral. There are horse and buggy rides you can hire to ride through the city centre.There are also lovely side streets and beautiful architecture. So many shops, cafes, bakeries uou could spend a week here in",
          "The cathedral a very special place. Our tour guide told us many fascinating facts about this place. The tour about an hour with lots to see and learn. Enjoyed the whole experience\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

          "I went into the Cathedral whilst exploring the old town. At the time of the visit there was a choir on which a lot of people had come to hear. The architecture both inside and out is beautiful and it is so big it takes time to go around and admire it properly . It is well worth",
          "the cathedral is breathtaking, even from the distance. I liked it rather from outside than from inside, I mean architecture is amazing.. there are street artists outside showing their skills and works of art which gives a perfect historical atmosphere. Even gardens around",

          "The cathedral is in the strict Centre of Palma de Mallorca, so it\u2019s great for people going there by bus and the ones who don\u2019t wanna walk too much. The Palma-city area is also a great place with many romantic streets and old buildings You won\u2019t find on the newer continents.",
          "The Cathedral is excellent. We walked around the city and found a wonderful square with tapas bars. On the top of the hill there\u2019s a modern art gallery which is inside the ancient wall. Palma is well worth a visit even if it\u2019s a simple walk to view the yachts in the harbour.",
          "We had no idea that the Palma Cathedral is another incredible work of Gaudi. We only thought of Gaudi for his work throughout Barcelona yet here is a stunning church with a lot of elements in common with La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. If your travels take you to Majorca this",
          "A magnificent gothic cathedral, massive, highly decorated, a real masterpiece of European Midlle Age art and architecture. Situated next to the Mediteranean shore, in the hystoric part of the city. I was amased.",

          "Beautiful building. Fantastic experience. Everyone enjoyed the visit. Would go back as we ran out of time.",

          "We went to see the work of Gaudi. It was amazing to see and such a contrast with the style of the rest of the cathedral. Not sure the church authorities appreciate it as there are no postcards on sale of the work!",
          "A must see in Palma even if religion is not your thing. How they managed to build such a structure in the 13th century is an absolute mystery. It dis take about 400 hundred years to construct so generation after generation of builders, stonemasons and artists probably worked",
          "Its not widely advertised but you can pre-book on to a 20 only person tour up the towers of the cathedral & see Palma from the top of the cathedral. It is excellent - provided you are vaguely fit & don't mind 208 spiral steps! The booking process is all in Spanish & not a quick",

          "I walked there from my hotel, through the park, lovely water features. Once inside the cathedral just magnificent. Walking around the outside, to view the river and beyond adds to the atmosphere. On the other side of the cathedral, many shops, walk down narrow streets, I loved",

          "You can only marvel at the wonder of Palma Cathedral, even if you are of no religous background, it is well worth a visit. The views from the outside terraces are just as good, overlooking the sea and port where all the cruise ships dock. Be prepared to queue if you have not",
          "Nice area to walk around and have beer at the side walk cafes. Didn't go into the church as it was crowded.",
          "Great experience, very helpful staff & disabled access very good. Would recommend a visit, stunning inside & out.",
          "Beautiful inside and out. We were keen to climb the tower and see the view from the top, but had been encouraged to buy a Spiritual Mallorca ticket a few days earlier. When we bought the ticket we were not told about the tower being extra, and when we asked if we could climb it",
          "Truly one of the more stunning places we visited in Spain. Excellent grounds, well maintained and breath taking architecture. Very crowded but not noticeable due to the layout. Go early if possible.",
          "Free entry. Last time I came here was in 2001 and I\u2019m not a religious person. My grandmother was dying at the time and I remember feeling calm and spiritual peace. This time my father was dying and it was a similar experience. It\u2019s a beautiful space with some fabulous windows",
          "A beautiful and magnificent cathedral in a wonderful city. Stained glass windows shine brightly in the sun.",
          "Dominating the Palma waterfront is the cathedral straight out of game of Thrones and surrounded by beautiful small gardens. Unfortunately I did not get the time or opportunity to step inside but the exterior is just amazing.",
          "Not as grand as many European cathedrals but still nice. Did not buy tickets ahead of time at most a 10 minute wait for the tickets. Worth seeing for 8 euro but not real special.",
          "Beautiful cathedral inside and out. There is an entrance fee. If you ore buy your ticket you can skip the line. Look for the group entrance. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This is a beautiful piece of architecture and definitely worth a visit if you are in Palma. Of course you can expect to queue, but it is definitely worth the wait.",
          "The cathedral is a famous landmark on the Palma city horizon. It is difficult not to be impressed with the interior but there is too much to describe. On leaving we realized that you could visit the roof so we will have to return soon to do that. Incidentally the cathedral is",
          "We took a walk through while on our cruise stop. 8 Euro per person. The line was short and it was worth a look. Very impressive on the outside.",
          "The ticket price for seniors is \u20ac7 which is an absolute bargain. We expected to pay a lot more. How refreshing not to feel ripped off at one of the worlds best cathedrals. And this is really just that. If in Palma do not miss it.",
          "The gothic looking cathedral is certainly the focal point of Palma - well, it is for me. Set on a hilltop, the cathedral looks magnificent against the usual blue skies of majorca. The building is peaceful. The inside is wonderfully preserved with different areas allowing",
          "Beautiful place to visit, day or night. And the guy signing on the front was super cool. I have spent the best relaxing evening in all my trip to Palma.",
          "Reasonably priced 11eur per adult no guided tours on offer. There is underground parking in city centre but nightmare to find",
          "A magnificent cathedral. Structure, stained glass windows and artefacts take your breathe away. Loses a star because I was uncomfortable knowing the starving people with rife illness outside whilst the church was accruing all this wealth in the 13th and 14th centuries.",
          "The cathederal is breathtaking as you approach it but even more so inside, with the high ceilings and amazing stain glass windows, definitely worth a visit.",
          "Absolutely gorgeous, but we did find that the smaller churches which they don't charge admission fee for were equally as stunning and beautiful",
          "This is a stunning building with a long an interesting history. The 2 rose windows are magnificent and the 20th and 21st Century alterations and additions made it feel like a living and evolving building rather than just a 'museum piece'. The audio-guide was useful but a little",
          "Been here last week . What a beautiful and old heritage . Definitely worth a visit . Also you can park your car nearby underground parking.",
          "I didn't go inside, think there was a fee but I can't remember how much. We walked around the building and it was beautiful. Busy area but not enough that you can't get around and see the building from outside.",
          "What a unique experience and only minutes from our hotel. The flying buttresses are simply amazing and the peace and tranquility will astonishing you",
          "Magnificent Cathedral well worth a visit. Very centrally located within the city of Palma, close to shopping area and only a short walk to the beautiful port. Superb views from outside the cathedral over the whole bay. A must to see if you are in Palma.",
          "Everybody who stays on Mallorca needs to visit the cathedral, so get there early. It is open to the public from 10:00am so if you are there before 10:30am there is no queue and the inside is much quieter. The whole place is truly spectacular. I won't bother to repeat the",
          "Went to visit Palma Cathedral last week. Three cruise ships were in that day so very crowded and over subscribed.Felt upset at seeing a disabled lady at the entrance begging.I don't want to be upset on my holiday. Too many people trying to sell things all around. Wouldn't go to",
          "worth a visit especially on a good sunny day, beautiful building and location as well as its historical significance",
          "This is one of f the most fantastic buildings in palma, it\u2019s well worth a visit, however do not go on a Sunday, obviously there will be services going on, and it\u2019s mega busy in the area.",
          "Historic and architecturally superb building - how did they do it all those years ago with such limited mechanised equipment? Many religious artefacts to admire and enjoy.",
          "Over 600 years old bulding made from sand bricks. Looking very well from outside. I have not been inside as there was a big queue to ho there and we were rushing to see other things. But I recomend as top one to see in Palma the capital.",
          "This is amazing place. We were walking here for a long time and recommend to visit for everyone who goes for a vacation here.",
          "We had a guided tour of the Cathedral. The stained glass windows are amazing and very beautiful. The history of the Cathedral is very interesting and it is worth having a guided tour.",
          "The Cathedral de Mallorca is a must see place in Palma. It is extremely big and beautiful. The Gaudi details can be seen in the middle of the front part. The presentations of the saints is precise and perfect.",
          "I was awestruck upon walking in to this glorious cathedral. It induced reverence. The height is amazing and the stained glass windows by Gaudi are mesmerizing. It is a total \u201cWOW!\u201d",
          "I\u2019m probably a bit biased but I didn\u2019t find this particular cathedral to be that impressive. However, I have been to almost all the famous cathedrals and churches in Europe such as Vatican, Seville, Barcelona, Italy and France etc, and found this one to be somewhat poorly",
          "For me the capital city of Mallorca wouldn\u2019t be the same withought this beautiful catedral with a very big walking area in front of it with gardens and fountains, also the view of the city from the catedral is amazing. The architecture is astonishing and it is definitely a place",
          "Really a must when visiting Palma Such a magnificent building It's as impressive on the inside As the outside and the entrance Fee isn't as much as I,d expected",
          "Absolutely stunning, a beautiful cathedral, make sure you have plenty of water with you as the steps are thirsty work.",
          "What an amazing cathedral. Really impressive architecture, took about 2 hours to get round everything. Definitely worth a visit both daytime and night time",
          "Not one for old buildings I\u2019m afraid but when we got out of the taxi and walked over to see the cathedral I got a bit emotional! It was simply awesome. It stands so majestic. I can see why many, many people come to visit. There was hundreds of people around the area. Maybe if we",
          "I spent day in palma great place to go for a day got local bus great shopping center Found nice cafe for lunch went to cathfral long time to get in noy cheap 8 euros each Beautifull inside worrh a visit",
          "Still in use, so watch the times. Can easily be reached by feet from the center in 15 minutes. Impressive architecture",
          "Fabulous cathedral with the most wonderful stained glass windows. Many chapels and a most unusual modern Christian section.",
          "Beautiful buildings inside and out. Thought we would only be there an hour or so. But was there for nearly three hours walking around well priced for what you get to see.",
          "We just did a bit of sightseeing around the outside of the Cathedral before having dinner in the area. The gardens are interesting and the architecture is amazing. There are tons of people about, and you can do other activities like carriage rides, etc.",
          "A truly magnificent Gothic Cathedral. Beautiful stained glass windows coupled with an awesome ceiling. A definite must see in Mallorca.",
          "This is one impressive building and well worth the 8 Euros entry lovely ornate windows Rose window in particular and very impressive look about the whole thing on exit walk around the walls and enter the maze of little streets and bars all around the old town",
          "Stunning location and impressive inside for the almost unique coloured windows. The price was a bit high at 8 Euros, as you'd struggle to spend more than 30 minutes there. Only go if you're really interested in church architecture.",
          "We parked in the underground car park in front of the cathedral, it's easy to get into and keeps your car cool, when you walk out onto the promenade in front of the church you know you are in a special place. The building itself is simply stunning, even if you are not religious",
          "What a beautiful building, so much history and wonderful artifacts. The stained windows are glorious. I thought it was good value as well as I thought it would be much more expensive for such an important cathedral. A fantastic experience",
          "This cathedral is a must if you're in Palma. Absolutely stunning and the surrounding town is lovely with lots to see",
          "One of the must see places in case you decide to visit Mallorca. It is located in the center of Palma city, which gives you quick access to the main streets of Palma. Enjoy.",
          "A beautiful building with lots of light. In total, there are 61 stained-glass windows \u2013 the most spectacular being the central rose window, which harnesses the morning sun, flooding the building with beams of coloured light. One of the most dramatic pieces in the cathedral is",
          "Just 8Euro to enter [7Euro for over 65s]. Ensure you arrive early to avoid queues. Access via the Museum entrance. Arrive early to witness the glorious rainbow spectrum of light thrown across the columns & aisle from the south facing stained glass window.",
          "We visited the cathedral in September. It was well worth the 8 euros to get it. The cathedral and grounds around it were immaculate. The only downside to the visit was that there were lots of beggars outside and they did harrass you a bit. Well worth a visit though.",
          "A complete story is told of this amazing cathedral from its origins to the present day. The self guided tour is much better today than it was only a few years ago with dated technology. Just marvel at the structures facade and the interior with an unhurried sit in the pews and",
          "Once inside the actual Cathedral the huge window is a show stopper. The blue glass was so bright. Lots of pictures and interesting things to look at. I lit three candles for family members and said some prayers. Even though it's open to the public, it still felt like a church.",
          "Great historical place, good atmosphere, great view on port A lot of restaurants and shops with souvenirs in short distance",
          "WE walked past the cathedral almost on a daily basis going and coming from dinner in the square. It overlooks a body of water and is up on a hill. We never visited the interior, but I imagine it must be beautiful inside as well.",
          "Beautiful buildings inside and out. We thought we would only be there an hour or so. But was there for nearly five hours walking around well priced for what you get to see. Lovely areas around the Cathedral to sit and have a coffee and take in the atmosphere. And people watch.",
          "An entry fee to see the interior of a cathedral that took 300 hundred years to build. Also know as cathedral by the sea.",
          "Wow wow wow. This is an amazing detailed cathedral. The stain glass windows bring in the colourful light and the cathedral just comes alight!! Amazing place and great surroundings.",
          "Stunning building and free to enter. The stained glass is particularly impressive. Gaudi influence in several areas.",
          "Dominates Palma and is amazing to see inside. Lot's of great stained glass and the famous design over the alter is impressive. Lot's of people but still worth it.",
          "We were holidaying in Mallorca in August and pre-booked the rooftop terrace tour. Each tour is limited to about 20 people, so not too crowded. There are a lot of spiral steps to get to the roof, and the staircase is very small and hot, so that's worth bearing in mind if you",
          "Can\u2019t understand some of the negative reviews to be fair. We booked a sightseeing bus and walking tour of the city and cathedral and was worth the money, \u20ac18 for the bus and another \u20ac20 for the tour and cathedral and it was worth it. You get to enter the cathedral through a",
          "Took a cab from our cruise ship to the Catedral de Mallorca with my handicapped Mother who uses a mobility scooter. Cabs take credit cards and Euros (not US dollars). Approx $12 Euros. Most cabs (and buses) will drop you at the base of the Cathedral and you have to walk up",
          "This huge building dominates the city and its position on the shoreline means it hasn't been lost in a modern urban sprawl. It took around 400 years to build, starting from the reconquest of the island from the Moors in 1229. There is grassland and a promenade in front of the",
          "Beautiful view close to the sea. If you won\u2018t pay for a ticket just go to a Mass, enjoy the service, the architecture and sunlight shining through the big colored window.",
          "Really interesting and beautiful cathedral. It's well worth getting the audio tour. Note that admission is cash only.",
          "You can see this Cathedral from a mile away as you approach Palma. This was my second visit and enjoyed it just as much. The entrance fee of 8 euros is well worth it. You can take your time in the Cathedral as there is a lot to see and the atmosphere is relaxed and not",
          "Visited here on a day trip to Palma. The architecture is fantastic. Well worth the \u20ac8 entrance fee. So much history. Don\u2019t forget to look at the crypts on the way out under the glass floor",
          "You can finish the cathedral 5 minutes entrance fee 8 euro but must walk around cathedral very nice .",
          "An amazing building to see, I\u2019m not religious so wasn\u2019t particularly bothered about that element. Get in early as it gets very busy.",
          "Had a lovely couple of hours looking round this beautiful building. If any advice , I got the audio tape But found it hard to use and find the things it was explaining. Maybe there is a certain route you take but couldn\u2019t find it . All in all it was good value for money and very",
          "Visiting the Cathedral is a regular occurrence as all visiting friends want a look around and I\u2019m still impressed with every visit. It\u2019s such a landmark of not just Palma but of Mallorca itself. It looks awesome from the outside and once inside you feel the respectful",
          "A great place to visit. The audio guide is well worth \u20ac4. The tour lasted an hour. Highly recommend even on a sunny day",
          "Love this cathedral in palma city. Very magnificent outside and just as beautifully decorated inside. Worth a visit.",
          "Being in Mallorca and not visiting this place would be a sin. Que in front can get very long ... we only enjoyed a walk around the cathedral - still impressive!",
          "This was our second visit to the Cathedral in Palma, it is worth a visit but it is very crowded and quite touristy. However, it is a great building to see.",
          "Very impressive cathedral. The stained glass windows are superb and the sun shining through onto the pews was stunning. Many side chapels with good descriptions in English.",
          "The lines are long to get in and it\u2019s expensive considering how little time one spends there. But it is beautiful.",
          "I love visiting cathedrals as the architecture is always impressive. This one doesn't disappoint. Love the open airiness of the place and the art. Well worth getting the audio guide.",
          "Apart from the stunning architecture the cathedral also has lots to offer on the inside. There are numerous artworks to see including some giant silver candels.",
          "We visited the cathedral on a very bright sunny day which made it even more spectacular against the bright blue skies. A stunning piece of architecture set along the river. Not the most spectacular inside that we have visited on our travels, but still very interesting.",
          "Not to be missed. Notice the majestic Gaud\u00ed lamp coronating the altar. A modern computer study has shown that the slender columns are engineered to be right at the center of the safety structure range. Another interesting fact: The Cathedral is at an angle with respect to the",
          "Great place to visit. Looks fantastic inside and out it\u2019s a must see if visiting the area. Small queues to enter and well priced.",
          "Went here last week the outside was breathtaking. Inside was magnificent not too expensive and worth every penny. We were all very impressed from our children to our adults would love to go back here",

          "We have visited many cathedrals and churches across the whole of Europe, and this one came second only to the Sagrada Familia. Architecture of the cathedral is beautiful with the stained glass windows and beautiful lighting. A highlight was each of the chapels (complete with",
          "An amazing piece of architecture built inside the Roman walled city of Palma, nice and cool inside but a walk around the perimeter is just as breathtaking",
          "Beautiful and majestic. The best is to visit in the evening as sometimes you can get inside of the cathedral without any fee",
          "An amazing Cathedral with outstanding grounds as well. Definitely take the time to go through this structure as there is a lot to see.",
          "We spent a couple of hours visiting here. We used the english self guided tour sets which were very informative. Coming from Barcelona it was interesting to see the Gaudi influence here. Unless you are coming on a cruise ship, we were told to try and arrive before the cruise",
          "Jaw dropping. Wonderful building and the area it stands in. Fountain and lake with the Guinness House bar facing this amazing treasure.",

          "A really outstanding cathedral not to be missed on a visit to Palma. Architecture is second to none so peaceful",
          "The cathedral is beautiful. There are some beautiful views especially the altars. The one issue was people not obeying the rules, and not showing respect, security should be more serious. Also a bit pricey to enter but it is worth it.",
          "Don\u2019t know much about Palma. But the more I see the more beautiful this city is. High up in Palma is this cathedral. Impressive, near the sea and harbour. But you have to pay entrance fee to go in.",

          "Impressive height cathedral (although you don\u2019t necessarily appreciate it, due to it\u2019s width) with some unusual features by Gaud\u00ed and Barcel\u00f3. Fairly plain internally otherwise, however the stained glass rose windows are undeniably beautiful. If you like visiting Cathedrals and",
          "Visited the cathedral in what I imagine was peak travel season so there was a fair queue to enter. Thankfully it moved fairly quick so we weren't waiting around for to long. To save disappointment at the end of the queue MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CASH as cards aren't accepted. Inside",

          "Beautiful hour or so at the cathedral, you can have a guided tour but we bimbled around on our own; plenty of notices in English to explain the different displays. There was a craft market on outside with various bits and bobs for sale. The cathedral exit leads to all kinds",
          "Having visited Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, it was hard to imagine anything coming close to it's majesty and magnificence but this certainly does. A range of chapels border the main seating area and high altar. The range of architecture and artwork is stunning and the windows",

          "Palma Cathedral is beautiful inside and out. Worth a visit but I think the entrance fee is a bit steep for what you get. Adults and kids over 12 (I think) were 8 euros. Students did get a 2 euro discount though. Some families were turning round and walking back out after",

          "It will cost you an 8 Euro entrance fee, but it will be worth it! If you think that the outside of the Cathedral looks impressive, you will not be disappointed with the inside. The sun light reflected via the rosette window, the stained glass windows (61 of them), the hanging",
          "Huge crowds when the cruise ships are in..which is most days in summer. The palace opposite offers a far better visitor experience in our opinion.",

Two sets of excellent toilets. Unfortunately the delightful \u201cwater play\u201d colonnade has been badly damaged and",
          "In the past would definitely have given it 5 stars as it was one of our favorite places. Not so this time. Wonderful fountain walk had suffered some storm damage, but seemed no repairs started. Entire walk roped off which meant no access to delightful little furnished cottage",
          "The house was very interesting, the garden smaller than expected. The pond is good, there were goats and horses to see but you couldn\u2019t get easily close enough to stroke them or appreciate them. The whole garden does need a bit more attention. There is a cafe where we thought we",
          "We previously visited the gardens in early summer time, so it was interesting to see it in March. Whilst in many ways the garden was still sleeping, it was lovely to walk around with fewer visitors, and hear the frogs singing in the pond. It is a lovely place for a spring",
          "Even in winter lovely gardens and interesting house. Not too many people when we went so was nice and peaceful.",
          "This garden is very nice and romantic. Great views, big viraety of trees, plants and some animals behind fences. We really enjoyed freshly squized juice in the bar within the premisses. I believe the oranges were picked from the trees kept in the Alfabia garden. There is also",
          "Relaxing afternoon stroll round the shady gardens, pools & fountains, lovely hour or two. Cute goats and a view of the vintage train as it passed on its way to Soller were both unexpected bonuses! The displays in the house are interesting too. Fresh orange juice from the bar",

          "We visited Jardins de Alfabia during our stay at Port Soller with our elderly Mother in law. I loved the place! Really peaceful despite being just off the beaten track. Being a Spanish holiday we arrived early, about 10.30. Plenty of free parking. Two hours later though this",
          "We quite enjoyed our time in the Jardins de Alfabia, though we went in early spring, when flowers weren't blooming yet. It is an excellent spot to enjoy some peace and quiet far away from the other crowded tourist spots. And you can take wonderful pictures there! We would also",

          "These gardens are recommended in the guidebooks but you are likely to be very disappointed. The gardens are small and have little of interest certainly when we went in September. Save your money and have a drink instead in Soller's lovely main square or down at the port - but,",
          "We visited the gardens for a couple of hours before we arrived at our apartment in Puerto de Soller. The place was very tranquil and we enjoyed having a wander around the gardens and house. As long as you are not expecting a large estate gardens, it is ideal for an hour or two.",
          "It's indeed a pretty garden. But for those who have seen similar gardens in Morocco or Iran won't be exceptionally impressed. Either way it was still a nice treat with my wife. Note: They offer audio guides through an app, but no public WiFi. Strange.",
          "The Jardins de Alfabia can be found just south of Soller very close to the south entrance to the Soller Tunnel. Close to this entrance is a roundabout with the gardens signposted. The whole place is delightful with a somewhat colonial feel to it. It's not large but includes, for",

          "As the weather was a bit dull went to visit the Jardins d'Alfabia. Absolutely worth every euro (7.50 pp). The entrance is just by the toll booth for the tunnel to Soller so be careful to get the right exit for the cat park. The use of the natural spring is amazing the gardens",
          "I'm glad we chose to ignore the negative reviews for this place and see for ourselves. We loved it! We spent around 3 hours in the gardens wandering around admiring the plants and trees. The gardens have a wonderful tranquil feel to them, particularly beautiful on a sunny day",
          "A quiet moment in the middle of splendid gardens. The beauty of the place is wild rather than refined, but the age and history of the plants and buildings add to its charm. We felt replenished and calm when we left.",

          "Really enjoyed our visit to Jardines de Alfabia. The gardens were beautiful and the inside was also very interesting to find out the history of the place. We really enjoyed our visit and would definitely recommend this place. The only thing I would say, there is not much variety",
          "A great Arabic influenced garden set in a great valley with sharp mountains in the background. Great structural gardens with planting suited the this hot environment. It is not a flowery garden but one to marvel at the age, the structure, the water features and the old villa",

          "Charming fertile oasis, we spent two hours here on the last day of our holiday. Very restful interesting place to visit and relax in. I'm certainly recommend stopping off if you are passing on the way to/from Soller",
          "Dropped in on our way back to Palma after a day in the mountains. The gardens are well laid out and looked after. It is a shame the roses were past their peak but that is nature for you! I had cake and coffee in the cafe, but I agree that the home made lemonade looked tempting",
          "My 14 year old daughter chose this as one of our holiday excursions, she was nervous that it might disappoint but it was a lovely place to visit and spend a few hours in the gardens and house. It is laid out very well and was a wonderful experience. The grounds are fantastic",

          "Much has been said already but this is an impressive place to stop en route to Soller or returning to Parma: an historic garden with bold Moorish architecture, an ingenious irrigation system as well as playful water features, striking palms, Buxus hedging, and much more planting",

          "Although we visited in late summer, when most of the flowers are not at their best, it was still a really worthwhile stop. You can get a sense of what life was like for the privileged owner of a property like this, centuries ago. If you're into botany or history this place is",
          "A lovely, peaceful place. We spent a good 3 hours there. I thought the entrance fee was expensive but once I got in I was surprised how interesting it was. It's not huge but it was a great way to pass a couple of hours wandering around.",

          "If you need somewhere to relax and forget about the world, this has to be it. It's not a big garden overall but has large trees and interesting planting. Lots of water to calm the spirits. Take your time, don't rush. The house, stables and olive pressing areas are worth spending",
          "This garden is lovely and shady with sounds of trickling water channeled through the stone. It has expanded and been further refurbished since my last visit 2 years ago. The cafe/bar is lovely with the music playing. Shame there is no lunch available, but we had a good",

          "Rather over-priced at 6.5 Euro for not a lot, but it was a shaded place which are few and far between in August. It was the only place we saw running water in 10 days! Maybe there is more colour outside the summer months. Very quite when we went around 4:30. Maybe because of",

          "OK, so firstly this isn't a plants man's garden but it is in a beautiful mountain setting and has many appealing trees and shrubs. You need time to absorb the peaceful atmosphere and relax. Also it's not cheap to get in so you need to spend time there to make it worthwhile.",
          "Visited with 5 year old son, nice activity for and hour or two at most, lots of shaded areas to cool off from the heat, also loved the alleyway with water fountains to run through. We got the Soller train to the gardens from Soller, stops right outside, so ideal.",

          "The gardens themselves are not particularly interesting being mainly palms and tropical trees interspersed with some agapanthus (this in July) but the pergolas and courtyard are stunning with bougainvillea and plumbago. The old stables and olive press are especially of interest",
          "A charming little place with some interesting buildings, plants and exhibitions. There were only half a dozen other people there (in June) so it had a really calm and tranquil feel to it. I imagine in the height of summer with a few tourist coaches it might feel a bit",

          "This does not look that enticing from the outside - but when you enter into the grounds and the house - the whole place becomes magical. It is so calm and peaceful. The caf\u00e9 is good (paper cups) but the toilets are the cleanest I have ever witnessed. It seems strange to go",

          "My wife and I visited this place and were both completely underwhelmed considering the high entrance fee (\u20ac6.50 when we visited). It's basically an OK but unremarkable garden with paths and water features (that all had stagnant water). There is a house and some other things to",
          "On the road from Palma to Soller, you reach a split where you can either pay to go through the tunnel or take the winding mountain road. Off to the side sits Jardines d'Alfabia. Dating from the time of the Arabic settlement of Mallorca, the gardens offer a lovely relaxing area",

          "Not somewhere to spend a whole day, but an excellent place to spend a few hours. This was our second visit, and it was just as good as the first. It's more of a house and garden than just gardens, although the house is quite small. The house is very interesting - the decoration",
          "Just paid another visit to the gardens and thought it worth mentioning that since our first visit six years ago they have been improved and restored - it is obviously a work in progress. I even liked them when they were overgrown and ramshackle, but now I think anyone with time",
          "At more than 30 degrees Celsius and 5 months without rain there was hardly any flowers in full bloom and the surrounding orange plantation looked quite burnt. The little bar at the centre of the garden had nothing to offer besides some beverages and over-priced salted nuts",

          "Very nice theme park, great 3 and 4D cinemasm nice mini golf, worth a visit. The splash park is for the small ones, but very nice. Prizes are okay, we love it everytime we go there",
          "I have been a few times now with all the family, and it's quite good (it's not a huge park, but good sized to spend a good whole day in it) kids love (and me too), has restaurants, really fun water park, good 4D cinema rides, and good collection of rides all around. Also has 2",
          "Been here 3 times! Great for kids/couples & family\u2019s. Fun day out with lots of things to do, defo worth going to when in maga. Upside down house is my favourite.",
          "It was the 1st time the children have been abroad and they loved it so much to do both day and evening",
          "When my son was younger, he dragged me here all the time. We had a wee drink there after going on the 3D seat ride. It was fantastic and I screamed the room down on each show we seen. I wouldn't recommend going on it if you have a sore back but it was worth it!!! Never really",
          "Had a great time. It were all trimmed up for Halloween, staff made a really great effort. Went in all attractions even though kids were to young. Upside down house really good, we went in twice . We bought VIP tickets which allowed us to go on as many times as we",
          "Nice hotel, friendly staff, room cleaning excellent, unfortunately restaurant manager was rude to us three times and we had to endure him being rude to other guests and staff during mealtimes.",
          "Kathmandu Park was small and there was like 5-6 attractions and we had to wait in lines for ahours. Golf was nice and new zombie 4d event. But haunted house was closed at 16 which wasn't said anywhere or given information about. Food was absolutely inedible, cold burger and I",
          "Would recommend to families. Stayed in the hotel and upgraded to gold play pass. Really good rides and amazing hotel",
          "We stayed nearby this place so decided to have a quick visit. Very nicely decorated and great fun for kids and big kids.",
          "Great and spooky.great moving seats Toilets immaculate.Lady called Renee always helpful with children Next year i bring my grandkids to Katmandu.",
          "My wife and I are mid 30's with no kids. Looking for something to do during the day is hard. Went and played crazy golf and had a good time. Will do it again. \u20ac12 each for 18 holes was a good value.",
          "As All-inclusive guests at the Resort, myself and my partner had a band which entitled us to enjoy certain activities and experiences within the Park, at no charge, throughout the length of our stay. We concentrated on the 'Dark Rides', 4D Cinema Screen orientated scenarios,",
          "Abit boring, we brought the standard ticket, you get 11 credits on the band and each ride is one credit, we went on 5 rides and found them all quite boring, they were all pretty much the same, didn\u2019t even use the rest of the credits as it was just too boring, very lovely staff",
          "We went to Katmandu Park one morning and had a lot of fun! First we went to The House where we laught a lot inside. We took a lot of pictures in each room where you can see very fun, strange and amazing things. After we visited a few attractions 4D! we liked a lot the Zombies",
          "Had a great day here. Mini golf was the highlight. Mainly for kids but adults can enjoy a day out here too",
          "OK start of trip from hotel was a quick drive on the bus my autistic lad found this drive rather therapeutic oddly listening to music on his phone whilst admiring the view, my 8yr old was nodding in and out, arrival at the park was quick and easy as those arriving from hotels",
          "this was a really good day out the 4 d rides were good as was the house and golf well worth the money",
          "Visited here yesterday with the hubby, would be great if you had little ones. Great indoor soft play and water park. We enjoyed it, especially the crazy golf.",
          "This was our 5th year coming here our boys love it. We payed to upgrade to VIP with unlimited drinks and 1 meal each. The park did not disappoint. We always do this trip with no frills and unfortunately this year we found the bus journeys to be way longer than normal (We stay in",
          "Staff really accommodating and friendly. We went end of season so wasn't a busy time. In a nut shell your passport ticket (wristband) gives you one go of every attraction in the park......11 entries in total ....but if you don't want to see every attraction you can use your",
          "Just back from 7 nights at this hotel. Facilities were amazing for kids (mine are 7 and 3). The pools were clean and not over crowded, theres a policy to stop sun loungers from being reserved so always places to sit down. The kids clubs run in the morning and afternoon and are",
          "This was the fourth time we've stayed here. Fantastic hotel, our son loves this place. Great choice of food and snacks. Really close to beach shops bars and clubs.",
          "We visited again the Katmandu Park and played Mini Golf, saw the 4D movie, visited the turned house, have been at the Splash Park and finally the Soft Play Adventure. It was great, the kids had so much fun and spent 5 hours there. We would have been stayed longer - for sure!",
          "I stayed with my 10 year old daughter in the Sol Katmandu hotel so we had free access into the park. The 4D rides are like the 4D cinema experience where you sit with the glasses on and feel like your inside the little movie which in Zombies you drive around and then crash and",
          "We bought tickets that allow you 11 rides/attractions. You can do all 11 on one day or go back a few days later. We did the crazy golf twice because it was so good.",
          "Visited with my wife and granddaughter (10) in August 2019. One tip, buy your tickets from your hotel, we saved \u00a316. One thing for sure, this ain't Disney but there again it doesn't advertise itself as such. No big rides, just 3/4D screens which for a 10 year old is exciting.",
          "A few 4d cinemas (3d glasses, small cinema screen and a vibrating seat that lasts 5 minutes each) and a tiny water park that gets boring after 10 mins. I'm so sorry to write a bad review but after the hype of it all it's so disappointing. It's worth \u00a315 each. But honestly. With",
          "Only did the Golf's which were great fun and well themed , if a little expensive both course are similar but the one to the right as you enter was a little harder could do with a little TLC but if your an adventure golf fan definitely pay a visit.",
          "Loved visiting here with our 2 boys it was like nothing they or me had done before the upside house was fantastic the kids were a little scared at first but soon got used to it and we went in twice. They loved the soft play and shooting clowns and zombies was a big hit with",
          "You can use your ticket / wrist band for two days if you don\u2019t see it all. Great value for money. Suits family\u2019s and couples definitely and plenty of things to do. Mini golf, 3/4D cinema, interactive games, etc. You could spend up to 3 hours here. Very enjoyable.",
          "For smaller children maybe but just thought for teenagers not great, the quality of their 3D and 4D cinemas not great to be honest, just feels tired and needing an upgrade. Crazy golf very good but we were limited to time. The upside down house was very good, I enjoyed that.",
          "Great visit for a day. We bought a day pass from an external ticket outlet for 20 euros, and it is good value at that price. Jose and Luis were very professional and made sure we had a good time.",
          "me, my wife and 10 yr old visited katmandu park whilst holidaying in alcudia, we had a fun day we had the vip pass so only spent money because me and the wife fancied a slush, we had unlimited drinks and also lunch included, the cues wasnt as bad as i thought they would be a day",
          "If your spending a few weeks in Mallorca like we did. A great day to do something different besides the beach",
          "Visited Katmandu whilst on holiday in Majorca in August 2019, using the package which includes food & drink. If you can, pay directly at the park as we booked through a travel rep and were charged well over what the on gate price is. However, the VIP pass is certainly worth it,",
          "Kids had a ball great for adults also you would easily spend a day here, only downside is they dont change the films the magic house and Jim and jet can get repetitive if you visit frequently",
          "They have a lot on for the kids during the summer time with kids clubs, soft play centre, splash centre and a kids pool. Please know that the rides are a one time only use and if you are a guest at the hotel with the one time only pass, that you will still need to purchase 40%",
          "Better than i thought it would be.We arrived at 11 to be picked up at 430 and that wasnt enough time to do everything.Really liked the upside down house and the rides we done,my boy loved the shoot em up zombie ride.Also we loved the 2 golf courses and the waterpark.You",
          "Me and my partner came here on our last day after we had ran out of things to do and needed to kill time and I wish we\u2019d done it sooner! We had been debating all week as we had looked online and it seemed a little odd (in comparison to British theme parks) and we weren\u2019t so",
          "Paid 94 Euros for 2 adults and 2 kids, save your money and time, found Zombies and Carnival the best, crazy golf was fun, rest is rubbish. For the price its very expensive. In the UK you would have a much better day at our theme parks. No onsite parking!",
          "Stayed at the hotel. Que too long, If you want to sweat like a pig for \u00a320 then go ahead. Looks tired, needs updating.",
          "Enough to do for a whole day, ques were not to bad for the time of year, good price not to expensive, my kids 6,7 and 17 loved the water park the best xx would deffo visit again",
          "My Granddaughter and I stayed at the Resort for 7 nights and full gold access to the park. If you are visiting for more than one night, I would urge you to do some rides in the evening when it less busy.If your children are the the outgoing type, they will have a ball. We",
          "Fantastic place and you can do each ride once so you can split the 6/7 activities over several days. Best prices are from the smaller operators",
          "Honestly haven't laughed or screamed in one day so much ever. Got the all inclusive, the food was great but avoid the wine! The rides are amazing and the staff funny and helpful. The house has to be done, too cool to describe! Allow a full day as we went around 1pm until 10pm",
          "We got the family vip passport with unlimited rides 2 adults, 2 kids (aged 10 and 13) We really enjoyed the park, we started off in the laser room, followed by a game of crazy golf and left the splash park until the end of the day. The house was probably our favourite part,",
          "Nice staff .fun place .kids love it ..some signage bit misleading ..ie pool times just go round and get in anytime it seems ...nice to cool off in the cold water great entertainment...some que jumpers try it on but just grin and bear it Haha",
          "Travelled in August so was pretty warm and this place was a nice refuge from the heat. Had 7&9 year old - their favourite part was the upside down house which has some pretty cool features. The splash park was good had a few slides and lots water threw around you but was great",
          "Came to Katmandu for a day trip with our four year old and had a great day out. Would definitely recommend.",
          "We were booked at the hotel so we had access to the park. We had lots of fun challenging each other on the 3D games such as Zombies, Desparado, Carnival. We visited the Upside down house a few times. We all enjoyed the 4D cinema and our children went many times.",
          "We visited in July. It was nice to have a theme park 10 mibs down ftom the hotel. In fact, we booked our trip taking this into consideration. The park was nit as large as we expected and caters for slightly older kids better.",
          "Good park with some good attractions. Could do with adding more stuff but the upside down house is cool.",
          "We visited Katmandu Park to cheer up my daughter after her holiday friend she made left the hotel before us. We brought the passport \u20ac29 euros adult and \u20ac22 euros children. You are able to visit all attraction once and there is 12. Most of the attractions are 4D, not suitable",
          "We have visited here a few times over the years. This year I paid approximately \u00a390 for a pass that included 11 attractions (2 adults 2 children, 7 and 13). I did have to pay adult price for my 13 year old. The house is pretty good but I felt that a lot had gone from in there",
          "After reading some reviews and the leaflet for Katmandu we decided to go ahead book some tickets. When we got there we did the house first, that was the best to be honest. The crazy golf was also very good with some challenging holes. The rest was a bit of a let down. A lot of",
          "Small park, fun for a half day for a family. The park was nice and clean. The negative part is that the food is horrible, for example the burger was like a hockey puck, so do eat before/after your visit the park. Best attractions is Desperado and Zombi. They also have a realy",
          "We went to this attraction after all the build up we had read online and in the brochure.It was very busy and the Upside down house was the best thing there.Lots to do and fun.That said the other attractions were all the same just different names.After queuing for 30 mins for",
          "Very small \u201camusement\u201d park consisting primarily of 4D cinemas. Do yourself a favor and tour the area before buying a pass. Consider only paying for the \u201cride\u201d you want.",
          "We purchased our VIP Passport through Jet2 before we travelled to Majorca. It includes access to all rides, upside down house, golf & unlimited soft drinks/beer & Sangria, plus a meal at the snack shack which was really nice, all for tea price of \u00a323 each. Well worth the money.",
          "Such a great a d magical place. Personally we only went on each attraction once, even though we paid for the unlimited rides. We were not staying locally, so if you are then it's probably worth it. A few of the attractions had problems, so we couldn't do everything. The crazy",
          "Had an entertaining day at this park this week. The rides were 4D virtual attractions that were suitable for everyone in our party (although I\u2019d think some were too scary for children under 10) We bought the VIP+ tickets which gave you passes to all attractions including the",
          "We went for the day and had a great time. The rides were mainly shooting games but all fun. The upside down house was terrific and the splash park was brilliant. Don't buy the all inclusive upgrade as the park is open and you can just go to the shops across the road.",
          "Took my 7 year old daughter here whilst on holiday a few days ago. She enjoyed the theme park but not the water park as it was just slides, nowhere to jump in etc. Lots of local children just pushing in at the top of slides & even parents pushing in to put their smaller children",
          "\"The House\" attraction is supposed to be some kind of fun house which failed miserably. It starts with a fake elevator ride that's supposed to scare the visitors that it's crashing and getting stuck with shaking floor, lights that go out and lots of noise and rumbling. Hell for",
          "We opted for the cheapest option for wristbands, passport. we loved the idea that the bands can be used over different days so didnt have to spend all day there, if you didnt want to. We came back day after day to pop in and go on a 4d experience, and also did the mini golf",
          "Alot of the attractions are indoors and instead of actual roller coasters it is 4d movies with seats that also move for further effects. Went with a 12 and 11 year old who both loved it. I do t think some of the attractions would be really suitable for kids under 8. We got the",
          "This is not a large park but there is plenty to do. you can do most activities in half a day but I would plan to be here for the day. We got the VIP passport which allowed us onto the attractions many times. The staff are friendly and helpful. Highly recommended and worth a",
          "We came here twice - once using the evening pass and once using the passport. I was with my two children ages 4 and 7. A few things worth mentioning - the staff are excellent, cheerful and helpful. Renee at laser game is brilliant with children and deserves huge credit for",
          "Not worth going- just 3d movies and a house with fun for the smallest children- water park was tiny and boring & the food was horrible- stay away",
          "This place was good fun. Lots of kid focused stuff but we enjoyed it, there was enough for adults to enjoy but more geared towards families. The house and 4D experiences were very good. MiniGolf was great too but we went peak summer there isn\u2019t much shade on the course so be",
          "Visited katmandu for a day out, the brouchers looked amazing, but not worth the money that we paid. We had purchased the all inclusive ticket for unlimited drink and food, but your only allowed one meal and there is no bottled water included in the soft drinks, therefore you",
          "Great day out! My boyfriend and I visited mainly for the golf but had a wander round the other attractions and I\u2019m so glad that we did. House was amazing and other attractions were exciting and well thought out. Staff were friendly and helpful. We spent a good 4/5 hours here and",
          "Half the things weren't opened so you'd be queuing, the best part is the house other attractions get boring, food isn't very nice .you can only open your locker once or else you will have to put a \u20ac1 in as the locker takes the coin they give you at reception which gets annoying",
          "A good park for families with golf as well , also fun things to do inside the house and 4s rides as well.",
          "We visited it with a day pass which gives entry to 11 attractions. Most of them were 3/4D cinemas. The Softplay was too full and also the Splashpark was not relaxing at all. Too many people, very loud and quite cold water, so that you just can't enjoy very long the slides, which",
          "Exactly as expected ........very busy , full of kids , but that\u2019s what it is supposed to be. The theme park was great apart from the lines and lack of staff ( we kept queuing only to find that particular one was closed ). Rooms ok , food ok.....but a \u2018cattle market\u2019 feel in",
          "We booked through our Thomas cook rep with transfers and had vip pass, so unlimited rides/attractions, drinks and one meal. Loved this place! 4yr old and 10yr old both enjoyed. We also done the water Park which is suitable for all ages! Although we found 1 hour in it was",
          "We went up after 5pm and got a discount. Good value as everything was included in the price. Went with two young children and they really enjoyed it.",
          "Very good for families. Good evening entertainment. Long queues for drinks. Food is average. Nice pool. Right in centre of Magaluf.",
          "We had a great day here, kids loved it, the upside down house was their favourite. We got our tickets across the road, was \u20ac75 for the family plus pass which meant we could go on the rides more than once. We actually only did the house more than once as we took our time going",
          "Great fun, we arrived at 11 and stayed until 16:30. Kids enjoyed everything, it\u2019s not that big but a lot of fun gathered at one place. Good with the splash park (well, one pool really), had changingrooms as well as big lockers to lock your valuables in (can fit a big backpack",
          "Visited this with our two grown up daughters. Had lots of fun shooting zombies, clowns and cowboys. Cooled off in the splash zone then a round of adventure golf. Had lunch which is limited to burgers etc but served promptly and a reasonable quality. Overall I would recommend",
          "We visited Katmandu Park and stayed in the hotel for a week all inclusive. We had a family room, which is just a standard room with a sofa bed, but it was the cheapest option so we got what we paid for. The only comment I would make on this is if it was sold as a family room it",
          "nice staff, great crazy golf x 2, lots of 4D and 5D experiences, smaller than we thought but just the right amount of time to get round them and grab a spot of lunch as well. opted for the plus package witj food and unlimited drinks, well worth it on a hot day",
          "I visited katmandu on Tuesday with family and 5 young children. We had a deal through our tui rep which made katmandu sound amazing, however when we got there and started going on things and looking around we were soon disappointed. There are not rides to go on so it\u2019s not a",
          "I brought my little boy who's 6 there in early June. The park is quite small but very enjoyable. The park consists of a large fun house which is very interactive for kids. There are several 3d interactive video game areas next to the fun house which u compete with other people.",
          "Was good what we saw but I was taken lll after 30 mins had to leave. They let us transfer to following day but I was too ill to go back disappointed they didn\u2019t give us a few days to do it !!",
          "Played mini golf here, slightly more expensive then in Palmanova but really nice course. We played 18 but can play more for a few more euros!",
          "We visited Katmandu with our 4 year old, in short it was an expensive waste of a day for us. The facilities were aver age but getting there was a nightmare - do not use No Frills Tours. We were sold an 8 hour day only for it to turn into a 10 hour day with over half of this on",
          "We wans't sure if we should go there, because I'm 18 and my brother has 15. We've even asked at reception in Katmandu and they told us its perfect for teenagers.. It was not. Only the house was interesting but rest was just shows for little kids, even the aquapark they told us",
          "just finished 10 day half board stay with my 2 year old and hubby. all in all great hotel with just a few negatives pics for rooms misleading. ours was a katmandu family room. didn't appear to be newly decorated but wasn't shabby. not alot if storage space at all for 3 people",
          "We decided to go to Katmandu Park as a result of picking up a leaflet while checking into our hotel, so glad we did. Firstly got a discount by getting the tickets at our hotel. The park was only 20 minutes walk away and the attractions were great. A couple of them I decided were",
          "Spent the day shooting holes on crazy golf, zombies and crazy clowns. Had some fun with the family whilst on a short break to Majorca. Not a bad place, but, food & drinks expensive and not much choice. If you like burgers or hot dogs fill your boots but that's about it ! Fun",
          "It was great fun doing the mini golf at the Katmandu park. Very good fun. The loos were a bit dirty which is why it isn't excellent.",
          "We visited with our 2 children are 8 and 10. We bought VIP passes and upgraded at gate to include all drinks and 1 meal. This is worth it as they are expensive to buy on the park. Saw a few with picnics which is also fine if you can carry it or leave in the lockers provided. We",
          "Lovely place to come for a day. Was rainy day, so we wer everywhere except aqua park, slides. Really recommend to visit:)",
          "We purchased tickets which allowed us to go back to the park every day a go on the rides on different days. ( you can only go on any ride once, but you can spread these rides over several days). Our grandson (9 years old) and us enjoyed all the rides and activities.",
          "Amazing family Day out. You can easily spend a Day here and not run out of things to do. The house, the waterpark, crazy golf and all the 4D rides. Kids loved it and so did my wife and I. Get the VIP + passport and get a meal included with unlimited drinks (beer,wine or a soft",

          "This was our second visit having been a few years ago. The house is worth it and good fun, as is the adventure golf. The 3D and 4D rides get a bit samey after awhile and they could do with replacing a couple with something a bit different.",
          "Visited with family and enjoyed the splash park especially. There is a lot to do and the cinema style shooting games were very good",
          "We visited Katmandu as a excursion pack with TUI at the hotel we was staying at this place is great there are things for everyone to do you can leave you children in sofa play and do the things they don't like and there safe there as they wear alarmed vests so if they try to",

          "It's mainly 4d rides with a strange upside down house. We paid for this as part of our stay at the resort but guess it would be good value for younger children.. some rides are 9+ and rightly so as they are a little scary for littlies.",
          "To be kept in a queue to see an attraction with two young children (under 10) for 1 hour and 20 minutes and then told the attraction is closed, no apology is totally unacceptable. It was freezing cold (Easter) and a staff member kept on saying 10 more minutes, 20 more minutes",
          "We visited with 3 children 11, 10 and 8 years old. The staff were all very friendly and made sure they explained in English as well as Spanish for us. The staff at the bar as you enter were great. Most of the activites follow same type of theme such a an interactive shoot em",
          "Took the kids here. It\u2019s small compared to most theme parks but it serves its purpose. On entry you will enter the upside down house which is full off many surprises! The fun part is you can go again! Outside the house there are loads to do from 4d cinema experiences,",
          "I'm so glad this was here, the weather in majorca was terrible, their was loads for the kids to do and the adults had fun as well.",

          "The weather was pretty bad when we were on holiday so we needed something for the kids to do. We really enjoyed the park. The House was really unusual and interesting, the 4D cinemas were good and the soft play was well run with lots of things to do with a separate area for the",
          "Having gone there for many times, before entering my son was hungry. So i bought him a hotdog at the katmandu\u2018s. The sausage was ineatable. The chef didn\u2018t care. After a mild complaint at the entreance while buying the tickets, the clerk was listening carefully and said they",
          "We booked this trip through Thomas Cook rep. Took an hour drive from cala dor. The park was easy to navigate round and the staff are friendly. The hotel looks great especially for families. I would definitely recommend this. We spent 6 hours here.",
          "Having been recommended by a bar server on the Magalluf beach front we decide to go. Excited after booking and looking on the website the activities seemed great but there was no warning that the majority of the activities are a minimum 40 min wait to get in! Having only gone",
          "Visited as part of a Tui excursion from our hotel in Cala Bona. Had a wonderful time at the park despite the windy weather during April. The mini golf courses are lots of fun but do take up quite a lot of time as they were very busy. Not anybody's fault but just take time to",
          "Highly recommended for children 7 years upwards in my opinion but absolutely no way for younger. My 3 year old was beyond petrified of the house and had to get out after minutes. Waterpark is ice cold in April so beware and soft play is sectioned under 5s and over 5s which is",
          "We went here just to play the golf, Lots of fun on a superb course, Will definitely be playing next time we are in Magaluf, Open to the public.",
          "Went on a very windy cold day, the house is ok but waited 40 mins per ride which were ok but mostly disappointing. Staff do not give our much info and as far as I can see the rides are all a cinema or simulation. A lot of money for very little.",
          "We went last Thursday and it was great fun. You can use all attractions as many times as you want, which makes it a great value for money. We loved paying golf, and we played for nearly 2 hours, with no rush and good fun. Highly reccomended!",
          "I visited the Park with my husband and kids (3 and 6 year old). House is ok, soft play area small. Park not run properly. We waited 1 hour on a cold windy weather, only to be told that the Magic house attraction was not working. Kids were really upset and cold. Save the money",
          "Waste of money, booked & paid to go for the day, it\u2019s just shows that you wait hours to get into, golf is heaving. House is ok but never worth the money.",
          "We travelled from Alcudia to Magaluf for the day just to go to Kathmandu park. An 8 hour day of which 3 hours was travelling cost me over \u00a3100 for 2 adults and 1 child. The upside down house was much of nothing, the 4d experiences accepted 16 people every 20 minutes which meant",
          "Great day trip. I took my 5 yr old There were a couple of rides with 9 yr old recommendations but it didnt effect our trip. My daughter loved it here and was highlight of holiday. A massive soft play with great security so you can relax without worrying your child may get",
          "Katmandu - was ok but what they didn't tell us was that some stuff was recommended for 9+ which wasnt good for us as we had a 6 and an 18 month. Splash pool was great along with soft play, our daughter loved the golf, we paid for the all inclusive as it was hot and we could go",
          "Very expensive for what it is. Defo not a theme park. Has a splash zone and several 4d rides/cinema and a mini God course. Not a full day out. Just a morning or afternoon and as I said expensive for what it is",
          "Loads to keep the children occupied, we played mini golf everyday. The upside down house is really good too",
          "Kids running all over the park , staff let them do it . When we stopped and asked for a refund they refuses. Stay away people over charging for what it is.",
          "We came here and really enjoyed it. It is somewhere I have always wanted to go and I have heard good things about it. It was expensive but didn\u2019t disappoint. The upside down house was really fun and a perfect way to start the day at Katmandu. I would go again but with children",
          "We spent an entire day at this local Santa Ponsa Park, and can say it was \"okay\" or fine for the kids, but not much going on for the adults, and the food not very good. We were a large group of 11 people, and the kids had a smile on their faces the entire time, so I suppose it",
          "Visited during October half term, most rides are 3D cinema style attractions, enough to do for a half day visit, and the soft play and upside down house were fun too. Quite expensive but I got a 2 for 1 offer, having played mini golf in palma nova by using a voucher, which made",
          "I went to Katmand\u00fa Park some time ago. I am a theme park lover, so I found it really interesting to have that sort of plans at the island. You can experience new digital technologies and themed architectures, and have a great time with your friends or family. Its price was very",
          "Themeing looks very nice but after that all your paying for is cheap 3d/4d simulator experiences and wait times can be very long , the only thing really worth the cost is the house & kids play areas Didn\u2019t try the water park but that looks good My top tip would be to get a",
          "Lots to do food plentiful and we'll cooked rooms clean and tidy kids night entertainment a little shabby but passable.",
          "We visited Katmandu when it first opened and there was just the museum, which was really interesting. We visited the museum (house) this time and there was not as much to see. The focus seems to be in the rides which were all 4D simulator / rides and were quite repetitive. Too",
          "we stopped at this place and had a really good 18 hole game of crazy golf there are two too choose from. we had a real laugh. there are plenty of other things to do at this attraction especially if your with the family.",
          "We loved our holiday here...the staff are amaxing and attention to detail in all areas is fantastic fir the price and size of the hotel...our waiters remembered our drinks daily despite 100s of other guests...more suited to younger children given pools and entertainment however",
          "Hours of fun for both adults and children. We ended up walking to the park as our hotel was only 10mins away, my daughter had an amazing time on the water slides and in the play areas.",
          "We visited here as we were told we got a discount as we stayed at a sol hotel near by even with the discount it's pricey we chose to do the mist expensive one with the food and drink included and unlimited goes on the attractions. The house is brilliant and we had lots of fun in",
          "As good as this place is, If visiting buy a pass for all attractions. Paying seperetly will leave you very disappointed.",
          "Visited on a girly weekend with my mother in law and sister in law, it was raining in the morning so the hotel recommended we visit katmandu. We were not sure what to expect as it was looking like it was for kids but what a great time we had!! The house was hilarious, illusion",
          "We had a good time here first week of October with our two young children. I think they were actually a bit too young but we all enjoyed it. Plenty of places to eat outside the park and you can easily go in and out as you please - I recommend walking to the beach for lunch.",
          "This was a spur of the moment thing for us - as the weather had taken a turn and rain was forecast - I might add we were a group of 9 adults age 57 plus ! And what a great day we had - we laughed from start to finish - what a fantastic place - for young and old - the ques",
          "I am sure there is quite a place for the kids, but after arriving I was dissapointed by the size of it. I mean... it is definitely a day trip but mostly because of all the queues that going on there. Without the queue- 3 hours tops. The advantage is there is plenty of places to",
          "Never been to anywhere like this before but we actually had a great family day out here during October half term. A nice sunny day, no queues, clean and tidy (not sure id come in the height of summer as it would be very hot and crowded). We weren\u2019t entirely sure what to expect",
          "Me and my partner visited recently. I loved it, the adventure golf is great, clean and varied. The 3D rides, particularly the Asylum are really good fun. The house was great, we were walking around giggling like kids. Drinks are reasonably priced I paid \u20ac5 for a small beer",
          "Good value for money. Clean and good entertainment. Kids really enjoyed themselves. Trip advisor forcing me to use 100 characters so I have just typed this last sentence.",
          "This is my second visit. I went last year with my 10 and 14 year old boys. That time we enjoyed the climbing frame so we came back again only to find it's been removed and been replaced with a bike ride for youngsters. The whole park is aimed at younger kids so, without the",
          "Went here last week with my wife, grandson and daughter. The queues were not great hence i have only given it 4 stars. The attractions are great fun. The house is a great weird out experience and the rides are virtual 4D type rides. Some are shoot em ups. The longest queues",
          "Tbh I\u2019m feeling a little underwhelmed having been told how brilliant this park is, for what there is it\u2019s expensive & we completed this all in a few hours. Water park was closed & too old for the play area. We paid \u20ac12.50 for all inclusive- I wouldn\u2019t bother the food was",
          "We stayed four nights in the hotel which included the theme park. I must admit my son loved the park and had wanted to go to KAtmandu for the past couple of years, the house was fantastic. Arrive as near to 10am to save the queues, the rides can be very much alike but as my son",
          "This was my second time here, the first being 5 years ago. I was a bit disappointed to see the Katmandu house was the same and nothing had been added but if it was your first time you would enjoy it more. There is a lot more to do than just the house with a on site water park,",
          "Was looking at things to do with 3 year old and found Kathmandu...bit pricey but had few activities. Unfortunately the water park closed the day after we arrived and it didn\u2019t mention anywhere in website when ordering tickets on day we arrived - would have thought they would",
          "Arrived Mon 15/10/2018 lunchtime, began arranging weeks activities, only to find out from an other guest on the tues, that the water park had closed for the session on Sunday 14/10, VERY poor communication from staff,and a very disappointed 8 yr old grand daughter to console.",
          "Went here today with my partner and t year old and 4 month old daughter. Although the attractions where good they were all the same 4d cinemas. We paid \u20ac110 euros to get in and there are only about 6 things to do so I'm very annoyed at the amount this cost as after 2 hours you",
          "We booked a VIP day ticket for two, which means unlimited visits to the different attractions. There are some great illusion type attractions in the \u2018upside down house\u2019. Then there are different attractions in separate buildings, most of which are a 4D cinema type experience,",
          "Not as big as i imagined but good day out we stayed at hotel.upside down house fun nice park for young kids the 3d rides were good we went a few times had fun",
          "We bought the passport std ticket online, \u20ac27 adult \u20ac20 child, we went 1 day did all virtual stuff, the house is great fun! then went back the day after & did the splash pool, mini golf & soft play, great day both days! Our 1&3 year old loved everything! Free transfer from",
          "Usually not a negative person here, but my god was this park such a waste of money and time... Guns to the rides work half the time, people push in queues and staff do nothing about it, there was a fire drill on our day of visit which I don\u2019t usually mind, but one ride we queued",
          "We got the Passport ticket (do all attractions once) and I reckon it was enough for us adults and our 6-years olds. Teenagers might want to do somethings more than once. It\u2019s fun: my favorites are haunted mines virtual ride and bandits shooting. Upside-down house is entertaining",
          "I went with my family last month and we recommend it. It has a lot of different spaces and activities, for all ages, and I found the place and control at the Katlantis Soft Play one of the best I have ever seen. The staff are friendly and helpful. I\u00b4m thankful to Marian, who",
          "We really enjoyed ourselves but our 3 year old didn\u2019t he was terrified from we entered until we left. The upside down house is really weird and funny. 5d screens r fantastic I highly recommend the asylum very creepy. We went all inclusive 55 Euro for adults and 38 children this",
          "I wouldn\u2019t even listen to all the negative feedback about this park, it\u2019s fantastic !! I\u2019m 24 and I still had an amazing day. From shooting bandits and zombies, to 5D cinemas roller coaster chairs, crazy golf which they spent 3 millions euros on, upside house with rooms on",
          "Come to this hotel last year and was amazing how fabulous it was my daughter loved every minute of are stay the things this hotel has for children is outstanding the staff are very friendly and are there to help every second of the day rooms are very clean and tyde totally",
          "Back from another fab holiday in magaluf. Hotel is lovely but the reception staff are rude and arrogant. Asking politely for a late check out prepared to pay the 40\u20ac (plus we are gold melia card holders) as our flight was midnight and we knew there were lots of empty rooms not",
          "Came here with my family and what a waste of bloody money it was, nothing but ques and waiting, ques and waiting! The park is about the same size as my garden and so bloody expensive for tickets etc can literally see everything in about 10 minutes if it wasnt for 30-40 minute",
          "Took over an hour to get some food which was then served cold and the attractions were rubbish and the waterpark was for small children only. Waste of a day out. Wouldn't recommend. #KatmanDONT!!!",
          "We visited here just to kill some time as our dolphin boat trip was cancelled due to weather, and we were pleasantly suprised. We bought wristbands so visited all attractions apart from the water area and soft play area. The house was well presented with some jumps and",
          "I was Really looking forward to going to this place all holiday, But to be honest I wish we saved our money. Very expensive considering you only get to do everything once!! I didn't know that until after I'd paid. The Laser shooting rides are Very fun and we did enjoy them but",
          "Had a really good time here. We got the all inclusive wristband which gave us all one go in every attraction. They were all fun but my favourites were the crazy golf and the upside down house. The lady looking after the house, Renee I think she was called was lovely. She was",
          "First visit to this theme park and to be quite honest we did enjoy what was on offer, the expedition golf is really good the cinematic rides are also quite good very different I recommend buying the vip ticket as individual rides can be expensive, food was very tasty but the",
          "Had a good fun time in the park, queues were not too long so didn't have to wait longer than 15 mins. Lots to do and see', great 3/4 D rides, crazy golf was fun, and the house itself was good especially a room where it made you feel totally un co-ordinated! Good day out!",
          "We received a 2 day pass free when booking Our holiday and it was so good we done the 2 days. Kids loved it. Adults did too. We had no idea what to expect from it and it was brilliant. The house had to be our fave. The not knowing what was in the next room was so exciting. The",
          "We had a fab day here the house is great full of weird and wonderful things then there is all the rides and although the queues were quite long we got on all of them. We also played the crazy golf which is great fun although it was so hot on the day we visited that we were glad",
          "My husband and I played crazy golf here and it was brilliant the staff were really great and helpful would definitely recommend a visit",
          "I loved this place and so did my son it was a fun day out. I can imagine peak season it\u2019s not too pleasant and big queues due to only 16 people being allowed per showing but this time of year it\u2019s bliss and quite quiet. The attractions are well thought out and excellent mini",
          "Great water slide park, good crazy golf. And weird but fun 4d shooting games and 4d short cartoon films. We all enjoyed it.",
          "My friend and I visited the park Tuesday. It was so much fun took a walk in the upside down house. The other attractions were brilliant including the 4D theatre where it felt like we were on a rollercoaster. There was even a crazy golf course. I would recommend it to my other",
          "Overall it doesn t worth the 29 euro fee per person for the package of entertainment that they supply,be careful if it s raining outside it s very sllipery, i felt down once, injured my knee!",
          "There is a feeling about this park that reminds me of Disney. Clearly, a lot of effort has gone into making this an interesting and immersive environment. My partner and I had great fun in the upside down house which was very interactive and interesting. I had great fun beating",
          "Great fun ...we got the passport pass... they are \u20ac29 but you can use over a few days .... mini golf is so much fun and they have people in costume hiding in certain areas to jump out ... was very funny and so much entertainment.",
          "Although weird, Katmandu is a lot of fun. There's tonnes of activities for all the family so would recommend a visit.",
          "Great value , we really enjoyed it and the mini golf is great fun , you can split your pass over a few days",
          "Aged 22-30, went as looked good and exceeded expectation. We purchased unlimited access tickets which made walking around easy and meant we could go on certain things as many times as we wanted. Perfect for bad weather as you can queue under shelter. We ended up spending most",
          "We spent 4/5 hours here and loved every minute. We all loved all of the rides/experiences and were also able to return later on in the day to play a round of mini golf. Food was ok but would not recommend.",
          "We enjoyed all the attractions that we had time to visit the youngest in our group was nearly 2 the oldest was 42 and there is something for everyone. There is only 1 place to get your food and drink from so you always have a long wait the food and drink is very very expensive",
          "We visited of an evening. Fun park although most activities are 3D movie based. Crazy golf on site. Food stopped at 5pm which was disappointing.",
          "Visited here yesterday 2 adults and 2 year old...80 odd euros for the vip passport which gives you unlimited access and a meal and unlimited drinks. Seriously wouldn\u2019t bother with it once is enough on each attraction as they are mostly the same and the food is very bad! Chicken",
          "If you enjoy watching movies in 4D and motion, Katmandu it's a great place for you, whether you are shooting bandits while riding a horse, or visiting a scary asylum, your will fill great the entire time. And in the end if you visited all the attractions, you can relax at the",
          "Best show iv see in years a must see if visiting kids loved every minute of it food and drinks great ro",
          "Visited Kathmandu while on holiday. My husband and our youngest son spent the day here. It is well worth a visit. The 4D rides are great fun. Our son liked the outdoor water area. It dies not get too full as they are timmed sessions avoiding over filling of the area. Great idea.",
          "We did the day pass for 12 euros. Great value - did the house, mini golf and the rides. Combined its a least 50 euro worth of activities. Superb value - great fun. Child friendly but a lot to do still for adults. Worth heading out to.",
          "We came here for my daughters fourth birthday. After telling her how much a big girl she was imagine our horror when she was told she was too little for the main section of soft play but had to go into the smaller section. The second my daughter walked in she burst into tears",
          "Had a really good time here and our tickets allowed us to come back the following day to finish what we hadn\u2019t done. We came back to do the soft play and my daughter is 110cm but they wouldn\u2019t allow her into the bigger part, they said she was just under the height, I was happy",
          "We went as a family of 5 with children 5 & 7. We struggled to see everything because of the queues but I guess that's school holidays for you. We upgraded ourwrist bands to all inclusive which was worth it to go into attractions more than once & to save on drinks but the food is",
          "Katmandu Park should be advertised as suitable for kids aged 12 or under, as our experience would back this opinion up fully. The water park is small and there are very limited slides for older children, in fact there were very few kids over twelve in the park apart from",
          "Lots of things to do that are different to normal theme parks. We thoroughly enjoyed it and happy to pay the price they charge.",
          "Book whilst on holiday via hotel. on the whole this was very enjoyable my 6 year old granddaughter thoroughly enjoyed it. particularly impressed with how they managed queues and entry to attractions! We didn't wait too long for anything and the entrance to splash park and indoor",
          "Outstanding experience especially with kids they will really have fun there are food services ice cream ...",
          "We booked this via our tour provider before we travelled and it was reasonable value. The house is great and exciting even for the adults, but sadly it sort of stops there for anyone over the age of 10. The \u201crides\u201d are actually 4D simulators which are basically the same, but",
          "Good day out Got kids free tickets with golf Fantasia Queues long Good fun for the family Good selection of bars outside for lunch ect",
          "Brilliant place to visit something for all ages queues diohave too long to wait. Well worth the money it's. Must to visit",
          "Came here with some younger friends, but actually had a good day. Ended up costing a bit more than thought it would. The upside down house is so good, the water park was a bit smaller than we thought too. Must be even better for kids.",
          "The upside down house was brilliant, had 2 hours at the waterpark, thought it was going to be alot bigger, as our own hotel had just as much, but not as high. Grand daughter went in the play centre while we sat and waited. We then played crazy golf which we all enjoyed. My only",
          "this place is suppose to be kid friendly, simply not true over priced, terrible service , food is appalling,the pools and water are not maintain to a standard that is accseptable, no children on the crazy golf under 14 with out an adult, who also has to pay just to accompany",
          "We booked through our hotel, the price was lower than the original if purchasing at the park! My only criticism would be you do need all day to get around it all and it\u2019s a shame the splash pool and soft play close early we had to choose one or the other so opted for splash",
          "We absolutely loved the whole experience at Kathmandu- wacky, wonderful, thrill seeking, not experienced anything like this before. Our Kids (5&8), loved the whole experience and are still talking about this 7 days later to friends relatives. 4d experience great, golf,",
          "Went here with my hubby,son who is 17 and our friends...it was a fab day the 6d cinema were fantastic...like all theme parks the queues were big and a lot of standing about but there is always shade while waiting...we didn't eat in there.3 cokes were 6.60 euros....upside down",
          "What a really good day out for all the family One tip is to buy the upgrade at desk when checking in to unlimited drinks which includes a main meal which is really good . Lots of rides and 4d cinema experiences , Staff are lovely and helpful . Splash world is good lots to do",
          "We opted for the all inclusive ticket which included a meal and unlimited drinks which was definitely worth it. We loved the water area and the 4D experiences. We didn't get to experience the Magic House as the queue was too long and limited numbers are allowed in at any one",
          "Visited here with my Fianc\u00e9 & 4 Year Old Son - Our Hotel was a 5 minute walk away. We had a Great, Fun day out here. It\u2019s not a \u2018Theme\u2019 Park as such, more attraction type things to do but all throughly enjoyable. The Mini Golf was really great, spotlessly clean all around. Your",
          "It\u2019s so hot here during the daytime so a later arrival might be advisable. Rides and the magic house all good fun, as well as the two crazy golf courses. The Zombies ride was particularly exciting, six year old daughter was fine in there, we didn\u2019t go on all the rides and you",
          "We brought our tickets via Jet 2 Holidays before we travelled. We got a taxi to the park from Sol Barbados hotel for \u20ac5 for 4 people. We arrived just after 10am and exchanged our paper ticket for wristbands at the upside down house. We went in the house first, which our 7",
          "If your expecting a \u2018theme park\u2019, do not come here. Arrived with 8 & 6 year old expecting a theme park which this is definitely not! It\u2019s basically a hotel with activities for children. Very small and not worth money paid. Very disappointing",
          "18 fantastic holes of mini golf. One of the best mini golf courses I\u2019ve played - many crazy designs and challenging holes. \u20ac11 per adult is worth it and would definitely recommend. Will return to play if I go back to the area again.",
          "Had a decent discount on entry due to the hotel we was staying in. Hotel Sol Palmanova, entry was very quick and easy First stop was the Katmandu House, with 4 adults and 2 children in our party it really did cater for all ages, very interactive and fun for all the family. We",
          "Expensive unless All Inclusive . Best to go early evening when the public aren't in there. Fun house good.",
          "9 of us visited here from age 8-38. The upside down house is brilliant and the splash park was really good (but only open for 2 hour intervals). Bought the all inclusive passes which was 1 lunch each and unlimited beer and pop. This is worth the money in the heat. Did not go to",
          "This was a nice park. You can pretty much finish it in one day as it only has 10 attractions. The upside down house was particularly nice so was the mini golf. The rest is mainly 4D experience which is great if you have young children. Overall recommended for a day experience",
          "Our visit was the 3rd year we had been and I have to say the worst, one that will make me never to return. There were 6 adults and a 2 year old in our group. The house has not changed much at all but in my opinion the best attraction of them all. The golf is good but",
          "We visited while on holiday in Palma nova, it was only a short walk down Magaluf beach. The tickets for the 4 of us was about 92 euros, but there was a option to Upgrade when we got there for a extra 12 euros each & it\u2019s worth doing this!! The upgrade includes unlimited drinks,",
          "This park is very different to a typical theme park with roller-coasters and rides. It\u2019s not what I was expected but it turned out to be a very fun family day-out, as only I and my brother only like rides. We bought an All-inclusive ticket so lunch and unlimited drinks were",
          "We visited here on the 3rd of July. There was 4 adults and 4 kids. We went with no frills which I would definitely recommend. We booked V.I.P tickets and you get unlimited drinks both soft drinks tea coffee and local beer spirit and wine and a meal each. This is well worth the",
          "This is our third time here now and each time it has expanded. We enjoyed all the rides and the magical house exhibit although times inbetween the rides could be better managed. Golf course is fantastic bit is very very warm in the sun and with little shade it can be an",
          "We went with 2 adults and 3 children, although one was classed as an adult. Aged 8, 11 and 14. We booked through our tui rep and got a deal which included food, unlimited entry for the day and unlimited drinks, as well as locker tokens. Everyone had fun, ques weren't too long. I",
          "I have visited this place over the weekend with my almost 6 yr old son and we loved it! The truth is I don't have what to compare it with because this was our first fun park, however the experience was really great. We loved the Magic House, we had no idea what to expect and it",
          "No other words to describe this park, normally I try and be subjective but what a load of rubbish. The asylum.... what was that...! Nothing asylum about it. Zombies is just sitting in a chair shooting a 3D screen. Got better experience from 4XD cinema back in the Uk. The place",
          "great day out, plenty of laughter, rides are fun, I like the session times for the splash zone so everybody gets to go in. the upside down house Is amazing. caf\u00e9 food was good and with a day ticket this comes at a good price",
          "We have just had THE best holiday the kids loved especially the daily rangers activities with Carlos and Caesar who do an amazing job at keeping them safe in the sun and occupied with so much energy and enthusiasm it\u2019s infectious. Tyla and Beau both cried when having to leave",
          "Two families with teenage kids (13, 14 and 16) enjoyed themselves very much at Katmandu. There was a good mixture of stuff to do, free parking v close and super friendly staff. There weren't too many people there either, so we really didn't have to wait for long to do whatever",
          "Excellent well worth a visit buy passpot band better to spread the days We went to water park a few times as granddaughter was not old enough to do the zombies",
          "Only 15 minute walk from Sol Palmanova hotel where we are staying so ideal location. Party of 3 adults and 2 kids ages 7 and 10. We chose to buy an everything pass (not vip) where we could go on everything once. The vip passes allows you to go more than once on things. Started",
          "The water park is great fun for the kids only thing i would say kids and adults pushing and bunking no staff to stop it. 2 hours in the water park but includes getting dried no one can enter till the last batch is out so you could end up 20 mins late in. The soft play looks like",
          "BGreat place for everyone you can buy tickets do some rides and come back next day or different.the upside down house is a must then go crazy golfing,really worth the money and visit",
          "If you want to stimulate your mind well bend it a bit this is a great place to go good all round fun buy online before you go if you don't get bank charges",
          "some reviews say, it's for small kids, too overpriced, etc etc. My family loved it, from small to big! Perhaps we're big kids, but then, you're on holiday. The food wasn't gourmet, granted, but the water park was brilliant and the various attractions are indeed different.",
          "Staying in Santa Ponsa. Had option of booking visit through TUI but chose one of those ticket sellers at the main roundabout. Had a taxi option - go and leave at your convenience for the same price. TUI had set times for pickup and collection by bus. Katmandu Park has done",
          "Some of the rides had an electrical fault the day we came. We were sat round for an hour in the queue before the staff decided to send us away. We decided to keep our passes and come back another day. Good job we were staying close by because I don\u2019t think the option of a refund",
          "Bought a passport. Got a free child voucher by playing golf at Fantasia in Palma Nova Water park good and well lifeguarded. The house was very cool on a hot day and had some good attractions inside. Asylum ride not suitable for under 12s and our 12 year old was a bit",
          "Dont go, to much money for what it is! Its not even a park. You Will not be happy! For the kids club you Will need to buy socks for your children. Every attraction is open at a certain time or time frame. The electricity was out and we had to wait an hour. Overall it was bad bad",
          "We booked to meet up with friends. We had paid for the vip tickets and in total for 5 of us \u00a3160. The 4d shows are on every 40 minutes and only a small amount of people allowed in each time. The splash park is suited for small children so after queuing for ages and needing to",
          "Recommend buying the VIP pass as you have unlimited drinks. You get a meal and unlimited use of the attractions.",
          "First off, I know it\u2019s aimed at children around 9 years of age but it said it had a splash park, soft play area and some cinema rides for under 9s so we decided to buy the vip tickets. The splash park was very crowded when we went and only had a couple of small slides for",
          "Went for day trip from Alcudia. Loved the upside down house although it terrified 4 year old grandchild. We had two small children with us so they loved the water park (small and only for young children but they loved it). Paid a lot for what we got really. We only managed three",
          "Our grandsons can't wait to return next year, and to be quite honest us grandparents loved it too! Well done to all the lovely staff",
          "The upside down house was a hit for my 7 and 9 yr old. We also enjoyed the mini golfing and the 4D. The water park was really good and fun for this age.",
          "This park stands out from other amusement parks by not having rides and carousels. Most of the activities are 4D movies/activities. The park is more suited for older kids. Some of the themes are horror, desperados, asylum and if you have younger children they probably don\u2019t",
          "Nice fun place lots to do - best idea is get a wrist band far cheaper and use it for the week - works out at under half price",
          "Really disappointed. Four of us visited, on entry we choose to take advantage of the extra \u00a312.50 per person for inclusive drinks and lunch. Which seemed like good value. The 4 d rides were really tame and a bit rubbish to be honest. The day we visited they had several power",
          "Bought reduced price tickets from our hotel, when we arrived they were dealing with a power cut but very quickly got things up and running. We didn't take full advantage of all of the activities, we did the House, which my 9 year old was a bit scared of at first, it's a bit dark",
          "We saw loads of adverts for trips to Katmandu and bought tickets not really knowing what it was. Great day, got hot in the sun waiting for rides, should have worn hats. Crazy golf was hilarious, I was rubbish! Not only for kids, loads for adults too. We had a great day, shame",
          "Very good, but all attractions were too scary for our 5-year old child, including the pool slides. Though the 8-year old daughter was having fun. Most tireful was waiting in ques in the sun, although water spray fans are helpful.",
          "Had a good day out here. Plenty to do including a fun house, splash park, crazy golf, indoor play area for little ones and lots of 4d rides for the whole family. Does get very hot in summer as there\u2019s not much shade while waiting for rides. Worth paying the extra for unlimited",
          "Enjoyed our day at Katmandu. Just enough to do for a day out, not too crowded and suitable for young children.",
          "We stayed in alcudia and booked a day trip to katmandu. So glad we did it's a great day out. Lots to do for kids. We spent few hours in the water park. The giant bucket is so fun. Slides are great. Then we went on the rides and had lunch. Very fun packed busy day definatly go",
          "We loved the park!!! Kids will go over and over all day..and we enjoyed it too. Los bandidos was our preferred",
          "Fantastic would definitely go back. Splash park fab. Motion rides brilliant upside down house great went a couple of times would recommend.",
          "We arrived around 10.30 am , parking in the area was good. We had VIP passes which are worth it, as you can go on anything unlimited times. There is lots for kids and adults to do. There is a soft play , mini water park , 2 mini golf courses plus lots of 4D cinema things and 4D",
          "We visited here with our family of 5, 9 year old, 15 year old & 16 year old. We had the turbo pass which only gets you on things once so went for VIP upgrade at an extra 12\u20ac50c which entitles you to unlimited juice & lunch which is well worth it as it is 3\u20ac for a juice. All the",
          "Great fun, worth the entry fees. We actually spread our visit over two days due to time constraints and did some of the attractions over both days. The 4d games were a lot of fun, all of us including the adults enjoyed them. From the games, the house, the mini golf, soft play",
          "So we were planning to do the whole park but decided to do the golf before we left instead.... The staff were so friendly and helpful. We approached the entrance and were guided round to tickets, where we found the most helpful of staff! He spotted our daughter had a birthday",
          "This is not a theme park in the typical sense. There are no rollercoasters or rides as such. A few 4D experiences and a very average upside down house. Splash park ok but small. Quite a bit of queuing. No atmosphere and very limited options for pre-school age. It isn\u2019t",
          "Decided to get a taxi here and it was good. Plenty of things to do for all ages. My 3 yr old loved the house and the soft play bit which was good as it had a section for younger kiddies so not too rough. Golf fun for us. The one negative was the price of drinks and food inside.",
          "\"Quirky\" probably best describes this place. Disappointed with the \"rides\" as it isn't very comfortable waiting in queues in the heat of Majorca. We had free passes for 2 days as part of our Jet2 package deal but saw everything we needed to on day one so didn't return for",
          "Hotel good children\u2019s entertainment and kids club foods very basic eating out most day three pools when open as kids have been pooping in them 2 adult 1 child very small room hotel room cleaned out every day hotel always clean staff work well visited for 10 night all inclusive",
          "Honestly this is one of the weirdest places I\u2019ve visited. But I loved it! They\u2019ve made great use of the space and all the attractions are worth trying out, especially the mini golf! Only a short walk from the strip, my friend and I spent 2 days there.",
          "We stayed at the Sol Katmanudu hotel for 10 days and as it had the park attached we were in and out of it everyday, we upgraded to the gold passes which allowed us unlimited entry to all the rides. My 3 year old son went on everything multiple times, zombies and asylum are",
          "We visited only due to free pass from holiday company - The house itself is very interesting,spooky and quirky ,outside there are many activities showground stalls , water park, fantasia type golf etc Would be great for families with a few kids but we are a bit 'mature' for",
          "good day out - quite a lot to do - spent all day there with a 5 year old some thing a bit scary - take with you a swimming costume and a pair of socks(yep socks) for play area. a good mini golf course did 36 holes.",
          "We were there playing mini-golf, itself house and other facilities. Great place for hole family to spend evening or daytime.",
          "Once you are in an attraction it is brilliant but the waiting around is anoying. Wouldn't be so bad if you could wait in the splash pool area but even that had a wait or time limit might be better if set up time schedule",
          "Great place for a new adventure, always plenty of time to see exciting and sometimes scary new things",
          "Having stayed in the hotel in May (with free entry to the park) I decided to book a VIP ALL pass for July when I will be visiting Mallorca with my family. I thought I would get the best price by booking through the park directly (Sol Melia) at 39,50 Euros per adult. The",
          "This was really good to visit and good for kids at any age. Me my bf went and we liked it. The waterpark bit is gd for kids of all ages",
          "The house is very interested full of games and fun things to do and the mini golf is really fun. All the other things are mostly for kids. There are many 3D or 4D adventure but they are most suitable for children and poorly fitted glasses combined with the movement of the chair",
          "Visited the Katmandu amusement park while on holiday. My 4yr old loved it. So much for him to do. His favourite was the desperados i lost count how many times he went on this. Played both the games of golf, so much fun. Didn't go intje paly area or the splash park, wee one",
          "Excellent day out with 4d cinema experiences, good splash park with plenty of lifeguards, stick to the cheapest ticket as you don\u2019t get to do the rides more than once and go to pub outside to eat.",
          "Visited with my three children 11,10 and 3 My three year old wanted a siesta on the first visit so we returned for a second to finish off the bits we had not done. It was nice to have the option to do this as our first visit the heavens opened and we had to hide from the rain",
          "Go to the crazy golf. Great fun for all ages. You can get reductions on groups or repeated visits. Do ask as they don\u2019t really advertise it",
          "I did enjoy it but thought it was expensive for what it was. I thought it would be a bit.more than just 4d games. Paid an extra 12 Euros for inclusive drinks (beer or soft drinks) plus lunch. Food is awful though. It's just a Chuck wagon, eating area is very messy/dirty. Not",
          "Katmandu is like something I've never seen before. For starters you get given a wristband with only 10 rides on it, that includes an hour and a half in the play area or the swim area (which nobody was timing). I thought we'd blast through our 10 rides quite quickly but in the",
          "What a great place for fun and laughter, I'm 49 and have been several times with other family members and still enjoy it as much as the first time, kids will love! You must go.",
          "We visited with 2 adults 1 senior and a five year old. We all had a blast and was well worth the money. The house is great with lots of things to see and do. My son and husband went on the splash park but unfortunately my husband slipped and hurt himself quite badly. Think this",
          "First of all I must start by saying, ignore the bad reviews of this place. I am quite a picky person and like to stop in nice 4/5 star hotel and I thought for the money this place was excellent. By the far the best 2 things about it would be the staff and the quality of the",
          "We visited the park today! We absolutely loved it even though we are not kids anymore.... we liked the fact that you can leave the park and eat and drink where ever you want and go back anytime on the same day of course. We really enjoyed the mini golf! The 3D shooting is just",
          "Stumbled upon this place on a walk. Decided to go back the next day. We paid for a VIP Pass (got 25% discount cos of staying in a Melia Hotel) which enabled us to play continuous mini-golf (2 different ones), we loved The Asylum, The House of Magic 4D, in fact we loved it all",
          "Kids really enjoyed this visit, especially the upside down house and 4D cinemas (Apocalypse and Magic were shut which was really disappointing) the soft play was good but shocked when needed socks to play or no entry! The water park was also really good but didn\u2019t realise adults",
          "Me and my partner had so much fun here were in our 20\u2019s and we felt like big kids- staff are really lively and helpful with fluent English language. Tickets are such a bargain we also had two free meals+ drinks as part our package booked with our travel rep and they were huge",
          "great for all ages amazing facilities and nice, welcoming and helpful staff, you will be at ease in this wondetful park. You'll often find customers on holiday, but I strongly recommend buy a passport the save lots euros the house great lots different rooms really enjoyed the",
          "With a varied range of entertainment activities, amazing facilities and nice, welcoming and helpful staff, you will be at ease in this wondetful park. You'll often find customers on holiday, but I strongly recommend it for resident people too. Even if you are lucky enough to",
          "A must if you are visiting Magaluf with kids. all the rides are really good and modern, the upside down house was amazing",
          "Really fun house especially loved the wonky rooms. Very relaxed and we returned the next day for crazy golf at no extra expense. Must try the 4d zombie ride.",
          "Great facility suitable for all ages friendly staff it was a enjoyable experience with local amenities perfect for the kids and the big kids the course was fun and very well presented me and my partner played twice on our trip.",
          "This is my best trip ever. I love this park. Good to come here. Highly recommended place. Like like like",
          "I was rather disappointed by this attraction after travelling over an hour to get there, having read great reviews and how it has the largest soft play area in Spain I thought it was worth taking our 2 yr old. The lady on reception was very nice but I did ask is the house ok for",
          "We did the house & golf and have never laughed so much not bad for 3 pensioners and a young in lol highly recommend",
          "Excellent mini golf for family fun! The 3D shows were too scary for kids. We expected more rides instead of siting in the movies. Nice water slides for younger kids.",
          "Kids really enjoyed it, splash park is fantastic and the attractions were definitely worth it , will look forward to return in the future",
          "Visited in early May when the park was fairly quiet so didn\u2019t need to queue. The crazy golf was good and the kids enjoyed the splash park. The 3D rides were fun and we enjoyed the shooting rides. We didn\u2019t manage to do the magic house ride as it\u2019s only on once each hour and we",
          "It look very small place from out side but when you get in it you will be in another world, a world full of fun happiness and ur Kids will have too much fun that will make ur holiday the best",
          "We had 2 day passes at Katmandu and had a blast, we enjoyed the house, the soft play and water park. There is so much to see and do here. My advice would be to plan your visit, especially if you want to go to soft play or the water park as they have fixed entry times. The ice",
          "Great fun for all types of people. We played the crazy golf then had an ice cream. We could have stayed all day as there is so much to do. Fun times definitely recomend the ice cream x",
          "The park is good but can easily be completed in a day we haven\u2019t had very good weather so my son has made use of the soft play which he\u2019s really enjoyed",
          "So where do I start , the water is freezing , the pools are not suitable for young children , the staff do not have any English skills , the manager might aswell not even be here he's useless !!! The food is disgusting they can't even cook beans , there's no rides but suppose to",
          "Clean and tidy with helpful staff and good service, very good choice of food at a high standard. A great family hotel with lots going on.",
          "Great park not huge but good for kids up to around the age of 12/13 , our son used the water park which he really enjoyed , even better that it was free with staying in the hotel Katmand\u00fa. The park is clean and tidy and modern and it\u2019s well staffed with life guards",
          "This was a last minute booking for an easy break in the sun. To be honest I wasnt expecting too much from the hotel as it was reasonable priced. The hotel itself is ok, clean and tidy, the staff were all very nice and the food was ok. The pool was freezing cold and not heated at",
          "I think Katmandu Park is a resort aimed at children but we popped in for a game of crazy golf which had an easy and harder pitch. It had been very nicely done with water features and footprints in the sand (dinosaurs). 18 holes all with different features. Loved it.",
          "the two 20 mins 5d films where good and the shooting zombie and desprardo thing was ok could be longer .the crazy golf was good liked the back ground.soft play looked fab and so did the splash pool but didnt try as didnt go with kids.up side down house as ok just things to look",
          "This is not a theme park! 6 rides 4 of which are cinematic not worth visiting if you have a need to thrill or have children over 8",
          "We stayed in this hotel for 7 nights it\u2019s was amazing place for kids from reception to room, kids clubs to restaurant and of course the theme park, staff was very friendly throughout our stay , we had complimentary free laundry every day as well , we had three kids age 7, 11 and",
          "We came here as part of my friends hen doo day out. It was quiet which was good as it allowed us to take our time. We dressed up as golfers and made our way round the course. \u20ac12 per person. Park really clean and staff friendly. We had some tasty burgers at the snack bar pre",

          "Bought a family pass 2 adults 2 kids for 94 euros in the ticket shop across the road. We got 3 days out of it as the queues for the rides were long and took a while would hate to see this in the summer - we particularity enjoyed the mini golf and the upside down house. Would",
          "This place isn't worth the money. It's effectively just 3D type rides where you shoot things. My main complaint is that the rides take 16 or sometimes 24 people at a time and that's it. None of them last more than 10 minutes yet some only let in every hour on the hour so you're",
          "We visited today with our 5 & 7 year old. We had a 25% discount with our hotel and we paid \u20ac96.75 / \u00a383.64. For us it wasn\u2019t worth the money. For what we are used to i wouldn\u2019t call this a theme park. There is a few 4d rides, crazy house, mini golf and soft play. We bought an",
          "It cost us \u20ac125 for 2 adults and 4 children. 1 went free as is under 2. It's possibly the worst \u20ac125 I've ever spent tbh. Aside from the upside down house, which was good but was over too quickly, the rest was pretty poor. The majority of the \"Theme Park\" is 4D cinema screens,",
          "Two good courses you could play as many as you want. Lots of 3D cinemas and an upsidedown house to explore.",
          "The upside down house, soft play area and crazy golf courses were a big hit with our six year old grandson. The 4D \u2018rides\u2019 were a bit tame. Overall, a great place to spend a day as a change from building sandcastles. Not sure I\u2019d want to go at the height of the summer,",
          "I first thought it was over priced but to be fair the rides must cost a fair amount to maintain ( two rides didn\u2019t seem to be working perfectly so I noticed) . But I would hate to come here during height of summer as the waiting times must be awful for those with small kids. The",
          "We loved it that much we are going back again in a month, something to do all the time with an active 4 year old it was the best holiday we ever had.",
          "I went for a day with my wife and 2 small children and we had a great family day. The park has many options for all ages: minigolf, 3D cinema, shooting game, huge indoor playground and upside down house with plenty of interactive games to play with. I wasn't sure where we were",
          "Had a great day here, loads to do and see. Some attractions are being revamped for the new season. Which starts in May.",
          "Great place to go as a family for the day. Lovely and clean and lots to do. We've visited a few times now and the children still love it as much as they did on their visit, no doubt we will go again when we return this summer.",
          "My family of 5 re-visited Katmandu having visited a year ago and we all enjoyed the experience again. Although two of the rides were not working we still found enough to do, entering the Park at 1000hrs and leaving at 1500hrs. This time we noticed the Park staff were",
          "Good fun for once, must go with the kids. My opinion no need of a VIP ticket as there are still queues and you have no time to visit same attraction few times, just to get each one once.",
          "We went there and stay in the katmandu resort this Easter holiday,My 6 year old girl loves it! 4D film, shooting game, and the upside down house, my personal favorite is the mini goalf, it was so good!",
          "Katmandu park was advertised to us as a theme park, it definitely isn't. It has a few 4D cinemas which were good but you'd only want to go once, a crazy house with lots of interactive stuff to do which was fun and a crazy golf course which again was good but a bit too long and",
          "A really lovely place for kids if it\u2019s a hot day. Unfortunately when we went the sun was out in the morning so the 18 hole golf looked very appealing with a group,of 4 kids, however when the wind picked up it became very chilly. This didn\u2019t stop the kids enjoying themselves ,an",
          "3 attractions were closed and the 4D cinema was 2D instead and they still charged us \u20ac29/\u20ac34 FULL PRICE TICKETS with half the park closed. Queues for two attractions were every 60 mins but the attraction itself lasted only 10 mins tops and only held 24 people so queues were",
          "\u00a345 for one kid and one adult. We spent 3-4 hours there, so reasonable value for Money. No rides as such, but more 3d/4d type experiences which were good fun.

          "Very very disappointed. Spent a lot of money on this holiday and it did not live up to expectations. The staff are rude. The manager is a disgrace. Nothing is open for food but the main restaurant which if u want fish or slimy meatballs then your ok. Arrived at 1.30am and",
          "The attractions were lack lustre and short. Not exciting. Luckily we went on a day when the lines were short otherwise it would have been a total waste. Also, two of the attractions were down because of technical issues and every time we attempted to go on one particular ride",
          "Enjoyable family afternoon at Katmandu Park with plenty to entertain all of us. The kids enjoyed the rides and everything in the brilliantly designed upside down house whilst we relaxed in the sun having a drink and a bite to eat. Then we all had a competitive game of mini golf",
          "Mandatory attraction, really amazing! It is perfect to spend an afternoon with your friends or family. It has a repertory of different experiences.",
          "The Katmandu is Fun and Exciting with loads of different activities to choose from. It suits family's of all ages and is very clean with helpful staff. My family really enjoyed here. But you would have to go for 2 days as there is so much to do.",
          "We did the high ropes course, the full Katmandu park (mini golf, 4d cinemas, zombie shooting experience etc) and the night of the frozen dead on 3 separate occasions. We had a fantastic time every time and would definitely recommend for a fun day out",
          "Katmandu is a fun place to visit in Magaluf. Mini golf is fun with a good course, and the attractions in the building is fun too. The museum is impressive. Great place for the whole family.",
          "Wasn\u2019t expecting to much from the park but we had a good day out. I think the park is better suited to kids and young teenagers. The splash park is fun but is definitely more for young kids. My friends daughter is 9 and had a great time in it. Most of the rides are",
          "We visited here towards end of season; we had been staying at Puerto pollensa, booked an excursion through Jet 2, we thought that because of time of year the water park at Katmandu would be closed, the lady Jet 2 failed to tell all customers that it was in deed closed, so we",
          "Magaluf or Calvia as it is now known was very quiet in the October school half term holidays. Not a Stag or Hen in sight. Perfect for a low cost, short flight holiday in the sun. Weather was good but pools genuinely to cold to use so this is were the theme park came in useful.",
          "Spent a week in the hotel on site so as was to the park is free. Everyday as went in and didn't get bored. My 8 year old loved it, every attraction except the zombie one. Highly recommended. Food also on site which is reasonably priced.",
          "Enjoyable day out Fun house and mini golf were great and has lots of virtual reality games too Cheaper if you prebook online I think",
          "For teenagers is great but for under 5s no , just a dark place called soft play..sorry but not daylight in ... not for my kid sorry.. Food van very poor and basic as we went out for a meal ..",
          "They say that if you don't finish your visit in a day you can go back.Really !!!!.You have wristbands that only let you into the attractions once so not to see everything in a couple of hours is a joke. Having said that it was a good experience especially the 4d Rollercoaster,",
          "Me and my partner have previously visited here 5 years ago and couldn't wait to come here again. This place has lots to do for all ages. There is so much more here now. The house is lots of fun, with illusions, games and fun stuff. We both loved the golf and all of the 4D houses",
          "so another honest review what a day out a brilliant day for the kids and myself alike do not buy tickets on the gate though go to attactiontix.com as you will get your tickets for 19 pounds for adults and children with vip and all day pass compared to the undereducated",
          "Had a good day here, for four of us we bought a 24 hour pass which included a meal each and as much beverages as you wanted it cost about \u00a3160 euros. We all went on the 3d cinema rides, asylum etc, played crazy golf, the boys climbed on the high ropes and activities. We didn't",
          "Myself and my six year old had a great time at Katmandu park. Get your tickets from over the road though as they're cheaper. Sadly the splash park was closed due to end of season, and we were advised that the zombies and asylum were not really suitable for younger children but",
          "My partner won the hotel stay in a competition. We arrived at the hotel not knowing what to expect. We checked in early and was told our rooms were ready. The rooms were nice, clean and comfortable. We were offer and upgrade on the park to gold wristbands for \u20ac20 per Person and",
          "This place is definitely worth a visit with the kids. I\u2019d say by the day pass that allows access to everything as the numbers soon add up. Crazy golf is good and most of the other bits are ok. If you fancy a day away from the beach, you won\u2019t go wrong.",
          "Too dear, and the time you had too wait to see the different attractions is rediculous, after going through the house itself, there was a wait of up to 30 minutes to see the different attractions, and 20 euros for each child to see each attraction once is rediculous.",
          "The theme park was ok, but has potential to be a lot better. The best part was of the theme park is the Upside down house, which is really fun and you spend a long time in exploring in the house. The mini golf is okay, but does drag out a bit (but I'm not too fond of mini golf).",
          "Great family day out with the whole family able to enjoy all activities. Food was a massive let down and it was a shame the water park was closed due to the ongoing water issues but still had a really good time.",
          "A great value day. This park is a interactive park and also has a climbing area like go ape. And a mini golf course.",
          "We visited on a whim and did the golf and it was brilliant fun. The prices are good in the restaurant too and you can also book the attractions individually if you don't want to visit the whole park. We would definitely recommend this place for lots of fun. There's also magaluf",
          "We used most of the attractions here. The 4D simulators were fun. The upside down house was full of illusions and things to see and do which we thoroughly enjoyed. Also the 18 hole crazy golf was great fun in the sun. Would recommend visiting here if in magaluf.",
          "15th/22nd October. We were a party of 7 staying in 2 rooms. The rooms are small. Ours was a room with 2 single beds pushed together and a sofa bed for the 2 kids. Moving around the room was near impossible and although there a sliding door, it opened to a sheer drop with a",
          "Excellent entertainment. Lots of different shows to watch. A good few hours can be spent there, very clean and well catered for.",
          "We stayed in the Sol Katmandu Hotel and had the play passes included to look around Katmandu Park House and some other activities including 4D experience. We enjoyed looking around the house as it had some interesting exhibits and good inter-activity but not enough to do there",
          "My second visit this year. Friendly staff and super hotel especially for kids. Would highly recommend and definitely be back again next year",
          "Very interesting place, the upside down house is awesome, rides are all sit down shooting games, they are really good, zombies was really good, they were all good apart from asylum ride, thought it would be scary, most ones are 4D. But had a fun day, would recommend. X",
          "Just visited to complete the crazy golf course. \u20ac11 per person for one course, extra \u20ac5 to do the second. A good facility and well kept",
          "I recently visited the theme park a few weeks ago . The park offers a wide range of activities for all age groups, but the but the biggest problem that they have is that before any ride starts I have notice that there is no safety guides put in place before the ride begins. A",
          "This was a great day out for adults, teenagers and kids. We had a great time going through the upside down house, it was so strange. We also did the crazy golf - Fire Course - this was such a laugh and so competitive with all 5 of us. Once again my youngest daughter got a hole",
          "Me and my mum visited Katmandu on a fairly overcast day during our holiday. It's a perfect day trip for those not so sunny Spanish days! With lots of different attractions to suit all ages and fantastic surroundings you really do forget you are in the middle of magaluf!",
          "We are a couple in our twenties and had a great time at the crazy gold course. It took nearly an hour to complete the course however tickets were 11 euros which I think is pricey. Lots for kids to do here too.",
          "Me and my partner went here last week for a day out. Katmandu caters for all ages, the house is brilliant and lots of different areas to explore. This is then followed by 2 4d cinemas , mini golf and the rope challenge. All was brilliant, food is available on site, all staff are",
          "had a great time using all the attractions in the park great fun for children and adults rides are fantastic 4d and 5 d cinemas great",
          "We visited over 2 days so could do everything at leasure but it could be done in 1 great pool play area and soft play for younger children The fun house was excellent defiantly worth a visit You can get discount. On entrance price from trip/ tours kiosks",
          "Excellent so much to see, do and watch in here, great addition to the hotel. Loved the 3d shark screen and the moving or not moving bridge lol Only thing that spoilt it for us was there was a school trip at the same time and they was quite rude.",
          "this place is a great day out for all the family all the attractions are great crazy golf jungle climb 3-4 D cinemas katmandu even has a water park i cant say enough about it fun was had by all. food pretty cheap aswell. if your going go vip with an up grade to all inclusive",
          "Only used the Crazy Golf course here ( 2 different courses) The rest of the site although not appealing to us, looked amazing for families",
          "Visited as a excursion with jet 2 from Sa Coma (around 1 hr 30 mins from Magaluf) I thought katmandu would be a lot bigger - it did have a lot of potential, the mini golf and outdoor pool/slide area were fab but found that the rest of it was pretty poor with most of it being",
          "Half of the park was closed. Bit pricey what we got. Half of the staff was unfriendly. Some were nice. My daughter had fun,but she's 5 she enjoys anything. Wouldn't go back there",
          "Got a great deal with our TUI reps so got unlimited rides for \u20ac27 for adults \u20ac20 for the kids. Got a taxi from Santa Ponsa for only \u20ac9 so was cheap there was loads for the kids to go on so they were very happy,crazy golf took ages because there were so many people playing but",
          "Visited here with my wife and 10 year old daughter. A great place to stay with a kid as the park is fantastic as was the staff and entertainment team. Hotel rooms were ok and food was quite good also. Plenty of places to eat and drink and a beatuful beach all a short walk. All",
          "Absolutely fantastic. Very friendly. Kids where overwhelmed. Hotel gave discount \u20ac20. So look around for offers.",
          "Had free tickets from jet2. We thought it would be a place for just kids, but it definitely not. Had such a laugh in the house. The 3D and 4d was a good experience. Recommend to anyone",
          "This is a brilliant place for all ages. My husband and I were on our own and visited twice during our weeks holiday. We had a go in all the various 3d activity cinemas etc. Good laugh amazing for kids. We loved the crazy golf. there are rwo different rounds. But there is so",
          "We visited Katamandu Park as our hotel was close by. We only played mini golf as the water park is more suited for young children. We had a brilliant time playing the mini golf, perfect way to spend a few hours in the sun. We played both courses which was worth it, definitely",
          "Just arrived home from a week at Sol Katmandu and we will definitely want to return mainly because of the fab kids club programme and it's staff. My children were so encouraged to go because they loved the team running it, especially Patri, Edu and Ainhoa. They tried so hard to",
          "Attractions have a person max of aprox 16. Wait times aprox 20 mins. Queue on avg was 35-40 people (not including us). Average wait time 40 mins. It was like that for every attraction. Excluding house + golf. Considering the price!!! It's awful!!! \u20ac27 entrance each!! Plus the",
          "we visited this park again last week, the house has changed since we were last there, it is still good value, the rides are ok, the new attraction of the house of magic wasn't what I expected, but it was ok for children I think, the staff were very friendly as usual, drinks here",
          "Had amazing holiday great place to take the kids always something to do and entertainment every night with something different staff are amazing and great food the only down side was are room was so small just about had room to move round the bed.. \ud83d\ude00",
          "was a last minute plan for us to visit. good job we had a fab day! only thing this was a very quiet day and it took us 6 hours to get round most attractions and this did not include the ropes as this was closed and the kids areas as we had no kids... we also missed off the",
          "This place was advertised at 45 Euros but we found a tout at the beach front who got us tickets for 20 Euros!... Even so I wouldn't say its as good as people make out.",
          "Visited this park as family of 10 including 9 month old ! Thoroughly enjoyable day lots to do - very organised timing for rides and activities - welcoming staff ! Just wish we had longer \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude01",
          "My boyfriend and I visited Katmandu Park whilst on holiday in Cala Vinas. We did not have high expectations as from the outside it looks quite run down. However, we were really impressed by it all! We got there not long after the park opened and started with the House which had",
          "Disappointed Far too busy kids totally out of control!! Food poor Attractions boring Splash park far to small Rooms tiny had to put suitcases on balcony. Entertainment rubbish Definitely won't be back!! Good points Departure day!!",
          "If you have standards when it comes to theme parks, you will be disappointed! The staff are not engaged in the experience at all. The price is a bit high for the quality standards this park delivers.. Most (all?) attractions close before 6. Some of the effects in the 4D",
          "Played 18 holes of golf \u20ac22 Euro good course great condition challenging holes fun for all the family!!! Would recommend. Had BBQ chicken wings and chips after \u20ac7 Euro very tasty!!!",
          "Very disappointed with the soft play here. My little boy is 3 years old so was only allowed in a very small area of the soft play complex. This was not explained to us when we booked. It boasts the best soft play but my son was deeply disappointed. He was out of it in 5 minutes.",
          "Spent a great afternoon playing crazy golf during a short break with a group of mates. Brilliant course and had great laugh.",
          "1st off - don't buy your tickets from the reception. We were quoted 29 euros and left to think about it and the tourist office across the street had the same thing for 20 euros. You can return any day of you haven't visited all attractions. We arrived on the Fri, when it was",
          "Great park for all ages young kids and older people plenty too do. Very well kept and maintained. Staff very friendly. Two crazy golf areas brilliant fun. 4d movies. Upside down house all great fun . Loads too do. Well worth a visit.",
          "Loads to do, 4d cinemas, the upside down house experience, kids water park, mia and boro the yetis are great for the kids. Staff very helpful - we spoke to Nat most days and she spoke really good English and was a good help. Would highly recommend a visit.",
          "Great place to stay. Good rooms and amazing breakfasts. Pools and splash park are really good. Staff very friendly and nothing is too much trouble for them.",
          "We visited House of Katmandu several years ago and it's grown a lot since then! This year we took our toddler to the soft play (Katlantis). There was a few quirky light up activities etc. which I haven't seen at soft play venues in the UK but the area for toddlers was quite",
          "As a couple with no children with us, we still found this a great place for a day out with lots of things to do.",
          "This is our 5th year visiting Magaluf and we always go to Katmandu. It's an excellent day out, I would recommend anyone to go, young and old alike. Every year they add new features which are always impressive. However, I do find that they don't do enough to maintain the",
          "We visited here with our 4 children during our holiday. We had the VIP package so had drinks and food during our visit which was definitely worth it. It was good but smaller then expected - The 4d experiences are all next to eachother so you feel like you're doing the same thing",
          "Excellent service, clean hotel, loads to do, even had a free bottle of bubbly and cake on my birthday!!",
          "At Katmando Park there are activities for the family. Movies, action movies and other activities including mini golf. I normally go there at least once a year but not during the summer when it is too warm.",
          "Would definitely recommend this little theme park. We bought a ticket from our Rep which cost 20 euro each but you could only go on each attraction once but over as many days as you want so you could do the 4d/5d rides one day, the upside down house another, the climbing park",
          "Fantastic Day out , had loads of fun and mini golf was such a laugh. Lots for kids , not a massive amount of adult rides",
          "Me and my partner decided to visit the park as our hotel receptionist advised we would enjoy it more than golf fantasia. We did enjoy the park, the upside down house was a laugh and an experience. The crazy golf course is one of the best I have ever been to. As for the rest of",
          "We purchased the wrist band to stay all day, the house was great, plenty to see with lots of interaction. we then moved on to the other activities which were all shoot-em ups, our main reason to visit was the climbing area which we were told at the ticket office would be fine",
          "We visited the park whilst on our honeymoon. We paid for a day pass (\u20ac29 each) and upgraded to the VIP All package (an extra \u20ac13 euros each) this was well work it as it gave you unlimited visits to each ride as well as unlimited drinks (excluding ice slush) and a meal.",
          "Recently visited here with my husband and 2 daughters aged 4 and 8. Had a fantastic day. We paid extra 10euros each to upgrade to have food from the snack shack and for all our drinks (Lager, wine and soft drinks all day), this was well worth the money as it was at least 7euros",
          "The climbing zone was amazing. The splash zone looked good fun. Overall the park is well themed and has a nice safe family friendly feel.",
          "There are two crazy golf courses here and we love them! We've been several times since it opened about ten years ago, and highly recommend it. Really fun decor, layout and cool rock music playing as you go round the courses. And we've used the bar to for food and drink,",
          "Fab Fab Fab! ..There is a kiosk over the road from Katmandu. Pay 20 euro each to the guys there then pay the 12.50 euro upgrade for unlimited drinks & a snack bar lunch at the Katmandu booking office. It'll save each of you 9 euro. For 5 of us this holiday that was 45 euros! Get",
          "We stayed at the hotel for a week in August. We had access to the park it was really good my daughter and myself did most of the attractions we enjoyed the zombie attraction the most.we did not go in the splash park cause my daughter was a bit old for it .We enjoyed the house it",
          "While visiting Magaluf the weather was not as expected. One morning it was cloudy so we decided to visit the Katmandu Park we had seen on the way to the hotel. We arrived around 10.30, shortly after the park opens, to find it was already busy and people were queuing so we",
          "We visited Katmandu yesterday as it is advertised as Spain's number 2 theme park. We are staying in Alcudia and it took just over an hour to get there in a well air conditioned coach. We spent six hours there and covered everything within that time, we enjoyed our day there but",
          "It was very fun lots of things to with teenagers and older people. The place is full of activities to do",
          "We played the mini golf at the Katmandu Park in Magaluf and it was incredible!! For 18 holes it was 11\u20ac which to me is very reasonable. We chose the hardest course and it was indeed difficult with lots of obstacles to dodge. We never did any of the other attractions in the park",
          "we booked our tickets online before going, much cheaper, kids will love this place, 3d 4d experiences, golf course, upside down house was fun, and climbing ropes",
          "Been to Katmandu a number of times either staying in the hotel or using passes supplied when staying at other Melia hotels in the area. The biggest problem the park has is the attitude of the staff who are laid back and spend more time talking to each other than guests. I had",
          "Had a fab day out. This is our 2nd visit the first was 3 years ago and only did the house and golf as daughter was only 2.5 years but this time we did everything and I must say we had a fab time, it was worth paying extra for the vip as the drinks were very much needed as it was",
          "Whilst staying in the pit Magaluf, my two sons enjoyed the activities offered at Katmandu - good value & plenty to do",
          "was so hot kids didnt use all the facilities that were on offer but it had lots to do on offer....4d rides.k3 climb.water park etc. had a deal for meal and drinks....had to queue for drinks and the food wasnt great so might be best upgrading to the hotel buffet at extra cost",
          "Myself and my daughter (age 9) visited Katmandu. We purchased advanced tickets via Jet2 and decided to visit on a cloudy day. We arrived for opening at 10am. We went into the 'upside down' house first in hindsight we should of gone straight to the cinemas as capacity is limited",
          "On my recent visit to Majorca, I thought it would be nice to take the kids to a theme park, and so off we went to Katmandu Park. This park is mainly suitable for those with younger kids (ideal for those between 8 and 12). The park is mainly made up of 3D interactive type rides,",
          "Somehow this is billed as the 2nd best thing to do in spain. I fell bad for spin if that the case! It's good fun, smaller than imagined and has 4 or 5 4D cinemas, not all were working so 3D in 2D kind of makes it just a bumpy ride.... The upside down house is brilliant it's",
          "Katmandu is billed as Spain's number 2 theme park. From this I expected a lot more and on a bigger scale, they have clearly never been to a UK theme park! However having said that we still had an enjoyable day there and all the 'rides' we went on were thoroughly enjoyable. It's",
          "Great day out for whole family. Its a little bit expensive but you can visit the park twice if you dont finish everything in one day. We spend two half days and we loved it . We entered a competition from Katmandu website and won a little price too( teddy bear you can collect",
          "We went as a day trip from a neighbouring resort. The attractions were fun once we got inside but we had a wait a long time for each one. Most staff were extremely friendly and helpful but some were miserable as sin. We upgraded our ticket to include free drinks and a meal.",
          "- Our 2 year old loved Katmadu and is still singing the theme song - My husband and I enjoyed it but the availability of some attractions leaves a lot to be desired. -Splash park and zip lines can only enter at certain times so we end up missing them completely. - Soft play is",
          "Attended yesterday with wife and six year old daughter. Highly recommended and value for money. Only disappointment was the queuing but to be expected high season. The Upside Down House is utterly amazing - hard to put into words - inspiring will do. Haven't experienced anything",
          "This was supposed to be 2nd theme park in Spain. There are 3D and 5D rooms which basically involve shooting at people on the screen. The movie 'house of magic' was bigged up but found that maybe the very small children would like this. I was just gettting into the film when it",
          "Hotel was great for the kids..evening entertainment was fab but get there early to get a seat...unfortunately hotel is right on the strip so depending on what side your room is take ear plugs!! Can't fought the bin men; the roads were cleaned quickly after the events that took",
          "Nice park, lots of activities, enough to keep your kids happy, even for us it was a great fun. Ques took a bit of time but I guess expected in holiday season. A nicely spent day out with my family! We enjoyed!",
          "We booked with Jet 2 through out hotel and the coach took 2 hours to get there. This reduced our time there and couldn't get round all the activities due to queues. Our children are 12 & 13 and are probably too old for this now although little children cannot go on the high wire",
          "Avoid this place. Long queues. Untasty junk food, rude staff. No baby troller facilities. High prices. It ruined our day.",
          "To wait such long time for every station, with kids it was awful! Will not come back... even for free",
          "Great day out Mini Golf was Best and upside down house Kids loved it!!! Teenager loved Climbing frame The 3d Cnema experience was Great We didnt do water part Only thing letting this place down is the Food We went for all in vip bands was great for drinks throughout the day",
          "Visited here with family on a recent trip to Palma nova just up the road, walking distance if it's not too hot! And your feeling up to it! There's a small water park which does get busy, not many seats around so if your not getting involved it's not so good, there are also 3D",
          "Went here for the day there were lots of activities for the kids, 4d experience ,great swimming area, eating areas and the expedition golf was great fun. There's plenty to do and would definately recommend it",
          "Did the park over two days. Some queues were quite long and the rides especially the cinema type ones were quite alike. The golf was really good. Food and drink is expensive but you can go off site and there are some cheap places close by. The boys really liked it so for",
          "Visited Katmandu with kids aged 12 and 10, they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. We booked the VIP pass that allows a snack at the kiosk, gives free soft drinks all day including wine and beer. We were also able to eat lunch at the Katmandu hotel, the lunch was absolutely great,",
          "An ok park but is a sun trap, we went with a 4 year old and 18month old. Splash park is small but ojr 4 year old loved it. Very expensive at \u20ac60 (this included a 25% discount) was only here for abkut 2.5hrs. Alot of the entertainment isnt buggu friendly so be prepaired to leave",
          "We came here with our 3 children (ages 8, 6 and 6). One of them was slightly scared to begin with but wants to go back again. It has 4d cinemas. Some of the attractions are more suited for 9 years upwards. Even though it was hot then most of the waiting areas for the",
          "Very good location to visit with your kids. Almost everything is under roof which is good when it comes to the sun. You can do everything in a couple of hours.",
          "Me and my partner came here one sunny afternoon early August to play expedition golf. It costs 11 euros per adult and you choose from the easy or the difficult course. We choose the easy course 'Glacier Valley' which has 18 holes. The holes vary in difficulty, some are on flat",
          "We booked this through our hotel rep and got all inclusive passes. Thankfully most of the attractions are indoors as the temperature was in the mid to high 30s when we went. It wasn't at all what I expected, 3d and 4d interactive rides, a big outdoor splash pool, an indoor soft",
          "This is the second time my partner and I have visited Katmandu park, except this time we had a one year old and it was still a fab day. Really great for our daughter as there is a huge soft play for when we wanted some down time. Adults are allowed in with their children in the",
          "We purchased a 24hour VIP ticket with unlimited access to all attractions before we left UK,great value for money. We loved the 4d house of magic,desperados,los banditos and 4d cinema would def do again. We also went in the main house,this was very strange & quick to get",
          "I brought the little lad I nanny for here for the day and from the moment we arrived it was a fabulous day. Renee on the front desk was so friendly and informative it set the day off to the lovely start. So much fun stuff to do its tough to pack it all in!!",

The booking we had gave us VIP passes which provides",
          "Like no theme park we had been to before. The upside down house is brilliant fun and visually amazing. All the 3D and 4D shows were really well done - very hi- tech . Best crazy golf we have ever been to and the water park was fab. We got VIP tickets which covered a meal from",
          "Took my 12 year old son. We'd set aside a full day for this trip, but that was way too much. A couple of hours maximum and he was ready to leave. The activities are ok but mainly for younger children. Have to say my son was rather underwhelmed by most of them. The only thing he",
          "We booked before travel with Travel Republic or \u00a322 per person (adult and child) this was for the VIP Passport which includes transport to and from the park, unlimited rides, lunch and drinks. It is more expensive on the door and online however the price escapes me. Anyhoo the",
          "Recently went to the park whilst on our holiday in Palma Nova. We got our tickets from across the road from Katmandu ( next to Finnegans bar) as it worked out a bit cheaper. It was definitely worth the money as we went most evenings to play mini golf after dinner. There were",

          "We went to the Katmandu Park attracted by the climbing area. We never climbed before or did anything similar but we felt quite safe with the explanation of the staff and their presence. Some of the obstacles are quite scary, but in a fun way :D. I was able to get to the third",

        "wiki": "This is a complete list of basilicas of the Catholic Church. A basilica is a church with certain privileges conferred on it by the Pope.\nNot all churches with \"basilica\" in their title actually have the ecclesiastical status, which can lead to confusion, since it is also an architectural term for a church-building style.\nIn the 18th century, the term took on a canonical sense, unrelated to this architectural style. Basilicas in this canonical sense are divided into major (\"greater\") and minor basilicas. Today only four, all in the Diocese of Rome, are classified as major basilicas: the major basilicas of St John Lateran, St Peter's, St Paul outside the Walls, and St Mary Major. The other canonical basilicas are minor basilicas.\nBy canon law no Catholic church can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. The Basilica di San Nicola da Tolentino was the first minor basilica to be canonically created, in 1783. The 1917 Code of Canon Law officially recognised churches using the title of basilica from immemorial custom as having such a right to the title of minor basilica. Such churches are referred to as immemorial basilicas.\n\n\n== Basilicas in Asia ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in Africa ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in North and Central America and the Caribbean ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in South America ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in Australia and Oceania ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in Europe ==\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nAs of November 2019, there were 1,690 basilicas (four of them major; the rest minor) in the world.\n\n\n=== Countries with more than 100 basilicas ===\nItaly (573)\nFrance (168)\nSpain (123)\nPoland (105)\n\n\n=== Countries with between 10 and 100 basilicas ===\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with more than 10 basilicas ===\nRome (66)\nBuenos Aires (15)\nKrak\u00f3w (13)\nBologna (11)\nFlorence (11)\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with between five and 10 basilicas ===\nNaples (9)\nBarcelona (9)\nMilan (9)\nVenice (8)\nCologne (6)\nLima (6)\nMadrid (6)\nSantiago (6)\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with five basilicas ===\nJerusalem\nParis\nPiacenza\nGenoa\nTurin\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with four basilicas ===\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with three basilicas ===\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with two basilicas ===\n\n\n== Other basilicas ==\nThe following churches are often referred to as basilicas, but there does not appear to be evidence of their officially holding that status:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of basilicas in Italy\nBasilicas of New Zealand\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nList of all Minor Basilicas from GCatholic\nList of all Basilicas in India from Notes on India\nBunson, Matthew, ed.

Apart from urban areas and public baths (some of which offer nude swimming days), nude bathing is common in Germany: unofficial clothing optional areas exist at most lakes and rivers and other sites, such as abandoned sand and rock quarries. Many designated Freik\u00f6rperkultur (FKK \u2013 Free Body Culture) areas exist at the seaside, at lakes and in baths, especially in the former East Germany, where nudism remains more widespread than in the west.

        "wiki": "Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu (Catalan pronunciation: [\u02c8sant\u0259 \u0259w\u02c8la\u027ei\u0259 \u00f0\u0259z \u02c8riw], Spanish: Santa Eulalia del R\u00edo) is a coastal town on the south eastern seaboard of the Spanish island of Ibiza. The town is located on the designated road PM 810. Santa Eul\u00e0ria is the third largest town on the island and also has the only river on the island which flows into the sea at the western end of the town.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe town is 9.3 miles (15.0 km) north east of Ibiza Town and 13.6 miles (21.9 km) of Ibiza Airport. The town sits next to a wide bay with the promontory of Punta Arab\u00ed at the east end of the Bay. Also at the eastern end of the bay is new harbour, mariner called Port Esportiu which is full of restaurants, shops and bars. The town has two beaches which are kept clean and tidy and have gently sloping sands and are ideal for young families. At the western end of the bay is the prominent hill of \u2018Puig d\u2019 en Fita\u2019 which dominates the landscape. The hill is dotted with apartments, hotels and private houses, and at night is dotted with the dwellings lights.\n\n\n== The Town ==\nAt the centre of the town on the \u2018Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Espanya\u2019 is the Ajuntament (town hall) which is now one of the last historical buildings of the town. The present building, which has been renovated, dates from 1795 and reflects the typical architecture of the period on the island. Nowadays the building is less functional as a town hall and is used with a civic representative purpose. In front of the Ajuntament is a small square which has a fountain with a stone surround which faces the busy main street of \u2018Carrer Saint Jaume\u2019. Behind the fountain is a stone monument, erected by the city of Palma, Mallorca to thank and honour the local fishermen who, On 17 January 1913, rescued victims of the shipwrecked steamboat \u2018Mallorca\u2019 which had run aground on a reef near the rocky inlet of Redona at Punta Arab\u00ed.  The town streets run grid like from the \u2018Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Espanya\u2019 with the \u2018Carrer Saint Jaume\u2019 running west to east. The \u2018Carrer da Sant Vincent\u2019 runs parallel, one street back from \u2018Carrer Saint Jaume\u2019 with the western end of \u2018Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Espanya\u2019. This street is pedestrianized and is filled with typical Tavernas and restaurants. There are also one or two lively bars. The \u2018Carrer Saint Jaume\u2019  is full of stores, banks, bars and restaurants. The \u2018Passeig de s\u2019Alamera\u2019 is an attractive thoroughfare which runs south from the \u2018Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Espanya\u2019 down to the seafront. This boulevard has a tree lined central pedestrianized area with gardens. In the summer this shady \u2018Ramblas\u2019 is lined with market stalls selling jewellery, sarongs, tie-dye Thai garb and trinkets of all kinds. At the southern end of \u2018Passeig de s\u2019Alamera\u2019 is Santa Eulalia's harbour front with views of the bay. Running in either direction is a paved and landscaped promenade. Below the promenade are the resorts two sandy beaches which have safe designated bathing areas which in the season are patrolled by lifeguards. Behind the promenade the bay is ringed by concrete apartment blocks, some of which have shops, bars, caf\u00e9 and restaurants opening on to the promenade.\n\n\n== The River ==\nThe river is called Riu de Santa Eulalia, it is more of a small stream and only ever becomes a raging torrent following very heavy rainfall. The source of the river is below the 342-metre-high Puig d\u2019en Sopes close to Sant Miquel. The river then meanders for 17 kilometres (11 mi) through the countryside to the sea at the western end of the town. A small way inland from the mouth of the river there is a small triple arched bridge, the Pont Vell, the bridge crosses the rocky valley and is claimed to have been built by the Romans as part of the imperial road building schemes on the island between 200 BC and AD 400, although the bridge's earliest mention is in a document of 1720. The river is also the only one of its kind in the Balearic Islands, and is fed by several small tributaries, notably the Torrent de Labritja, which originates at the northern village of Sant Joan de Labritja.\n\n\n== The Parish Church of Santa Eul\u00e0ria ==\nTo the west of the town centre is the hill called \u2018Puig de Missa\u2019. The hill is 52 metres above sea level and its summit is dominated by the Esgl\u00e9sia de Puig de Missa. The church is dedicated to Saint Eulalia. The Path to the church spirals up around the hillside before arriving in a courtyard beside the church come Fortress. The Church is thought to have been built in 1568 although it is recorded that there was a chapel dedicated to the saint as far back as 1302. Despite the huge natural advantage of constructing the church on this hilltop, the small community of Santa Eul\u00e0ria, employed the skills of military designer Giovanni Calvi to fortify the church you see here today. Calvi had a rounded bastion constructed in the style of the islands many watchtower although the church's bastion is solid and has no internal guardrooms. The churches nave roof is higher than the Bastion which restricted the range and scope of any cannon placed on the bastion, although it is thought that at one time the roof may have been lower than the bastion. The Porch of the church, added in the eighteenth century, is larger than most on the island and stands separate from the main church building. It has multiple pillars and rounded arches which has been compared to the Moorish style of architecture, and this does compare well with a mosque and its prayer halls still seen on main land Spain. The porch is probably the newest part of this church. On the west elevation of the church there is a small chapel which is topped with a plain stone dome complete with a lantern. This chapel is an addition to the original church, and is entered through a ponderous arch bored through the massively thick walls. The interior is square and rather small with the dome above supported on squat arches over each corner. The lantern above has stained glass lights. There is another similar chapel on the opposite wall which gives the nave a footprint in the shape of the crucifix. There is a gilded altarpiece which was brought and installed from Segovia in 1967. the rest of the church is very sparse and has been heavily restored due to the extreme damage done to the church by iconoclast Republicans during the Spanish Civil War of 1936 who viewed the church as a hotbed of sedition.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n=== Ball Pag\u00e8s ===\nTHE DANCES\nThe roles of men and women are clearly differentiated in our dances. The woman, indifferent, holds her arms close to her body, walking with short and rapid steps, circling around a central point. The man, however, does not have previously determined steps. He tries to show his force and manliness by taking great leaps, in order to win the favour of the woman. The dances and the popular culture are part of rural, or country, society. The people who lived in and from the countryside did not have many opportunities for socialising or parties. The songs have a decidedly Oriental sound. The words have to be guessed, with syllables cut off so they fit into the monotonous and unvarying melody. Christian influence is perhaps the strongest. In 1235, Catalan men during the reign of Jaime I took the island from the Arabs. Its influence is seen in the jewels, the men's dress and the language we speak. In spite of the Christianisation of the dances and the inclusion of music in the liturgy, the profane nature of the same can be easily recognised.\nLA CURTA\nThis is a short dance. The steps and the rhythm are suitable for the elderly. Generally, the elderly, the well owner with the heir to the house, or the in-laws of the couple marrying \u2013 depending on the occasion \u2013 started and finished the party with this dance, granting permission to the rest to continue.\nLA LLARGA\nYoung people display their energy with this much faster dance. In almost all the dances, the dancer selects his partner with a bang on the castanets. This gesture, a quite rude way to issue an invitation to a woman, is forgiven at the end of the dance when the man kneels before her. The woman reciprocates with a small curtsy.\nSA FILERA\nA man dances with three women in a line. It seems like a wedding dance where the recently married bride is accompanied by two friends or ladies. The rhythm is the same as the Llarga.\nSES NOU RODADES\nThis may be the prettiest and most important dance in our repertoire. Parties culminate with this dance and it is a nuptial ceremony. The newly married couple dance in a series of circles, separating and then meeting again in the centre, where they link elbows. After the sixth turn, the wife flashes her rings (twenty-four in total) that her husband has presented her.\nTHE INSTRUMENTS\nThe basic rhythm of our music is percussion and wind. It may seem surprising that such a Mediterranean island does not include string instruments in their music. The drum, the flute, the espas\u00ed (a metal sword-shaped piece) and the castanets always accompany our dances and fiestas.\nTHE DRUM\nA hollowed pine trunk. The outsides are adorned with carvings or paint, with red and green colours predominating here. The motifs are vegetal or geometric. The skin is made from rabbit.\nTHE FLUTE\nAn oleander branch hollowed out with fire. With only three holes, it is also adorned with vegetable and geometric shapes. This instrument requires greater skill, even though composers do not have a conventional knowledge of musical theory or other disciplines and play accompanied by the drum.\nTHE ESPAS\u00cd\nA piece of metal in the shape of a sword. The stridency of the metal backs up the music.\nTHE CASTANETS\nThis may possibly be the strangest instrument, due to both its size and its sound. Created from juniper wood, they are carved with vegetable or geometric shapes using knives. While castanets are widely used throughout the Mediterranean, we use the largest ones available. The sound resembles a trotting horse.\nTHE XEREMIA\nAnother wind instrument, which was used principally by shepherds. It is created with two young bamboo shoots, with a vibrating reed. You can see an instrument identical to the xeremia at the British Museum in London, which is the Egyptian maid. Besides accompanying our dances, some of these instruments can be heard at religious celebrations and other solemn occasions. Ses Caramelles is the song played on Christmas Eve. Sa Pujadeta and Sa Calera are songs that are already classics and enjoy great popularity amongst the Ibizans.\nTHE DRESS\nThe originality and authenticity of some of the native dress styles offer some samples that are over three hundred years old. In the different villages of the island, similar to how the exact dance style varies, there are also small variations in dress. We can distinguish between three different types of dress, both for men and women, in accordance with their function and age.\nTHE BLACK GONELLA\nThis is the oldest dress for women, probably dating from the 18th century. It is a tunic of knitted wool, consisting of an underskirt, a serge jerkin with embroidered satin sleeves, silver buttons and coloured ribbons. This is topped with an apron, a yellow silk shawl and a cambuix, a lace scarf tied under the neck. It is usually worn with a black, felt, wide-brimmed hat. Jewels on the dress are silver and red coral. Gold, which was traditionally used, became scarce during this time. The jewels are affixed to the body with coloured, embroidered ribbons.\nTHE WHITE GONELLA OR WHITE DRESS \nA luminous white colour, consisting of the same garments as the gonella (underskirts, jerkin, apron, shawl and scarf), but with some particularities. A hat is never worn. The bride layered on underskirts until their width no longer allowed her to pass through the door of her bedroom. The jewels are made from gold. This was generally the dowry that her family contributed to the wedding. The cross, la joia, hung with eighteen spans of golden braid (6 or 7 times over the chest) and two or three necklaces. The sleeves were adorned with gold buttons. The rings could be in different shapes - the family seal, the heart and key to the house, etc. These were gifts from her fianc\u00e9e, with a total of twenty-four rings.\nCOLOURED GONELLA OR COLOURED DRESS\nOld women that still wear this dress on a daily basis can be seen in isolated villages. On the day of the town festival, they wear their best dresses adorned with jewellery and then go to the church, following a long tradition. They have essentially the same clothing items, but the apron is normally long, short if undergarments are worn. It can be accompanied with a wide-brimmed hat made from pita fibres (capell de floc), with a yellow scarf, but never together with the undergarments. There are also three types of dress for the men. Recognised as the oldest, it seems to have come from a military uniform, and we can place it next to the gonella. Black holds prominence over white. A large rosary with silver and ebony beads is worn at the neck. The following is possibly the most popular. Worn for summer festivals, it is made with luminous white cloth and a highly embroidered shirt. The sash has bright colours and the waistcoat has silver button work: 14 or 24 buttons, depending on the man's wealth. Lastly, the most modern outfit that disappeared only quite recently, was worn by the elderly. All signs of ostentation have been suppressed here: there is no button work or adornments. It consists of a loose-fitting shirt closed only at the neck that goes over the inside shirt. Dark-coloured, and worn with a silk scarf, generally yellow. Topped by a black felt hat. All these dresses were worn with handmade pita-fibre espadrilles. The most common colours for men were red and white. Women put much more imagination into the colouring of their clothing. The jewels merit special mention. S'emprendada, a set of gold, silver and coral jewels, has an artistic and historical value much greater than their economic value. And we could not finish without mentioning the importance that dance, music and dress play within our culture and as an extremely relevant part of our entity.\n\n\n=== Hippy Markets ===\nThere are two Hippy Markets which attract large numbers of tourists and locals: Punta Arabi, located in Es Canar runs all day every Wednesday from April through October. Las Dalias, near Sant Carles, runs all day every Saturday, throughout the year. Las Dalias also has a \"Night Market\" which runs Monday and Tuesday evenings from June through September.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nThe town was depicted, in the time before and up to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, in Elliot Paul's Life and Death of a Spanish Town (1937).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nCarola Li\u00f1ares Serantes, Local Student, actual 3 times champion of Spain in Athleticism (1600 m)  willing to become P.E. Teacher in the future.\nRigoberto Soler Impressionist Painter lived in the town from 1924 to 1956.\nElliot Paul (10 February 1891 \u2013 7 April 1958), was an American journalist and author who lived in the town for six years.\nWilhelm Von Keitel Field Marshal of Nazi Germany owned a house in the town which remained empty until 1958\nDenholm Elliott English actor\nTerry-Thomas English actor\nRobin Maugham British novelist, playwright and travel writer.\nDiana Rigg DBE, English actress.\nLeslie Phillips English actor\nLaurence Olivier English actor\nNigel Davenport English actor\nLaureano Barrau impressionist painter lived and died in the town\nSandra Cretu German singer lives in the town\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n Media related to Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Municipality of Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu\nS\u2019Argamassa Roman Fish Farm to the 1 km east of Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu\nLife and Death of a Spanish Town, Novel by Elliot Paul\nThe Roman Bridge, Pont Vell\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAjuntament de Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu\nConsell Insular d'Eivissa i Formentera\nPopulation figures of the Balearic Islands",

          "This beautiful church humbly situated in a quiet neighborhood. I was surprised that it was so quiet seemed like waiting quietly for people to discovered. We actually came by accident while looking for the cafe Can Joan for some ensaimada. What a great find!",
          "Unlike the cathedral and St Francis Basilica this church is free to enter and if you think that means its not worth visiting think again. Like so many churches in this region it is a tall building with fantastic ceilings and light filled spaces.",
          "We are staying close by this beautiful structure. While I was sitting on our rooftop, I saw people in the roof of this church. Went in, bought a 5 euro ticket to walk up and enjoyed it immensely.",
          "With so many magnificent sights to see around Palma after a while you get a little blase but this is another wonderful church to visit.",
          "I can recommend visiting it, especially the interior was very beautiful. You have to pay 5 euro and you can climb the stairs to the terrace. I was there alone. You have some nice views of the streets. It is not high at all so it is good to take photos. The girl at the entrance",
          "We stumbled upon the church wholly by accident while seeking shelter from a storm. Avoid the queues at the cathedral and come here instead.",
          "Sits in the square of Santa Eulalia. Nice location and a very dominating structure. No sign of the opening hours however.",
          "Never went in but even the outside is so nice to look at it is situated in a pleasant square with cafe bars in front of the main entrance and they are reasonably priced for a main city. great for photos if you go to see the cathedral you need to walk along the front of it until",
          "Church Santa Eulalia located on Plaza de Santa Eulalia should be one of the main target for visitors. It was one of the four oldest church in Mallorca and some of the wooden structures inside were still maintained in good condition. Nonetheless, opening hours of the church",

          "You can buy the 'Spiritual' ticket here or at any of the six religious sites (including the cathedral) to which it gives access, giving a significant saving over the individual tickets. The big highlight is the climb (stairs only) to the terrace, from where every half hour they",

          "We happened upon this church as we were aimlessly exploring Palma de Mallorca during our cruise port day. We were lucky to have caught it at a good time as after spending about 1/2 hr. inside, the bell was rung and visitors were signalled to vacate the premises. Intricate decor",
          "This is a relatively nice square with a few restaurants that were ok without being amazing. However the church in the square in beautiful and you can pay 5 euros to climb to the top where the views are just beautiful.",

          "Got to be honest I felt by the time we'd covered miles of Palma, & tried our best to see everything looking mildly cultural (unlike the holiday resorts) we were not at our best for yet another church. Yes it is a nice church, impressive architecture & imposing - but that's that",

          "In our visit to Palma we loved Santa Eulalia square, one of our favourite spots of the city to stop for a nice cup of coffee or a cold drink with a tapa. Always busy with a great atmosphere, the 3 cafes in the square are usually all busy with locals and tourists. Beautiful",
          "Happened her by chance on the ferry back from Es Carnes and hopped off to have a look. Had ghastly service from a cafe off the main drag by a waiter who looked as if he was on crack. Closer to the port the service was infinitely better. Some interesting shops and very pretty but",

          "In this very interesting church (a visit worth it all by itself) we attended a concert given by Palmas Banda Municipal de Musica, at least 50 members in the orchestra, in a series \"Musica Antiga\". With works from Bach and Tromboncino plus traditional works, it was a stunning",

          "A lovely church surrounded by some good restaurants. The church itself is worth visiting in the day if you can, as the stained glass windows let in a lot of light so you can see everything. It's also worth a visit in the evenings, if you're lucky, as it's transformed and must",

          "While strolling the old town of Palma I find it an excellent spot to sit have coffee and let all the sights be absorbed in you. It will really leave you a good sense of Palma\u00b4s old town. Santa Eulalia church is beautiful and San Francisco church is few steps from there.",

        "wiki": "Portofino (Italian pronunciation: [\u02ccp\u0254rto\u02c8fi\u02d0no]; Ligurian: Portofin [\u02ccp\u0254\u027etu\u02c8fi\u014b]) is an Italian fishing village and holiday resort famous for its picturesque harbour and historical association with celebrity and artistic visitors. It is a comune located in the Metropolitan City of Genoa on the Italian Riviera. The town is clustered around its small harbour, and is known for the colourfully painted buildings that line the shore.\n\n\n== History ==\nPliny the Elder (AD 23 \u2013 AD 79) referred to Portus Delphini (Port of the Dolphin) as on the Ligurian coast between Genoa and the Gulf of Tigullio.The village is mentioned in a diploma from 986 by Adelaide of Italy, which assigned it to the nearby Abbey of San Fruttuoso di Capodimonte. In 1171, together with the neighbouring Santa Margherita Ligure, it was included in Rapallo's commune jurisdiction. After 1229 it was part of the Republic of Genoa. The town's natural harbour supported a fleet of fishing boats, but was somewhat too cramped to provide more than a temporary safe haven for the growing merchant marine of the Republic of Genoa.\nIn 1409 Portofino was sold to the Republic of Florence by Charles VI of France, but when the latter was ousted from Genoa the Florentines gave it back. In the 15th century it was a fief of families such as the Fieschi, Spinola, Adorno, and Doria.\nIn 1815 it became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia and, from 1861, of the unified Kingdom of Italy.\nIn the late 19th century, first British, then other Northern European aristocratic tourists began to visit Portofino, which they reached by horse and cart from Santa Margherita Ligure. Aubrey Herbert and Elizabeth von Arnim were amongst the more famous English people to make the area fashionable. Eventually, more expatriates built expensive vacation houses, and by 1950 tourism had replaced fishing as the town's chief industry, and the waterfront was a continuous ring of restaurants and caf\u00e9s.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nStatue of Christ of the Abyss, placed underwater on 29 August 1954 in the inlet at a depth of 17 metres (56 ft). This statue was placed to protect fishermen and scuba divers and in memory of Dario Gonzatti, the first Italian to use SCUBA gear, who died in 1947. Sculpted by Guido Galletti, it represents Christ in the act of blessing while looking up towards the sky with open arms in a sign of peace.\nCastello Brown (16th century).\nChurch of St. Martin (Divo Martino, 12th century).\nChurch of St. George, housing some saints' relics.\nOratory of Santa Maria Assunta, in Gothic style.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Enchanted April, a 1922 best-selling novel by Elizabeth von Arnim based on the author's stay in Castello Brown, is credited with making Portofino fashionable. The novel was the basis of a 1991 feature filmed in the Castello, with a cast including Joan Plowright, Miranda Richardson and Alfred Molina. The film was nominated for three Oscars.Portofino is often thought to be the inspiration for Sir Clough Williams-Ellis' Italianate village named Portmeirion, built between 1925 and 1975, in north Wales. However, this was repeatedly denied by the architect. He stated only that he wanted to pay tribute to the atmosphere of the Mediterranean. He did, however, draw on a love of the Italian village, stating \"How should I not have fallen for Portofino? Indeed its image remained with me as an almost perfect example of the man-made adornment and use of an exquisite site.\"In 1959 Dalida released song \"Love in Portofino\", written by Leo Chiosso and composed by Fred Buscaglione. With lyrics in French and Italian language, it became a hit and was later iconized alongside the village's name. It also spawned several international covers, including Andrea Bocelli's in 2013 which was followed by a concert recorded and issued on DVD.Portofino is the eponym of Frank Schaeffer's Portofino: A Novel (1992). It was the first of Schaeffer's Calvin Becker Trilogy.Portofino is one of the shooting locations of the 1995 Antonioni / Wenders film, Beyond the Clouds.There is a full-scale replication, in authentic detail, of Portofino Bay at Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, USA, which opened in September 1999.Portofino inspired in 2001 a recreation of the seaside town in the Mediterranean Harbor area at Tokyo DisneySea in Chiba, Japan. It also served as the namesake for the restaurant Cafe Portofino.Portofino was also featured in 2008 for the television series Top Gear (Episode 5, Series 12). Richard Hammond, in a Ferrari Daytona raced James May in a carbon fibre powerboat from Portofino to St Tropez in France.Ferrari named one of their new V8 sports cars after Portofino in 2017.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nKing Richard I of England (1157-1199), in 1190\nPope Gregory XI (1330-1378), in 1377\nHenry Herbert (1831-1890), British Politician\nGuy de Maupassant (1850-1893), French writer\nGuglielmo Marconi (1874-1937), Italian engineer, inventor of radio\nGiuseppe Amisani (1879-1941), Italian painter\nMichele Cascella (1892-1989), Italian painter\nRex Harrison (1908-1990), English actor\nLilli Palmer (1914-1986), German actress, wife of Rex Harrison\n\n\n== Twin towns ==\n Kinsale, Republic of Ireland\n Palma, Spain\n Cassis, France\n\n\n== See also ==\nItalian Riviera\nList of castles in Italy\nCastello Brown\nCervara Abbey\nParaggi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Portofino travel guide from Wikivoyage\nPortofino\nPortofino tourism\nCity Hall\nPortofino Natural Park\nVirtual tour, Marine\nLove in Portofino song on YouTube",

          "These caves arent the biggest - however a good example of caves of similar nature. Easy to get to by Bus route 5. ( 30-40minutes from town center and only Euro1.50 bus fare - each way). Entry was Euro10/person. Takes about 40mins in a guided group - only less then 40meter in",
          "Loved the cave tour. Can\u2019t stand the tourist thing so wanted a different experience and this was it. Our guide was really funny and my teenage boys were very amused. Afterwards we ate at the restaurant and had a wonderful experience there too. Make sure to get the house rose.",

          "This is a strange one. The caves are nice. However the tour was extremely rushed for no reason. (It wasn't particularly busy.) Meaning there was virtually no opportunity to stand and admire the stalagmites! You had to keep your eyes on the steps while moving as it was quite dark",
          "I love natural things and arrived at the caves after a day of walking and stumbled upon the 46 bus stop near the Belver Castle and decided to make the journey since it was near 8pm when Google said it re-opens (after 4pm siesta). However, to my initial horror, I was told upon",

          "To tour the small caves, price is 10 euros for adults and 5 euros for children. Please note that the owner will charge teenagers as adults, meaning a 40 Euro cost for a family of 4. We watched a 5 minute video of the history of the caves, and then he took us for a walk through",

          "It was interesting to visit the caves, it would have been better if the \u201cEnglish guide \u201c actually was cable of just some basic language skills. It could though not take the beauty of the caves away but you can as well tour them yourself if allowed.",

          "Visited these caves on 3rd Sept 2017. After hearing they were the smallest caves in Mallorca we were very impressed at how beautiful they were and the history behind them. The caves are based inside a restaurant which is were you purchase the tickets and you receive a 10%",

          "Set in a little town just north of Palma, the Cuevas de Genova can be a little deceiving from the entrance as it looks like it is just a restaurant. We decided to walk through town and eat elsewhere so I cannot comment on the food here but the tour of the caves was very good.",
          "Our taxi driver convinced us to visit these caves before we head to the beach for a late lunch and swim. The caves are great. It's a long drive from the port where our cruise ship us docked but we managed to do the cave tour reasonably quickly There is a boat ride and light show",
          "We were accompanied to the cave's entrance by the guide, who also gave us some brief historical points and directions within the cave. We then discovered it on our own and took the time to take all the pictures we wanted. The cave itself is very small but well worth the trip. We",
          "Dinner was very good, prices are ok and scenery very nice. You can book a tour down to the caves with \"the waiter\" who knows a lot about food and even more about caves. Brilliant man!",
          "We visited the caves which are in the little village of Genova. The caves are within a restaurant area and a visit costs 10 euros per person. This includes a video showing. The restaurant serves coffee etc outside or you can have an excellent meal there too.",
          "Tours were given on a continuous cycle when one finished the next began. Each tour lasted around 30 minutes there were a total of 6 in our tour and 4 in the previous tour. You paid in the restaurant either by cash or credit card. Tours cost 10 euros with discounts for children.",

        "wiki": "Calvi\u00e0 (locally [k\u0259lvi\u02c8a]) is a municipality on the island of Majorca, part of the Spanish autonomous community of the Balearic Islands.  It is located in the southwestern part of the island of Majorca, between the Serra de Tramuntana and the Serra de Na Burguesa. The municipal seat is the town of Vila Calvia.Calvi\u00e0 has an approximate area of 145 km2 (56 sq mi). It is bordered on the north by the municipalities of Puigpunyent and Estellencs, Palma de Mallorca (Palma), the island's capital to the east, Andratx to the west and to the south by the Mediterranean Sea.\nAccording to the 2008 census, the municipality had a population of 50,777 inhabitants, of whom 18,046 were foreigners. Today, it is the second most populated area of the entire archipelago Balearic after Palma, and also an area that has the largest number of tourists in the islands.  Its population is scattered around the different urban centers created as a result of tourism development and twentieth century urbanization.\nThe historical epic that marked the most important local culture and traditions regarding the rest of Mallorca is the landing in Santa Ponsa on 10 September 1229 of King James I of Aragon, and the subsequent conquering of Muslims who had arrived in the year 903. Since 1248, Calvi\u00e0 has had its own parochial church, Sante Ihoannes Caviano.  Despite the popularity and use of the official shield locally, the municipality has no flag.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe origin of the place name is subject to conjecture but is believed to be from the patronymic Latin calvianum, derived from the personal name of Calvius. According to the philologist Antoni Maria Alcover, it comes from the word Caluus, meaning \"burn\" or \"be hot\", testament to the arid land that contains no vegetation.  The official name is Calvi\u00e0 (with a grave accent), but in Castilian, Calvi\u00e1 (with an acute accent) is used.Officially, the adjective to refer to inhabitants of Calvi\u00e0 is calvienses or calvieros. However, more widespread use in both Catalan and in its Castilian translation is calvianero/a. This is used by agencies such as the Institut Calvianer d'Esports del Ajuntament de Calvi\u00e0 and the Asociaci\u00f3n Calvianera.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\nThe municipality does not have a flag but has a distinctive coat of arms, defined as an azure blue shield with a paschal lamb holding a flag with a St George's Cross, capped by a crown. The coat of arms was approved on 25 June 1976 emblazoned with De azur y el cordero de plata que empu\u00f1a en su mano derecha una bandera de aquel metal, cargada con cruz de gules. Al timbre corona real, cerrada..\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nCalvi\u00e0 first appears in history as a village 2,000 years BCE, although the area was first populated in the Neolithic Era.  Later, sailors coming from the east stopped in the Balearics on their way to the Iberian Peninsula, where they sought metals. They came from Italy, from other Mediterranean islands, and from the Near East, and constructed small settlements along the coast. Historians call this period the \"Cave Culture\", because caves were frequently used as habitations and burial areas. Some vestiges of this area have been catalogued in an archaeological excavation called the Puig de sa Morisca Archaeological Park, which conserves remains of what was a talaiot 9 metres (30 ft) in diameter. It is located on a small mountainous elevation in Calvi\u00e0's Santa Ponsa district.\nThe Roman era lasted from 123 BCE until the 4th century CE, but left no significant vestiges. Among the few archaeological remnants of this era are the remains of a Roman villa in Santa Ponsa known as Sa Mesquida, which has an oven that was used to make ceramics, the horse-shoe shaped Naveta Alemany and the Tur\u00f3 de Ses Abelles.\nIn 425, the area was invaded by the Vandals, who ended up settling. Lack of remains or written record means little is known about this area other than the decline that began with the destruction of Pollen\u00e7a. The Byzantine general Flavius Belisarius ordered the conquest of the archipelago in 534, bringing an end to this era.\nThe first Muslim arrivals were in 707. They quickly ended the Byzantine domination and established their own hegemony. Until 903, the island was part of the Umayyad Caliphate.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 903, the Almoravid general Isam al-Jawlani conquered the island on behalf of Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi, Emir of C\u00f3rdoba. The city of Palma passed from the Almoravids to the Almohads, eventually becoming part of one of the taifas. Calvi\u00e1 was part of the administrative division Juz' d' Ahwaz al-Madina.\nIn 1229, after the Conquest of Mallorca by King James I of Aragon, colonists brought the Catalan language and culture, which survive to the present time. In the division of the conquered territory, Calvi\u00e0 formed part of the medietas magnatum that the king granted to nobles Guillermo II de Montcada, Hugo de Ampurias, Nu\u00f1o S\u00e1nchez and Berenguer de Palou, all of whom had participated in the conquest. Calvi\u00e0 in particular was granted to Berenguer de Palou, Bishop of Barcelona, becoming part of the Barony of the Bishops of Barcelona. There were many tensions among the conquering nobles who were granted various feudal rights; these were resolved through a pariatge or condominium under which feudal rights were shared. Therefore, the surroundings of the municipality are also known as the comarca of the Pariatge. Ultimately, though, the rights accrued to the Bishopric, which held them until 1834 when the Spanish Church lost many of its feudal properties.\n\nThe conquerors came, in various proportions from a variety of places. Thus, and according to the Llibre del Repartiment (\"Book of Distribution\"), the conquered lands were distributed among people from Catalonia (39.71%), Occitania (24.26%), Italy (16.19%), Aragon (7.35%), Navarra (5.88%), France (4.42%), Castile (1.47%) and Flanders (0.73%). Owing to the extermination or expulsion of the greater part of the prior local populace, there were not enough laborers to cultivate the land. In 1230 a set of privileges called the Franquezas de Mallorca were granted in order to attract new settlers to cultivate the countryside. Most of these new settlers of Mallorca came from Catalonia, more specifically the northeast and, within the east, from Ampurd\u00e1n. As a result, the dialect spoken today (Mallorqu\u00ed) is an eastern Catalan dialect.\nSince 1248, Calvi\u00e0 has had its own parish church, Sante Ihoannes Caviano, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. In 1285, during the reign of James II of Aragon, second son of James I, it gained the status of a villa. This meant it would have its own mayor, named by the king or governor. The mayor would execute orders from higher levels of government and would also maintain public order and administer justice. Nonetheless, he did not have the power to administer the villa, which fell within the purview of the jurados de prohombre, (a medieval office that was essentially a district overseer).\n\nIn the Middle Ages, various watchtowers were built to defend against Mediterranean piracy.To sustain the parish and its clerics, the king and the tenured landowners of the jurisdiction ceded one fourth of the diezmos paid to them by those who cultivated the land. This was, in turn, divided into four parts, three of which were granted to the rector of the parish and the fourth to the parish priest or vicar.James II of Majorca reigned over the islands for more than two decades and made great efforts to guarantee the viability of his kingdom. He undertook a broad policy of agrarian colonization, with the creation of rural nuclei; increased the royal revenue; favored the creation of consulates in North Africa and in the kingdom of Granada; created a new monetary system for the kingdom; promoted the creation of textile industries; increased royal power relative to that of the nobility and Church; and promoted the construction of palaces and castles such as the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, the La Seu Cathedral in Palma, and the Bellver Castle. The opening of the trials of the Knights Templar and the later suppression of the order allowed the Crown to take over their revenues in the islands.\nThe health system consisted mainly of physicians of Jewish origins, so-called Xuetas, descendants of Mallorcan Jews who had converted to Christianity, but continued to form a largely endogamous community. The nearest hospital to Calvi\u00e0 was in Sant Elm, founded in 1303 by Jaime II. Fundamentally it was dedicated to merchants and sailors of the ships that were heading from Palma to Barcelona. They also used it  as a refuge in bad weather.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nFrom the 13th century to the mid-20th century, the region was almost entirely agricultural. The first area to be cultivated was along the banks of the Bay of Santa Ponsa; at the time, the area was referred to as the t\u00e9rmino de Santa Ponsa; the expression t\u00e9rmino de Calvi\u00e1 came far later. Despite the long coast, people turned their backs to the sea, deriving their living from the dry and none-too-fertile land.\nAgriculture was based on latifundia\u2014large estates\u2014from the 14th century into the 20th. Most of the land was owned by a small number of nobles. In 1863, continuing a longstanding pattern 66.3% of the land was owned by four proprietors. At a slightly earlier date, Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana owned 2,516 hectares (6,220 acres), including all of Bendinat, Paguera, as well as an additional 990 hectares (2,400 acres) in the municipality of Andraitx. The Marquis of Bellpuig owned 4,376 hectares (10,810 acres) in Santa Ponsa, the largest latifundium in Mallorca at the beginning of the 19th century. On the other hand, there was a small group of peasants known as els roters, to whom the nobility had ceded land near the sea. These roters cultivated cereals, and lived in miserable conditions.\nIn the 16th century, Calvi\u00e0 itself largely escaped the plague that decimated the population elsewhere, although other nearby municipalities such as Andraitx suffered the scourge of the epidemic. Still, the population suffered other epidemics associated with the era and their way of life, particularly malaria which only a few escaped, such as the priest or the few artisans who did not work in Ses Rotes. The daily wage of a farm laborer was between four and six sous (a dozen eggs cost one-and-a-half sous). In that era there were also Arab slaves, although not in the maritime zones, where they were seen as liable to escape or to collaborate with pirates. In the 18th century a severe drought and bad cereal harvest led to a long period of famine. On 28 November 1715, Philip V of Spain abolished the fueros and privileges of the Balearics, as the Nueva Planta decrees extended the administrative organization of the Kingdom of Castile, prohibited the Catalan language, and required the use of Castilian Spanish in the islands. In 1748 the wretchedness of the municipality had become so severe that chronicler Pere Xamena Fiol described it as follows:\n\nWheat became so expensive that one paid 25 Sous per barchilla (unit to measure cereals, approximately 13.75 litres or 14.53 US quarts), and fortunate was he who could find some. Hunger reached the point where each house got no more than two doblers of bread, even if the family was large, and they gave permission to eat meat during Lent, and many people who didn't have the money to buy meat ate herbs, and they told me that some people had gone more than a fortnight eating only boiled herbs, and the poor people and workers were so thin that they couldn't work for lack of food.\nThe economic system rooted in latifundia underlay the Caciquism that made moot the theoretically democratic Spanish constitutions the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century. In Restoration Spain the power of the dominant classes remained intact. Both major political parties of the time, the Conservative Party led by Canovas del Castillo and the Liberal Party led by Sagasta relied on a system where day laborers and smallholders beholden to the caciques and voted accordingly, producing an orderly alternation of the two parties in power, the turno pac\u00edfico. In the late 19th century, hunger and poverty sparked emigration to the Americas, especially to Cuba and Argentina, as well as to France and Algeria.Calvi\u00e1 at that time lacked industrial establishments, except for the manufacturing of cement and plaster. The latifundia system was largely an impoverished agrarian autarky. In 1923 the Federaci\u00f3 Obrera Calvianera (\"Federation of Calvian Workers\") was founded as a member of the socialist Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores, followed by the Uni\u00f3 Agr\u00e0ria de Calvi\u00e0 (Calvian Agrarian Union) and La Fraternal. On 30 September 1923, Spain's socialist party, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, inaugurated a Casa del pueblo (a cultural and service center), which represented an investment of half a million Spanish pesetas. The labor movement and socialism played an important part in politics during the Second Spanish Republic, but were squashed during the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\n=== Contemporary era ===\n\nThe first seed of the modern tourism-based economy came when steamboat service from Barcelona to Palma began in 1838. This made travel to Mallorca easier for travelers from the Iberian peninsula and beyond. Some came to visit the municipality's coves and beaches. At this time Mallorca drew visitors who were motivated by the desire for adventure, an interest in exploring a different world and society than the one they knew, but also those who came to the island for therapeutic reasons. Among this last group was the composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. Works published by travelers, learned people, artists and geographers increasingly promoted Mallorca as a preferred destination.\nIn 1962, Calvi\u00e0 had four butcher shops, three bakeries, a dairy, ten grocery shops, three caf\u00e9s, two haberdashers, five carpenter's shops, two blacksmiths, a bicycle shop, and one bus line. Its scant industry consisted of five master masons, various ventures in shipping and transport, two cement and plaster factories, a trader in nuts and dried fruit, a machine for shucking almonds, a flour mill, a carob crusher, a wood dealer, and an oil press.\nThe first urban nuclei in the municipality began development in 1920, built on failed agricultural land sold well below its potential value. By 1960, changes in ownership had been so fundamental as to facilitate immediate development. Three quarters of the coast was rapidly developed, including all of the most desirable areas. Through their real estate affiliates, some of the last large landowners, such as Miguel Nigorra Oliver, president of the Banco de Cr\u00e9dito Balear, came to control nearly all of the development of Santa Ponsa. By 1986, the municipality had 10,000 of the dwellings locally known as chal\u00e9s (\"chalets\").On 30 July 2009, around two in the afternoon, the Palmanova neighborhood suffered a bombing attack by ETA. Two members of the Civil Guard were killed by a bomb placed under a patrol car outside their barracks; a second similar bomb was discovered and successfully defused.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nCalvi\u00e0 is located in the western part of the island of Majorca, next to the Sierra de Tramontana, the main mountain of the Balearic Islands, and extends to the Sierra de Na Burguesa, a mountain located in Calvia. Calvia has an area of about 145.02 km 2. Of a total of 14,372 hectares, 81% is protected rural land, 18% is developed urban land and 1% are soils with low protection.  It is bordered on the north by the municipality of Puigpunyent and Estellencs, Palma de Mallorca (Palma), the island's capital to the east, Andratx to the west and to the south by the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe highest point of the municipality is the Puig de Galatz\u00f3 at 1,026 m (3,366 ft) above sea level. The second is 926 metres above sea level, the Mola del Esclop, an area which consists of many valleys and ravines, between the hills of Puig Batiat and Penya Blanca.The peninsula on which the municipality is located is marked by the presence of wetlands to the east and west, at Magalluf, Palma Nova and Santa Ponsa, that lead to a narrowing similar to an isthmus to the north.The urban area has expanded around its coastline, converting into several villages on the main beaches. The coast extends from Cape Andritxol, until the area of Cas Catal\u00e0 Ses Illetas. It is 54 km (34 mi) long and very rocky, but still has 34 beaches and coves. There is 35.5 kilometres of rocky shores, 4.5 kilometres of sandy beaches, 10 islets and 7,000 hectares of coast, with a maximum depth of 5 m (16 ft). Islets include El Sec, Sa Porrassa, D'en Sales, Ses Illetes, D'estenedor and Sa Caleta. The most important though, ecologically, are the Malgrats and El Toro, having been designated as marine reserves and a special protection area for birds.\n\n\n=== Localities ===\nThe municipality contains eighteen settlements. The most important are the resorts. Palma Nova was one of the first tourist resorts to be built on the island within the grounds of an old farm called Ses Planes and began as a project intended to build a residential type Garden City, but due to the Spanish Civil War, this idea was discarded. In 2009, it was considered one of the most important tourist areas of Majorca. It is bounded on the west by the busy town of Magaluf which contains the largest hotel and greatest infrastructural services of the municipality to accommodate the many tourists.  Another of the localities, Santa Ponsa, has historical significance as the place that James I of Aragon landed. The town of Portals Nous is also a renowned meeting point for businessmen, celebrities, high society figures and members of the Spanish Royal Family during their summer stays in the Marivent Palace. Another of its main tourist areas is Paguera, where many residents spend their summer holidays, as well as a number of German tourists. Similarly, the urbanized residential areas of El Toro, which has a marina and a small beach, and Son Ferrer, are of note.\n\n\n=== Geology and relief ===\n\nThe topography is marked by the contrast between the mountains in the north and the rest of the municipality, where the features are flatter.\nThe main mountain range is called the Serra de Na Burguesa, situated between Son Falconer and Son Vida in Palma. It is the southernmost range of the Serra de Tramuntana. It was formerly known as Portop\u00ed or d'en Bou. It has an average height of 500 meters and is covered by large formations of Mediterranean pine forest and scrubland. The hills are composed of Triassic and Jurassic materials, mainly limestone and dolomite, with marl and gypsum present as well. The hills have a complex tectonic structure, forming a relief fold with many faults. The karst nature of the Tramuntana has led to the formation of numerous caves and sinkholes.The rest of the municipality is relatively flat, with broad valleys filled by quaternary and tertiary materials and small hills, with Mesozoic materials surfacing occasionally. This area contains a number of cavities divided between the area of Es Coll des Pastors and around the Puig Gros de Bendinat, Son Boronat, Benatiga Nou and Valldurgent. The Puig Gros de Bendinat depression contains abundant late Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments.  Its coastline is composed of calcareous materials.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCalvi\u00e0 has a mild Mediterranean climate with an average annual temperature of 19 \u00b0C and an average annual rainfall of 410 mm (16 in). It is influenced by two types of atmospheric circulation manifested in two distinct seasons: a hot, dry summer with little pressure gradient and occasional rainfall, as opposed to a cool, wet winter. The coldest month is January, with 15.1 / 3.5 \u00b0C and the hottest is August, with 31.0 / 18.2 \u00b0C. Rainfall averages 51 days a year and there are approximately 2,756 hours of sunshine. The average temperature in the summer is 27 \u00b0C, and 14 \u00b0C in winter. The driest month is July, at an average of 7.8 l / m2, while the wettest is December with an average of 81.1 l / m2.  The area is sheltered from the Nordic Tramuntana wind by mountains that are over a thousand feet high.\nThe thermal variation of the water has a range of around 15 \u00b0C. During the winter, it drops down to about 13 \u00b0C. In the late spring, warming occurs, raising the temperature one degree each week. During the summer, a 25 cm deep water layer reaches temperatures above 25 \u00b0C.(something of a thermocline).\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\nAccording to the Instituto Geol\u00f3gico y Minero de Espa\u00f1a (IGME), the area receives 4,900,000 cubic metres (6,400,000 cu yd) of rain per year, plus 100,000 cubic metres (130,000 cu yd) runoff from irrigation and 200,000 cubic metres (260,000 cu yd) infiltration of treated waste-water. 6,700,000 cubic metres (8,800,000 cu yd) is pumped annually for the water supply, but the current Balearic Hydrological Plan intends to reduce this to 4,100,000 cubic metres (5,400,000 cu yd).\n\n\n==== Ravines ====\nBecause of the torrential rains in October and November, Mallorca has many ravines, narrow channels that bring the rainwater to the sea. Among these are the Torrente (ravine) des Gorg, which rises in Es Capdell\u00e0 and enters the sea at Peguera. The Torrente Vial, rises on the outskirts of the village of Vial and runs to the Cala (cove) de Santa Ponsa; it receives the water of hundreds of smaller ravines, among which are the Barranco des Cobaix and the Barranco des Pas de la Mula. Among the longest is the Torrente de Galatz\u00f3, running 23 kilometres (14 mi) and draining a basin of 72 square kilometres (28 sq mi). It begins on the west slope of the Puig de Galatz\u00f3 and reaches the sea at the Bay of Santa Ponsa (Santa Pon\u00e7a).\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n\nMore than 49% of Calvi\u00e0's 14,552 hectares (35,960 acres) consists of woods and garrigues (low, soft-leaved scrubland), with pines as the dominant trees, although there has been some deforestation in recent decades. Cultivable land amounts to about 32% of the municipality; the main crops are almonds, carob (Ceratonia siliqua), olives and, to a lesser extent, figs. There is also still some farming of cereals and grains.\nAlthough the area has a harsh climate with few natural resources it is also densely populated by humans and there are relatively few populations of wild animals. The most notable zones for fauna are the rocky shore and the islands of Cala Figuera (Figuera Cove), such as El Toro, the islet of Refeubetx and the group of islets known as the Malgrats. This area has international recognition by the European Commission as a Special Protection Area for birds. In 2008, a diver in this reserve sighted and photographed a monk seal (Monachus monachus); it is believed that no more than 500 monk seals survive in the entire world. The Balearic government has studied the possibility of reintroducing monk seals to the islands.Local native plant species include holm oak (Quercus ilex) and various pine species. There are over 1,000 animal species; notable among them are the seabirds Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), various cormorants (Phalacrocorax), the common swift (Apus apus), and the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) as well as numerous reptiles, such as the endemic Lilford's wall lizard (Podarcis lilfordi) found on several of the islets of the archipelago. The islets are also home to one of Spain's few colonies of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni; other colonies are in Murcia and Almer\u00eda).Although the vegetation on the cliffs is sparse, it merits special interest as a habitat for endemic plant species such as the perennial herb Hippocrepis balearica, and Dianthus alpinus, whose Spanish-language names variously designate it as the \"cliff carnation\", \"forest carnation\" or \"Mediterranean carnation\". The cliff also provides a habitat for birds, especially raptors such as Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae) and osprey (Pandion haliaetus) as well as the world's only remaining insular cinereous vultures (black vulture, Aegypius monachus). Also worthy of mention, if only for gastronomical reasons, are two species of snail, Cornu aspersum and Helix pomatia.\nAmong the fungi, the autumn rains bring out the reproductive structures of the mushrooms. Of particular note is  Lactarius sangifluus, known locally as esclata-sang. This Lactarius is much appreciated for its singular flavor, and figures prominently in the local cuisine.The forest plants of the region can be divided into four groups:\n\nHerbaceous plants: the most common of these are nettles, fiddle dock (Rumex pulcher), and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare); heather(Calluna vulgaris) can also be found. Five endemic species of Limonium have evolved in the salty soils of Magalluf. In the garrigue of Santa Ponsa are several varieties of orchid (Orchis collina).\nShrubs: the most common shrub is the Mediterranean buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus), but there are also rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis),  thyme, a species of rock rose (Cistus albidus) several species of asparagus (Asparagus acutifolius, Asparagus albus, Asparagus officinalis), and common ivy (Hedera helix). Protected species include Mediterranean fan palm (Chamaerops humilis), myrtles, and Phoenicean juniper (Juniperus phoenicea).\nFerns: ferns of the Polypodium genus can be found in cooler or more shaded areas.\nTrees: the most common tree in the region's forests is Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis). These are plagued by a moth known as the pine processionary (Thaumetopoea pityocampa). A special brigade targets this moth, setting traps and destroying their nests. In the northern part of the province, although in lesser measure, there is holm oak (Quercus ilex), white poplar (Populus alba), narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), and strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMost of the people are either Spaniards from the mainland\u2014mainly from Andalusia\u2014or their descendants, who reached the island in the early 1960s, or they are foreign immigrants. According to the 2008 census, the municipality has a population of 50,777 inhabitants, of whom 25,548 were males and 25,229 were women ( 50.31% versus 49.69%).  The municipality has the second highest population in the Balearic Islands, second only to the capital, Palma de Mallorca.In 2017 the population was 49,063, including 14,822 foreigners (non-Spanish) registered with the town hall. The total population reached above 50,000 in 2008 but in 2015 began decreasing; in 2016 it had 49,580 people, including 15,623 registered foreigners.\n\n\n=== Population pyramid ===\nAnalysis of the population pyramid shows that:\n\n21% of the population is under the age of 20.\n32% of the population is aged 20\u201339 years.\n32% of the population is aged 40\u201359 years.\n15% of the population is 60 or older.This structure is typical of the modern demographic regime seen in much of Western Europe, with a population slowly aging as the birth rate diminishes.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe area contains many of Majorca's major tourism hotspots, with the localities of Magaluf (3,865), Santa Ponsa (8,188), El Toro (2,002), Paguera (3,400), Illetas (3,286), Portals Nous (2,395) and Palma Nova (5,975). It embraces six tourist zones with 60 kilometres of coastline, 27 beaches, 4 sport ports and 120.000 tourist units. The proximity of Palma with major road connections means that it can take as little as 15 minutes to reach the city centre. With massive tourism, estimated at 1.6 million visits per year and with a resident population that itself includes many expatriates, it is impossible to evaluate municipal income or expenditure as it relates only to the residents. What one can say is that Calvi\u00e0 appears to be one of the wealthiest municipalities in Europe, based on per capita public investment. In the early 1960s, Calvi\u00e0 began building a complete infrastructure for massive tourism, such as rapid construction of hotels. Later, more touristic features were added which included four professional golf courses (Club de Golf Poniente, Golf Sta Pon\u00e7a I, Golf Sta Pon\u00e7a II, Golf Sta Pon\u00e7a III and Golf Bendinat), water parks, a modern promenade called Paseig Calvi\u00e0. The 2004 World Chess Olympiad was held in Calvi\u00e0.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBisson, T. N. (1988). Hist\u00f2ria de la Corona d'Arag\u00f3 a l'Edat Mitjana (in Catalan).

        "wiki": "Juan Alberto March Ordinas (4 October 1880 \u2013 10 March 1962) was a Spanish businessman closely associated with the Nationalist side, led by Francisco Franco during and after the Spanish Civil War. Juan March was the wealthiest man in Spain and the sixth richest man in the world. The March family are among the richest in Spain, reported to be worth over US$5 billion.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJuan March Ordinas was born in Santa Margalida on the island of Majorca. As a young man, he smuggled tobacco from North Africa into Spain. During World War I, he supplied goods to both sides, evading the Allied blockade of the Central Powers, and the German U-boats.\nHis power and influence increased under different Spanish governments during the reign of King Alfonso XIII. In 1926 he created the Banca March in Majorca.\nWhen the monarchy was replaced by the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, March lost his influence, and was convicted and imprisoned for his illegal dealings. He escaped from prison, and fled to Gibraltar where his influence with the British government protected him against extradition.\nMarch was an important backer of the 1936 military rebellion against the Republic which led to the Civil War. He arranged Franco's flight from the Canary Islands to Spanish Morocco, brought the colonial troops there into the rebellion, and personally financed the Italian airlift of those troops to southern Spain.\nWith the Nationalist victory in 1939, March regained all his former influence and more, and was greatly favored in Francoist Spain. During World War II, the Allies employed him to keep Spain from joining the Axis. According to recently declassified documents, in 1941 the British government gave him US$10,000,000 with which to influence the top Spanish generals.\nIn 1944, March became a supporter of the claim of Don Juan de Borb\u00f3n, who had turned pro-Allies, to the Spanish throne. He also owned newspapers and funded political parties.\nAfter World War II, he was the seventh-richest man in the world. In 1955, he established the Juan March Foundation to support the arts, music, and social sciences.\nJuan March married Leonor Servera (1887\u20131957). They had two children: Juan March Servera (Palma de Mallorca, 1906 \u2013 Madrid, 1973) and Bartolome March (Palma de Mallorca, 1917 \u2013 Paris, 1998).\nBartolome March amassed one of the greatest 20th century art collections. At a young age, he started buying books and manuscripts. Later, he collected 18th century French furniture, and Baroque, Impressionist, Modern, and contemporary art, including works of Murillo, Goya, Vel\u00e1zquez, Picasso, Monet, Van Gogh, Mir\u00f3, Kandinsky, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, L\u00e9ger, Dal\u00ed, Fontana, Rothko, Klein, Francis Bacon, and many others. The March family collection is one of the most important in the world, and is reported to be worth over 1 billion USD.\nThe March family are still one of the richest families in Spain (after Amancio Ortega from Zara). They live between Madrid, Majorca and Gstaad. The Casa March, an imposing villa overlooking Cala Ratjada, Majorca and surrounded by an expansive sculpture garden, was built by Juan March in 1915; the gardens are open to guided tours.\n\n\n== Barcelona Traction ==\nMarch was widely known for involvement in lucrative illegal activities, bribery, political influence, and bending the law whenever he saw a benefit. This was exemplified in his 1948 takeover of the Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power Company (BTLP) for a small fraction of its real worth.\nBTLP was a utility company which provided power and streetcar services in Barcelona; originally incorporated in Canada, it was mostly owned by Belgian investors. BTLP had come through the Spanish Civil War largely undamaged, and was quite profitable. Its assets were about \u00a310,000,000 (about $500 million in 2010). However, for the convenience of some of its foreign investors, BTLP had issued some bonds denominated in pounds, and the interest on these bonds was payable in pounds. The Spanish government had imposed currency restrictions: BTLP was unable to exchange its Spanish pesetas for pounds, and so could not pay the interest.\nThis was not viewed with any great alarm by the bondholders; BTLP had plenty of pesetas and would pay the interest arrears whenever the currency restrictions were relaxed.\nHowever, March sensed an opportunity. Agents secretly acting for him quietly bought up the bonds (about \u00a3500,000). Then in February 1948, they appeared in a Spanish court, asserted that BTLP was in default on the bonds, and demanded immediate relief. The judge agreed and awarded ownership of all BTLP's assets to them (in fact to March). BTLP's foreign investors appealed, but got no relief from Spanish courts. The Belgian government appealed to the International Court of Justice but to no avail: the final resolution coming in 1970, eight years after March's death.\nThere is an example of March's worldwide notoriety in John D. MacDonald's 1962 novel, The Girl, the Gold Watch & Everything. At one point, one of the chief villains of the story complains of the difficulties of operating in the United States, where the police are honest and the press interferes. He remarks:\n\nIt was always better elsewhere, particularly in Spain, where Juan March would help with the arrangements.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nJuan March Ordinas is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Spanish lizard, Algyroides marchi.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDe Benavides, Manuel (1934).

        "wiki": "Las Palmas (UK: , US: ; Spanish: [las \u02c8palmas]), officially Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, is a city and capital of Gran Canaria island, in the Canary Islands, on the Atlantic Ocean.\nIt is the capital (jointly with Santa Cruz de Tenerife), the most populous city in the autonomous community of the Canary Islands, and the ninth-largest city in Spain with a population of 383,308 in 2010. It is also the fifth-most populous urban area in Spain and (depending on sources) ninth- or tenth-most populous metropolitan area in Spain.Las Palmas is located in the northeastern part of the island of Gran Canaria, about 150 km (93 mi) off the Moroccan coast in the Atlantic Ocean. Las Palmas experiences a hot desert climate, offset by the local cooler Canary Current, with warm temperatures throughout the year. It has an average annual temperature of 21.2 \u00b0C (70.2 \u00b0F). According to a study carried out by Thomas Whitmore, director of research on climatology at Syracuse University in the U.S., Las Palmas enjoys \"the best climate in the world\".The city was founded in 1478, and considered the de facto (without legal recognition) capital of the Canary Islands until the seventeenth century. It is the home of the Canarian Ministry of Presidency (shared in a four-year term with Santa Cruz de Tenerife), as well as half of the ministries and boards of the Canarian government, and the High Court of Justice of the Canary Islands.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe city was founded by Juan Rej\u00f3n on 24 June 1478, with the name \"Real de Las Palmas\". Rej\u00f3n was head of the invading Castilian army, which then engaged in war with the locals.In 1492, Christopher Columbus (Spanish: Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n) anchored in the port of Las Palmas and spent some time on the island on his first trip to the Americas. He also stopped there on the way back to Spain. The Col\u00f3n House museum in the Vegueta area of the city is named after him.\nIn 1595, Francis Drake tried to plunder the town, leading to the Battle of Las Palmas. A Dutch raid under vice-admiral Pieter van der Does in 1599 was only slightly more successful; some of the town was destroyed, but the raiders were repelled.\nLas Palmas' seaport, Puerto de la Luz (known internationally as La Luz port), benefited greatly from the closure of the Suez Canal during the Suez Crisis. Many foreign workers migrated to the city at this time.\nLas Palmas is a sister city of San Antonio, Texas, in the United States, which was founded in 1718 by about 25 Canary Islanders.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nLas Palmas is divided into five administrative districts, which in turn are subdivided into districts, not necessarily consistent with the traditional neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city has four main beaches: Las Canteras, Las Alcaravaneras, La Laja, and El Confital.\n\nPlaya de Las Canteras (Las Canteras Beach) is the largest beach in the city, and is frequented throughout the year by city dwellers as well as by large numbers of foreign visitors. The beach lies on the west side of the isthmus of Guanarteme, which links the peninsula of La Isleta, located to the northeast, with the rest of the island of Gran Canaria. The 3,100 m beach is oriented toward the northwest in what is known as Confital bow or bay, and stretches from the foothills of La Isleta until shortly before the mouth of the ravine Tamaraceite. Along much of this length, the beach is sheltered from most of the waves and currents of the Atlantic by a natural barrier of coral sandstone popularly known as \"the bar\", which is in easy swimming distance from shore. A system for environmental management has been introduced, and the beach has received ISO 14001 certification \u2013 one of only three beaches in Spain to do so, namely La Concha in San Sebasti\u00e1n and La Victoria in C\u00e1diz. Inside the beach runs the Paseo de Las Canteras, a wide pedestrian boardwalk, or sidewalk, which runs parallel to the beach from near the Auditorio Alfredo Kraus to the area known as \"Puntilla\" until reaching Playa del Confital.  La Playa de Las Canteras covers three areas that correspond to the arches and inflections that it conducts on the coast. Each presents certain morphological characteristics.\n\nPlaya de Las Alcaravaneras (Las Alcaravaneras beach) extends from the rising side of the Isthmus of Guanarteme, an old spit of sand dunes and mountains linking the peninsula of La Isleta, located to the northeast, with the rest of the island of Gran Canaria. It extends from the Real Club N\u00e1utico de Gran Canaria to the new marina breakwater of the city, for just over 800 metres (1\u20442 mi) of fine golden sand. The whole beach is serviced by the promenade, which starts in Las Alcaravaneras, connects with the Playa de San Cristobal, and ends in Playa de La Laja, 16 kilometres (10 mi) to the south. The promenade is one of the recreational areas of the city and is popular with people who take the opportunity to walk, run, play sports, or cycle. The tranquility of the bay, and yacht clubs close to the existing beach, make Playa de Las Alcaravaneras a great place to practice sports such as sailing and canoeing. The beach also offers facilities for sports such as beach volleyball, beach soccer or futv\u00f3ley (which has organized tournaments in the summer) and court sports such as basketball, indoor soccer, and volleyball.\nPlaya de la Laja (La Laja Beach), with fine gray sand, is approximately 1200 m long and has an average width of 40 m. Its moderate waves and currents are no longer dangerous since the construction of a dam in the south in the 1990s. At the time, the Ministry of Environment also trawled the seabed to bring sand onto the beach, and the construction of a boardwalk has significantly improved pedestrian access. Due to the intensity of its streams and incoming waves, La Laja has been hailed as a favorite surfers' beach. It is the starting point for boat races that occur every weekend between April and October.\nPlaya del Confital (Confital Beach), southwest of the peninsula of La Isleta, is the northern part of the large bay which contains Playa de Las Canteras and Playa del Confital. While Playa de Las Canteras is a long and wide, sandy beach, Playa del Confital is a narrower and mostly hard, volcanic beach equipped with comfortable foot paths and large, slanted slabs of stone suitable for relaxing, exercising and sunbathing. Advanced off the beach surfing replaces swimming as the major water activity on Playa del Confital. Until some years ago, the beach was home to a small shanty town, which has since been eradicated and the land of the Playa del Confital returned to general, public use. Ensuing improvements, however, proved controversial as some environmental organizations and residents questioned the legality of the proceedings. The waves arriving at the beach are highly thought of by amateur and professional surfers alike, some of whom consider the Confital as having one of the best right hand breaks in Europe. Here, the ocean currents form a tube that is used by more experienced surfers for its speed and strong contrasts. Each year, qualifying events for the professional world surfing championship take place on this beach.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLas Palmas has a desert climate (BWh) with warm dry summers and warm enough winters to classify it as a tropical climate. Its average annual temperature is 21.2 \u00b0C (70.2 \u00b0F)\u201328 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) during the day and 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) at night.

The Carnival of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is known not only in Spain but also worldwide, and is one of the main attractions for tourists. The city center of Las Palmas, specifically the Vegueta and Triana neighbourhoods, are included in the tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n=== Museums, theatres and exhibition halls ===\nThe Museo Canario is located in the historic district of Vegueta. Founded in 1879, it is an international partner of the Council for Scientific Research (CSIC). It has a valuable collection of Canary archaeological objects, which are exhibited in 16 halls. It is also equipped with a library of over 60,000 volumes, many of them dealing with the Canary Islands topics. Its archive covers the period from 1785 until today.\nThe Casa Museo de Col\u00f3n is in the Plaza de San Antonio Abad, behind the cathedral of Santa Ana.

It has permanent and temporary exhibitions that range from the historical avant-garde to the latest trends. It is located on Calle Los Balcones de Vegueta, and preserves the original fa\u00e7ade of the 18th century.\nThe Teatro P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s was designed by the architect Francisco Jare\u00f1o y Alarc\u00f3n in 1867. Its current appearance, with some modifications, is due to the intervention of Fernando Navarro and Miguel Mart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de la Torre after the fire that destroyed it almost entirely in 1928. Miguel Mart\u00edn's brother, the painter N\u00e9stor Mart\u00edn-Fern\u00e1ndez de la Torre, was commissioned to decorate the stalls, lounges and the stage. It was originally called Teatro Tirso de Molina until 1901, when, with the occasion of the premiere of Electra, the theatre was renamed after the canarian writer Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s.

It is considered a point of geological interest because of the Caldera de Bandama: this volcanic caldera reaches 569 m (1,867 ft) above sea level at the highest point on its rim, Pico de Bandama, and is about 1,000 m (3,300 ft) wide and 200 m (660 ft) deep. The steep walk to the bottom of the caldera takes about half an hour. Volcanic ash of different hues is in great abundance, and there are some interesting botanic species of Canary Islands origin. There are facilities for food and refreshments as well.\nArchaeological sites in Santa Br\u00edgida. In the valley of La Angostura and Las Meleguinas can find numerous traces of Aboriginal canaries that have prompted the declaration of the area as a Cultural, as groups of caves carved into rock, silos or sidewalks. In the archaeological site of El Tope, discovered on 16 July 1988, where you can see remnants that suggest the existence of an aboriginal burial mound, as well as ceramics, pottery and curious pintaderas. En la pared norte de la Caldera de Bandama se encuentra la Cueva de los Canarios, utilizada por los abor\u00edgenes como granero. It has been discovered Libyco-Berber inscriptions belonging to the ancient Guanche autochthones and some vessels (which are now in the Museo Canario). Also in the same area in the wall of the volcano in the stew is the Cueva de Los Frailes was discovered in 1933 a set of 37 caves.\nChurch of San Juan Bautista (also vulgarly known as Catedral de Arucas due to its big size) built entirely in Arucas stone by local master masons, and it dates from 1909 (Initial Configuration from the 17th century). Apart from the wealth of the carved stone columns and column heads, there are also some beautiful stained glass windows, the works of Canary Island painter Cristobal Hernandez de Quintana, and an extraordinary carving of the Reclining Christ, by Manuel Ramos.\nJard\u00edn de la Marquesa de Arucas \u2013 Botanical Garden in Arucas.\nIglesia de San Juan Bautista de Telde is the true spiritual centre of Telde. Located in the square of the same name and founded in 1483, the old church was erected by the Garcia del Castillo family at the time of the town's foundation. It still has the original gateway, an example of Sevillian\u2013Portuguese Gothic architecture. The towers, however, are an example of early 20th neo-Gothic construction. The real marvels are inside the building: the statue of Christ on the main altar, made from corn dough by the Pur\u00e9pecha Mexican Indians, brought here before 1550, the Flemish Gothic main altar, which dates back to before 1516, and the triptych of the Virgin Mary, brought from Flanders, also in the 16th century, depicting five religious scenes.\nBas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pino in Teror from 1760.\nArchaeological sites in Telde. Telde has 101 archaeological sites and 709 listed assets of ethnographic interest. In regard to the aboriginal time deposits, each year it expands its number or discover new aspects of old fields, but most are in disrepair and many are disappearing. Some of the most prominent are the coastal town of Tufia, in good condition and extensively excavated by archaeologists; Four Doors cave site, Telde, a large cave with four doors located on top of a mountain and overlooking the teldense plain; an almogar\u00e9n (religious vessel) at the top; a troglodyte village with collective barn in the back, the caves of Tara and Cendro remains of the ancient center of population, the town of Draguillo on the border with Ingenio, Las Cuevas Chalasia which consist of a labyrinthine series of artificial caves linked by tunnels and the impressive Necropolis of Jin\u00e1mar which includes more than 500 tombs of various types belonging to the old canary.\nBas\u00edlica de San Juan Bautista in Telde\nBas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pino in Teror from 1760.\nPalacete Rodriguez Quegles, an eclectic modernist mansion from the turn of the 20th century, it is a  venue for exhibitions and other cultural events, and the center for coordinating events around the city.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Diocese of Canarias (Catholic Church), Spanish Evangelical Church (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Union of Evangelical Baptists of Spain (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God. There are also Muslim mosques.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads and highways ===\n\nUrban road infrastructure is overburdened on workdays and in certain areas; the city street plan is not at all rectilinear, and may be confusing even to experienced drivers. However, there are no toll roads; entrances, exits, main streets and important zones are all well-signposted.\nLas Palmas, being the centre of the Las Palmas metropolitan area, is the hub for the island's motorway network. The city is linked with three highways: the GC-1 to the south, the GC-2 to the west and GC-3 to the center of the island.\nThe GC-1 links the capital with Puerto de Mog\u00e1n in the south. It is the fastest route from the top of the island to the bottom and vice versa with a speed limit of 120 km/h (75 mph). It is approximately 75 km (47 mi) in length and runs along the eastern and the southern coasts, and is also the second longest superhighway in the Canary Islands. The road provides easy access from the Airport to the major cities and resorts, which include Maspalomas and Playa del Ingl\u00e9s. The increase in tourism over the years has necessitated the route's upgrading and widening to cope with traffic growth. The GC-1 begins south of the downtown area of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the highway runs within the beach of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and 2 km (1 mi) south intersects with the GC-2 and later runs with a few clover leaf interchanges and later forms a junction with GC-5 and south, the GC-31.\n\nThe GC-2 North Highway connects Las Palmas with the small northern port and village of Agaete. The eastern portion \u2013 about 20 km (12 mi) in length \u2013 is a superhighway with interchange numbers, the rest of the highway is a two-laned; the western part is also only two-laned and has exit numbers. The highway begins by the beach area of the island, and runs through the downtown area, linking with the GC31 at a roundabout interchange. The freeway runs within the beaches and the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean for the half part but at around the 20th km, it becomes a highway after the unidirectional parclo interchanges and runs within the coastline, it later has several interchanges and several towns as it passes to the northwest and finally, it ends in Agaete.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nLas Palmas is served by Gran Canaria Airport, also called Las Palmas Airport (IATA: LPA, ICAO: GCLP).\nThe airport is located in the eastern part of the island, about 18 km (11 mi) from Las Palmas city centre. In 2008, it handled 10,212,106 passengers and 33,695,248 kg (74,285,306 lb) of cargo, and is the fourth busiest in Spain. It is also the only airport on the islands with two runways, thus can accommodate up to 53 landings and take-offs per hour. The lengthy runways made the airport an alternative landing site for the NASA Space Shuttle. This airport is also a base for Binter Canarias and Navegacion y Servicios A\u00e9reos Canarios, airlines which operate regional inter-island flights within the Canary Islands.\nAn airbase of the Spanish Air Force is located to the east of the runways. Beyond several hangars opposite the passenger terminal, the Gando Air Base (Base A\u00e9rea de Gando) contains ten shelters situated on the southern end of the eastern runway.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPuerto de Las Palmas (Las Palmas Port), also known as Puerto de la Luz, is a main port for fishing, commercial, passenger and sports in the northwest of the city. It has been the traditional base for scale and supplying ships on their way through the Middle Atlantic for five centuries. The Port of Las Palmas is not only the first port of the Canary Islands, it is one of the main ports of Spain and the first of the geographical area of West Africa. As the leading port in the mid-Atlantic, it serves as the crossroads between Europe, Africa and America. In 2007, the port received some 11,262 ships; it welcomed a total of 907,782 cruise passengers, a 16.26% increase on 2006. In terms of annual TEU, the port of Las Palmas ranks as the 5th in Spain, and is among the first 15 ports of Europe.The Port of Las Palmas is the first Mid-Atlantic fishing base, with an annual traffic of more than 4,500 stopovers and with some 400,000 tons of frozen fish processed. Despite experiencing some decline in recent years, it retains its dominance in the fishing industry over other ports in the Canary Islands. The port provides 175,000 m3 (6,180,067 cu ft) of cold storage facilities. At the foot of pier, special refrigerated containers and preparation rooms for frozen products can carry out the entire chain of post-processing and storage of fish, from refrigeration and distribution, to manufacture and supply of industrial ice. The port's EU-approved border inspection post is responsible for inspecting all types of imports and exports between the European Economic Union and its trading partners.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLas Palmas boasts a high quality bus system, provided by Guaguas Municipales. Municipal Bus Lines offers 40 urban transport routes, covering both the bottom and the top of the city. The main lines are the 1 (Teatro \u2013 Puerto), 2 (Alameda de Col\u00f3n \u2013 Puerto), 17 (Teatro \u2013 El Rinc\u00f3n), 25 (Campus Universitario \u2013 El Rinc\u00f3n), 12 (Puerto \u2013 Hoya de la Plata) and 30 (Alameda de Col\u00f3n \u2013 Santa Catalina, via Rehoyas). In addition, two circular lines (A: Santa Catalina \u2013 Santa Catalina, via Alcaraveneras) and B (Santa Catalina \u2013 Santa Catalina, via Ciudad Alta).\nThe most important bus lines have frequencies of between 3 and 15 minutes during the day and between 10 and 40 minutes at night; most lines have service throughout the night. The bright yellow buses are known simply as 'guaguas'. The unique tariff, paid directly to the driver, is 1.30 euro. A 10-ride ticket is available for \u20ac7.50 at official shops in the city. The Tarjeta Insular (Island Card) which offered a 20% discount on both municipal buses and Global buses was discontinued on 1 January 2011.\nGlobal, inter-hire company, has 119 lines, many to or from the capital. This company was formed in 2000, resulting from the merger of the previous Salcai and interurban lines Utinsa.\nThere is also the Guagua Tur\u00edstica, which covers the most interesting sites of the city with a guide in several languages.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThere is currently no rail transport system on Gran Canaria. Between 1893 and 1944 steam tram ran between Las Palmas and Puerto de La Luz. The line was electrified in 1910, although the line reverted to steam traction in 1944, when trams were hauled by a steam locomotive known as La Pepa. A reproduction of this locomotive is now on display in the Elder Museum in Las Palmas. In the early 1970s an experimental elevated railway line operated through Las Palmas. Called the Tren Vertebrado (\"vertebrate train\"), it was designed by Basque engineer Alejandro Goicoechea and consisted of an unusual low-profile train running on elevated concrete tracks through the city. The project was unsuccessful and was dismantled in 1974.In the early 21st century, plans were put forward by the Gran Canaria Cabildo to develop a rapid transit railway line on Gran Canaria. If built, the Tren de Gran Canaria (TGC) line would run along the eastern coast and connect Las Palmas with the airport and Maspalomas in the south. In 2004 the Spanish Ministry of Development put a contract out to competitive tender for a feasibility study on a 50 km railway line from Las Palmas to Maspalomas. This railway project is currently abandoned due to funding difficulties.\nAnother project is the Tramway Palmas (Gran Canaria), which would cover the same journey as the bus line 1, with an average frequency of 5 minutes and a journey time of 35 minutes.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nLas Palmas is home to three major professional sports teams. These are:\n\nUD Las Palmas \u2013 association football club playing in Spain\u2019s Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. The team play their home games at Estadio de Gran Canaria, with a capacity of 32,665.

          "Firstly,do not take any notice of bad reviews, we knew it was going to be casual and no frills. Did not expect such good service, food and entertainment. Cleanliness was priority, my hands never been so clean! We cruised 19th May - 2nd June, went to wonderful places, Calvi,",
          "This is our fourth cruise, but if it had been our first it would have been our last! People have said this is a 'cheap' cruise - it was NOT a cheap cruise, but it was certainly sub-standard! I had not realized that their idiom 'casual and informal' was a euphemism for 'chaotic",
          "This is the most beautiful beach. I have spent 3 wonderful holidays in the area and walked the length of the beach many times",
          "This is one of the best beaches in Mallorca, but you need to choose a location Close to the suburb of Can Pastilla, Close to the Airport and 8 km from Palma. The further towards Arenal you get, the more touristic (and not in a good way).",
          "Island Escape Cruise, was a great experience, we have now enjoyed several cruises, have to say this was a big and beautiful ship, clean and extremely well run. Welcoming staff teams, everyone of them worked very very hard to make your holiday pleasurable. Food was top quality,",

          "Liked everything about the place. This is not like Magaluf or Palmanova it is lot more relaxed and people are a lot more friendly. The tourist trains along the coast are great for to catch the breeze on a hot day. Buses are plentiful into Palma if you are in a hurry get the 25",

          "Loved the long promenade along a great beach. Also loved the fact that you could walk from Arenal to Palma safely in the sunshine. Loads of shops, restaurants and cafes all along the bay. Everything geared towards the German tourist, this was not a problem for me, it made a nice",

          "The first thing you notice about the island escape is its size. It\u2019s a big ship and yes it\u2019s getting on a bit. However you will only notice its age if you look close. You won\u2019t have to look too close in the tired and cramped basic cabins. However that\u2019s where any bad news ends.",

          "I read lots of negative reviews so was feeling a bit nervous as this was our first cruise however there was no need as we had a great week. If you are used to 5 star luxury cruise ships then you may well be disappointed with the Island Escape. Yes the rooms may be a bit tatty",

          "Wow. 4 cruise virgins now back having had a great week. I was wary of the food given that all inclusive food is usually no better than poor. On the boat it was very good (OK not the very best) giving me a pleasant surprise. The AI drinks were 'local' so again whilst not the best",
          "Recently returned from the island escape cruise around the Med. Travelled with my 2 sisters all in our 50's and had a smashing time. Flew from Belfast and picked up ship in Palma. We were on the 5th deck and I can honestly say I never once felt I was on a ship-very smooth. This",

        "wiki": "Madrid (, Spanish: [ma\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei\u00f0]) is the capital and most-populous city of Spain. The city has almost 3.3 million inhabitants and a metropolitan area population of approximately 6.5 million. It is the second-largest city in the European Union (EU), surpassed only by Berlin, and its monocentric metropolitan area is the second-largest in the EU, surpassed only by Paris. The municipality covers 604.3 km2 (233.3 sq mi).Madrid lies on the River Manzanares in the center of both the country and the Community of Madrid region, of which it is also the capital. As the capital city of Spain, seat of government, residence of the Spanish monarch, Madrid is also the political, economic and cultural centre of the country. The mayor is Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida from the People's Party.\nThe Madrid urban agglomeration has the third-largest GDP in the European Union and its influence in politics, education, entertainment, environment, media, fashion, science, culture, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the world's major global cities. Madrid is home to two world-famous football clubs, Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Due to its economic output, high standard of living, and market size, Madrid is considered the major financial centre and the leading economic hub of the Iberian Peninsula and of Southern Europe. It hosts the head offices of the vast majority of major Spanish companies, such as Telef\u00f3nica, IAG or Repsol. Madrid is also the 10th most liveable city in the world according to Monocle magazine, in its 2017 index.Madrid houses the headquarters of the UN's World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB), the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI), and the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB). It also hosts major international regulators and promoters of the Spanish language: the Standing Committee of the Association of Spanish Language Academies, headquarters of the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE), the Instituto Cervantes and the Foundation of Urgent Spanish (Fund\u00e9u BBVA). Madrid organises fairs such as FITUR, ARCO, SIMO TCI and the Madrid Fashion Week.While Madrid possesses modern infrastructure, it has preserved the look and feel of many of its historic neighbourhoods and streets. Its landmarks include the Plaza Mayor, the Royal Palace of Madrid; the Royal Theatre with its restored 1850 Opera House; the Buen Retiro Park, founded in 1631; the 19th-century National Library building (founded in 1712) containing some of Spain's historical archives; many national museums, and the Golden Triangle of Art, located along the Paseo del Prado and comprising three art museums: Prado Museum, the Reina Sof\u00eda Museum, a museum of modern art, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, which complements the holdings of the other two museums. Cibeles Palace and Fountain has become one of the monument symbols of the city.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are three established theories regarding the origin of the toponym \"Madrid\" (all of them with problems when it comes to fully explain the phonetic evolution of the toponym along history), namely:\nA Celtic origin (Madrid < * Magetoritum; with the root \"-ritu\" meaning \"ford\").\nFrom the Arabic ma\u01e7r\u00e0 (meaning \"water stream\").\nA Mozarabic variant of the Latin matrix, matricis (also meaning \"water stream\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nAlthough the site of modern-day Madrid has been occupied since prehistoric times, and there are archaeological remains of Carpetani settlement, Roman villas, a Visigoth basilica near the church of Santa Mar\u00eda de la Almudena and three Visigoth necropoleis near Casa de Campo, Tet\u00faan and Vic\u00e1lvaro, the first historical document about the existence of an established settlement in Madrid dates from the Muslim age. At the second half of the 9th century, Cordobese Emir Muhammad I built a fortress on a headland near the river Manzanares, as one of the many fortresses he ordered to be built on the border between Al-Andalus and the kingdoms of Le\u00f3n and Castile, with the objective of protecting Toledo from the Christian invasions and also as a starting point for Muslim offensives. After the disintegration of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in the early 11th century, Madrid was integrated in the Taifa of Toledo.\nIn the context of the wider campaign for the conquest of the taifa of Toledo initiated in 1079, Madrid was seized in 1083 by Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile, who sought to use the town as an offensive outpost against the city of Toledo, in turn conquered in 1085. Following the conquest, Christians occupied the center of the city, while Muslims and Jews were displaced to the suburbs. Madrid, located near Alcal\u00e1 (under Muslim control until 1118), remained a borderland for a while, suffering a number of razzias during the Almoravid period and its walls were destroyed in 1110. The city was confirmed as villa de realengo (linked to the Crown) in 1123, during the reign of Alfonso VII. The 1123 Charter of Otorgamiento established the first explicit limits between Madrid and Segovia, namely the Puerto de El Berrueco and the Puerto de Lozoya. Since 1188, Madrid won the right to be a city with representation in the courts of Castile. In 1202, Alfonso VIII gave Madrid its first charter to regulate the municipal council, which was expanded in 1222 by Ferdinand III. The government system of the town was changed to a regimiento of 12 regidores by Alfonso XI on 6 January 1346.Since the mid-13th century and up to the late 14th century, the concejo of Madrid vied for the control of the Real de Manzanares territory against the concejo of Segovia, a powerful town north of the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range, characterised by its repopulating prowess and its husbandry-based economy, contrasted by the agricultural and less competent in repopulation town of Madrid. After the decline of Sep\u00falveda, another concejo north of the mountain range, Segovia had become a major actor south of the Guadarrama mountains, expanding across the Lozoya and Manzanares rivers to the north of Madrid and along the Guadarrama river course to its west.In 1309, the Courts of Castile convened at Madrid for the first time under Ferdinand IV, and later in 1329, 1339, 1391, 1393, 1419 and twice in 1435.\n\n\n=== Modern Age ===\nDuring the revolt of the Comuneros, led by Juan de Padilla, Madrid joined the revolt against Charles, Holy Roman Emperor, but after defeat at the Battle of Villalar, Madrid was besieged and occupied by the imperial troops. The city was however granted the titles of Coronada (Crowned) and Imperial.\n\nThe number of urban inhabitants grew from 4,060 in the year 1530 to 37,500 in the year 1594. The poor population of the court was composed of ex-soldiers, foreigners, rogues and Ruanes, dissatisfied with the lack of food and high prices. In June 1561 Phillip II set his court in Madrid, installing it in the old alc\u00e1zar. Thanks to this, the city of Madrid became the political centre of the monarchy, being the capital of Spain except for a short period between 1601 and 1606, in which the Court was relocated to Valladolid (and the Madrid population temporarily plummeted accordingly). The capitality was decisive for the evolution of the city and influenced its fate and during the rest of the reign of Philip II, the population boomed, going up from about 18,000 in 1561 to 80,000 in 1598.\n\nDuring the early 17th century, although Madrid recovered from the loss of the capital status, with the return of diplomats, lords and affluent people, as well as an entourage of noted writers and artists together with them, extreme poverty was however rampant. The century also was a time of heyday for theatre, represented in the so-called corrales de comedias.The city changed hands several times during the War of the Spanish succession: from the Bourbon control it passed to the allied \"Austracist\" army with Portuguese and English presence that entered the city in late June 1706, only to be retaken by the Bourbon army on 4 August 1706. The Habsburg army led by the Archduke Charles entered the city for a second time in September 1710, leaving the city less than three months after. Philip V definitely entered the capital on 3 December 1710.Seeking to take advantage of the Madrid's location at the geographic centre of Spain, the 18th century saw a sustained effort to create a radial system of communications and transports for the country through public investments.Philip V built the Royal Palace, the Royal Tapestry Factory and the main Royal Academies. The reign of Charles III, who came to be known as \"the best mayor of Madrid\", saw an effort to turn the city into a true capital, with the construction of sewers, street lighting, cemeteries outside the city and a number of monuments and cultural institutions. The reforms enacted by his Sicilian minister were however opposed in 1766 by the populace in the so-called Esquilache Riots, a revolt demanding to repeal a clothing decree banning the use of traditional hats and long cloaks aiming to curb crime in the city.\n\nIn the context of the Peninsular War, the situation in French-occupied Madrid after March 1808 was becoming more and more tense. On 2 May, a crowd began to gather near the Royal Palace protesting against the French attempt to evict the remaining members of the Bourbon royal family to Bayonne, prompting up an uprising against the French Imperial troops that lasted hours and spread throughout the city, including a famous last stand at the Montele\u00f3n barracks. Subsequent repression was brutal, with many insurgent Spaniards being summarily executed. The uprising led to a declaration of war calling all the Spaniards to fights against the French invaders.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Liberal State ===\n\nThe city was invaded on 24 May 1823 by a French army\u2014the so-called Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis\u2014called to intervene to restore the absolutism of Ferdinand that the latter had been deprived from during the 1820\u20131823 trienio liberal. Unlike other European capitals, during the first half of the 19th century the only noticeable bourgeois elements in Madrid (that experienced a delay in its industrial development up to that point) were merchants. The University of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares was relocated to Madrid in 1836, becoming the Central University.The economy of the city further modernized during the second half of the 19th century, consolidating his status as service and financial centre, although in the other hand the new industries were mostly focused in book edition, construction and low-tech sectors. The introduction of railway transport greatly helped Madrid's economic prowess, and it also led to changes in consumption patterns (such as substitution of salted fish by fresh fish from the Spanish coasts) as well as further strengthening of the city role as logistics node in the country's distribution network. Electric lightning in the streets was introduced in the 1890s.During the first third of the 20th century the population nearly doubled, reaching more than 850,000 inhabitants. New suburbs such as Las Ventas, Tetu\u00e1n and El Carmen became the homes of the influx of workers, while Ensanche became a middle-class neighbourhood of Madrid.\n\n\n=== Second Republic and Civil War ===\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1931 was the first legislated on the state capital, setting it explicitly in Madrid.\nDuring the 1930s, Madrid enjoyed \"great vitality\"; it was demographically young, but also young in the sense of its relation with the modernity. During this time the prolongation of the Paseo de la Castellana towards the North was projected. The proclamation of the Republic slowed down the building of new housing. The tertiary sector gave thrust to the economy. Illiteracy rates were down to below 20%, and the city's cultural life grew notably during the so-called Silver Age of Spanish Culture; the sales of newspaper also increased. Anti-clericalism and Catholicism lived side by side in Madrid; the burning of convents initiated after riots in the city in May 1931 worsened the political environment. The 1934 insurrection largely failed in Madrid.Madrid was one of the most heavily affected cities of Spain in the Civil War (1936\u20131939). The city was a stronghold of the Republican faction from July 1936 and became an international symbol of anti-fascist struggle during the conflict. Its western suburbs were the scene of an all-out battle in November 1936 and during the Civil War the city was also bombed by aeroplanes. The city fell to the Francoists in March 1939.\n\n\n=== Francoist dictatorship ===\n\nA staple of the Post-war Madrid (Madrid de la posguerra) was the widespread use of ration coupons. Meat and fish consumption was scarce, and starvation and lack of proteins were a cause of high mortality. As the protracted right-wing despise towards the city nurtured during the Second Republic turned up to eleven during the war, the victors toyed with the possibility of moving the capital elsewhere (most notably to Seville), yet such plans did not materialize, and the Francoist regime conducted then an attempt to resignificate the city, stemming from the Spanish Imperial ideal.The intense demographic growth experienced by the city via mass immigration from the rural areas of the country led to the construction of plenty of housing in the peripheral areas of the city to absorb the new population (reinforcing the processes of social polarization of the city), initially comprising substandard housing (with as many as 50,000 shacks scattered around the city by 1956). A transitional planning intended to temporarily replace the shanty towns were the poblados de absorci\u00f3n, introduced since the mid-1950s in locations such as Canillas, San Ferm\u00edn, Ca\u00f1o Roto, Villaverde, Pan Bendito, Zof\u00edo and Fuencarral, aiming to work as a sort of \"high-end\" shacks (with the destinataries participating in the construction of their own housing) but under the aegis of a wider coordinated urban planning.The municipality grew through the annexation of neighbouring municipalities, achieving the present extension of 607 km2 (234.36 sq mi). The south of Madrid became very industrialised, and there were massive migrations from rural areas of Spain into the city. Madrid's newly built north-western districts became the home of the new thriving middle class that appeared as result of the 1960s Spanish economic boom, while the south-eastern periphery became an extensive working-class settlement, which was the base for an active cultural and political reform.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nAfter the death of Franco and the start of the democratic regime, the 1978 constitution confirmed Madrid as the capital of Spain. The 1979 municipal election brought Madrid's first democratic mayor since the Second Republic.\nMadrid was the scene of some of the most important events of the time, such as the mass demonstrations of support for democracy after the failed coup, 23-F, on 23 February 1981. The first democratic mayors belonged to the centre-left PSOE (Enrique Tierno Galv\u00e1n, Juan Barranco Gallardo). Since the late 1970s and through the 1980s Madrid became the center of the cultural movement known as la Movida. Conversely, just like in the rest of the country, a heroin crisis took a toll in the poor neighborhoods of Madrid in the 1980s.\n\nBenefiting from increasing prosperity in the 1980s and 1990s, the capital city of Spain consolidated its position as an important economic, cultural, industrial, educational, and technological centre on the European continent. During the mandate as Mayor of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez del Manzano construction of traffic tunnels below the city proliferated. The following administrations, also conservative, led by Alberto Ruiz-Gallard\u00f3n and Ana Botella launched three unsuccessful bids for the 2012, 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympics. By 2005, Madrid was the leading European destination for migrants from developing countries, as well as the largest employer of non-European workforce in Spain. Madrid was a centre of the anti-austerity protests that erupted in Spain in 2011. As consequence of the spillover of the 2008 financial and mortgage crisis, Madrid has been affected by the increasing number of second-hand homes held by banks and house evictions. The mandate of left-wing Mayor Manuela Carmena (2015\u20132019) delivered the renaturalization of the course of the Manzanares across the city.\nSince the late 2010s, the challenges the city faces include the increasingly unaffordable rental prices (often in parallel with the gentrification and the spike of tourist apartments in the city centre) and the profusion of betting shops in working-class areas, equalled to an \"epidemics\" among the young people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nMadrid lies on the southern Meseta Central, 60 km south of the Guadarrama mountain range and straddling the Jarama and Manzanares river sub-drainage basins, in the wider Tagus River catchment area. There is a considerable difference in altitude within the city proper ranging from the 700 m (2,297 ft) around Plaza de Castilla in the north of city to the 570 m (1,870 ft) around La China wastewater treatment plant on the Manzanares' riverbanks, near the latter's confluence with the Fuente Castellana thalweg in the south of the city. The Monte de El Pardo (a protected forested area covering over a quarter of the municipality) reaches its top altitude (843 m (2,766 ft)) on its perimeter, in the slopes surrounding El Pardo reservoir located at the north-western end of the municipality, in the Fuencarral-El Pardo district.The oldest urban core is located on the hills next to the left bank of the Manzanares River. The city grew to the east, reaching the Fuente Castellana Creek (now the Paseo de la Castellana), and further east reaching the Abro\u00f1igal Creek (now the M-30). The city also grew through the annexation of neighbouring urban settlements, including those to the South West on the right bank of the Manzanares.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMadrid has an inland Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa) in the western half of the city transitioning to a semi-arid climate (BSk) in the eastern half. Winters are cool due to its altitude, which is approximately 667 m (2,188 ft) above sea level, including sporadic snowfalls and frequent frosts between December and February. Summers are hot, in the warmest month, July, average temperatures during the day range from 32 to 34 \u00b0C (90 to 93 \u00b0F) depending on location, with maxima commonly climbing over 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) during the frequent heat waves. Due to Madrid's altitude and dry climate, diurnal ranges are often significant during the summer. The highest recorded temperature was on 24 July 1995, at 42.2 \u00b0C (108.0 \u00b0F), and the lowest recorded temperature was on 16 January 1945 at \u221215.3 \u00b0C (4.5 \u00b0F). These records were registered at the airport, in the eastern side of the city. Precipitation is concentrated in the autumn and spring, and, together with Athens which has similar annual precipitation, Madrid is the driest capital in Europe. It is particularly sparse during the summer, taking the form of about two showers and/or thunderstorms during the season.\n\n\n=== Water supply ===\n\nIn the 17th century, the so-called \"viajes de agua\" (a kind of water channels or qanat) were used to provide water to the city. Some of the most important ones were the Viaje de Amaniel (1610\u20131621, sponsored by the Crown), the Viaje de Fuente Castellana (1613\u20131620) and Abro\u00f1igal Alto/Abro\u00f1igal Bajo (1617\u20131630), sponsored by the City Council. They were the main infrastructure for the supply of water until the arrival of the Canal de Isabel II in the mid-19th century.Madrid derives almost 73.5 percent of its water supply from dams and reservoirs built on the Lozoya River, such as the El Atazar Dam. This water supply is managed by the Canal de Isabel II, a public entity created in 1851. It is responsible for the supply, depurating waste water and the conservation of all the natural water resources of the Madrid region.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Madrid has overall increased since the city became the capital of Spain in the mid-16th century, and has stabilised at approximately 3 million since the 1970s.\nFrom 1970 until the mid-1990s, the population dropped. This phenomenon, which also affected other European cities, was caused in part by the growth of satellite suburbs at the expense of the downtown region within the city proper.\nThe demographic boom accelerated in the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century due to immigration in parallel with a surge in Spanish economic growth.\nThe wider Madrid region is the EU region with the highest average life expectancy at birth. The average life expectancy was 82.2 years for males and 87.8 for females in 2016.As the capital city of Spain, the city has attracted many immigrants from around the world, with most of the immigrants coming from Latin American countries. In 2020, around 76 % of the registered population was Spain-born, while, regarding the foreign-born population (24 %), the bulk of it relates to the Americas (around 16 % of the total population), and a lesser fraction of the population is born in other European, Asian and African countries.\nAs of 2019 the highest rising national group of immigrants was Venezuelans.Regarding religious beliefs, according to a 2019 Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) survey with a sample size of 469 respondents, 20.7% of respondents in Madrid identify themselves as practising Catholics, 45.8% as non-practising Catholics, 3.8% as believers of another religion, 11.1% as agnostics, 3.6% as indifferent towards religion, and 12.8% as atheists. The remaining 2.1% did not state their religious beliefs.The Madrid metropolitan area comprises Madrid and the surrounding municipalities. According to Eurostat, the \"metropolitan region\" of Madrid has a population of slightly more than 6.271 million people covering an area of 4,609.7 square kilometres (1,780 sq mi). It is the largest in Spain and the third largest in the European Union.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government and administration ===\n\nThe City Council (Ayuntamiento de Madrid) is the body responsible for the government and administration of the municipality. It is formed by the Plenary (Pleno), the Mayor (alcalde) and the Government Board (Junta de Gobierno de la Ciudad de Madrid).\nThe Plenary of the Ayuntamiento is the body of political representation of the citizens in the municipal government. Its 57 members are elected for a 4-year mandate. Some of its attributions are: fiscal matters, the election and deposition of the mayor, the approval and modification of decrees and regulations, the approval of budgets, the agreements related to the limits and alteration of the municipal term, the services management, the participation in supramunicipal organisations, etc.The mayor, the supreme representative of the city, presides over the Ayuntamiento. He is charged with giving impetus to the municipal policies, managing the action of the rest of bodies and directing the executive municipal administration. He is responsible to the Pleno. He is also entitled to preside over the meetings of the Pleno, although this responsility can be delegated to another municipal councillor. Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, a member of the People's Party, serves as Mayor since 2019.\nThe Government Board consists of the mayor, the deputy mayor(s) and a number of delegates assuming the portfolios for the different government areas. All those positions are held by municipal councillors.Since 2007, the Cybele Palace (or Palace of Communications) serves as City Hall.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nMadrid is administratively divided into 21 districts, which are further subdivided into 131 neighbourhoods (barrios):\n\n\n=== Regional capital ===\nMadrid is the capital of the Community of Madrid. The region has its own legislature and it enjoys a wide range of competencies in areas such as social spending, healthcare, education. The seat of the regional parliament, the Assembly of Madrid is located at the district of Puente de Vallecas. The presidency of the regional government is headquartered at the Royal House of the Post Office, at the very centre of the city, the Puerta del Sol.\n\n\n=== Capital of Spain ===\nMadrid is the capital of the Kingdom of Spain. The King of Spain, whose functions are mainly ceremonial, has his official residence in the Zarzuela Palace. As the seat of the Government of Spain, Madrid also houses the official residence of the President of the Government (Prime Minister) and regular meeting place of the Council of Ministers, the Moncloa Palace, as well as the headquarters of the ministerial departments. Both the residences of the Head of State and Government are located at the northwest of the city. Additionally, the seats of the Lower and Upper Chambers of the Spanish Parliament, the Cortes Generales (respectively, the Palacio de las Cortes and the Palacio del Senado), also lie on Madrid.\n\n\n=== Law enforcement ===\n\nThe Madrid Municipal Police (Polic\u00eda Municipal de Madrid) is the local law enforcement body, dependent on the Ayuntamiento. As of 2018, it had a workforce of 6,190 civil servants.The headquarters of both the Directorate-General of the Police and the Directorate-General of the Civil Guard are located in Madrid. The headquarters of the Higher Office of Police of Madrid (Jefatura Superior de Polic\u00eda de Madrid), the peripheral branch of the National Police Corps with jurisdiction over the region also lies on Madrid.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nLittle medieval architecture is preserved in Madrid, mostly in the Almendra Central, including the San Nicol\u00e1s and San Pedro el Viejo church towers, the church of San Jer\u00f3nimo el Real, and the Bishop's Chapel. Nor has Madrid retained much Renaissance architecture, other than the Bridge of Segovia and the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales.\n\nPhilip II moved his court to Madrid in 1561 and transformed the town into a capital city. During the Early Hapsburg period, the import of European influences took place, underpinned by the monicker of Austrian style. The Austrian style featured not only Austrian influences but also Italian and Dutch (as well as Spanish), reflecting on the international preeminence of the Hapsburgs. During the second half of the 16th-century the use of pointy slate spires in order to top structures such as church towers was imported to Spain from Central Europe. Slate spires and roofs consequently became a staple of the Madrilenian architecture at the time.Stand out architecture in the city dating back to the early 17th-century includes several buildings and structures (most of them attributed to Juan G\u00f3mez de Mora) such as the Palace of the Duke of Uceda (1610), the Monastery of La Encarnaci\u00f3n (1611\u20131616); the Plaza Mayor (1617\u20131619) or the C\u00e1rcel de Corte (1629\u20131641), currently known as the Santa Cruz Palace. The century also saw the construction of the former City Hall, the Casa de la Villa.The Imperial College church model dome was imitated in all of Spain. Pedro de Ribera introduced Churrigueresque architecture to Madrid; the Cuartel del Conde-Duque, the church of Montserrat, and the Bridge of Toledo are among the best examples.\n\nThe reign of the Bourbons during the eighteenth century marked a new era in the city. Philip V tried to complete King Philip II's vision of urbanisation of Madrid. Philip V built a palace in line with French taste, as well as other buildings such as St. Michael's Basilica and the Church of Santa B\u00e1rbara.\nKing Charles III beautified the city and endeavoured to convert Madrid into one of the great European capitals. He pushed forward the construction of the Prado Museum (originally intended as a Natural Science Museum), the Puerta de Alcal\u00e1, the Royal Observatory, the Basilica of San Francisco el Grande, the Casa de Correos in Puerta del Sol, the Real Casa de la Aduana, and the General Hospital (which now houses the Reina Sofia Museum and Royal Conservatory of Music). The Paseo del Prado, surrounded by gardens and decorated with neoclassical statues, is an example of urban planning. The Duke of Berwick ordered the construction of the Liria Palace.\nDuring the early 19th century, the Peninsular War, the loss of viceroyalties in the Americas, and continuing coups limited the city's architectural development (Royal Theatre, the National Library of Spain, the Palace of the Senate, and the Congress). The Segovia Viaduct linked the Royal Alc\u00e1zar to the southern part of town.\n\nThe list of key figures of madrilenian architecture during the 19th and 20th centuries includes authors such as Narciso Pascual y Colomer, Francisco Jare\u00f1o y Alarc\u00f3n, Francisco de Cubas, Juan Bautista L\u00e1zaro de Diego, Ricardo Vel\u00e1zquez Bosco, Antonio Palacios, Secundino Zuazo, Luis Guti\u00e9rrez Soto, Luis Moya Blanco and Alejandro de la Sota.From the mid-19th century until the Civil War, Madrid modernised and built new neighbourhoods and monuments. The expansion of Madrid developed under the Plan Castro, resulting in the neighbourhoods of Salamanca, Arg\u00fcelles, and Chamber\u00ed. Arturo Soria conceived the linear city and built the first few kilometres of the road that bears his name, which embodies the idea. The Gran V\u00eda was built using different styles that evolved over time: French style, eclectic, art deco, and expressionist.\nAntonio Palacios built a series of buildings inspired by the Viennese Secession, such as the Palace of Communication, the C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes, and the R\u00edo de La Plata Bank (now Instituto Cervantes). Other notable buildings include the Bank of Spain, the neo-Gothic Almudena Cathedral, Atocha Station, and the Catalan art-nouveau Palace of Longoria. Las Ventas Bullring was built, as the Market of San Miguel (Cast-Iron style).\n\nFollowing the Francoist takeover that ensued the end of Spanish Civil war, architecture experienced an involution, discarding rationalism and, eclecticism notwithstanding, going back to an overall rather \"outmoded\" architectural language, with the purpose of turning Madrid into a capital worthy of the \"Immortal Spain\". Iconic examples of this period include the Ministry of the Air (a case of herrerian revival) and the Edificio Espa\u00f1a (presented as the tallest building in Europe when it was inaugurated in 1953). Many of these buildings distinctly combine the use of brick and stone in the fa\u00e7ades. The Casa Sindical marked a breaking point as it was the first to reassume rationalism, although that relinking to modernity was undertaken through the imitation of the Italian Fascist architecture.With the advent of Spanish economic development, skyscrapers, such as Torre Picasso, Torres Blancas and Torre BBVA, and the Gate of Europe, appeared in the late 20th century in the city. During the decade of the 2000s, the four tallest skyscrapers in Spain were built and together form the Cuatro Torres Business Area. Terminal 4 at\nMadrid-Barajas Airport  was inaugurated in 2006 and won several architectural awards.\nTerminal 4 is one of the world's largest terminal areas and features glass panes and domes in the roof, which allow natural light to pass through.\n\n\n=== Parks and forests ===\n\nMadrid is the European city with the highest number of trees and green surface per inhabitant and it has the second highest number of aligned trees in the world, with 248,000 units, only exceeded by Tokyo. Madrid's citizens have access to a green area within a 15-minute walk. Since 1997, green areas have increased by 16%. At present, 8.2% of Madrid's grounds are green areas, meaning that there are 16 m2 (172 sq ft) of green area per inhabitant, far exceeding the 10 m2 (108 sq ft) per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization.\nA great bulk of the most important parks in Madrid are related to areas originally belonging to the royal assets (including El Pardo, Soto de Vi\u00f1uelas, Casa de Campo, El Buen Retiro, la Florida and the Pr\u00edncipe P\u00edo hill, and the Queen's Casino). The other main source for the \"green\" areas are the bienes de propios owned by the municipality (including the Dehesa de la Villa, the Dehesa de Arganzuela or Viveros).El Retiro is the most visited location of the city. Having an area bigger than 1.4 km2 (0.5 sq mi) (350 acres), it is the largest park within the Almendra Central, the inner part of the city enclosed by the M-30. Created during the reign of Philip IV (17th century), it was handed over to the municipality in 1868, after the Glorious Revolution. It lies next to the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid.\nLocated northwest of the city centre, the Parque del Oeste (\"Park of the West\") comprises part of the area of the former royal possession of the \"Real Florida\", and it features a slope as the height decreases down to the Manzanares. Its southern extension includes the Temple of Debod, a transported ancient Egyptian temple.Other urban parks are the Parque de El Capricho, the Parque Juan Carlos I (both in northeast Madrid), Madrid R\u00edo, the Enrique Tierno Galv\u00e1n Park, the San Isidro Park as well as gardens suchs as the Campo del Moro (opened to the public in 1978) and the Sabatini Gardens (opened to the public in 1931) near the Royal Palace.\nFurther west, across the Manzanares, lies the Casa de Campo, a large forested area with more than 1700 hectares (6.6 sq mi) where the Madrid Zoo, and the Parque de Atracciones de Madrid amusement park are located. It was ceded to the municipality following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931.The Monte de El Pardo is the largest forested area in the municipality. A holm oak forest covering a surface over 16,000 hectares, it is considered the best preserved mediterranean forest in the Community of Madrid and one of the best preserved in Europe. Already mentioned in the Alfonso XI's Libro de la monter\u00eda from the mid 14th-century, its condition as hunting location linked to the Spanish monarchy help to preserve the environmental value. During the reign of Ferdinand VII the regime of hunting prohibition for the Monte de El Pardo became one of full property and the expropriation of all possessions within its bounds was enforced, with dire consequences for the madrilenians at the time. It is designated as Special Protection Area for bird-life and it is also part of the Regional Park of the High Basin of the Manzanares.\nOther large forested areas include the Soto de Vi\u00f1uelas, the Dehesa de Valdelatas and the Dehesa de la Villa. As of 2015, the most recent big park in the municipality is the Valdebebas Park. Covering a total area of 4.7 km,2 it is sub-divided in a 3.4 km2 (1.3 sq mi) forest park (the Parque Forestal de Valdebebas), a 0.8 km2 (0.31 sq mi) periurban park as well as municipal garden centres and compost plants.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAfter it became the capital of Spain in the 16th century, Madrid was more a centre of consumption than of production or trade. Economic activity was largely devoted to supplying the city's own rapidly growing population, including the royal household and national government, and to such trades as banking and publishing.\nA large industrial sector did not develop until the 20th century, but thereafter industry greatly expanded and diversified, making Madrid the second industrial city in Spain. However, the economy of the city is now becoming more and more dominated by the service sector. A major European financial center, its stock market is the third largest stock market in Europe featuring both the IBEX 35 index and the attached Latibex stock market (with the second most important index for Latin American companies). It concentrates about the 75 % of banking operations in the country.Madrid is the 5th most important leading Centre of Commerce in Europe (after London, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam) and ranks 11th in the world. It is the leading Spanish-speaking city in terms of webpage creation.\n\n\n=== Economic history ===\nAs the capital city of the Spanish Empire from 1561, Madrid's population grew rapidly. Administration, banking, and small-scale manufacturing centred on the royal court were among the main activities, but the city was more a locus of consumption than production or trade, geographically isolated as it was before the coming of the railways.\nThe Bank of Spain is one of the oldest European central banks. Originally named as the Bank of San Carlos as it was founded in 1782, it was later renamed to Bank of San Fernando in 1829 and ultimately became the Bank of Spain in 1856. Its headquarters are located at the calle de Alcal\u00e1.\nThe Madrid Stock Exchange was inaugurated on 20 October 1831. Its benchmark stock market index is the IBEX 35.\nIndustry started to develop on a large scale only in the 20th century, but then grew rapidly, especially during the \"Spanish miracle\" period around the 1960s. The economy of the city was then centred on manufacturing industries such as those related to motor vehicles, aircraft, chemicals, electronic devices, pharmaceuticals, processed food, printed materials, and leather goods. Since the restoration of democracy in the late 1970s, the city has continued to expand. Its economy is now among the most dynamic and diverse in the European Union.\n\n\n=== Present-day economy ===\n\nMadrid concentrates activities directly connected with power (central and regional government, headquarters of Spanish companies, regional HQ of multinationals, financial institutions) and with knowledge and technological innovation (research centres and universities). It is one of Europe's largest financial centres and the largest in Spain. The city has 17 universities and over 30 research centres. It is the second metropolis in the EU by population, and the third by gross internal product. Leading employers include Telef\u00f3nica, Iberia, Prosegur, BBVA, Urbaser, Dragados, and FCC.The Community of Madrid, the region comprising the city and the rest of municipalities of the province, had a GDP of \u20ac220B in 2017, equating to a GDP per capita of \u20ac33,800. In 2011 the city itself had a GDP per capita 74% above the national average and 70% above that of the 27 European Union member states, although 11% behind the average of the top 10 cities of the EU. Although housing just over 50% of the region's's population, the city generates 65.9% of its GDP. Following the recession commencing 2007/8, recovery was under way by 2014, with forecast growth rates for the city of 1.4% in 2014, 2.7% in 2015 and 2.8% in 2016.The economy of Madrid has become based increasingly on the service sector. In 2011 services accounted for 85.9% of value added, while industry contributed 7.9% and construction 6.1%. Nevertheless, Madrid continues to hold the position of Spain's second industrial centre after Barcelona, specialising particularly in high-technology production. Following the recession, services and industry were forecast to return to growth in 2014, and construction in 2015.\n\n\n==== Standard of living ====\n\nMean household income and spending are 12% above the Spanish average. The proportion classified as \"at risk of poverty\" in 2010 was 15.6%, up from 13.0% in 2006 but less than the average for Spain of 21.8%. The proportion classified as affluent was 43.3%, much higher than Spain overall (28.6%).Consumption by Madrid residents has been affected by job losses and by austerity measures, including a rise in sales tax from 8% to 21% in 2012.Although residential property prices have fallen by 39% since 2007, the average price of dwelling space was \u20ac2,375.6 per sq. m. in early 2014, and is shown as second only to London in a list of 22 European cities.\n\n\n==== Employment ====\nParticipation in the labour force was 1,638,200 in 2011, or 79.0%. The employed workforce comprised 49% women in 2011 (Spain, 45%). 41% of economically active people are university graduates, against 24% for Spain as a whole.In 2011, the unemployment rate was 15.8%, remaining lower than in Spain as a whole. Among those aged 16\u201324, the unemployment rate was 39.6%. Unemployment reached a peak of 19.1% in 2013, but with the start of an economic recovery in 2014, employment started to increase. Employment continues to shift further towards the service sector, with 86% of all jobs in this sector by 2011, against 74% in all of Spain. In the second quarter of 2018 the unemployment rate was 10.06%.  \n\n\n==== Services ====\n\nThe share of services in the city's economy is 86%. Services to business, transport & communications, property & financial together account for 52% of total value added. The types of services that are now expanding are mainly those that facilitate movement of capital, information, goods and persons, and \"advanced business services\" such as research and development (R&D), information technology, and technical accountancy.Madrid and the wider region's authorities have put a notable effort in the development of logistics infrastructure. Within the city proper, some of the standout centres include Mercamadrid, the Madrid-Abro\u00f1igal logistics centre, the Villaverde's Logistics Centre and the Vic\u00e1lvaro's Logistics Centre to name a few.Banks based in Madrid carry out 72% of the banking activity in Spain. The Spanish central bank, Bank of Spain, has existed in Madrid since 1782. Stocks & shares, bond markets, insurance, and pension funds are other important forms of financial institution in the city.\n\nMadrid is an important centre for trade fairs, many of them coordinated by IFEMA, the Trade Fair Institution of Madrid. The public sector employs 18.1% of all employees. Madrid attracts about 8M tourists annually from other parts of Spain and from all over the world, exceeding even Barcelona. Spending by tourists in Madrid was estimated (2011) at \u20ac9,546.5M, or 7.7% of the city's GDP.The construction of transport infrastructure has been vital to maintain the economic position of Madrid. Travel to work and other local journeys use a high-capacity metropolitan road network and a well-used public transport system. In terms of longer-distance transport, Madrid is the central node of the system of autov\u00edas and of the high-speed rail network (AVE), which has brought major cities such as Seville and Barcelona within 2.5 hours travel time. Also important to the city's economy is Madrid-Barajas Airport, the fourth largest airport in Europe. Madrid's central location makes it a major logistical base.\n\n\n==== Industry ====\nAs an industrial centre Madrid retains its advantages in infrastructure, as a transport hub, and as the location of headquarters of many companies. Industries based on advanced technology are acquiring much more importance here than in the rest of Spain. Industry contributed 7.5% to Madrid's value-added in 2010. However, industry has slowly declined within the city boundaries as more industry has moved outward to the periphery. Industrial Gross Value Added grew by 4.3% in the period 2003\u20132005, but decreased by 10% during 2008\u20132010. The leading industries were: paper, printing & publishing, 28.8%; energy & mining, 19.7%; vehicles & transport equipment, 12.9%; electrical and electronic, 10.3%; foodstuffs, 9.6%; clothing, footwear & textiles, 8.3%; chemical, 7.9%; industrial machinery, 7.3%.The PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn plant is located in Villaverde district.\n\n\n==== Construction ====\n\nThe construction sector, contributing 6.5% to the city's economy in 2010, was a growing sector before the recession, aided by a large transport and infrastructure program. More recently the construction sector has fallen away and earned 8% less in 2009 than it had been in 2000. The decrease was particularly marked in the residential sector, where prices dropped by 25%\u201327% from 2007 to 2012/13 and the number of sales fell by 57%.\n\n\n==== Tourism ====\n\nMadrid is the seat of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the International Tourism Fair (FITUR).\nIn 2018, the city received 10.21 million tourists (53.3% of them international tourists).p. 9 The biggest share of international tourists come from the United States, followed by Italy, France, United Kingdom and Germany.p. 10 As of 2018, the city has 793 hotels, 85,418 hotel places and 43,816 hotel rooms.p. 18 It also had, as of 2018, an estimated 20,217 tourist apartments.p. 20The most visited museum was the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, with 3.8 million visitors in the sum of its three seats in 2018. Conversely, the Prado Museum had 2.8 million visitors and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum 906,815 visitors.p. 32By the late 2010s, the gentrification and the spike of tourist apartments in the city centre led to an increase in rental prices, pushing residents out of the city centre. Most of the tourist apartments in Madrid (50\u201354%) are located in the Centro District. In the Sol neighborhood (part of the latter district), 3 out of 10 homes are dedicated to tourist apartments, and 2 out of 10 are listed in AirBnB. In April 2019 the plenary of the ayuntamiento passed a plan intending to regulate this practice, seeking to greatly limit the number of tourist apartments. The normative would enforce a requirement for independent access to those apartments in and out of the street. However, after the change of government in June 2019, the new municipal administration plans to revert the regulation.\n\n\n==== International rankings ====\nA recent study placed Madrid 7th among 36 cities as an attractive base for business.  It was placed third in terms of availability of office space, and fifth for easy of access to markets, availability of qualified staff, mobility within the city, and quality of life. Its less favourable characteristics were seen as pollution, languages spoken, and political environment. Another ranking of European cities placed Madrid 5th among 25 cities (behind Berlin, London, Paris and Frankfurt), being rated favourably on economic factors and the labour market, and on transport and communication.\n\n\n=== Media and entertainment ===\nMadrid is an important film and television production hub, whose content is distributed throughout the Spanish-speaking world and abroad. Madrid is often seen as the entry point into the European media market for Latin American media companies, and likewise the entry point into the Latin American markets for European companies. Madrid is the headquarters of media groups such as Radiotelevisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, Atresmedia, Mediaset Espa\u00f1a Comunicaci\u00f3n, and Movistar+, which produce numerous films, television shows and series which are distributed globally on various platforms. Since 2018, the region is also home to Netflix's Madrid Production Hub, Mediapro Studio, and numerous others such as Viacom International Studios. As of 2019, the film and television industry in Madrid employs 19,000 people (44% of people in Spain working in this industry).\n\nRTVE, the state-owned Spanish Radio and Television Corporation is headquartered in Madrid along with all its TV and radio channels and web services (La 1, La 2, Clan, Teledeporte, 24 Horas, TVE Internacional, Radio Nacional de Espa\u00f1a), Radio Exterior de Espa\u00f1a, Radio Cl\u00e1sica. The Atresmedia group (Antena 3, La Sexta, Onda Cero) is headquartered in nearby San Sebasti\u00e1n de los Reyes. The television network and media production company, the largest in Spain, Mediaset Espa\u00f1a Comunicaci\u00f3n (Telecinco, Cuatro) maintains its headquarters in Fuencarral-El Pardo district. The Spanish media conglomerate PRISA (Cadena SER, Los 40 Principales, M80 Radio, Cadena Dial) is headquartered in Gran V\u00eda street in central Madrid.\nMadrid is home to numerous newspapers, magazines and publications, including ABC, El Pa\u00eds, El Mundo, La Raz\u00f3n, Marca, \u00a1Hola!, Diario AS, El Confidencial and Cinco D\u00edas. The Spanish international news agency EFE maintains its headquarters in Madrid since its inception in 1939. The second news agency of Spain is the privately owned Europa Press, founded and headquartered in Madrid since 1953.\n\n\n== Art and culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and cultural centres ===\n\nMadrid is considered one of the top European destinations concerning art museums. Best known is the Golden Triangle of Art, located along the Paseo del Prado and comprising three major museums: the Prado Museum, the Reina Sof\u00eda Museum, and the Thyssen Bornemisza Museum.\nThe Prado Museum (Museo del Prado) is a museum and art gallery that features one of the world's finest collections of European art, from the 12th century to the early 19th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection.

Located next to the Royal Palace and the Almudena, Patrimonio Nacional has tentatively scheduled its opening for 2021.\n\nThe Museum of the Americas (Museo de Am\u00e9rica) is a national museum that holds artistic, archaeological, and ethnographic collections from the Americas, ranging from the Paleolithic period to the present day.Other notable museums include the National Museum of Natural Sciences (the Spain's national museum of natural history), the Naval Museum, the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales (with many works of Renaissance and Baroque art, and Brussels tapestries inspired by paintings of Rubens), the Museum of L\u00e1zaro Galdiano (housing a collection specialising in decorative arts, featuring a collection of weapons that features the sword of Pope Innocent VIII), the National Museum of Decorative Arts, the National Museum of Romanticism (focused on 19th century Romanticism), the Museum Cerralbo, the National Museum of Anthropology (featuring as highlight a Guanche mummy from Tenerife) the Sorolla Museum (focused in the namesake Valencian Impressionist painter, also including sculptures by Auguste Rodin, part of Sorolla's personal effects), or the History Museum of Madrid (housing pieces related to the local history of Madrid), the Wax Museum of Madrid, the Railway Museum (located in the building that was once the Delicias Station).\nMajor cultural centres in the city include the Fine Arts Circle (one of Madrid's oldest arts centres and one of the most important private cultural centres in Europe, hosting exhibitions, shows, film screenings, conferences and workshops), the Conde Duque cultural centre or the Matadero Madrid, a cultural complex (formerly an abattoir) located by the river Manzanares. The Matadero, created in 2006 with the aim of \"promoting research, production, learning, and diffusion of creative works and contemporary thought in all their manifestations\", is considered the third most valued cultural institution in Madrid among art professionals.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nMadrid has been one of the great centres of Spanish literature. Some of the best writers of the Spanish Golden Century were born in Madrid, including: Lope de Vega (Fuenteovejuna, The Dog in the Manger, The Knight of Olmedo), who reformed the Spanish theatre, a work continued by Calderon de la Barca (Life is a Dream), Francisco de Quevedo, Spanish nobleman and writer known for his satires, which criticised the Spanish society of his time, and author of El Busc\u00f3n. And finally, Tirso de Molina, who created the character Don Juan. Cervantes and G\u00f3ngora also lived in the city, although they were not born there. The homes of Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Gongora and Cervantes are still preserved, and they are all in the Barrio de las Letras (District of Letters).\nOther writers born in Madrid in later centuries have been Leandro Fernandez de Morat\u00edn, Mariano Jos\u00e9 de Larra, Jose de Echegaray (Nobel Prize in Literature), Ram\u00f3n G\u00f3mez de la Serna, D\u00e1maso Alonso, Enrique Jardiel Poncela and Pedro Salinas.\n\nThe \"Barrio de las Letras\" (Quarter of Letters) owes its name to the intense literary activity developed over the 16th and 17th centuries. Some of the most prominent writers of the Spanish Golden Age settled here, as Lope de Vega, Quevedo or G\u00f3ngora, and the theatres of Cruz and Pr\u00edncipe, two of the major comedy theatres of that time. At 87 Calle de Atocha, one of the roads that limit the neighbourhood, was the printing house of Juan Cuesta, where the first edition of the first part of Don Quixote (1604) was published, one of the greatest works of Spanish literature. Most of the literary routes are articulated along the Barrio de las Letras, where you can find scenes from novels of the Siglo de Oro and more recent works like \"Bohemian Lights\". Although born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, realist writer Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s is credited with making Madrid the setting for many of his stories, underpinning what has come to be known as the Madrid Galdosiano.\n\nMadrid is home to the Royal Academy of Spanish Language (RAE), an internationally important cultural institution dedicated to language planning by enacting legislation aimed at promoting linguistic unity within the Hispanic states; this ensures a common linguistic standard, in accordance with its founding statutes \"to ensure that the changes undergone [by the language] [...] not break the essential unity that keeps all the Hispanic\".Madrid is also home to another international cultural institution, the Instituto Cervantes, whose task is the promotion and teaching of the Spanish language as well as the dissemination of the culture of Spain and Hispanic America.\nThe National Library of Spain is the largest major public library in Spain. The library's collection consists of more than 26,000,000 items, including 15,000,000 books and other printed materials, 30,000 manuscripts, 143,000 newspapers and serials, 4,500,000 graphic materials, 510,000 music scores, 500,000 maps, 600,000 sound recording, 90,000 audiovisuals, 90,000 electronic documents, more than 500,000 microforms, etc.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe Madrilenian cuisine has received plenty of influences from other regions of Spain and its own identity actually relies in its ability to assimilate elements from the immigration.The cocido madrile\u00f1o, a chickpea-based stew, is one of the most emblematic dishes of the Madrilenian cuisine. The callos a la madrile\u00f1a is another traditional winter specialty, usually made of cattle tripes. Other offal dishes typical in the city include the gallinejas or grilled pig's ear. Fried squid has become a culinary specialty in Madrid, often consumed in sandwich as bocata de calamares.Other generic dishes commonly accepted as part of the Madrilenian cuisine include the potaje, the sopa de ajo (Garlic soup), the Spanish omelette, the besugo a la madrile\u00f1a (bream), caracoles a la madrile\u00f1a (snails, sp. Cornu aspersum) or the soldaditos de Pav\u00eda, the patatas bravas (consumed as snack in bars) or the gallina en pepitoria (hen or chicken cooked with the yolk of hard-boiled eggs and almonds) to name a few.Traditional desserts include torrijas (a variant of French toast consumed in the Easter) and bartolillos.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\n\nMadrid is reputed to have a \"vibrant nightlife\". Some of the highlight bustling locations include the surroundings of the Plaza de Santa Ana, Malasa\u00f1a and La Latina (particularly near the Cava Baja). It is one of the city's main attractions with tapas bars, cocktail bars, clubs, jazz lounges, live music venues and flamenco theatres. Most nightclubs liven up by 1:30 a.m.and stay open until at least 6 a.m.Nightlife flourished in the 1980s while Madrid's mayor Enrique Tierno Galv\u00e1n (PSOE) was in office, nurturing the cultural-musical movement known as La Movida. Nowadays, the Malasa\u00f1a area is known for its alternative scene.\nThe area of Chueca has also become a hot spot in the Madrilenian nightlife, especially for the gay population. Chueca is known as gay quarter, comparable to The Castro district in San Francisco.\n\n\n=== Bohemian culture ===\nThe city has venues for performing alternative art and expressive art. They are mostly located in the centre of the city, including in \u00d3pera, Ant\u00f3n Mart\u00edn, Chueca and Malasa\u00f1a. There are also several festivals in Madrid, including the Festival of Alternative Art, the Festival of the Alternative Scene.The neighbourhood of Malasa\u00f1a, as well as Ant\u00f3n Mart\u00edn and Lavapi\u00e9s, hosts several bohemian caf\u00e9s/galleries. These caf\u00e9s are typified with period or retro furniture or furniture found on the street, a colourful, nontraditional atmosphere inside, and usually art displayed each month by a new artist, often for sale. Caf\u00e9s include the retro caf\u00e9 Lolina and bohemian caf\u00e9s La Ida, La Paca and Caf\u00e9 de la Luz in Malasa\u00f1a, La Piola in Huertas and Caf\u00e9 Olmo and Aguardiente in Lavapi\u00e9s.\nIn the neighbourhood of Lavapi\u00e9s, there are also \"hidden houses\", which are illegal bars or abandoned spaces where concerts, poetry readings and the famous Spanish botell\u00f3n (a street party or gathering that is now illegal but rarely stopped).\n\n\n=== Classical music and opera ===\n\nThe Auditorio Nacional de M\u00fasica\n is the main venue for classical music concerts in Madrid. It is home to the Spanish National Orchestra, the Chamart\u00edn Symphony Orchestra and the venue for the symphonic concerts of the Community of Madrid Orchestra and the Madrid Symphony Orchestra. It is also the principal venue for orchestras on tour playing in Madrid.\nThe Teatro Real is the main opera house in Madrid, located just in front of the Royal Palace, and its resident orchestra is the Madrid Symphony Orchestra. The theatre stages around seventeen opera titles (both own productions and co-productions with other major European opera houses) per year, as well as two or three major ballets and several recitals.\nThe Teatro de la Zarzuela is mainly devoted to Zarzuela (the Spanish traditional musical theatre genre), as well as operetta and recitals. The resident orchestra of the theatre is the Community of Madrid Orchestra.\nThe Teatro Monumental is the concert venue of the RTVE Symphony Orchestra.Other concert venues for classical music are the Fundaci\u00f3n Joan March and the Auditorio 400, devoted to contemporary music.\n\n\n=== Feasts and festivals ===\n\n\n==== San Isidro ====\n\nThe local feast par excellence is the Day of Isidore the Laborer (San Isidro Labrador), the patron Saint of Madrid, celebrated on 15 May. It is a public holiday. According to tradition, Isidro was a farmworker and well manufacturer born in Madrid in the late 11th century, who lived a pious life and whose corpse was reportedly found to be incorrupt in 1212. Already very popular among the madrilenian people, as Madrid became the capital of the Hispanic Monarchy in 1561 the city council pulled efforts to promote his canonization; the process started in 1562. Isidro was beatified in 1619 and the feast day set on 15 May (he was finally canonized in 1622).On 15 May the Madrilenian people gather around the Hermitage of San Isidro and the Prairie of San Isidro (on the right-bank of the Manzanares) often dressed with checkered caps (parpusas) and kerchiefs (safos) characteristic of the chulapos and chulapas, dancing chotis and pasodobles, eating rosquillas and barquillos.\n\n\n==== LGBT pride ====\n\nThe Madrilenian LGTB Pride has grown to become the event bringing the most people together in the city each year as well as one of the most importants Pride celebrations worldwide.Madrid's Pride Parade began in 1977, in the Chueca neighbourhood, which also marked the beginning of the gay, lesbian, transgender, and bisexual rights movement after being repressed for forty years in a dictatorship. This claiming of LGBT rights has allowed the Pride Parade in Madrid to grow year after year, becoming one of the best in the world. In 2007, this was recognised by the European Pride Owners Association (EPOA) when Madrid hosted Europride, the Official European Pride Parade. It was hailed by the President of the EPOA as \u201cthe best Europride in history\u201d. In 2017, Madrid celebrated the 40th anniversary of their first Pride Parade by hosting the WorldPride Madrid 2017. Numerous conferences, seminars and workshops as well as cultural and sports activities took place at the festival, the event being a \u201ckids and family pride\u201d and a source of education. More than one million people attended the pride's central march. The main purpose of the celebration was presenting Madrid and the Spanish society in general as a multicultural, diverse, and tolerant community. The 2018 Madrid Pride roughly had 1.5 million participants.p. 34Since Spain legalised same-sex marriage in July 2005, Madrid has become one of the largest hot spots for LGBT culture. With about 500 businesses aimed toward the LGBT community, Madrid has become a \u201cGateway of Diversity\u201d.\n\n\n==== Other ====\n\nDespite often being labelled as \"having no tradition\" by foreigners, the Carnival was popular in Madrid already in the 16th century. However, during the Francoist dictatorship the carnival was under government ban and the feasts suffered a big blow. It has been slowly recovering since then.\nOther signalled days include the regional day (2 May) commemorating the Dos de Mayo Uprising (a public holiday), the feasts of San Antonio de la Florida (13 June), the feast of the Virgen de la Paloma (circa 15 August) or the day of the co-patron of Madrid, the Virgin of Almudena (9 November), although the latter's celebrations are rather religious in nature.The most important musical event in the city is the Mad Cool festival; created in 2016, it reached an attendance of 240,000 during the three-day long schedule of the 2018 edition.p. 33\n\n\n=== Bullfighting ===\n\nMadrid hosts the largest plaza de toros (bullring) in Spain, Las Ventas, established in 1929. Las Ventas is considered by many to be the world centre of bullfighting and has a seating capacity of almost 25,000. Madrid's bullfighting season begins in March and ends in October. Bullfights are held every day during the festivities of San Isidro (Madrid's patron saint) from mid May to early June, and every Sunday, and public holiday, the rest of the season. The style of the plaza is Neo-Mud\u00e9jar. Las Ventas also hosts music concerts and other events outside of the bullfighting season.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nThe main annual international events held in Madrid are:\n\nCycling:\nVuelta a Espa\u00f1a: one of the three worldwide prestigious three-week-long Grand Tours, takes Madrid as the final stage. It takes place in the second week of September.\nTennis:\nMadrid Open: a male and female professional tennis tournament, played on clay court. The event is part of the ATP Tour Masters 1000 and one of the top four Premier Mandatory on the WTA Tour. It is held during the first week of May.\nDavis Cup Finals: the finals of the major tournament between men's national teams, will be played from November 2019 in Madrid.\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nMadrid is home to La Liga football club giant Real Madrid, who play their home games at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. The club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world and their supporters are referred to as madridistas or merengues (Meringues). Real Madrid was selected as the best club of the 20th century (FIFA Club of the Century), being the leader of the European teams ranking and the most valuable sports team in the world. Real is also the worldwide leader with a record 26 international titles.\nTheir successful hometown rivals, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, are also well-supported in the city and play their home games at the Metropolitano Stadium. Their supporters are referred to as colchoneros (The Mattressers), in reference to the team's red and white jersey colours. Atl\u00e9tico is considered a European elite team, having reached in the last ten seasons, three UEFA Europa League titles and two UEFA Champions League finals. Historically nationwide, Atletico has won ten Leagues and ten Cups.\nMadrid has hosted four European Cup/Champions League finals at the Bernab\u00e9u, and the 2019 final was played at the Metropolitano. As well, the Bernab\u00e9u has hosted the final matches for the national teams competitions UEFA Euro 1964 and 1982 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\n\nMadrid boasts a main place in Spanish basketball, with two ACB clubs, both playing their home games at the Palacio de Deportes (WiZink Center). The Real Madrid's basketball section (founded in 1931) is one of the most decorated European basketball teams, having won most Euroleague throphies (10) than any other team. Madrid's other professional basketball club is Estudiantes another longstanding ACB team, founded in 1948.\nRegarding international competitions, the city hosted the final matches for the 1986 and 2014 FIBA World Cups and the EuroBasket 2007, both held at the Palacio de Deportes.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nState Education in Spain is free, and compulsory from 6 to 16 years. The  education system is called LOE (Ley Org\u00e1nica de Educaci\u00f3n).\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nMadrid is home to many public and private universities. Some of them are among the oldest in the world, and many of them are the most prestigious universities in Spain.\nThe National Distance Education University (Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia; UNED) has as its mission the public service of higher education through the modality of distance education. At more than 205,000 students (2015), UNED has the largest student population in Spain and is one of the largest universities in Europe. Since 1972, UNED has sought to translate into action the principle of equal opportunity in access to higher education through a methodology based on the principles of distance learning and focused on the needs of the student.\n\nThe Complutense University of Madrid (Universidad Complutense de Madrid; UCM) is the second largest university in Spain after UNED and one of the oldest universities in the world. It has over 11,000 staff members and a student population of 117,000. Most of the academic staff is Spanish. It is located on two campuses, the main one of Ciudad Universitaria in the Moncloa-Aravaca district, and the secondary campus of Somosaguas, located outside the city limits in Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n and founded in 1971. The Complutense University of Madrid was founded in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, old Complutum, by Cardinal Cisneros in 1499. Nevertherless, its real origin dates back to 1293, when King Sancho IV of Castile built the General Schools of Alcal\u00e1, which would give rise to Cisnero's Complutense University. During the course of 1509\u20131510 five schools were already operative: Artes y Filosof\u00eda (Arts and Philosophy), Teolog\u00eda (Theology), Derecho Can\u00f3nico (Canonical Laws), Letras (Liberal Arts) and Medicina (Medicine). In 1836, during the reign of Isabel II, the University was moved to Madrid, where it took the name of Central University and was located at San Bernardo Street. Subsequently, in 1927, a new University City (Ciudad Universitaria) was planned to be built in the district of Moncloa-Aravaca, in lands handed over by the King Alfonso XIII to this purpose. The Spanish Civil War turned the University City into a war zone, causing the destruction of several schools in the area, as well as the loss of part of its rich scientific, artistic and bibliographic heritage.\nIn 1970 the Government reformed the High Education, and the Central University became the Complutense University of Madrid. It was then when the new campus at Somosaguas was created to house the new School of Social Sciences. The old Alcal\u00e1 campus was reopened as the independent UAH, University of Alcal\u00e1, in 1977. Complutense also serves to the population of students who select Madrid as their residency during their study abroad period. Students from the United States for example, might go to Madrid on a program like API (Academic Programs International) and study at Complutense for an intense immersion into the Spanish Language. After studying at the University, students return home with a fluent sense of Spanish as well as culture and diversity.\n\nThe Technical University of Madrid (Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid; UPM), is the top technical university in Spain. It is the result of the merge of different Technical Schools of Engineering. It shares the Ciudad Universitaria campus with the UCM, while it also owns several schools scattered in the city centre and additional campuses in the Puente de Vallecas district and in the neighbouring municipality of Boadilla del Monte.\nThe Autonomous University of Madrid (Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid; UAM) was instituted under the leadership of the physicist, Nicol\u00e1s Cabrera. The Autonomous University is widely recognised for its research strengths in theoretical physics. Known simply as La Aut\u00f3noma by locals, its main site is the Cantoblanco Campus, located at the North of the municipality, close to its boundaries with the neighbouring municipalities of Alcobendas, San Sebasti\u00e1n de los Reyes and Tres Cantos.\nLocated on the main site are the Rectorate building and the Faculties of Science, Philosophy and Fine Arts, Law, Economic Science and Business Studies, Psychology, Higher School of Computing Science and Engineering, and the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education. The UAM is considered the institution to study Law in Spain, The Medical School is sited outside the main site and beside the Hospital Universitario La Paz.The private Comillas Pontifical University (Universidad Pontificia Comillas; UPC) has its rectorate and several faculties in Madrid. The private Nebrija University is also based in Madrid. Some of the big public universities headquartered in the surrounding municipalities also have secondary campuses in Madrid proper: it is the case of the Charles III University of Madrid (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; UC3M) with its main site in Getafe and an educational facility in Embajadores (after signing a deal with the regional government and the city council in 2011) and the King Juan Carlos University (Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; URJC) having its main site in M\u00f3stoles and a secondary campus in Vic\u00e1lvaro. The private Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela University (Universidad Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela; UCJC) has a postgrade school in Chamber\u00ed.\n\n\n=== Business schools ===\n\nIE Business School (formerly Instituto de Empresa) has its main campus on the border of the Chamart\u00edn and Salamanca districts of Madrid. IE Business School recently ranked #1 in WSJ's 2009 rankings for Best MBA Programs under 2 years. It scored ahead of usual stalwarts, INSEAD and IMD, giving it top billing among International MBA programs. Although based in Barcelona, both IESE Business School and ESADE Business School also have Madrid campuses. These three schools are the top-ranked business schools in Spain, consistently rank among the top 20 business schools globally, and offer MBA programs (in English or Spanish) as well as other business degrees. Madrid is a good destination for business schools and a city much desired by foreign students. The most important Spanish business schools (IESE, IE, ESADE) have invested 125 million euros in expanding their campuses in Madrid in 2020.Other Madrid business schools and universities that have MBA programs include: EAE Business School (in English and Spanish), the Charles III University of Madrid through the Centro de Ampliaci\u00f3n de Estudios (in English or Spanish); the Comillas Pontifical University (in Spanish only) and the Technical University of Madrid (in Spanish only).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nMadrid is served by several roads and three modes of public surface transport, and two airports, one of them being almost two different airports. A great many important road, rail and air links converge on the capital, providing effective connections with other parts of the metropolitan region and with the rest of Spain and other parts of Europe.\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\nMadrid Central\nCars (except for hybrid and electric vehicles as well as residents and guests) were banned in the Madrid Central low-emission zone in 2018. Pollution in the area dropped following the ban. In 2016 it was announced that Madrid will stop the use of all diesel powered cars and trucks within the next decade.\nRadial roads\nMadrid is the centre of the most important roads of Spain. Already in 1720, the Reglamento General de Postas enacted by Philip V configurated the basis of a radial system of roads in the country.Madrid features a number of the most prominent autov\u00edas (fast dualled highways), part of the State Road Network. Clock-wise starting from the north: the A-1 (Madrid\u2013Ir\u00fan\u2013French border), A-2 (Madrid\u2013Zaragoza\u2013Barcelona\u2013French border), A-3 (Madrid\u2013Valencia), A-4 (Madrid\u2013C\u00f3rdoba\u2013Sevilla\u2013C\u00e1diz), A-5 (Madrid\u2013Badajoz\u2013Portuguese border) and the A-6 (Madrid\u2013A Coru\u00f1a). The A-42, another highway connecting Madrid to Toledo, is also part of the State Network.\nThe M-607 connects Madrid to the Puerto de Navacerrada. It is a fast dualled highway in its initial stretch from Madrid to Colmenar Viejo, and part of the Regional Road Network (in relation to the concerning administration, not to the technical features of the road).\nDue to the large amount of traffic, new toll highways were built parallel to the main national freeways. Their names are R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-5 and they were intended to provide a paid alternative to the often overcrowded free radials. However, except the R-3, they do not end close to the M-30 innermost ring road, as the R-2 finishes in the M-40, the R-4 in the M-50 and the R-5 in the M-40.\n\nOrbital roads\nAlso Madrid road network includes four orbital ones at different distances from the centre.\nThe innermost ring-road, the M-30, is the only one with its path strictly located within the Madrid municipal limits. It is owned by the Madrid City Council and operated by Madrid Calle 30, S.A. It is the busiest Spanish road, famous for its traffic jams. A significant portion of the southern part runs underground parallel to the Manzanares, with tunnel sections of more than 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) in length and 3 to 6 lanes in each direction.\nThe second ring-road, the M-40 (part of the State Road Network) circles the city, while also extending to other surrounding municipalities. A NW stretch of the road runs underground, below the southern reaches of the Monte de El Pardo protected area.\nThe M-45 partially circles the city, connecting the M-40 and M-50, passing through areas like Villaverde and Vallecas in the South-East of the municipality.\nThe M-50, the Madrid's outer ring road, connects municipalities and cities in the metropolitan area, like Fuenlabrada, M\u00f3stoles, Getafe, Legan\u00e9s in the South and Boadilla del Monte and Las Rozas in the West.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThere are four major components of public transport, with many intermodal interchanges. The Consorcio Regional de Transportes de Madrid (CRTM) coordinates the public transport operations across multiple providers in the region, harmonizing fares for the commuter rail, rapid transit, light rail and bus transport services provided by different operators.\n\nMetro\nThe Metro is the rapid transit system serving Madrid as well as some suburbs. Founded in 1919, it underwent extensive enlargement in the second half of the 20th century. It is the second longest metro system in Europe (after London's) at 294 kilometres (183 miles). As of 2019, it has 302 stations. Only the M\u00e9tro of Paris has more stations. It features 13 lines; 12 of them are colour-coded and numbered 1 to 12 (Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 5, Line 6, Line 7, Line 8, Line 9, Line 10, Line 11 and Line 12), while the other one, the short Ramal (R), links \u00d3pera to Pr\u00edncipe P\u00edo.\nCercan\u00edas\nCercan\u00edas Madrid is the commuter rail service used for longer distances from the suburbs and beyond into Madrid, consisting of nine lines totalling 578 kilometres (359 miles) and more than 90 stations. With fewer stops inside the centre of the city they are faster than the Metro, but run less frequently. This system is connected with Metro (presently 22 stations) and Light Metro. The lines are named: C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10, respectively.\n\nBusesThere is a dense network of bus routes, run by the municipal company Empresa Municipal de Transportes (or EMT Madrid), which operates 24 hours a day; special services called \"N lines\" are run during nighttime. The special Airport Express Shuttle line connecting the airport with the city centre features distinctively yellow buses. In addition to the urban lines operated by the EMT, the green buses (interurbanos) connect the city with the suburbs. The later lines, while also regulated by the CRTM, are often run by private operators.\nAlmost half of all journeys in the metropolitan area are made on public transport, a very high proportion compared with most European cities.\nMadrid has 15723 taxis around all the city.\n\nTaxiThe taxicabs are regulated by a specific sub-division of taxi service, a body dependent of the Madrid City Council. The authorisation entails a badge for the vehicle and a license for the driver, who has to be older than 18. Since the 1970s, the fleet of taxis has remained stable roughly around 16,000 vehicles, accounting for 15,600 in 2014.\n\n\n=== Long-distance transport ===\n\nIn terms of longer-distance transport, Madrid is the central node of the system of autov\u00edas, giving the city direct fast road links with most parts of Spain and with France and Portugal. It is also the focal point of one of the world's three largest high-speed rail systems, Alta Velocidad Espa\u00f1ola (AVE), which has brought major cities such as Seville and Barcelona within 2.5 hours travel time. There are now 2,900 kilometres (1,800 miles) of AVE track, connecting Madrid with 17 provincial capitals, and further lines are under construction.Also Spain business are designing new high speed trains which will be the new generation AVE 104 like Talgo AVRIL.\nAside from the local and regional bus commuting services, Madrid is also a node for long-distance bus connections to plenty of national destinations. The Estaci\u00f3n Sur de Autobuses in M\u00e9ndez \u00c1lvaro, the busiest bus station in the country, also features international bus connections to cities in Morocco as well as to diverse European destinations.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nMadrid is also home to the Madrid-Barajas Airport, the sixth-largest airport in Europe, handling over 60 million passengers annually, of whom 70% are international travellers, in addition to the majority of Spain's air freight movements. Barajas is a major European hub, yet a largely westward facing one, specialized in the Americas, with a comparatively lighter connectivity to Asia. Madrid's location at the centre of the Iberian Peninsula makes it a major logistics base.

          "Really enjoyed our day out here.We booked this through tui and it was a big plus getting the fast track passes.Some of the ques was around 25 minutes but we got on the rides staight away.My 8 year old loved it here,some of the rides are a bit intemidiating but we still loved",
          "Visited in August 2018, it was amazing! Although the food was expensive and the queues were long, the slides were so much fun. The best one was probably one where you\u2019re in a dinghy and drift up a massive hill shaped as a cobra.",
          "After reading the reviews I went to Aqualand with some trepidation - turned out to have an excellent afternoon. Showed the carhire contract and drivers licence on entry - which meant one adult went free. Didn't bother with lockers - just paid for a lounger and kept stuff there,",
          "This place is ridiculously expensive and by a long way is not the best water park I\u2019ve been to. You almost need to have the fast track bands otherwise you\u2019ll only get on about 5 rides a day HOWEVER the fast track costs the same as an adult entry and is 150% child entry price!!",
          "This slide is a liability and is going to result in serious injury. I had a very bad experience going down this slide with my 7 yr old daughter in a two person tube. Basically as you are going down the slide you stop mid way twice at the mouth of the cobra and have to get out of",
          "My family of 5, 3 girls aged 7, 8 & 11 are just back from day to Aqualand. We paid for a fast pass each, got stung for food, carpark etc so day out cost circa \u20ac300. We more or less expected this though. What I could not believe was the level of disregard for safety. We went on",
          "We had a great day yesterday but it is so ridiculously expensive. After establishing within 30 mins of arriving that we would spend most of our time queuing (even though it didn\u2019t seem that busy) & with a plane to catch in the evening (we had to be off site by 4pm) we ended up",
          "Definitely recommend if you have teenage kids. Get fast pass the queues are unbearable in the burning sun. Take a picnic. Rides are fun but we only went on three as it was just too busy and we had a 3 year old so was a hit young to really enjoy. Sun beds cost \u20ac4 Baby/ kids",
          "We booked a package through Jet2 which cost \u20ac54 with transfer from calla Millor. This took around 1.5hr. We got fast passes in the park which cost \u20ac28 each, which is well worth it to skip the queues and we managed to go on all rides numerous times. The queues did seem long if",

          "So when I say dangerous, I am referring to this dark tunnel ride. Me and my friend were in a double tube to go down together. The person in charge of the ride pushed us down but he pushed us to the right instead of straight. Not sure if it was his fault or the rides fault but a",
          "We come to Mallorca regularly and we finally gave in to the teenagers and took them to the park. We went inline and we thought we purchased park entry tickets wit fast pass at \u20ac100 for a family of 4. However when we arrived at the park the next morning we were advised these",
          "We arrived as a family of five with two teenagers and one 7-year-old. Admission already cost us \u20ac135 with the discount voucher. Then there\u2019re \u20ac5 for parking and \u20ac5 for locker, both of which should have been free. We decided not to pay for sun loungers, which would have cost us",
          "Family with two children aged 8 and 10, both over 120cm which was the minimum for most rides. Overall we had a great time. Half way through the day we agreed we should have bought a fast pass. Like it or not it makes a massive difference to queue times (see suggestions below).",
          "Park is quite nice but overall expensive if you get the fastpass which by the way is a MUST, otherwise you stand in line 30-40min for main attractions. In total you must pay 30+25 for fastpass. 55 eurs for such park is \u201ehurting\u201cspecially if you can not go in all attractions with",

          "We went while on holiday for what we thought would be a good day out... Don't get me wrong the kids enjoyed it but it is a badly organised expensive place. For a family of 4 with 2 adults 2 children 10 and under it cost us nearly \u20ac100 to enter... We then paid for a locker and",

          "Not sure where to start with this one, we were looking forward to visiting Aqualand for the day, but came away very disappointing. Ticket price was 27 Euro for adults and 12 euro for children when ordered on line which was fine. When we got the park, many extra costs added: Car",
          "Me, my wife and our 7 year old daughter visited here a few days after visiting Western water park. We have been to many Aqualand water parks in several countries but this one we found really disappointing. The main reasons are that the fast track que\u2019s take COMPLETE priority",

          "Visited Aqualand with my husband and our 2 children (aged 11 and 4). I had read a few reviews after booking and wasn\u2019t looking forward to it but we found it to be really clean and well organised. We took a packed lunch but bought some drinks and snacks, they were overpriced but",
          "Aqualand was a great waterpark. The staff are super nice. We left our car open on accident and guess what? They warned the hole park! Super Organized cool slides and nice staff! Worth it!!!",
          "We had a good day here & my young son was happy enough, it has a dozen or so water attractions & a wave pool, plus bits & bats for younger kids. There\u2019s some fun rides but we saw one or two incidents with people banging themselves at the end of slides, particularly on Crazy",
          "We payed over \u20ac180 for our family of 4 with transport so expected a good day out. We arrived just before it opened so managed to get on 2 rides before the huge queues began. We were queuing over 30 minutes for any rides which weren\u2019t helped by the fast passes being able to skip",
          "We visited here and did have a good time, only bad thing was mental prices. 30 to get in then being peak season you need a fast pass or will be waiting 30 to 45 for one go on a slide. Fast pass was another 26 each. I bought a sausage and chips that was 11 euros when it came out",
          "A really nice water park with 20 rides. All the rides can be done if you are over 120cm high. The food is reasonable, \u20ac13 for a large pizza but drinks are expensive. So bring your own drinks which is totally allowed (unlike many similar parks). You can bring cool boxes but then",
          "Went here with my partner and our sons 10 and 15, I love waterparks and have been to some really amazing ones Siam park in tenerife outshone this completely. First we paid for fast pass still only went on 5 rides as some rides all it did was get you a tube quicker you still had",
          "After reading some scary reviews I was very pleasantly surprised. I thought it was a very good, well laid out and attractive park. Loads of fun! Yes fast pass system is really annoying - we did without and just chose the rides with less queuing so we got on quite a few, and in",
          "I've been to plenty of water parks from the small to the huge and this is without a shadow of a doubt the worst one. I can appreciate that at this time of year (August) that places will be busier and queues longer but not to this extent. We arrived at around 10:30 and left at",
          "Excellent place, priced the same as all usual UK theme parks. Very clean resort, lots of staff, good health & safety, loads of rides. GREAT FUN! I honestly can\u2019t fault it. Entrance fees were \u20ac27 each if bought online day before & Fast passes (\u20ac20-22 per person in August)",
          "We had a great day but the Fast Pass ticket lanes really frustrated us. We didn\u2019t want to pay the \u20ac24 per person premium to queue jump but I can see the appeal. If we went again we\u2019d spend the extra money to avoid hours in the queue. A good day out.",
          "The park is a good compact size with good variety of slides, slightly frustrating with the emphasis on fast pass on all rides, if you can afford a fast pass then the only ride you really queue for is the cobra. Staff are the most helpful I have experienced at a waterpark very",

          "Came five years ago with family, and this place has really changed since Felt ripped off from the moment we entered- mainly due to fast track We got \u20ac16 tickets from carrefour and hired a car, so the driver got in free (with a full price child @ \u20ac21) Very much worth getting",
          "Within half an hour of arriving our daughter came off an inflatable inside one of the flumes , bashed her arm badly and required 2 stitches. She felt she was sat correctly but the ride ops did not check , just sent her quickly on her way. The medical centre within the waterpark",
          "This place has hardly changed in the last 10years, really not worth the entrance fee, guest areas are very poor and covered in stones which is simply not acceptable for a water park where the majority of guests are bare foot. The park is in need of some major attention/upgrades.",
          "There is Lots of fun for whole day. A bit expensive in restaurants. But worth is anyway. 3x adult and 1 older child cost 110euro.",
          "Stayed between 11-4:30 and only managed to get on 2 slides because of queue\u2019s as the rest were ridiculously long. I would suggest fast pass but the queue\u2019s are just as long. Food is extremely expensive, \u20ac56 euros for 2 pizzas, nachos a drink and a slush. Pizza\u2019s were super basic",
          "We visit Aqualand regularly and have done for the past 16 years.

          "This was my first experience of the El Arenal water park and I have to say that the slides were actually pretty fun and entertaining. One of the staff did call me stupid right in front of my face, which was rude, but apart from that I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. The",

          "Large park with a good variety of rides, open air spaces to picnic and plenty of space to find some shade and relax in between. But...ridiculously overpriced when you consider that you need the fast pass (20 euro online, 22 on site) if you want to enjoy half the rides without",
          "As above, it's a fun day out but its now totally geared towards having a Fastpass which makes it very expensive - 4 X \u20ac30 + extra 4 X \u20ac22 Fastpass tax + \u20ac5 for parking & 4 X \u20ac4 for loungers = \u20ac229! Not added in any food (coke \u20ac5) or other charges like locker fees or travel.",

          "Like so many other comments this is an expensive day out for a family like ours. Paying in is not the issue here its the afters that make it unattractive to revisit. You get charged \u20ac5 just to park, \u20ac10 for a locker (you do get \u20ac5 back upon return of key), \u20ac15 each for fast pass",
          "30\u20ac each entry and 50\u20ac + for lunch 2x pizzas and 4x drinks and then sun bed hire made it a 190\u20ac day out, If we had bought fast passes it would of been another 20\u20ac each We just found it expensive for what it was, long wait for rides, they cater for the fast pass people, not",
          "The rides themselves were great and while on them, we very much enjoyed our time, however the fast pass (at \u00a315pp) is a must if you want to go on everything. On some of the rides, it was alternated for each rider between fast pass then non-fast pass but on many rides, they were",

Without this pass you queued for anything up",

          "We all enjoyed our visit to Aqualand but in typical teenager style after 5 hours of slides and water they wanted to do something else that wasnt relaxing and sunbathing. Vast majority of people had fast passes but it was still worth paying the extra fee. Take a packed lunch as",

          "Some great rides, we all loved it and there is something for everyone. We had fast pass bit on many rides all it meant was you got a float quicker, which was great and it would have been a lot worse without the fast pass. On one side the were separate queues however the",

There are some good fun rides but like every other reviewer will say, you pay to go in then you need to pay for a locker and if you want to go on anything you\u2019ll need a fast pass. It\u2019s clear they want to make more money from it because without it",
          "Travelled with my husband and 2 children aged 10 and 12. The waterpark is actually really good fun with lots of different slides to appeal to all ages. This is my second visit and since last time they have introduced fastrack....it\u2019s awful! There are so many more inflatables",

We couldn\u2019t fault the rides, especially the skimming ride, which I have never come across before. Throughout the day we managed to get on 5 rides, this was due to the \u201cFast Pass\u201d",

          "Although a bit wary about all the negative reviews we went anyway. We are so glad we did. We had an awesome day. The park was clean and well kept. All the staff (except one grumpy boy halfway down the rapids) were friendly, helpful and kept the queues going well. On the topic",
          "Visited 17th July 2018. It was a Tuesday. Got there at 10am as gates opened. For the 1st hour no queues at all. Did every ride in the park apart from 2 which were closed. I thought the bad reviews were not fair but maybe it\u2019s a lot worse at weekends? Can\u2019t say. It\u2019s not a cheap",
          "Great rides, often theres a long line. The staff are not friendly or service minded. You must pay for sun beds, and then you get a sticker on your bed. Make sure to not place anything in front of this sticker, because they will wake you up to ask for money! The \"lifeguards\" act",

          "Myself and my partner visited Aqualand on Sunday the 8th of July. The park was as busy as we expected it to be considering it was the weekend. Health and safety doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a concern at the park, particularly at the rapids as the lifeguards send too many people",
          "And they \u201ccheated\u201d me by selling one ticket extra for 29 EUR. Most likely an error but was not possible to get the money back. I have realized that only after I was back home. Normal ticket makes you wait in long queues. We were there 3 hours+ and we managed to slide only 5",
          "Me and my partner had a fantastic day here. It was so much fun. I would definitely recommend the fast-track wrist bands, and i think the people that wrote the bad reviews don't know how they work. They only have a limited amount of normal rubber rings and so people without",
          "I'd highly advise getting fastpass as it's only \u20ac12 and saves you lot's of queuing time as it does get very busy but it doesn't effect all of the rides Some queuing was odd and confusing as on the serpent ride people with the specific floats for the slide skipped the queue",

          "Very simple review. Nice big park Good price to get in Loads for all ages Best ages tho 8+ or 1.2m high Big beer for \u20ac7.50 worth it but if u can bring your own will save a killing . Definitely worth a visit",
          "Overall it was a good experience. I recommend buying fast pass as otherwise it takes over an hour for each ride. They made it in quite a clever way of having only 10 or so public inflatables on each slide and about 50-60 fast track ones. Which generally means you will queue",
          "The Worst Aqualand we've ever been!!!!Overpriced food,paying additional for sunbeds ,no organisation at all you can wait ages for one slide unless you pay more for fast pass but in our case many people were with fast pass so we need to wait anyway .WILL NOT RECOMMEND AND DEFO",

          "Overall the waterpark is a great day out, my only criticism is that having paid \u20ac12 each for a fast track pass I was disappointed to find that the majority of staff were not checking bands I appreciate it\u2019s a busy park and not every single rust band can be checked however there",
          "We went to aqua-land because we got a week long promotion through our hotel (27 euro for the week). We were very disappointed by the whole experience primarily due to the overuse of the fast-pass system. Unlike other systems that I have seen there were dedicated rubber",

          "Biggest let down by far is the fast pass system this place \u2018tries\u2019 to operate, which frankly is a disgrace. We paid the extra 12 euros per person after waiting a good hour to get on the first slide we queued for. At this point the fast pass queue for the Crazy Race slide was",

          "I was in the aquapark last week with my husband and children. Generally, the park is ok but there are two things we totally disliked. The first is the system of fast pass, which, in my view, is unfair. Basically, you are paying for the entrance and not for the rides because",
          "We found out about this water park and for around 30 quid had a laugh. The queues were a bit much at one point but it's expected. Best slide was the cobra - Steve banged his bad knee - got no sympathy. Would add up for a big family - what a laugh.",
          "Prepare to be fleeced of lots of cash for an average day. Anyone aged 12 or over is an adult so entry for 2 adults and 2 'kids' aged 12 and 14 was 130 euros basic. You can then add fast pass for 12 euro each taking your cost to nearly 180 - bear in mind the park is basic and",
          "Overpriced, too many ques felt like second class citizen with all the fast track going before us. Long long waiting times, were really disappointed only spent a few hours there and most of it spent in a que. food very expensive too! Really not worth it been to much better",
          "Let\u2019s start with the best two slide. The King Cobra and the Tsunami. Those two gives you the feeling that you expect. The rest of them gives some pleasure it is worth to try them once. In general good place, but I was expecting a bit more adrenaline",
          "We went to the waterpark early July and I think we made the most of our money whilst there which cost us \u20ac29 at the box office, \u20ac27 online. We arrived quite early in the morning so queues were short and we managed to go on every slide at least 2/3 times which was really good.",
          "Even though might be crowded during the summer season, this attraction worth every spend Penny. The ques are reasonable, but it is rccomendd that one should by Fast pass ticket. The water inside is warm enough, and there is a plenty of sunshade due to p\u00e2ine forrest inside. Some",

          "This place costs a fortune to go to only 2 food huts open not only did our children nearly drown my husband ended up with a strapped bruised ankle dunno if he has done any serious damage as he doesn't want to miss work . Some fun rides but no health and safety what so ever.",

          "We went on a very quiet day, most rides had a 120cm height restriction so it's most suited to older children and adults although there are two pools with rides for little ones. Take your own picnic as good and drinks expensive and not great. Was a good day but not sure it would",
          "This was our second visit here and we loved it. Very good for children and adults alike. Staff pleasant and good with children. The facilities were clean. We went on a quiet day so no queues which made the day even better. Our kids are 7 & 9 but we came first time when they",

          "Great park! Did find it a little bit pricey and on entry I had a parrot put on my shoulder without notice they took my picture then tried to charge me 10 Euro for the picture, I noticed opposite me there was a man sitting playing on his phone while there was a massive snake",
          "Great day out, nice choice of different food stands. And lots for the kids and adults to do. Lockers are available. Great fun in the dance pool We all had a great day",
          "I'd recommend going here 100% it is a brilliant day out! You should aim to be here for opening hours as it's hard to get through all rides during the day! Also don't be shy to bring your own food & alcohol. Very easy to get to and reasonable pricing.",

(We got one sunbed between us as I opted to stand). Don\u2019t get me wrong the slides are",

          "This waterpark has some fantastic rides and if you are lucky enough to go out of season you should be able to ride on all of them without too much queuing. It should be noted that quite a few of the rides are for two people only with no option for a single rider, so if you do go",
          "My husband and I visited yesterday and was meant to be a fun filled day for him and a relaxed chilled day in the sun for me as not normally a ride kinda girl but after trying out 1 that was it I was hooked! Lucky as a lot of them where for couples so other half would have been",
          "I enjoyed the park, the rides were fun, but 50% of the facilities are for two people only!! No reduction in price for this and they would not allow a single person to ride... this should have been stated at the outset - very disappointing!",

          "Had a lovely day at aqualand. My partner cut his elbow open on one of the slides and he was quickly seen to by a first aid person. We went on a Sunday and it was dead we didn't queue for any slides. All in all a good day, but it was a bit dirty",
          "Booked to go to aqualand instead of western one it was further out needed to get a bus little confusion there but once got there had a good day slides are good. Took packed lunch so didnt buy the food as previous reviews said expensive. Did not buy fast pass and as it wasn't",

          "We arrived at 3.30pm and were advised the park closed at 5. (Why? It stays light till gone 8pm. I suspect Aqualand has made so much money ripping people off by 5 that it has to close to truck the cash to the bank). But the two young lads we'd brought to the park were desperate",
          "Great day out and value for money. Stay at hotel blue sea costa verde and buy a ticket and get free entry for a week.",
          "Good park with plenty to do. Paying 12 euros each helps beat the queues. Take your lunch with you as the food in the park is very expensive. Only downside was lack of changing facilities.",

          "Bare in mind, children over the age of 10 are classed as an adult so for a family -2parents a 11year old and 9year old it cost \u00a3112. It then cost us a further \u00a378 for 2hamburgers, a portion of chips and a small salad with small drinks. The park opens at 10am so we managed to fly",

Anyway there is lots to do",

We thought that was the most painful bit, but NO! The 2nd ride we went on was the Formula races at the top it was chaos Spanish kids",

          "It's one of those places that you know exactly what you will get. There are about 15 water slides of pretty much all descriptions , nothing totally unique or scary but some good fun rides. As is typical food prices are horrendous and the food itself is no better than average",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed our day at aqualand but it has to be said it wasn't particularly busy which definitely contributed to the day. Even though it wasn't busy we still had the fastpass tickets which also contributed to getting on every ride in the park. Be aware the fast pass",

          "Great rides and nice surroundings, but unfortunately the insanly long queues and extremely high prices for food and everything \"extra\" (such as parking, lockers, sunbeds...) almost ruined our day. The fast pass system does not work at all. There are two kind of swim rings used",

          "Visited with my son last week. When we arrived it was obvious that the fast pass lines were moving much quicker than the free lines. Most rides were fine for him on his own. The king cobra ride was for 2 people and as I was too scared to go on it posed a problem! A kind stranger",
          "Visited Aqualand on 12/08/17, with the family, while on hols. What a fab waterpark, the actual rides themselves are well thought out, and offer some real thrills. We booked online before we flew out, and its worth paying the 12 euros for the fast pass, otherwise you queue twice,",
          "Great place, exciting slides. To save money, bring a packed lunch because the restaurant is expensive. Quick tip, the FastPass doesn't let you skip the queues it only lets you be first to get a float. It can be helpful but take that into consideration. Other than that, great!",
          "Went to aqua land with my wife and two kids ( 8 & 16 year olds) , the park is very nice but could do with a face lift as some of the rides are rusty and there is litter in certain areas, some people were moaning that the floor is hot well it's HOT in Spain so that isn't the",

          "All the details are well publicised in the reviews published, so please plan ahead to make most of your day. Basics of park are ok, there are enough rides to keep a couple of teenagers happy for the day, but to look out for: - based on experience I would say that a fast pass is",
          "Went yesterday with a group of adults & kids. The kids had a good time - there are several pools for them and lots of slides that adults aren't allowed on, so they could go up and down over and over again (we had 7 children in our party aged 2-6). The big issue with aqualand is",
          "This place is an absolute joke!!! DO NOT GO!! It cost us over 137 euros with transport for four from our hotel about half hour away! Got in the park then they take a photo for you to spend more money!!! Then they charge you 4 euros each for sunbeds! That was another 16 euros !",
          "Went here in July 2017. It was a little busy and definitely worth paying the extra for the FastPass, otherwise most of your day will be spent standing around in queues. The slides are ok. Having been to many waterparks around the world, I would place this one as average. The",

Overall the extras make the visit a",
          "A nice place but there are several things that could make this place a much better experience. We got there at approx 9.30am on a Monday. A good time to arrive. We queued until the park opened at 10, by which time the queue was unbelievably long. Getting inside was straight",
          "Bought 6 tickets online, unbelievable that anyone over 10 is classed as an adult. There was no special 'already bought your tickets online queue' when we got there and we had to wait in line. Disappointed that had to pay 5 euros for parking, 8 euros for 2 loungers and 10 euros",
          "Myself and my wife Visited Aqualand today with a 12 & 8 year old. Although generally we had a good time, due mainly down to the fact that the weather was great and the kids will just throw themselves down any kind of water slide. Myself and my wife however look at value for",

          "We visited this water park on monday. We had read bad reviews about this place so at first we were afraid that this place would be over crowded and disapointing. But we spent a really fun day there. Its true that there are a lot of people and you must be ready to wait in ques.",

Good points: \u2022 Lots of fun slides and pools for all different age groups. \u2022 A lot of sun loungers and places to sit, both in the sun and under shade. \u2022 Queues for slides aren't too bad",
          "Spent a day at Aqualand water park during a recent stay in Mallorca. As it was only 10 mins from our hotel. The kids were excited about it and for \u20ac100 for a family of 4, it wasn't a ridiculous price for a day out. The selection of rides is great but unfortunately the queues",
          "I wish that I had checked Tripadvisor before we booked tickets. I tend to agree with most of the negative reviews. I appreciate that a day out at a theme park will be pricey, this one was not worth the money. To me it appeared poorly run with the sole management focus on",

          "We went here as a group of two couples on the last day of our holiday and really enjoyed it. Yes it is busy, but it is also the middle of summer holidays so is to be expected... we each paid \u20ac12 for a fast pass band and would definitely recommend, it means you skip the queue to",
          "Having been to the western water park we thought we would try this one out. Flumes and pools were ok, and public areas clean enough. Food was ridiculous expensive and queues for rides were horrendous. 28 Euro each to get in for a family of four was a bit steep. Won't return,",
          "Great waterpark with a great selection of slides for all ages. It is well laid out with great green spaces to sit and relax (a bit of shade) there are plenty of food outlets, which are a little expensive but serve very good food. The little ones have 5 areas to play with one",
          "Earlier reviews were useful however we had an excellent time and the kids loved it. It's true that the food and drink is too expensive, so take you own packed lunch if you want to avoid this! Our 5 year old loved it - there are lots of options for little ones - and there are",
          "I would recommend this park for families with children up to 15 years old. The slides are good, but smaller than many we've been to, but there is a good variety of slides on offer. We booked on line and had bar codes emailed to our phones - this was easy to do, saves us 4Euro",

          "You will see lots of people saying the food is ridiculously expensive and there are long waits, but what did they expect? This park has some great rides and is nice and compact, and there is plenty of space to find a spot to sit. The system for getting a ride is a bit annoying",
          "I don't get why people are so annoyed here because of prices etc. It's a theme park and theme parks are expensive with expensive and not so good food. At least I was prepared for the whole thing and my son and I enjoyed a nice day at Aqualand. I think it's great that they allow",
          "We went as a group of 6 people to aqua land El arena and paid 25\u20ac per person to get in. We were not given the information a the counter that the park operates with fast pass (extra 12\u20ac) to the water activities. This makes a huge a difference, as a basic package quest gets stock",
          "You need to be in the queue to get in by 9.30 otherwise it will take ages. The entry process is rubbish. Those already with tickets should be allowed in via one queue, not have to queue up with others, taking absolutely ages to purchase tickets. Not helped by certain people",
          "The only redeeming feature of the day was the fact that we booked online and made a small saving in doing so. As I can from other reviews I am not the only person who feels the same way as me. I spent 7 hours in the park and only managed to get onto 5 rides!!! There were 3",

          "Visited aqualand 31st July 2017 and is a very very good water park. Especially for children. Lots of slides and pools, for adults and children. Lines were so so long so didn't end up going on any slides, wanted to get fast passes but so many people were getting them which made",
          "Our experience with this park has been shocking. it will cost 28 euro to get in, 7 to rent a locker and 4 for one sunbed. It cost us 19 to bring out daughter in and outside of the kids pools, staff wouldn't let her on any of the rides, despite her being an accomplished swimmer",
          "Me and my friend took a day trip here as we always go to waterparks when we are away and this was the worst one we have been too. We decided to pay \u20ac12 each for fast pass which we assumed would mean we cut the queues for the slides, we got our dingys faster the people not with",

          "Total rip off, don't bother to go if you can't afford to buy a fast pass. They have \"special\" floats and rings for fast pass people so you end up in a long queue waiting for the few non fast pass rings available, we counted 9 normal and 23 fast pass on one slide so you get the",
          "The slides are very nice, specially 'the cobra'. There is also 'The fast pass' which gives you priority in waiting lines. This costs you 12\u20ac extra above entrance price which is in my opinion unfair. Later on the day it gets less busy.",

          "Firstly, the advertising is very misleading. You see ads giving 3 euro's off per person, meaning 12 euro's to get in instead of 15. Bargain right? Worth driving from Alcudia to Palma for! Wrong! It's 3 euro's saving on the 28 euro per person entry fee, limited to 4 people.",

It costs a lot in entrance and in addition there is 5 \u20ac for parking, 4 \u20ac if you want to rent a sun lounger and 5 \u20ac for the locker.

          "Fast track system is pathetic normal riders were not able to get rings and fast track would keep there's and go on again. No percentage of either and after paying nearly \u20ac50 each was not acceptable. Also food and drink prices hiked up for the captive audience and not even nice",

          "The slides were ok. Nothing special, compared to somewhere like Siam Park in Tenerife they're poor. We got a fast pass which allowed you to skip the cue that you had to wait in to get a rubber ring, but then we still had to wait in the cue for the ride so it didn't really make",
          "Aqualand is quite hard to find from the main road, it is (very) expensive, and there are queues for everything. Just as an example: without a discount voucher, in July 2017, it costs \u20ac28 per person to get in (from memory 'adults' are 12 and up) plus you really need a fast pass",
          "We feel that we did not get value for money at Aqualand. First of all I have never, until now, been to a water park where you have to pay extra for your beds, 4 euros each! You pay your entrance fee, then you have to pay for your lockers, then your beds and then for fast pass",

          "The rides here are very fun and staff are really friendly.. the best rides to go for is king cobra. Crazy race. Banzai and rapids .. the only reason why I'm giving this a three stars is the management is very poor as they charge you for sun \u2026",
          "Very expensive, from the minute you walk in you feel like you are being fleeced.10 euros for a locker and you get 5 back at the end only to have to pay that to get out of car park. Then you have  the fast passes which are 20 euros after \u2026",
          "People know you need a fast pass here otherwise you need to wait very long, but the downside to this is that almost everyone in the park is rocking one of those things. So we still had to wait a long time for most of the slides. Good thing \u2026",
          "Staff are very rude, it only has a few slides and was really hyped up and turned out to be nothing to shout about. Wave machine was off! Slides were good though",
          "Expensive to get in, and everything inside is expensive. If you want to ride anything, you have to pay 15 extra or stand in line all day.\nWe went on a very slow day in the off-season, not a lot I'd people, yet long queues. They obviously \u2026",

          "DON 'T GO!\nIf you go, buy a fastpass. Price \u20ac22 above the entranceprice. If you go without fastpass, you real feel like a secondclass-citizen. You are waiting in a long row. Then you see passing all the fastlane-members. Again. And again, \u2026",

          "Make sure you include 15 euros on top of the ticket price for fast pass or you won\u2019t get on the rides. Overpriced. Ok park otherwise, but ticketing a con!",

It's quite expensive but for a fun day out I did think it was worth it as you can go on the slides as much as you like. Food and drink are massively overpriced so we took our own.",

          "Over priced park to start with...then they want an extra 15\u20ac for a fast pass.\n\nAt opening time they only open half the slides and and stop non fast pass users using the slides by removing their rings so the queue's build up, this means \u2026",
          "Fun park, but Fast Pass system is very unbalanced. Fast Pass visitors vs normal to get access to a glide is like 5:1. This means you easily wait for like 45 minutes. Also this difference seems to make Fast Pass users very pretentious. They \u2026",

For 29\u20ac a ticket it\u2019s ridiculous!\nAnd this is in September!!!!!\nOtherwise you have to get a fast pass which is another 12\u20ac per person, parking is an additional 5\u20ac, a locker 5\u20ac.\n\nSo basically you spend 40 seconds on rides and 2 and a half hours in line. What a day.",
          "We went kinda at the end of the season which is probably why we never experienced any issues with the queues.\n\nThe lifeguards were very helpful when we needed them and the park is nice. It could use a touch of paint and to get some flooring \u2026",

          "I was not impressed with this park, expensive and lazy staff which did very little to help on how to position in the the rides, i hit my head pretty hard in the tornado. It definitely needs to be renovated, ground was upleasant to walk on \u2026",
          "Great range of slides. Food is expensive, better get your own, there is picnic areas. Three pools for kids under 10. Be prepared to be charged for any extras, car park, sunbed, etc. Most of slides have min height limit of 120cm.",
          "1 things we buy ticket and when we get in we still have buy the chair it is 4\u00a3 each and buy key block 5\u00a3, in ather place it is free, second thing is the food expensive but it is unfresh and  smell like odor, 3 thing i buy ticket for my \u2026",
          "Awesome place to have fun with the family",
          "don't bother if you intend to go without fast pass",
          "If going get a fast track pass for 12\u20ac otherwise you do spend a long time queuing. Otherwise a great day!",
          "Fine byt way to crowded",
          "Sorry but I would not recommend this place. Euro is the word here and they will try to squeeze every last one out of you. The entrance price of 29 euro is no way worth it. Then 12euro if you want the fast past. Which every one does so it's \u2026",
          "I was recently robbed by Aqualand El Arenal.\n\nAfter purchasing tickets online we turned up to the park being closed this day. We didn't have any incline of this whilst booking the tickets.\n\nI've contacted the park, and the company that runs \u2026",
          "Some of the rides were closed when we visited in August which was a real shame as it was one of the rides we were really looking forward.  You might be tempted to invest in a fast pass at \u20ac15 only then to find that everyone else has one and the queues for the fast pass are just as long as regular ones.",
          "There was a time when these parks were  fun but now they turned in to corporate money making machine . Total ripoff 29 \u20ac  entrance, 5\u20ac paking , waiting on any slide for 30- 45 min except if you pay extra 12 \u20ac for fast pass. They are \u2026",
          "Nice rides but absolutely terrible service and queues. On almost all rides you had to wait at least half an hour. Everyone that worked there looked like they would rather be anywhere else. While waiting on some rides you had to stand on \u2026",
          "Okay, but definitely not worth the money.",
          "We got an end of season online deal came to around 80 euro with 30% discount. This was e-ticket that you have to download to phone and scan at gate.\nA locker cost 10 euro, of which you get back 5euro deposit. Parking cost 5 euro.\nWe did not \u2026",
          "The park is obsolete, food expensive and poor all fried. nothing here does not match the price. you definitely never come back 4-member family pay 150 euro admission with priority card for attractions definitely price does not match quality.",
          "It's a rip off!!! You pay for a park entry ticket and can't get on any of the flumes as all they have is fast track boats, then when you are forced to pay for fast track they introduce more non fast track boats meaning fast track is queuing and non fast track is faster!!!\n\nYou then pay for lockers and car parking, total rip off!!",
          "Compared to other waterparks I have been to I can\u2019t believe this is the best thing Mallorca has to offer. Bear in mind you have to pay for everything (parking, lockers, hammocks, etc). If you can bring your own food because there was only \u2026",
          "Not bad for a day out if you like that sort of thing. Food is expensive and quite low quality... Basic fast food. I'd recommend you take a picnic or just rough it. Good for older kids there are height restrictions on a lot of rides though.",
          "Pretty good but when you get in they absolutely rip people off. The prices of food and drink are ridiculous.",
          "If you don't get a fast pass at this venue you are made to feel like a second class citizen.   The system doesn't work the same as other parks and you are left waiting in the queue despite rings & mats piled up just waiting for fast pass \u2026",
          "Very disappointing visit, 30 Euro entrance fee, a rip off additional 15 euros for fast track on to rides, they don't have enough of the general blue color inflatables so you can , as we did wait for 45 minutes and then still have to queue \u2026",
          "We had a brilliant day. The slides were very good. The Rapids were the best. The only thing was that the food was a bit expensive. Otherwise brilliant",
          "Nice place but if you don't want to que then you need to buy the fast pass",
          "We went to this Park as a family day out and it ended up being a nightmare from hell.\n\nThey don't tell you anywhere on the website that you have to pay \u20ac5 for parking and \u20ac4 each for a sunbed even though you are paying a premium to enter \u2026",
          "Very expensive day out for a family, entrance, lockers, food and drinks all pricey. Rides are fab but the queues are very long.",
          "Nice slides but overpriced... Also they arranged it in a way that makes it 4 times the wait if you buy regular compared to fast track",
          "Visited as a end of holiday treat for the kids...and left wishing we had spent 130 euros   more wisely. Entrance for four people was 116   euros and as if that wasn't enough, we had to pay 5 euros to park and then cough up another 5 euros \u2026",
          "We was a bit unlucky as it rained after we had been there for about an hour and a half. I believe there are 13 rides and at least half of them were closed. We will not be visiting again.",
          "Expensive but plenty of fun. Staff weren't very helpful. The park was well kept.",
          "We had the best time here and decided to go considering lots of bad reviews. Bring your car hire rental aggreement and driver goes free. Extra wrist band worth investing. We went with three dauggter 21 19 and 16 who loved it and went on \u2026",
          "Very nice place, expensive drinks and food though . You have to queue in lines if you don't buy the additional 'fast track' pass for 12 \u20ac more. The 'free lines' for what you pay in entry ticket price, are long and moving very slow. The attractions are awesome and everyone can find something they like. Overall 4/5 :)",
          "\u20ac28 per person. Great day out, park filled with slides and pools. Props to the dj who held a dance class with us in the pool, was great fun and lots of memories!\n\nI'd suggest planning for a sunny day as it can get quite cold when the sun isn't there.",
          "Lovely place to have fun",
          "Good attractions big park. High entrance fee and pricy food. Best to buy tickets online",
          "Great time had by all. Don't think you should have to pay for sunbeds after already paying an admission fee.\nSlides and pool great and plenty for the smaller kids to do too.",
          "Very fun parc !",
          "Had great fun. A fabulous day out!",
          "Amazing for the price paid it was well worth it",
          "Brilliant water park recommend the fast passes didn't queue for longer than 20 mins",
          "great park, lots to do.\nThere is a free bus service to pan casillia, just make sure you use the correct bus stops",
          "Very expensive, entrance \u20ac29,- but even worse is you get ripped off more inside. Sunbed \u20ac4,- safe \u20ac5,- a beer \u20ac4.20. Also too busy and a ridiculous fast pass system",
          "Great fun for kids & adults too.\nNot a bad price, worth paying for fast track",
          "Rides are generally good, our least favourite was the new Cobra one which has a long wait for a boring tube ride with a brief gimmick at the end and then it's a long time before you actually get to get off the ride.\nTornado (better name \u2026",
          "My son nearly drowned on a slide i rescued him whilst they did nothing because no staff noticed he was in danger!!. They need to supervise rides better. No refund was offered nothing just useless staff who need to be first aid trained learn some basic communication skills. Horrible experience!!",
          "Great water park, however, due to a complete lack of information about certain rides being closed the waiting time for 2 different rides cost me and my son 2 hrs of queuing, even with fast passes, which to be honest don't really mean much \u2026",
          "Very expensive. Charge for everything. Take your own food and drink as these rip off merchants even charge for loungers. Pools are actually great though. Just rampant shameless profiteering on everything else",
          "Great waterpark, with lots of slides and fun. Pools are great and the wave pool is lots of fun. Food is very pricy I think but it's great that they have a picnic area where you can eat your own brough foods and drinks. Cool concept with \u2026",
          "It's a good water park I would recommend getting the fast pass",
          "The cues are very very long, even if you have fast pass. Some attractions closed so early. Dont waste your time and money here.",
          "Good water park, over zealous staff sometimes",
          "Amazing place with some great slides and attractions.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it there and would love to go again if we ever visit Mallorca again.",
          "Worst Aquapark ever for this value. 4 rides out of 16 are closed, without fast pass you can easily spend more than an hour in a queue and with fast pass you will still spend more than half an hour in a queue. Going to aquapark that costs more than Disneyland or Port Aventura? No thanks.",
          "Money grabbing, basically you need to buy a fast pass or you won't get on the slides for every 6 fast pass people only one person with a normal ticket gets on and they have limited rings for people with normal tickets so you have to wait in \u2026",
          "Too long queue not worth it. Just the money making machine - definitely not customers orientated",
          "Lack of communication between top, middle and bottom staff on rapids ending up with people landing on back of others.",
          "To be honest we was quite disappointed going here as the rides were ok and there was 3 slides that were shut all day but we wasn't notified and nothing was on the web site as if we knew this we would of gone else where.you get charged 5 \u2026",
          "Extra costs for many things like for example locker which should be included. Make sure that the weather is nice becouse in our case they close at 3pm becouse of storm",
          "Great water park. Worth a visit if your on your hols.... drinks and food pricey but they always are at these places",
          "The place is full, we waited 40 mins in a queue to slide down. There's not much fun at all, costs way too much for such an old attractions. I recommend spending this 30 euros on shopping or food in Mallorca rather as buying a ticket to this \u2026",
          "Not a bad thing to do on a warm sunny day, but doesn't offer many exciting things for adults. Can be more interesting for kids, though.",
          "Nice place to have fun",
          "Very poor Fast Pass systems in place, you queue to wait for an inflatable to take on the ride - red are the Fast Pass inflatables but make up about 90% of all inflatables so its almost pointless going if you don't pay for the Fast Pass on \u2026",
          "The free pick up transport to return at the centrum of El Arenal isn't work at all! The park still learn how to do it easily with out problems to the tourist.",
          "Nice enough for a few hours but it is absolutely extortionate for everything except entry into the park",
          "The price we paid for this park (29p.p.) is definitely not worth it. Very long waiting lines, the park was not clean, the personel was unfriendly and some couldn't even speak english. Toilets without locks, toilet paper and handsoap. \u2026",
          "It is absolutely ANAZING",
          "Great but expensive food",
          "Recommend getting a fast pass bracelet since some queues are long. Great for children and adults. Good day out but recommend packing a picnic since food very expensive.",
          "Nice and  fun place. But to much time spending for waiting",
          "The park itselvfs are good. But the prices they have, is grasy!! 4 euro JUST for renting a stool to the sun! And 44 euro for just 3 Coca cola and 2 small pizza! And when you then are going out.  You have to pay 5 euro in parking... wee Will not come back again",
          "Tourists don't bother. Without a printer you cannot use the cheaper online tickets so you end up paying full gate price \u20ac29. Then once you enter you realise you need to pay another \u20ac15/person fasttrack pass otherwise the queue can be 1 to 2 \u2026",
          "Nice place, but anything, I really mean anything, like sunbed on locker, cost extra, and not cheap",
          "The slides are fun. We had a nice day here.\n\nWhen we where there, not all slides were open, but we had to pay full entrance. They also charge 5 Euro per locker and for parking - even though the flyer of Aqualand advertises \"free parking\".",
          "Descent water park, very expensive \u20ac30 entry & \u20ac15 for burger & chips",
          "Nice slides, real nice slides",
          "Some if the rides not open until later on. Food to expensive",
          "this place is the third biggest water park on this planet and i love it, im 13 years old and it has fun for my upcoming dad... at 42 age doesnt matter it ia fun for all ages! love it",
          "Spent all day here, great variety of water flumes and pools for all ages.",
          "The most unorganized place! 80% of the people\nbuy fast pass so queues without are shorter BUT there are only ONE inflatable per slide that is regular. So, everyone has to que for hours!!! STUPID!!!!",
          "Did not go inside after seeing that after you pay 30 \u20ac for an entry ticket, you still have to pay parking, storage locker and chair beside the pool.",
          "Very big waterpark, went in June and almost no queue, took about 5 mins to get on each ride.\nStaff don't know much English but do try, very nice and friendly",
          "They lure you in with a reasonable entry fee, but inside you have to pay extra for everything. There is an option called fastpass with that you get extra lanes for people who paid for it. They intentionally provide less boats for all non \u2026",
          "What an awful 'waterpark, me and my fiance visited as part of a Royal Caribbean cruise shore excursion and on certain rides there are two slides which would mean less queuing time and allow groups or couples to participate on the slide \u2026",
          "Great day out but very expensive to eat and drink there better for a family to bring your own with you",
          "The water park looks a lot like: \"oh wait, we also need a waterpark, let's build some steel structures and put on some pipes to call it a water park\". The lazy river is like a donut shaped waterstream, the slides are pretty undoable as \u2026",
          "Superb place, especially with kids, hours become minutes there is so much fun. WOW",
          "We had a great day at Aqualand , lots of slides to suit the whole family",
          "A big waterpark with a lot to offer. For young and old there is something to do. When going on a not so busy day you can do every slide offered in the place. Very busy days you can always buy a fastpass. You can easily fill a whole day \u2026",
          "Atrractions are so so ok, but everything else BAD.\nSome atrractions work one half only, the only one \"Grand Canyon\" is for the family (we have enjoyed Tenerife's waterpark for family fun), all the atrractions fits for minimum 120 cm so \u2026",
          "Expensive, not worth 150 Euros for family of 4, the main rides don\u2019t have fast pass so you wait anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s great for kids though and that\u2019s what counts.",
          "The attractions are great, but queues are really long, takes half an hour to probe one slide without fast pass. You have to pay for everything above the entry fee (lockers, sunbeds, fast pass for less waiting)",
          "Great day out",
          "Make sure to get a fast pass as you'll be queuing for AGES.",
          "Unreal too many slides to go through  it was enjoyable",
          "great attractions, but you have to pay for everything. parking 5 \u20ac, sun loungers 4 \u20ac. In my opinion, the very entrance is very expensive and you still have to pay for parking...terrible",
          "Great time, fun, really love it",
          "Very expensive. Large queues to everything. Slides were good however you only get to go on them once or you risk not going on everything they have to offer.",
          "Perfect, the \"VIP\" is for 12 \u20ac per person, but saves a lot of time",
          "Very expensive. For a locker, inflatables, sunbeds, food and drink you need 40E +. Great rides but queues are very long if you choose not to rent you own inflatable. Huge water park with many different slides - lots of fun. But comes at a price.",
          "Could improve there services",
          "Love it and will come here again in one day",
          "After reading some reviews i was a bit worried. However, it was well worth it! The waterslides were amazing and staff were really friendly and helpful, laughing and joking with us. We went on a Sunday so it was fairly quiet but when there \u2026",
          "We tried to be smart and picked a less frequent day - Saturday. Plus we bought pass fast immediately after entering as reviews advised there is no point in going without it. It worked our well for us, we didn\u00b4t get annoyed by queuing, it \u2026",
          "Its good fun for all the family, but take your own food & drink. Don't hire a lounger, take a blanket. Food & drink was extremely expensive & there were not price lists up.....",
          "Went here today 30th July 2018 with my wife and children (age 4 and 7) and it was the worst day of any holiday ever.\n\nYou\u2019re probably thinking, how could a park this bad possibly stay open? Surely people would go elsewhere? It is because \u2026",
          "Good value for money. My boys loved it.",
          "Fastpass... Basically the entrance is 28\u20ac but once you're in they do everything to make you pay more. They created a discriminating system in which you can pay 12 \u20ac to cut the lines but that isn't the worse. When I went there the park \u2026",
          "Good place for family..\nSomehow better than Western park.\nOnly.. fast track.. don't need. Also very expensive food and drink.",
          "Neverless announced as water park for whole family, there is no single tobogan for kids. Websides saying nothing about strict rules ( no sun glasess in water or you can buy expensive leash). Food very expensive. Without extra pay for fast track you still waiting. For kids 2-4 years no slides. Much better aquaparks around then this.",
          "This park are happy to take people's money when it suits but can't be bothered to change their online status to closed !",
          "Had to purchase a pair of swimming shorts as I tore mine when I got to the changing rooms I noticed they was defective. So I returned to the gift shop and asked for a new pair. They was very reluctant and tried to insinuate I had damaged \u2026",
          "Some slides good but not enough for the amount of people they let in.\nWill need a lot more to cope with crowds.\nComplete con as well if you don't buy a fast pass as you will never get on anything.\nSh1 t water park to be honest",
          "Excellent waterpark for all ages! Although I highly recommend the VIP wristbands to skip those long ques!!",
          "They have everywhere billboards that are showing the price of 15\u20ac/person, but at the counter they told the price is 28\u20ac. The price from billboard is only for the second visit.\n\nEven if you can have some fun, there where big waiting lines, doesn't worth the price.",
          "Great park, lots of fun. Signs aren't always clear.",
          "If your not prepared to pay out the extra for fast passes then prepare for a long long wait. Real shame spoiled the day",
          "Quite good for our 5 year old but felt that 60 euros for 3 pizzas & 3 slushies was overly extortionate. Some queues very long, even though park was not that crowded. 4 euros per sunbed, 5 euros parking charge - a good day out but they sure maximise their profits!",
          "Most overpriced and the slowest park we visited. During all day we used only 5 attractions. My recommendation for Aqualand team is to visit Siam Park in Tenerife, where for same price you will get 4x better attractions, services in much better area.",
          "very good but get the fast pass trust me",
          "Very good water park the kids loved it.",
          "Nice Waterpark, kids muss be 120cm tall to get on most slides",
          "Appalling day, run down and poor staff",
          "Such a rip off! The sad thing is the rides are actually very enjoyable but having to pay \u20ac120 to get in is just a rip off. Plus having to wait for like an hour to get on a ride in the baking sun also ruins it. Also you cannot take swimming goggles in or a shirt to stop you from getting sunburn.",
          "The best water park on the island. We travel there  several times ever year from Santa Ponca. Could be a little cheaper on the refreshment.",
          "Fun water park. Plan on spending at least 5 hours. At lunchtime the queue to certain food places can be long and slow. If you plan to buy your tickets online, you have to do it the day before you go there.",
          "Excellent rides but installation is getting shabby",
          "When the park is empty you will get value for money. But expect crippling queues and frustration if the park is full.\nwell laid out, many rides and pools, lots of cover and grass\nAvoid the family ride its a waste of time - yes 5 of you can ride together but believe me the 5 second ride is not worth the 34 min wait",
          "very long waiting times to get on slides.  for five people cost 220 euros.  not what I was expecting not allowed shirts.  expensive food",
          "Great, but I wouldn't go without a fast pass",
          "Nice water park but for the biggest one in Mallorca it was quite small with very few big slides. Nevertheless we had a good time and was well worth the visit.",
          "Great day out but the food and drinks were very over priced! Nearly \u20ac7 for a slushy!!! Very clean and tidy. Queues moved quickly too.",
          "Very good, some slides adults can't go on with children, but that was expected, would advise to get the fast pass",
          "Disgusting, unclean, rude staff, not a lot open and only one pool had water in.",
          "Amazing place apart from the food, drinks and lockers are totally over priced.",
          "Great but the food is expensive once you are in there. I advise you to take your own.",
          "High Basic ticket Price 28 \u20ac And you have To Buy fast queue add 10 \u20ac parking  4 \u20ac guardrobe 7 \u20ac lounge 4 \u20ac . in a day, if you don't Buy \"fast queue\", you only play 5 Games.  every Game is'n so beautiful.  many Games are for two People only. your Group should be a multiple of two.",
          "Nice swimmingpark with a lot of slides, can be very busy",
          "Tickets are expensive and you should take the fast pass if you do not wanna be frustrated(10euros)  so you will pay 38euros per person me which is a lot but not more than another attraction parks. Bad reviews comes from the fact that people \u2026",
          "Great place for family.spend 6 hours, relaxing in shadow and going in slides. Fast express excellent value.",
          "A massive disappointment! The water park does have a few good rides but it is so poorly organised that you spend all your time in queues. We spent over 1hr trying to get some lunch and eventually gave up. The prices are also very high for whats on offer. I wouldn't recommend this water park to anyone.",
          "Disappointing. Some rides do not open until 12 noon although park opens at 10am. Food and drink is extremely expensive nearly 15 euros for 4 bottles of water. Almost 5 euros for 2 packets of crisps. Park not organised or managed well. Most of the staff are about 17.",
          "Overcrowded overpriced aquapark with lack of attractions and lines/quoues where u can stay 45-50 minutes. Fast track allows you to save 5-10 minutes only. So if you are lucky and have read reviews, better save your time and spend this day somewhere on the beach.",
          "Great variety of rides and good food on-site",
          "Spent way more time in queues than in water, food and drinks are extortion at its very best, hidden charges everywhere for example.. lockers its 5 euro that they keep and 4 euro to \"rent\" a sun lounger, in all ok... But excessive wait times and extortion",
          "Many different kind of water slides. It makes really fun. But the food is fastfood from the supermarket and too expensive.",
          "It is a very good waterpark, but pricey. Everything is expensive there",
          "Worst waterpark I have ever been to, not enough staff controlling the queuelines. The Congo river ride was totally out of order, with teenagers diving and jumping in the river at any point on the river, large queue lines on non fast track not enough rings/mats etc, staff could do with a course on how to smile.",
          "Great place to spend a day with the family. Wonderful staff and rides are great.",
          "this water park is well worth going to! spectacular! it was lots of good fun all day with a great range of slides that will keep you entertained all day. although it is a little pricey at 24 euros to get in it is well worth the money and \u2026",
          "nice place, even suitable for babys, not so crowded when I was there. Closing at 17.00 and not minute later. dont forget to get parking token for your car before you will leave.",
          "Why are prices for food and drink not displayed anywhere? I'll hazard a guess that it's because they are extortionate and sure, you have no choice on where to eat whilst in there anyway...what does it matter? Basic pizza, small salad and \u2026",
          "We enjoyed our day here although the park is smaller than we expected\nSaying that there was three good slides and they went on all day\n\nThe lazy river was a let down\nBut there were good food options for lunch and we were lucky with the weather",

Sunchairs inside the park cost 4\u20ac rent. Lockers for valuables also cost extra. And very long queues for the attractions.",

          "Absolute waste of money. Unless you're happy queuing for hours to get on the poorly managed rides only to have the locals barge in front. Don't waste your money",
          "Not the biggest water park we've been to and don't get me wrong we expected to queue but when u have to queue for an inflatable n then again for the ride plus the fast pass people had an abundance of of inflatables to hand  so more of them \u2026",

          "If you don't buy the fast pass for your visit you are wasting your time going. We didnt and quewed for 90 minutes on certain rides, as they favour the fast pass holders too much. Food is poor and expensive, take a picnic and spend the money you save on fast passes and you may have a good day.",
          "Total waste of money if you have children under 120cm but would have been a great day with older children",
          "Absolutely garbage , it's a money vacuum. If you don't pay for the extras then your treated like your 2nd rate , wait far too long for rides unless you fork over money for a fast pass . Lockers cost far too much just to hold your stuff and food is stupidly expensive , unless Money is no concern to you avoid like the plague.",

          "Spend all day queueing! Even with fastpass you queue for hours for favourite rides!!!  You queue to enter,  to eat and drink,  to buy parking.   Everything costs extra and is not worth it! Avoid!!!",
          "The only way you can really enjoy this park is by buying a fast pas otherwise the wait is horrendous. As to the rides themselves there are just 2 that are worth the wait.",

          "Too expensive for what is there. Family of 4 kids 8 & 6 94 euros entry then an extra 48 if you want fast pass, ques if you don't are very long so kids got bord. When you do finally get on the slides the kids got stuck more often than \u2026",

          "It was amazing.  But on the king cobra we got stuck for a little bit.  Also, if you want chips you have to queue up for about 3 days. The best ride was kamikaze because you didn't have to queue but my friends favourite was banzai and \u2026",

          "Water slides, yay. Not a great value, and as noted elsewhere FastPass is not a guarantee of short lines, but the alternative is far worse.\n\nAbout half the rides need a cushion, for which FP saves you a lot of time, but for other rides it \u2026",
          "Great park. Highly recommended, some awesome slides. Food isnt cheap",
          "Not a great selection of slides, was overcrowded when we went. A fair amount of queue jumping. Wave pool countdown clock wasn't changed so never caught it working. Congo river full of kids fighting with the rings. Only managed to get on 2 \u2026",

          "What a terrible investment. The lines where outrageous and the prices way too high. It cost 110 Euros for 3 people with entry and food. The staff was very rude aswell. DON'T spend money on this, spend it on a great day on the beach with activities and action instead. Just DON'T go to this park.",

          "This place is very expensive for what it is, and you'll spend most of your time in line.\nThere are huge queues for everything. They make you wait in line for a inflatable ring, then wait again to get on the slide. Some of them took 40 mins \u2026",

          "Fun when it wasn't busy",
          "After paying \u00a3180.00 for 2 adults and a 4 year old most of the slides were glossed. The food and refreshments very expensive and the toilets untidy and dirty. Won't recommend it to anyone. Also had to pay for lockers and sun lounger, very disappointed.",
          "This is not What you should be expecting with all the advertisement. The price to begin with is way expensive ( 25 euro's  per person), and you have to pay for extra lockers if you don't want to lose your belonging. Then when I was finally \u2026",
          "The park is not value for money. The admission fee is expensive especially when you take into account all the add on fee like for a locker, benches etc. You should bring your own picnic instead of queing for unhealthy,expensive food with \u2026",

          "If you like markets then this is worth a look - it is not as atmospheric as the one in Malaga but still good. The cured meats and variety of fish make you wish there were some like this in the UK. As well as little tapas bars there were also sushi and oyster/champagne stalls",
          "This is a great marketplace to get leather goods, and other clothing items. There are about 200 stalls in this market that spans the streets of this inland city of Mallorca. Market day is Thursday, and it's well worth making the trip from wherever you are as the choice of goods",
          "Mercat de l'Oliver is a large market with everything a market should have. Not as exciting as some but what it lacks is novelty or aesthetics it makes up for in function. With a large supermarket above it it's a useful place if you are staying in an apartment in Palma. Around",

          "This place has stalls that offer local fruit, vegetables, nuts etc that taste like you just picked them from your garden. Sample the cheeses and cured meats before you buy to ensure you get the right product according to your taste.. If you are a food lover, this is the place",
          "The guide books say go early but the market doesn't really get going until about 9.00 am. Fresh produce from land and sea abound in the packed and colourful stalls and, even if you're not buying, it's a visual feast. There's plenty of already prepared takeaway food and modest",

          "A pleasant colourful market with very well presented stalls. The ham and fresh fruits and vegetables all looked fresh and colourful. Today the fish stalls were mostly empty but around half had a good selection to sell. The eateries in the fish market felt cold and uninviting",
          "We four tourists(!!) visited this great market a few times on a recent. The produce is amazing. My wife and I had cava and tapas at one of the small stalls for food and drink which were everywhere. Four of us went back and shopped from many stalls to do our own tapas night in",

          "It is to our eternal shame in the UK that, in spite of being an island, the overwhelming majority of people hate fish. So, as a Brit who loves fish, this place is fantastic... Not least because the British fish-haters are nowhere to be seen. The market is brimming with fantastic",

        "wiki": "Mallorca (Catalan: [m\u0259\u02c8\u028e\u0254\u027ek\u0259], Spanish: [ma\u02c8\u028eo\u027eka]) or Majorca (English:  m\u0259-YOR-k\u0259, -\u2060JOR-) is the largest island in the Balearic Islands, which are part of Spain and located in the Mediterranean.  The local language, as on the rest of the Balearic Islands, is Catalan, which is co-official with Spanish.\nThe capital of the island, Palma, is also the capital of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. The Balearic Islands have been an autonomous region of Spain since 1983. There are two small islands off the coast of Mallorca: Cabrera (southeast of Palma) and Dragonera (west of Palma). The anthem of Mallorca is \"La Balanguera\".\nLike the other Balearic Islands of Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera, the island is an extremely popular holiday destination, particularly for tourists from Germany and the United Kingdom. The international airport, Palma de Mallorca Airport, is one of the busiest in Spain; it was used by 28 million passengers in 2017, with use increasing every year since 2012.The name derives from Classical Latin insula maior, \"larger island\". Later, in Medieval Latin, this became Maiorica, \"the larger one\", in comparison to Menorca, \"the smaller one\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric settlements ===\n\nLittle is recorded of the earliest inhabitants of the island. Burial chambers and traces of habitation from the Neolithic period (6000\u20134000 BC) have been discovered, particularly the prehistoric settlements called talaiots, or talayots. They raised Bronze Age megaliths as part of their Talaiotic culture. A non-exhaustive list is the following:\n\nCapocorb Vell (Llucmajor municipality)\nNecr\u00f2poli de Son Real (east of Can Picafort, Santa Margalida municipality)\nNovetiforme Alemany (Magaluffa, Calvi\u00e0, Miconio)\nPoblat Talai\u00f2tic de S'Illot (S'Illot, Sant Lloren\u00e7 des Cardassar municipality)\nPoblat Talai\u00f2tic de Son Forn\u00e9s (Montu\u00efri municipality)\nSa Canova de Morell (road to Col\u00f2nia de Sant Pere, Art\u00e0 municipality)\nSes Pa\u00efsses (Art\u00e0 municipality)\nSes Talaies de Can Jordi (Santany\u00ed municipality)\nS'Hospitalet Vell (road to Cales de Mallorca, Manacor municipality)\n\n\n=== Phoenicians, Romans, and Late Antiquity ===\n\nThe Phoenicians, a seafaring people from the Levant, arrived around the eighth century BC and established numerous colonies. The island eventually came under the control of Carthage in North Africa, which had become the principal Phoenician city. After the Second Punic War, Carthage lost all of its overseas possessions and the Romans took over.The island was occupied by the Romans in 123 BC under Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus. It flourished under Roman rule, during which time the towns of Pollentia (Alc\u00fadia), and Palmaria (Palma) were founded. In addition, the northern town of Bocchoris, dating back to pre-Roman times, was a federated city to Rome. The local economy was largely driven by olive cultivation, viticulture, and salt mining. Mallorcan soldiers were valued within the Roman legions for their skill with the sling.In 427, Gunderic and the Vandals captured the island. Geiseric, son of Gunderic, governed Mallorca and used it as his base to loot and plunder settlements around the Mediterranean  until Roman rule was restored in 465.\n\n\n=== Middle Age and Modern history ===\n\n\n==== Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages ====\nIn 534, Mallorca was recaptured by the Eastern Roman Empire, led by Apollinarius. Under Roman rule, Christianity thrived and numerous churches were built.\nFrom 707, the island was increasingly attacked by Muslim raiders from North Africa. Recurrent invasions led the islanders to ask Charlemagne for help.\n\n\n==== Moorish Mallorca ====\n\nIn 902, Issam al-Khawlani(es)(ca) (Arabic: \u0639\u0635\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u064a\u200e) conquered the Balearic Islands, and it became part of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba. The town of Palma was reshaped and expanded, and became known as Medina Mayurqa. Later on, with the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba at its height, the Moors improved agriculture with irrigation and developed local industries.\nThe caliphate was dismembered in 1015. Mallorca came under rule by the Taifa of D\u00e9nia, and from 1087 to 1114, was an independent Taifa. During that period, the island was visited by Ibn Hazm. However, an expedition of Pisans and Catalans in 1114\u201315, led by Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, overran the island, laying siege to Palma for eight months. After the city fell, the invaders retreated due to problems in their own lands. They were replaced by the Almoravides from North Africa, who ruled until 1176. The Almoravides were replaced by the Almohad dynasty until 1229. Ab\u00fa Yahya was the last Moorish leader of Mallorca.\n\n\n==== Medieval Mallorca ====\n\nIn the ensuing confusion and unrest, King James I of Aragon, also known as James the Conqueror, launched an invasion which landed at Santa Pon\u00e7a, Mallorca, on 8\u20139 September 1229 with 15,000 men and 1,500 horses. His forces entered the city of Medina Mayurqa on 31 December 1229. In 1230 he annexed the island to his Crown of Aragon under the name Regnum Maioricae.\n\n\n==== Modern era ====\n\nFrom 1479, the Crown of Aragon was in dynastic union with that of Castile. The Barbary corsairs of North Africa often attacked the Balearic Islands, and in response, the people built coastal watchtowers and fortified churches. In 1570, King Philip II of Spain and his advisors were considering complete evacuation of the Balearic islands.In the early 18th century, the War of the Spanish Succession resulted in the replacement of that dynastic union with a unified Spanish monarchy under the rule of the new Bourbon Dynasty. The last episode of the War of Spanish Succession was the conquest of the island of Mallorca. It took place on 2 July 1715 when the island capitulated to the arrival of a Bourbon fleet. In 1716, the Nueva Planta decrees made Mallorca part of the Spanish province of Baleares, roughly the same to present-day Illes Balears province and autonomous community.\n\n\n=== 20th century and today ===\nA Nationalist stronghold at the start of the Spanish Civil War, Mallorca was subjected to an amphibious landing, on 16 August 1936, aimed at driving the Nationalists from Mallorca and reclaiming the island for the Republic. Although the Republicans heavily outnumbered their opponents and managed to push 12 km (7.5 mi) inland, superior Nationalist air power, provided mainly by Fascist Italy as part of the Italian occupation of Majorca, forced the Republicans to retreat and to leave the island completely by 12 September. Those events became known as the Battle of Majorca.Since the 1950s, the advent of mass tourism has transformed the island into a destination for foreign visitors and attracted many service workers from mainland Spain. The boom in tourism caused Palma to grow significantly.\nIn the 21st century, urban redevelopment, under the so\u2011called Pla Mirall (English \"Mirror Plan\"), attracted groups of immigrant workers from outside the European Union, especially from Africa and South America.\n\n\n==== Archaeology ====\nA 3,200-year-old well-preserved Bronze Age sword was discovered by archaeologists under the leadership of Jaume Deya and Pablo Galera on the Mallorca Island in the Puigpunyent from the stone megaliths site called Talaiot. Specialists assumed that the weapon was made when the Talaiotic culture was in critical comedown. The sword will be on display at the nearby Majorca Museum.\n\n\n=== Palma ===\n\nThe capital of Mallorca, Palma, was founded as a Roman camp called Palmaria upon the remains of a Talaiotic settlement. The turbulent history of the city had it subject to several Vandal sackings during the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It was later reconquered by the Byzantines, established by the Moors (who called it Medina Mayurqa), and finally occupied by James I of Aragon. In 1983, Palma became the capital of the autonomous region of the Balearic Islands. Palma has a famous tourist attraction, the cathedral, Catedral-Bas\u00edlica de Santa Mar\u00eda de Mallorca, standing in the heart of the City looking out over the ocean.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate of Mallorca is a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa), with mild and stormy winters and hot, bright, dry summers. Precipitation in the Serra de Tramuntana is markedly higher. Summers are hot in the plains, and winters mild, getting colder in the Tramuntana range, where brief episodes of snow during the winter are not unusual. The two wettest months in Mallorca are October and December.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nMallorca and the other Balearic Islands are geologically an extension of the fold mountains of the Betic Cordillera of Andalusia. They consist primarily of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea during the Mesozoic era. These marine deposits have given rise to calcareous rocks which are often fossiliferous. The folding of the Betic Cordillera and Mallorcan ranges resulted from subduction of the African plate beneath the Eurasian plate with eventual collision. Tectonic movements led to different elevation and lowering zones in the late Tertiary period, which is why the connection to the mainland has been severed at the current sea level. \nThe limestones, which predominate throughout Mallorca, are readily water-soluble, and have given rise to extensive areas of karst. In addition to limestone, dolomitic rocks are mainly present in the mountainous regions of Mallorca; the Serra de Tramuntana and the Serres de Llevant. The Serres de Llevant also contain marl, the more rapid erosion of which has resulted in the lower elevations of the island's southeastern mountains. Marl is limestone with a high proportion of clay minerals. The eroded material was washed into the sea or deposited in the interior of the island of the Pla de Mallorca, bright marls in the north-east of the island and ferrous clays in the middle of Mallorca, which gives the soil its characteristic reddish colour.\n\n\n=== Regions ===\n\nMallorca is the largest island of Spain by area and second most populated (after Tenerife in the Canary Islands).\nMallorca has two mountainous regions, the Serra de Tramuntana and Serres de Llevant. Both are about 70 km (43 mi) in length and occupy the northwestern and eastern parts of the island respectively.\nThe highest peak on Mallorca is Puig Major at 1,445 m (4,741 ft) in the Serra de Tramuntana. As this is a military zone, the neighbouring peak at Puig de Massanella is the highest accessible peak at 1,364 m (4,475 ft). The northeast coast comprises two bays: the Badia de Pollen\u00e7a and the larger Badia d'Alc\u00fadia.\nThe northern coast is rugged and has many cliffs. The central zone, extending from Palma, is a generally flat, fertile plain known as Es Pla.  The island has a variety of caves both above and below the sea \u2013 two of the caves, the above sea level Coves dels Hams and the Coves del Drach, also contain underground lakes and are open to tours.  Both are located near the eastern coastal town of Porto Cristo.  Small uninhabited islands lie off the southern and western coasts; the Cabrera Archipelago is administratively grouped with Mallorca (in the municipality of Palma), while Dragonara is administratively included in the municipality of Andratx. Other notable areas include the Alfabia Mountains, Es Cornadors and Cap de Formentor.\n\n\n=== World Heritage Site ===\nThe Cultural Landscape of the Serra de Tramuntana was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.\n\n\n=== Municipalities ===\n\nThe island (including the small offshore islands of Cabrera and Dragonera) is administratively divided into 53 municipalities. The areas and populations of the municipalities (according to the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, Spain) are:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria ===\n\nArchduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria (Catalan: Arxiduc Llu\u00eds Salvador) was the architect of tourism in the Balearic Islands. He first arrived on the island in 1867, travelling under his title \"Count of Neuendorf\". He later settled on Mallorca, buying up wild areas of land in order to preserve and enjoy them. Nowadays, a number of trekking routes are named after him.Ludwig Salvator loved the island of Mallorca. He became fluent in Catalan, carried out research into the island's flora and fauna, history, and culture to produce his main work, Die Balearen, a comprehensive collection of books about the Balearic Islands, consisting of 7 volumes. It took him 22 years to complete.\n\n\n=== Chopin in Mallorca ===\n\nThe Polish composer and pianist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, together with French writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (pseudonym: George Sand), resided in Valldemossa in the winter of 1838\u201339. Apparently, Chopin's health had already deteriorated and his doctor recommended that he go to the Balearic Islands to recuperate, where he still spent a rather miserable winter.Nonetheless, his time in Mallorca was a productive period for Chopin. He managed to finish the Preludes, Op. 28, that he started writing in 1835. He was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.\n\n\n=== Literature and painting ===\nFrench writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (pseudonym: George Sand), at that time in a relationship with Chopin, described her stay in Mallorca in A Winter in Majorca, published in 1855. Other famous writers used Mallorca as the setting for their works: While on the island, the Nicaraguan poet Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo started writing the novel El oro de Mallorca, and wrote several poems, such as La isla de oro. Many of the works of Baltasar Porcel take place in Mallorca. Ira Levin set part of his dystopian novel This Perfect Day in Mallorca, making the island a centre of resistance in a world otherwise dominated by a computer.\nAgatha Christie visited the island in the early 20th century and stayed in Palma and Port de Pollen\u00e7a. She would later write the book Problem at Pollensa Bay and Other Stories, a collection of short stories, of which the first one takes place in Port de Pollen\u00e7a, starring Parker Pyne.\nJorge Luis Borges visited Mallorca twice, accompanied by his family. He published his poems La estrella (1920) and Catedral (1921) in the regional magazine Baleares. The latter poem shows his admiration for the monumental Cathedral of Palma.Nobel prize winner Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela came to Mallorca in 1954, visiting Pollen\u00e7a, and then moving to Palma, where he settled permanently. In 1956, Cela founded the magazine Papeles de Son Armadans. He is also credited as founder of Alfaguara.\n\nThe English poet Robert Graves moved to Mallorca with his family in 1946. The house is now a museum. He died in 1985 and his body was buried in the small churchyard on a hill at Dei\u00e0.\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\nThe Ball dels Cossiers is the island's traditional dance. It is believed to have been imported from Catalonia in the 13th or 14th century, after the Aragonese conquest of the island under King Jaime I. In the dance, three pairs of dancers, who are typically male, defend a \"Lady,\" who is played by a man or a woman, from a demon or devil. Another Mallorcan dance is Correfoc, an elaborate festival of dance and pyrotechnics that is also of Catalan origin. The island's folk music strongly resembles that of Catalonia, and is centered around traditional instruments like the xeremies (bagpipe) and guitarra de canya (a reed or bone xylophone-like instrument suspended from the neck). While folk music is still played and enjoyed by many on the island, a number of other musical traditions have become popular in Mallorca in the 21st century, including electronic dance music, classical music, and jazz, all of which have annual festivals on the island.\n\n\n=== Art ===\nJoan Mir\u00f3, a Spanish painter, sculptor, and ceramicist, had close ties to the island throughout his life, he married Pilar Juncosa in Palma in 1929 and settled permanently in Mallorca in 1954. The Fundaci\u00f3 Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3 in Mallorca has a collection of his works. Es Baluard in Palma is a museum of modern and contemporary art which exhibits the work of Balearic artists and artists related to the Balearic Islands.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe Evolution Mallorca International Film Festival is the fastest growing Mediterranean film festival and has occurred annually every November since 2011, attracting filmmakers, producers, and directors globally. It is hosted at the Teatro Principal in Palma de Mallorca\n\n\n=== Mallorcan cartographic school ===\n\nMallorca has a long history of seafaring. The Majorcan cartographic school or the \"Catalan school\" refers to a collection of cartographers, cosmographers, and navigational instrument makers that flourished in Mallorca and partly in mainland Catalonia in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. Mallorcan cosmographers and cartographers developed breakthroughs in cartographic techniques, namely the \"normal portolan chart\", which was fine-tuned for navigational use and the plotting by compass of navigational routes, prerequisites for the discovery of the New World.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nIn 2005, there were over 2,400 restaurants on the island of Mallorca according to the Mallorcan Tourist Board, ranging from small bars to full restaurants. Olives and almonds are typical of the Mallorcan diet. Among the foods that are typical from Mallorca are sobrassada, arr\u00f2s brut (saffron rice cooked with chicken, pork and vegetables), and the sweet pastry ensa\u00efmada. Also Pa amb oli is a popular dish.Herbs de Majorca is a herbal liqueur.\n\n\n== Language ==\nThe main language spoken on the island is Catalan. The two official languages of Mallorca are Catalan and Spanish. The local dialect of Catalan spoken in the island is Mallorqu\u00ed, with slightly different variants in most villages. Education is bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, with some teaching of English.In 2012, the then-governing People's Party announced its intention to end preferential treatment for Catalan in the island's schools to bring parity to the two languages of the island. It was said that this could lead Mallorcan Catalan to become extinct in the fairly near future, as it was being used in a situation of diglossia in favour of the Spanish language. As of 2016, with the most recent election in May 2015 sweeping a pro-Catalan party and president into power, the Popular Party's policy of trilingualism (Catal\u00e1n, Spanish, English) has been dismantled, making this outcome unlikely.\n\n\n== Population ==\nMallorca is the most populous island in the Balearic Islands and the second most populous island in Spain, after Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, being also the fourth most populous island in the Mediterranean after Sicily, Sardinia and Cyprus. It had an officially estimated population of 896,038 inhabitants at the start of 2019.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSince the 1950s, Mallorca has become a major tourist destination, and the tourism business has become the main source of revenue for the island. With thousands of rooms available Mallorca's economy is largely dependent on its tourism industry. Holiday makers are attracted by the large number of beaches, warm weather, and high-quality tourist amenities. Due to the climate and diversity in roads, Majorca attracts a lot of cyclists.\nThe island's popularity as a tourist destination has steadily grown since the 1950s, with many artists and academics choosing to visit and live on the island. Visitors to Mallorca continued to increase with holiday makers in the 1970s approaching 3 million a year. In 2010 over 6 million visitors came to Mallorca. In 2013, Mallorca was visited by nearly 9.5 million tourists, and the Balearic Islands as a whole reached 13 million tourists. In 2017, ten million tourists visited the island. The rapid growth of the tourism industry has led to some locals protesting the effects of mass tourism on the island.Mallorca has been jokingly referred to as the 17th Federal State of Germany, due to the high number of German tourists.Attempts to build illegally caused a scandal in 2006 in Port Andratx that the newspaper El Pa\u00eds named \"caso Andratx\". A main reason for illegal building permits, corruption and black market construction is that communities have few ways to finance themselves other than through permits. The former mayor was incarcerated in 2009 after being prosecuted for taking bribes to permit illegal house building.\n\n\n=== Top 10 arrivals by nationality ===\nData from Institute of Statistics of Balearic Islands\n\n\n== Politics and government ==\n\n\n=== Regional government ===\nThe Balearic Islands, of which Mallorca forms part, are one of the autonomous communities of Spain. As a whole, they are currently governed by the Balearic Islands Socialist Party (PSIB-PSOE), with Francina Armengol as their President.\n\n\n=== Insular government ===\nThe specific government institution for the island is the Insular Council of Mallorca, created in 1978.It is responsible for culture, roads, railways (see Serveis Ferroviaris de Mallorca) and municipal administration. As of July 2019, Catalina Cladera (PSIB-PSOE) serves as president of the Insular Council.\n\n\n== Mallorcans ==\n\nSome of the earliest famous Mallorcans lived on the island before its reconquest from the Moors. Famous Mallorcans include:\n\nAl-Humayd\u012b, Moorish historian, born on the island in 1029.\nAbraham Cresques, a 14th-century Jewish cartographer of the Majorcan cartographic school from Palma, believed to be the author of the Catalan Atlas;\nRobert Graves, English writer, lived for many years in Mallorca, buried in a small churchyard on a hill at Dei\u00e0.\nRamon Llull, a friar, writer and philosopher, who wrote the first major work of Catalan Literature;\nJun\u00edpero Serra, the Franciscan friar who founded the mission chain in Alta California in 1769.\nJoaqu\u00edn Jovellar y Soler, 19th century military commander.\nAntonio Maura, two-time Spanish Prime Minister.\n\n\n=== Notable residents, alive in modern times ===\nEaktay Ahn (1906\u20131965), founder of the Balearic Symphony Orchestra and composer of Korean national anthem, lived in Mallorca from 1946 until his death in 1965.\nJeffrey Archer, English novelist, owns a villa in Mallorca.\nMarco Asensio, Spanish footballer, plays for Real Madrid, was born in Palma, Mallorca.\nMiquel Barcel\u00f3, contemporary painter, created sculptures in Palma Cathedral.\nConcha Buika, contemporary flamenco singer.

          "Great day out we visited the caves takes about 1 hour to get there from our home and then about 1 1/2 hours to go in and out . Then went to a nice beach near by to finish the day . The caves are sooo beautiful worth a look. Also lots of steps so wouldn\u2019t advise if you struggle",
          "We came here with our 4 year old and our parents and although visitors were restricted because of Covid19 - it was quite full. It was hard to enjoy the beautiful formations and there was a lot of walking involved - partly difficult for elderly people. The highlight is the",
          "Lovely experience for a relatively small price. This cave wasn\u2019t our first experience of this kind but offers a really nice experience: shot classic concrete and boat experience in the cave lake. Just for that worth going.",
          "Definitely worth a visit, even if you might think one cave is much like another!! The whole experience was beautifully executed, particularly given the COVID restrictions. The caves are wonderfully illuminated to add to the magnificence and sheer scale of the place. There is",
          "This was one of the best experience we had on Mallorca. The cave was incredible and the lighting was amazing, the staff was great and got to take a boat across a little water way. Then we had an amazing live concert with incredible acoustics. The trip can be a little chilly so",
          "It\u2019s a place that you must see if you arrive in Palma de Mallorca!! There you will find a wonderful view. Lights and amazing lighted paths. A lake with extremely pure and clear water. And finally a concert of classical music held on the lake will delight your hearing.",
          "The experience to see the cave is very good. We visited in July so outside it was hot. But Inside it is nice and cool. The boat experience is nice inside cave. Overall a 5 star.",
          "Definitely worth a visit, tranquil beautiful place with a nice concert, good for all the family. I would recommend a vist.",
          "Amazing experience Spectacular concert 25m under the ground, brought tears in my eyes, a feeling out of this world Lovely family day",
          "The little concert at the end was beautiful but the whole setting is stunning. And the walk although quite dark the lighting was perfect to catch the ombience beautifully.",
          "Beautiful scenic place with a very romantic concert on the bottom of the cave with simple lights on the boat with the artists and darkened everywhere else. Must see if you're in Mallorca",
          "The caves were very stunning and the live music played at the end of the tour was beautiful. Both we, as well as our 4 year old loved the visit. The only downside for me is that I would have liked some information on the cave and what we were looking at.",
          "Majorca is a lovely island that is part of the Balearic Islands off the east coast of Spain. There\u2019s a lot to see, do, eat and drink there. The Caves of Drach are a series of four large caves on the Island of Majorca. Sitting on the east coast of the island, they\u2019re a hugely",
          "Went here years ago and it still looks as beautiful now, as it was then. The classical music was wry nice",
          "The caves are impressive and nice and easy to visit (not for people in wheelchairs or walking issues though). They are well signposted, plenty of parking space and you can eat and drink something on site as well. All in all a nice thing to do when visiting Mallorca.",
          "Visited Cuevas del Drac and de Art\u00e1 on the same day. Out of these 2 I would definitely choose Cuevas de Art\u00e1. In Art\u00e1 the tour size is smaller and the guide actually tells you facts, albeit little, about the caves. In Drach you are just guided through the caves among +50 others",
          "Never seen anything like it. Should be or must be a worlds heritage site. So breathtakingly beautiful and well kept, surprising classic music concert on underground boats had really made it spectacular and experience to remember. Must see!!!",
          "If you have never been to a cave before then this is wow! What you get is only a walk through with no information, nothing. At the end they have a musical concert, that is what they call which is also no big shakes. Would say, there are better ways to handle tours within caves.",
          "The Wife and myself were staying in Porto Christo which is where the Cave Del Drach actually are we walked from out hotel which was across the road paid roughly \u00a33 each to get in well worth it the place is beautiful you follow the paths to the bottom which is all lit up. You sit",
          "Very interesting. Live music concert was pretty, but it is hard to see it, if many people are there. It is not allowd to film it, but some people try to do it.",
          "This was our 3rd or 4th trip to the caves and the concert is quite magical in the caves on the lake!",
          "We arrived in the morning and there was a lot off people. For the entry we were waiting about the hour. While we was waiting, we found out that near is very beautiful stony beach, with spectacular view. Caves wasn't very impressive as we thought, but it is worth to see once.",
          "A fantastic experience I wouldn\u2019t have missed for anything! The trip was very well organised and not expensive. The tour guide on the coach spoke 4 languages, English, French, German and Spanish and he made it very interesting too. I fully recommend this trip as the caves are",
          "We arrived n the morning just as it opened. The only problem being there were coach loads of people there. So we had to wait 2 hours for entry. Then when its your you queue outside in the hot sun. This place is not disabled friendly. Also because of time yore constantly moved on",
          "It is a majestic place to visit deep down under ground. The lake at the bottom of the cave is beautiful and when the lights go out and the little boats come along playing music it's really quite lovely. We'll worth a visit.",
          "Worth seeing these caves and the underground lake. We went mid-day, crowds were not too bad which allowed us time to enjoy this natural wonder.",
          "Having been to Majorca many times never quite got round to visiting these caves, so was really looking forward to it, have to say we were dissapointed, the cave structure is ok but we were looking forward to the musical experience, unfortunately that was a let down, boats sailed",
          "We had know idea that this existed on Mallorca! Great experience. They take a lot of people in for every tour (which creates some waiting) and there is no live guiding. But all in all a great experience with live classical music concert. The caves are lit in a beautiful way, not",
          "The caves at Porto Christo are a must for tourists to visit. Spectacular sights in the caves with well lit areas. And at the bottom section a lake with an orchestra in boats entertaining visitors. Well worth the price of the ticket.",
          "What a pleasant visit this was. Great value for money and a very nice family trip. The whole thing probably lasts and hour or two with the added bonus of the concert and boat ride. Loads of parking and close to the marina which is ideal for lunch and a paddle!",
          "Amazing place, well preserved and looked after. Lighting is lovely. Pools or water are so blue. The musical concert at the end is very dramatic. Worth the price, but good it's not any more expensive as there is No guide or explanation as you go.",
          "What a great couple of hours - lots to see, the music was excellent and the kids are still talking about it hours later. A must do!",
          "This summer we visited Mallorca for the first time! It was amazing time during our two weeks of holidays. We planned few excursions during this 2 weeks, and one of them was Caves of Drach tour from Palma in Click Mallorca. We were staying in Arenal so it was the best option we",
          "Visited here on our first day in Mallorca--about an hour's drive from Son Antem. We were lucky to get the last tour and were delighted with the cave. The most special part was an underground concert performed by musicians in boats floating on the underground lake. When they",
          "Such a beautiful place and the concert played at the end of the tour was beautiful! If you are staying in Palma and don\u2019t have a car, the public bus drops you off and picks you up at the entrance and definitely way cheaper than paying for a tour",
          "It's a location very beautiful which worth to be visited. Splendid underground lake, very well arranged and lighted. The special moment was a mini classical concert with an orchestra playing on a boat on the lake.",
          "You walk for about 1km underground.Its a bit crowded at first but people soon stretch out. Very impressive caves, and the musicians playing from the rowing boat at the end is very charming.",
          "Caves of Drach is a Must do see on your holidays in Mallorca. Incredible nature creations and beautiful underground lake Martel left me speechless. We booked the tour with click-mallorca.com and it was a great choice. Nice and informative guide, easy booking and great experience.",
          "Best caves I have ever seen! Fantastic tour and small musical concert and small boat ride to finish the tour.",
          "We were there in October when you would think it was a bit quieter. But no such luck. The place was heaving and we felt like cattle being prodded forward so we could not enjoy the 'mites and tights' which in other circumstances would have been quite spectacular. Thought the",
          "We went here early in November. Not too many people, so there is plenty of space to really experience the caves. A nice walk, beautiful sights and a very pleasant concert on the lake. The only reason for not giving \"excellent\" is that I should wish the concert had been a little",
          "Absolutely beautiful. Tears welled when the orchestra started. Only downside was that we\u2019re too many people wanting the boat ride. It would have taken too long to wait.",
          "Outstanding fascinating experience. Amazing unusual cave visit. Final water entertainment was magical.",
          "Awesome views. Going deep into the ground. Get to travel across a small underground lake on a gondola. Worth a visit to see the amazing stalagtites and stalagmites. Whole thing is over in less than an hour though. Plenty of steps so beware",
          "This is a \u201cmust see\u201d as many do not get to go below in caves on a regular basis. The whole experience took about one hour but we were glad we went. At the end of the tour, there was a small concert given while we were still beneath the ground and a paddle boat ride a short",
          "The cave is stunning as it is packed full of stalactites and stalagmites. There is so much to see in every area of the cave. You follow a path around, there is no guide. The only negative thing was the sheer volume of people, even in early Nov. It was just one long line of",
          "Second time visiting the caves, never tire if seeing this amazing place, well worth a visit, don't forget your camera",
          "The cave is very impressive but to start with its a little congested as too many people are visiting at once and everyone wants to take selfies. As the tour foes on it gets better as the lines thin out and you can comfortably see everything. At the end of it you get to see the",
          "Please ignore the negative reviews which call this place overpriced and boring. The whole experience is an unrushed journey through one of nature's best sculptures. The caves are truly wondrous and extensive with view after view of what nature can do. Those who find it",
          "We stayed in nearby hotel and surely this was one of the attractions that must be seen. We were lucky to be there end of April, so, not so crowded and no queues. Caves are spectacular, guides very helpful and mini concert with classical music unexpected lovely surprise. And last",
          "The guide guy is great at explaining the cave points. Inside the cave, there is a magical music mini-concert. You can take pictures without flash and, videos too. It is a great tour you must go to.",
          "Amazing cave and lake only down side is too busy, too many people inside the cave, it would be nice to see with less people inside.",
          "A really big stalactite cave with impressive stalactites and stalagmites. In the depths, there is a large auditorium that obligatory hosts a small (about 10 min) concert given by musicians from a boat. Nice. However, I advise to reserve the tickets in advance via the Internet,",
          "Title says it all really. The visit lasts an hour, unescorted and very busy. As a result when you get to the theatre area for the musical performance you wait forever for everybody to get a seat. Now that Ive seen it wouldnt rush back.",
          "This is a very nice place to explore! We had a great time there! The cave was absolutely amazing. It doesnt matter how the weather is!",
          "We all loved it. Beautiful, lit up caves. High ceilings, self guided tours which start hourly. Was a bit congested at the beginning, we were in the middle of the group, but thinned out after a while. Stunning to walk through these lovely caves and the scenery constantly",
          "what a amazing place to visit the cost is 16 euros but well worth the price for that you get a 1hr walk through experience and at the end you are seated overlooking the underground lake and a rowing boat with a three piece orchestra playing classical songs in front of you whilst",
          "Visited here more than forty years ago and my return visit with my husband truly did not disappoint. The caves are fabulous and the magical musical performance was just as I remembered, but better. Definitely an experience not to be missed.",
          "Very much enjoyed this visit underground when the rain outside was chucking it down. Very spectacular vistas of spectacular natural artistry created by the formation and interaction of stalactites (\"they that drip\") and stalagmites (\"them of the drippings\"), illuminated to show",
          "I'd been to the caves in the late 1960's with my parents but was determined to take my wife whilst we were in Majorca this October. It didn't disappoint and due to the time of year and the fact we were on an organised trip we arrived in time to go straight in. The only complaint",
          "Beautiful music and beautiful caves. I feel I am quite cynical about tourist attractions but was carried away by this. Hang back at the end and go on the last boats. Less crowded.",
          "Magical. It's like Narnia and Rivendell. Bring a light jacket even if the heat outside is unbearable. It is very chilly. The musical performance on the underground lake is spectacular.",
          "What a great day trip we absolutely loved it the caves are beautiful, the end was extra special with the musicians and boat ride.",
          "Yes the cave is great. But we had to wait almost an hour since there is a tour only every hour and we just missed one. Then one hour later there was a huge crowd that did the tour with us. Very loud. There is no explanation during the tour. The small concert at the lake is nice",
          "The cave or rather the system of several caves and corridors is fabulous. You may take as many photos as you like - flash and tripods are forbidden, but the cave is so perfectly illuminated, that your photos will be great. There is the final concerto played on the boats (nothing",
          "it was ok but very expensive for what you get 20 euros each. the music show was the best of the lot, was not very busy at the time we were there",
          "This was part of a day trip doing a few different things but the reason we booked the trip was the things we'd heard and read about the caves and in all honesty it was a bit of a disappointment. We went in October and it was jam packed with people. So if your uneasy in crowds",
          "Extensive and large cave system with amazing rock formations. Tours hourly. Walk through the caves, short classical music presentation from boat on underground lake.",
          "Visited yesterday with a toddler and seven year old. They both absolutely loved it especially the younger one! The concert and boat ride were thoroughly enjoyable. It's warm down there, you don't need extra clothes. My children both sat quietly throughout the performance.",
          "Amazing caves with a huge amount of stalagmites and stalactites. So many that after a while it gets a bit samey. Nice concert in the middle. A bit boring for children and teeangers. Gets mega busy so ensure to book in advance.",
          "We had a fantastic evening here, the caves are magnificent and we enjoyed a short classical quartet who played from boats on the lake. Then finished with a short row across the underground lake, left a happy man! \ud83d\ude01",
          "We went to the caves and it was interesting to see. Caves looked good, but the concert in the caves is something else, wow.",
          "great place to visit but not for babies as they are spoiling the concernt quiet time and most important feture in visiting these caves.",
          "Had a lovely day out with the TUI crew we went to a couple of places then went here despite the cues it was a worth while second visit for me so I could share this experience with my hubby as I had visited 11years ago. Was a lovey day and we really enjoyed the day",
          "We were herded through the caves in a group of approx 1000 people . Could have done with music for atmosphere. No spoken guide regarding the caves . An ok trip . Lots of steps so not for the less abled people .",
          "The caves themselves are awesome! I had visited many years ago and enjoyed the tour. Today was a different story. There were far too many people in at one time. We had to sit and wait almost twenty minutes for everyone to be seated to watch a musical performance which was so",
          "Have visited several times over the years, a very worth while trip, but there are steps to navigate. There are some nice restaurants close by if you drive.",
          "Tour guide did not speak English so didn't understand the whole tour, wasted 20mins being seated and waiting for a musical on a boat, just for them to be hidden behind a wall where we couldn't even see them play. The whole trip was boring and a time waste learn nothing and",
          "Me and my partner recently visited drach caves. This was. Beautiful experienece, I was worried that due to claustrophobia I would find this tour uncomfortable but surprisingly it was airy and bright due to the lovely lighting. The show and boat ride at the end was stunning and a",
          "Stunning looking caves well looked after and a little musical surprise too well worth a look, food and drink outlets too",
          "The cave experience was unique given the depth one has to climb down and climb up. Also the natural formation of the rocks and their illumination are amazing. The light and music show adds to the beauty of the cave trial. The boat ride on the crystal clear blue water was also a",
          "Price was very reasonable, which was the first thing i was impressed by. Plenty of parking and it\u2019s free which is a bonus! Great to take photos whilst walking the first part, then what followed was just incredible. The concert was great and i cannot recommend it enough, it\u2019s a",
          "We took a bus from S\u2019illot (the 441) which cost around \u20ac1.80 and dropped us off at the entrance to the caves. \u20ac16 entry which is an excellent price as the caves are amazing however the concert wasn\u2019t at all what it\u2019s made out to be. There are three small boats with fairy lights",
          "This is the second time we have visited these caves, last time was 4 years ago. It was still as stunning as before. Once you enter the caves which is on an hourly basis you are left to follow the path at your own pace until you reach the underground lake where they give a short",
          "Amzing place! Have to see. Beatiful lights and there was also about 10 minutes last concert. Little lake was also beatiful.",
          "Had a great visit here today. The concert was amazing on the boats then we got a lift on one too it was enjoyable. Definitely recommend a visit",
          "The Cuevas del Drach was a good experience for the 3 of us. Had 2 caves to look at and 2 shows recommended.",
          "Went to visit the caves last week. What an amazing experience. It was like walking back in time. Breathtaking beautiful experience.",
          "Beautiful natural formations, well lit. Path is a little steep and slippery in places. Stunning underground lake, completed with a lovely live classical music concert played from a rowing boat. You then have the option of being rowed across the lake or walking beside it to exit",
          "If you ever seen any kind of stalagtites or stalagmites formation, dont be bothered.even though i liked show at the end of tour with musicians in the boats.",
          "Me and the family visited today and had a great time with one exception, overcrowded, there were at least 1000 people in the caves at once. Very difficult to move around freely. Claustrophobic people would not find it easy. Would go again if the groups were smaller. The quartet",
          "Yes, fantastic limestone structures which have been formed over millennia. Difficult to summon up the appropriate awe when having your feet trodden on by hulking rude Russians whilst being driven through the tunnels in a claustrophobic photo obsessed mob (no flashes allowed,",
          "This place is awe inspiring. Even if you don't like classical music if you are not moved by the music played by the musicians in the boat on the lake, you have got to be dead from the neck up. It is absolutely beautiful. If you do not go when you are in Majorca, you will have",
          "I was here many years ago when it was a small attraction. However this is now a major attraction and a must see whilst in Majorca. We travelled by boat from Cala Millor to Porto Christopher then a 5 Euro taxi ride to the caves, whilst there were no major queues for tickets you",
          "Of all the attractions on this beautiful island these caves were definitely at the top of our list. A truly amazing experience from beginning to end with so many formations to admire at every turn. Indeed, they just kept on getting more and more spectacular the further in the",
          "WE went on a No Frills Excursion to the caves. The pick up was on time, and after picking a few more guests up along the way, we were on out way. First stop was at Sileu Market, where we spent an hour and half, then on to the Minacor Pearl factory, before stopping at Porto",
          "We booked this trip without much thought just so we at least did one trip while on holiday. And i have to say it was one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve ever seen. The caves are incredible and just go on and on getting more creepy and beautiful as you go down into the belly of",
          "I don't really like the \"touristy\" programs, and usually explore places and things on my own. My friends recommended the caves, but I was not sure if I get bored after some time, as the program seemed a bit too touristy for me. It was a totally positive surprise, I think, it is",
          "Didn\u2019t get the show must make millions per year and looks to man made great to see but was disappointed compared to other caves I have seen",
          "After having visited the main tourist attractions of Palma on a previous cruise, the logical thing to visit would be the Drach caves. We had a sort trip through the countryside to reach Porto Cristo,the location of the caves. The subterranean tour 25 meters below ground is",
          "Visited the caves when staying on the east coast.Booking as early as you can in the day will get you the tour group/time you would like. Be prepared to queue for 20-30 mins along with well over 100 other visitors. The entrance is down a winding path which leads into these",
          "Takes a good 1.75 hours to walk through, and to sit in a natural auditorium and see the boat on the underground lake is amazing. Visitors can then take a short journey in a boat across the lake.",
          "Visited these caves while on holiday...absolutely amazing. As you make your way down the cave looking at all the views with subtle lighting showing the beauty of the caves, you reach the bottom where there are places to sit. Its such a serene feeling and then small boats come",
          "We Visited the Cuevas of Drach on the 10Th of September. We had a great tour of the Caves and enjoyed the music near the end. We made own way to the caves from Can Picafort using the local bus far cheaper than a TUI trip.",
          "Yes, it\u2019s a bit of a cattle market with literally 100++ on each hourly \u2018tour\u2019 but put that behind you and enjoy the incredible caves with trillions of stalagmites & stalactites, beautifully lit, and then the moving concert from fairylight-lit boats appearing thru the darkness on",
          "It was off season in September and we went with a group so we would have a reserved timeslot. People who do this on their own have to wait and see when there is space for them to join a group at a certain time. We did not have to wait. The caves are wonderful but almost",
          "One of the most beautiful caves I have ever been! very good price just 16 euros.. is not that cold inside. Classical music concert.. WOW.. I had a chills all over my body! something spectacular... boat ride is very short.. but very recommended. I have spent very nice time in",
          "We were staying at the Porto Playa Hotel which is 2 minutes walk away from the caves . Walked along the previous day & pre booked for 10am as some friends of ours had been & couldn\u2019t get in for the early visits without prior booking . Arrived 20 minutes early & were first in",
          "Badly organised and expensive. Each entry is on the hour and around five hundred people go in each time with only two turnstiles. You are shepherded through a badly lit space with no information or signs to say what you are looking at. The so called concert is weak and after 15",
          "Well arranged trip, good price and a must see. Second visit in 2 years. Will not spoil and say too much as first time very surprised. Not too good if you cannot walk freely.",
          "Really enjoyed the caves . Not very good for older people as it has lots of steps. But fir me it was fabulous.",
          "Take your time and don\u2019t rush this splendid experience..... the structures are breathtaking ....one for the camera enthusiast",
          "Nice walk through the cave and the final mini concert how poetic. A break in time and in the race of taking sun",
          "I would highly recommend this attraction. However, the atmosphere in the caves is very humid and a little uncomfortable. Formations of the rocks were wonderful and every one is different. The short classical music concert at the lowest point of the descent was enchanting and",
          "A fantastic look at a special cave, which lasted an hour. A sit down half way to be amazed by a small concert on the underground river, then a small boat ride or you can walk the bridge. Dont book tours, it is easy to use public transport and will save you around \u20ac20 a couple",
          "Went to the caves of drach and paid 34 euros each for two of us. What a waste of money!!! Yes the caves are beautiful but once you have been in 5 minutes you have seen it all. It's all very similar. Got told of the show at the end. Again what a disappointment! The boat ride at",
          "Visited as part of a full day visit around island The caves are impressive there is a show on the lake which is pleasant. Do not do this if you have mobility issues as lots of steps down and a lot of steps back up",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Caves of Drach. The caves are very popular but once inside we never felt particularly crowded. The rock formations are spectacular and the lighting is sympathetic and unobtrusive. Highlight of the visit is undoubtedly the classical concert",
          "We paid an unplanned visit to these caves and were blown away by the lovely totally unexpected surprise at the end. Unusual and unique experience.",
          "Great place our children (10 and13yrs) loved it really good experience for everyone and reasonably priced.",
          "The bus was 20 minutes late picking us up. Then the lady takes me to the wrong cave! I told her that I paid for that other one and she said that I would have to pay extra. I refused until she took me to the cave. It ended up working out...it was just annoying to have to deal",
          "Booked online for 12pm slot. Bipassed the ticket queue but arrived at the entrance to the caves to a HUGE crowd of people who, including us were hustled through like cattle. All throughout the walk we were forced to move along.. but it was so busy we could not enjoy the beauty",
          "Positive about the trip: The beautiful cave and the good coffee that is served in the cafe at the entrance. The number of free parking slots. Negative: I didn\u2019t enjoy that too many people were let into the cave at the same time, I felt being pushed or being in the way for the",
          "Good experience, not too cold or humid! Didn't need to take asthma medication! Good bus service! Lots of stairs up and down!",
          "Had a visit to these Caves whilst on Holiday in Majorca, Some of our Party wanted to go, Me I wasn't really interested, however was better than I thought, After booking tickets, got given a Tour Time, which left us plenty of time to have a drink and bite to eat in the large",
          "Visited the Cuevas on the last day of September. The night before, I booked my ticket online for the time slot of 11 o'clock. I took the public bus number 441 from my accomodation in Cala Dor. The trip took almost one hour and the bus stops inside the Cuevas parking lot, very",
          "Such a nice cave to see Live music makes it all! You will def enjoy, and take the ride with the boat when you get out Make sure you sit in the first row",
          "It was very crowded (we went there on Sunday) but still worth the visit. The cave is very big, the temperature is perfect and the concert is something amazing.",
          "The Cave are a marvel to look at it a great day out it and the music show is great I won\u2019t put to much photo as Spoilers",
          "We heard a lot about the caves so decided to give it a go... Not somthing we would normally do but it ended up being a good day. The queue to go in was huge but well worth the wait.",
          "The caves themselves are a fantastic delight for the eyes, it's just a shame about the huge number of people that are herded through at the same time. The first 200-300 metres are by far the worst. It is busier than london underground on a monday morning. It does start to thin",
          "Fabulous cave formations and classical music recital by an underground lake. Very popular and there for hundreds of people sharing the experience with you. Not for those looking for a more intermit location. I would not have missed it.",
          "if anyone has the chance to go to the caves its well worth it, its magical i would not spoil all whats it offers but wow its great well worth the trip",
          "Fantastic, outstanding ..... no words can explain the beauty. You walk through the caves looking at the different shapes, colours, water holes and suddenly you are in an underground amphitheatre, the lights go out and boats float across the underground lake with lights",
          "A lovely visit, the caves are an example of stunning natural beauty finished off with a lovely classical concert! The Majorca Pearls are also beautiful- lovely trip & a unique memory",
          "We visited these caves yesterday. The caves themselves are amazing. It\u2019s tourists that let it down. There are too many people cramped into one area and I don\u2019t need too tell you how rude some people can be. The classical music played at the end was ruined again by people. It\u2019s",
          "Great experience seeing nature to what it does best. Hard to believe how cave has formed over the many many years.",
          "Absolutely amazing place a must visit if staying near by second time I have been here and it\u2019s always been great to see the amazing crystals",
          "Me and my parents visited the caves and it was absolutely amazing! So so impressed by nature. The concert was incredible.",
          "We bought tickets online to skip the que, that worked. Yes it is busy, yes it is crowdy. But I must say it dissolves a but after the first meters in the cave. The music part is not bad. Tip! Sit far left next to the water. Sit down and you will be able to get in the boats",
          "Do you like large groups of people? Do you like large groups of people in small space? Do you like large groups of people in small spaces who don't know how to behave or can't keep their small kids calm? That's what you'll get. In abundance. There's short classical music",
          "We went to see the cave. Is massive, a lot of underground lakes, stalagmites, stalactites. A lot of people in one tour and is tightly at the beginning. But the end of the tour is surprising as you sit in nice hol and there is a concert playing live music from the bout. I",
          "Very good tour of the caves which is every hour and last for an hour. This tour gets very busy. Thought it was a little expensive as it was 16 euros for an Adult.",
          "Highly recommend visiting these caves. The formations and dimensions are astonishing and the lighting enhances the spectacular scenery. We were surprised to find how warm it was. The short classical concert given by the musicians in a boat on the huge lake was quite magical",
          "The caves are superb. The place is very unique and romantic. The little concert by the lake was extraordinary.",
          "This excursion my seem a bit expensive at first glance, but I would highly recommend it. The Drach caves are spectacular, there exibited really well, and when you finally reach the bottom, there is a seating arena. Suddenly when everyone is seated, the caves go completely dark",
          "This is a must in the Island. One of the best tourist attractions you can find. We\u2019ve been going at least once a year for the last fifty! And still find it awesome!! Impressive!!! Amazing!!!",
          "Fantastically interesting cave! We've visited Mammoth Caverns in KY and other caves, but this was extraordinary. As scuba divers, we were struck by the similarity of some of the limestone configurations in this cave to coral seen underwater. Besides the unusual rock",
          "Visited caves all over the place and these are quite spectacular well worth a visit. There's set times that your allowed in, on the hour basically, and you'll be with about at least 1000 other people meandering down steps and slopes with amazing sights, ending up at the lowest",
          "Caves are well lit and stunning. What was a real let down is the musical experience at the end. We sat for ages waiting for everyone else to file in and be seated. Finally the lights went down and 3 rowing boats sail in with I think a quartet playing music on first rowing boat.",
          "A must if you are in the area. The formations of stalactites and stalagmites are breath taking. The visit is very well organised and an excellent caf\u00e9 provides some where comfortable to wait. god pathways take you through the caves with staff to guide you along the way. Always",
          "Fantastic caves with lots to see. Beautiful music at end of the tour. Would highly recommend. Wear sensible footware as can be slippy",
          "I came as part of a tour and at the same time as us, there were lots of other tour groups so it was jam packed. It was like a moving Disneyland queue through the cave. The cave itself was ok, nothing too spectacular but if you have never been to a cave, it\u2019s worth seeing. The",
          "If you like this sort of thing then this is the one for you. Fab to see. boat ride too and ecoustics wonderful would do it again. lots of steps though",
          "Amazing Dragon Caves. Wonderfully mesmerising. Excellent lighting and super energy. The lake is awesome. Love the classical musical interlude. A definite must do in Mallorca",
          "It was great to visit these Caves. Wandering down, down, down in to a labyrinth of chasms and tunnels. It was quite cool but a little humid. The tour takes about an hour, and worth the 50 euros for a family of four. Book online and skip the queue at the ticket office, and turn",
          "Just the same as it was 18 years ago, really lovely, we were next door so walked, it was lovely and only 16 euros each, worth it!!",
          "I booked this attraction through Viator and as I was on a cruise ship I had to make my way to the meeting point on foot. We were taken to the caves where the tickets were collected. The inside of the caves were spectacular and even more fascinating was realising that there was a",
          "Paid 16 euros each to visit. Got there at 11 had to book a 2pm timeslot. You all queue about 10 mins before entry and then they let about 400 people in each hour, you walk through the caves but they constantly rush you through and ask you to keep moving. After about 30 mins",
          "We had a rainy day so had already researched the caves...got over about 11:20 and the 12 tour was sold out, it was very busy because of the weather but easily got tickets for the 1pm tour. If you like nature and natural creations this place is fantastic, the caves are",
          "There are quite varied reviews of this site - here's mine. We booked on line - around 14 Euros - that is normal for an attraction this size. We turned up an hour earlier and they amended the ticket - very helpful. The visit is shared by a lot of people - low hundreds but this",
          "Not as impressive as I\u2019d hoped. Once you\u2019ve seen one cavern of multiple large stalactites and stalagmites you\u2019ve pretty much seen them all. Classical music on the lake in the large cavern was slightly odd and my 2 sons were bored very quickly.",
          "This is a great place for any ages, unless you\u2019re a little unsteady on your feet or infirm. The caves are fabulous and well worth a visit, as long as you\u2019re able bodied. It\u2019s a tour which is unguided as such, but you simply follow a line of people. It was incredibly busy when we",
          "They let too many people in on the hour visit. It is such a rush and push in dark surroundings and lots of steps. Boat concert is ok not as spectacular as it was made out to be.",
          "Went to the caves as part of a day trip. Stalagmite and stalactite formations were amazing, however there were an awful lot of people taken round at the same time and felt we didn't really get enough time to see everything as we were constantly moved on towards the lake. Took",
          "I spent a great time visiting the largest cave in Porto Cristo, the concert of classic music was amazing. You have to go there if you're coming to Mallorca. Highly recommended for sure",
          "Absolutely stunning! There are no words to describe how beautiful these caves are! We went with an excursion that took us to other places on the same day, so unsure for the admission price",
          "We booked our tickets online so when we arrived we were able to go directly to the cave entrance and queue to wait for our entrance time. Once they let you in it is a walk through with no guides but there are members of staff who try to move you on and keep the flow of people",
          "We booked online as on a dull day we\u2019d hired bikes and rode there but every visitors slot was full! So we booked online for the next day and got the bus from Sa Coma to Porto Christo only \u20ac1.95 each, we walked back, which is roughly 5 miles. The caves are well worth a visit, but",
          "52 years ago we went to the Caves of Drach. Unsurprisingly they've changed! Very busy at 11am but we warned they would be. I think they are good value providing you don't mind crowds and selfie takers at every turn. Forget the crowds enjoy the caves",
          "We traveled by boat from Sa Coma to Porto Cristo. Then a short walk approximately 5 minutes to the caves. The complex is well organised and pleasantly laid out. There are restaurants, food outlets, shops and toilet facilities.etc The caves are spectacular and the grand finale",
          "We went here from Cala Millor on the service bus, after buying tickets online. We arrived earlier than the 11 o'clock tour time which we had booked, had a coffee at the cafe, then walked around the gardens. The gardens were unkempt and disregarded and looked dead, very very",
          "Humungous cave it was. I didn\u2019t expect to see a classical music presentation at the end. Pleasing to the eyes if you are a nature lover.A bit pricey though for kids.",
          "Thirty Years had done little to the caves themselves (obviously, if any!) since my last visit, however the tour operation, guide, lighting and ultimately illuminated and orchestral return shared boat journey made this a spectacular new version of something that seemed noticeably",
          "Beautiful and spectacular, well worth seeing! Lovely musical at the end and boat trip. Top tip: when sitting for the musical head to sit down nearest to the water to get a better view and quicker access when queuing for the little boat trip. Highly recommend",
          "Would recommend a visit to these caves if you stay in Majorca, the cave takes about half hour to 45 minutes to walk around, you can take photos but no flash photography, the sights and pools are amazing, there are no photos allowed at the end with the lit up boats. Definitely",
          "We have visited the caves in August during school holidays. It's definitely worth to see, however on the next occasion I would choose a different time. As it was very busy, we had to wait couple of hours before it was our time, so booking ahead is advisable. Also it's better to",
          "If you are lucky enough to be near this place it's a must visit. Its a feast for the senses. My children were fascinated too. I recommend taking the small boat trip at the end it's super",
          "Such a wonderful experience. Beautiful caves and lake. Would most definitely visit again on a future trip to Mallorca.",
          "Beautiful cave! The concert was wonderful and the boat ride after was such a peaceful and unique experience. Highly recommend!",
          "The caves are impressive, the issue is that during peak school holiday season they try and pack too many tourists into the Drach cave in particular - and the visit is far too squashed as you\u2019re push along at the speed of the crowds.",
          "Absolutely amazing place went to visit the caves in Aug with my sister .we would highly recommend you to go can't wait to visit this beautiful place again",
          "We weren't sure what this tour would be like when we arrived, but we drove there in good time from Son Serra Marina and easily found parking. I would recommend that you buy your tickets in advance, but it is not necessary for you to be the first person in line; just be on time",
          "I like caverns but this is much more than go down a grotto to admire its stalactites. It is an experience with live music and lights of a wonderful cavern and it\u2019s hidden lake. I did the tour 15 years ago the first time and I repeated it this year too. Totally worth it! Kudos to",
          "The place itself is excellent and very atmospheric. The down side is the groups are too big as you wait half of the time for the seats to fill up for the orchestra. The orchestra itself is great but no one listens to the no camera instruction at this point and the area is filled",
          "We have a 3 year old son on the autistic spectrum. We had to queue in 35 degree heat. Hundreds of people were farmed into the cave at the same time. My son cried because of the queues. We couldn't see anything inside the cave because it was so packed. They then were going to",
          "The caves themselves are beautiful. The concert is also very good. However, we felt that there were too many people allowed in at any given time and we were herded through with no time to properly appreciate the caves at our own pace. This made the experience feel impersonal and",
          "Good trip but extremely busy as they let a lot of people in at the same time. The concert is fabulous",
          "Travelled here on local bus; booked online that morning (16.00 entry). At 16.00 security start to scan tickets and following a 10 minute wait in a queue we were inside. Although 16.00/17.00 are deemed to be quieter times, it was still exceptionally busy. The caves are gorgeous",
          "Vast caverns of stalactites and stalagmites that are well lit with stable walkways. Too many people are let in at once so it can get very crowded. Slightly surreal music \u2018show\u2019 at the end, but the caves are definitely worth a visit.",
          "This place will now forever be known to my family as the Caves of Crap. The whole experience is a money making joke with no reward. The cattle herding experience is awful, the cave formations are the only upside. The \"concerto spectacular\" they promise is nothing short of",
          "Would definitely recommend caves des draches ! It\u2019s very different and unique to other places we have been to. The concert was also exceptional- really enjoyed it! Definitely recommend the small boat ride too- it\u2019s rather short but is worth it! We went with no frills excursions",
          "Great place to hide from the sun, see some excellent caves, and the atmosphere around the big lake is excellent. Only spoiling factor is too many children ruining the music/concert by the lake by constant screaming and parents trying to calm them.",
          "This experience is difficult to write about. It delivered on everything but at the same time was not my ideal excursion. We went in high season from a cruise line. It is about an hour bus ride from the port to the caves. Nothing wrong there. Arrived at the caves with a set tour",
          "The caves of drac are well worth a visit you will be amazed and ride out on the gondola to music stunning place to see",
          "Its actually years ago when i went to these caves and we did not have trip adviser or even the technology we have now so could not review so hopefully things have only improved since. first of all the moment you go into the cave you are amazed by the sheer size and colours they",
          "We visited the caves as a family as we had a rental car. We arrived at 11.30 but had to wait until 2pm to enter the caves. You can book online to reserve a time entry which we wish we had done.",
          "We went to the caves at 10am, so were the first through. The staff keep the flow going through the caves, but we didn't feel pushed along. Some spectacular caves. The tour ends with sitting in a big cavern whilst a boat floats past with a few people playing music on it (great",
          "A more personal tour would\u2019ve been better. There were far too many people! The concert at the end was lovely.",
          "Loved the caves and the short boat trip. I went 40\u2019years ago and it was very apparent there has been some heavy investment into the caves. However, given this is a tourist attraction - the guides will only speak Spanish and no other language. Asking how old the caves were, or",
          "We stopped by the cave on a lovely afternoon in Mid August. We booked online in that day, in the morning. Everything went smoothly. The concert was lovely, highly recommend!! The boat tour was short but sweet :)",
          "This was my third trip to the caves. Well worth a vist, the underground cave formations are really impressive. Not a strenuous walk, but do wear sturdy nonslip footwear. I do think the \u20ac15 charge is on the high side, but I wouldn't not go because of it. Would recommend booking",
          "Some of these bad reviews are poppycock! Yes, its quite busy. But what do you expect? I think it's very well organised and an absolutely BEAUTIFUL place to visit. There is a classical concert near to the end on the lake and its beautiful. I would however suggest that if you",
          "The cave and the formations are really spectacular. The admission fee, however, is overpriced at 15 euros. Leaving the natural beauty aside, you get a mediocre experience, where about 500 people are first herded through like cattle in the slippery pathways, then squeezed like",
          "I worried that this tourist trap would be a 10 foot hole with some water at the bottom, but in fact the caves are massive and the lake inside is impressive. I hadn\u2019t quite realized there\u2019s be so many people in each session - our only disappointment is that there wasn\u2019t enough",
          "Well worth a visit although young child and teenagers may find this a little boring. It is inexpensive and the Stalactites and caves are amazing. The boat on the late with a very small orchestra is amazing albeit young child find it hard to listen quietly. A few tips would be",
          "A really interesting place. However, because it is a popular tourist attraction, be prepared for big crowds! The caves are fascinating, however with the numbers visiting the staff have to \"coax\" people through the caves. Visitors are given time slots. So either book in",
          "Maybe I've expected too much bur it didn't meet the expectations. Especially comparing to less famous caves i've been visited. Looks like they're not maintaning it so well. Many of the stalactites are broken. No guides. Mini concert was fine. If you have time go and visit it.",
          "Wow, just wow...best part of our holiday. Amazing classical quartet plays on a lit row boat in pitch dark",
          "A very enjoyable visit which is very well organised. Situated just outside Porto Cristo with plenty of car parking (well it seemed it on an early visit) and not badly priced at \u20ac15, with deals for kids and seniors. The actual caves are well lit to make the most of the natural",
          "We bought tickets online to the Caves of Drach. Sometimes buying at the counter there can mean standing in long queues with no guarantee of availability. We went with our 1 yr old without the stroller since the path was full of steps and it was easier to carry the baby. It is",
          "This is one of those places that definitely should be seen during a holiday to Mallorca. Although I would say you only really need to see it once and whether it's better or worse than the other local caves (of Hams) I couldn't say. Obviously, the caves themselves are",
          "The cave system is a very beautiful place finishing at the bottom with a lake. The visit also has a small seating area so you can watch small boats with musicians on row out and play 3 classic songs. Its a long climb yp so if you have trouble walking be very careful. It is well",
          "Visited here several times,the boat trip from our resort takes in some really nice views,certainly one of the best trips you will go on in Mallorca.you have to do it once.",
          "This is an amazing place to visit, very busy. We were a family of 4 and went early in the morning 10am as was advised this was the best time to go as not so busy but this was not the case. We really enjoyed the caves and it was easy for us to walk round, maybe difficult for",
          "Lovely site to visit. True it is overcrowded but it is worth visiting. The musical show in the water is among the prettiest things I have ever seen in my life.",
          "The Cuevas del Drach or Dragon Caves are just a few minutes walk from the lovely beach of Porto Christo on the east coast of Majorca. There are visits starting on the hour from 10am and each visit can get pretty busy so booking your visit in advance and at least the day before",
          "Went to the caves by car with 14, 16,19 year olds and all had phones out all way round-TAKING PHOTOS!! The formations were incredible and the finale amazing. As it was so quiet with about 400 people sitting together the feeling was very atmospheric. We googled the",
          "We went in August at the 2pm showing. It was very crowded and this detracted from the enjoyment. I thought the caves at campanet were better in terms of relaxed viewing inside the caves. The facilities at Drach are good with food outlets and toilets. The local town is about a",
          "We visited by bus from Cala D\u2019Or. This was so easy to do. Bus stop straight outside. We went to the 10.00 visit which I was so pleased we did. As when we came out all the tours were sold out except of 16.00 and 17.00. Sell out very quickly. We were close to the front and",
          "One of those \u2018when in Majorca\u2019 perhaps? Booked online \u20ac15 per adult (\u20ac16 at the ticket office on the day). Massive looking queue, but everyone starts moving when they open on the hour. You simply follow the path down, admiring the natural wonder of the caves & appreciating the",
          "I would advise to book before you go as we got there at 11:00am and the next hourly visit was at 6:00pm. It is extremely busy but once you enter the caves everyone spreads out a bit. Well worth a visit, lovely walk through the caves looking at the different rocks that have",
          "Very neat caves in Mallorca. Worth the drive out. Light show and music was unique. About an hour in the caves and then there some cool shops and food service. Highly recommend if you're in there area.",
          "So many people here this day. We came 10,45 am but first visit to Cave would have been 3 pm. We did not want to wait so long time so we missed it. So I can just say remember to book tickets before visit.",
          "If you want to cool down a little, this place is perfect, inside the temperatur is at 21degree. The hole year. I cut live with out the music break in the caves, to many people trying to find places to sit dawn in the end of this huge cave.",
          "We decided to do something different whilst staying not far away. 16 euros per adult and 9 for our 12 year old sounds reasonable, but you are only in there for just over an hour. It's a beautiful sight to see as you stroll towards the amphitheatre, stalactites and stalacmites",
          "Had a lovely time visiting the caves although I believe the group tours are way to big because when it comes to the show in the caves your waiting for the people who have fallen behind etc. But overall a beautiful visit.",
          "The place was far from our hotel which was in Palma, but we could manage to go by a bus which the hotel arrange.. after all it was worth it the caves were such a beautiful thing to see",
          "We recommend getting the 10am timed entry slot. We arrived at the location by 9:30 am which gave time for a cup of coffee and a croissant before walking 200 m over to the entrance to the caves. There is plenty of parking space in the car park at this time of day but we noticed",
          "This is a size of around 1,200 metres and a maximum depth of 25 m. below ground level, The caves contain a large underground lake, Lake Martel and it really is worth a visit. It's considered one of the largest underground lakes in the world. You will be surprised",
          "Beautiful caves but they let crazy amounts of people in at once. The classical music in the inner cave would be good except for the noise of adults and children in the large crowd. Do not queue up for the boat trip. We thought it took you to a further section of the cave.",
          "This is a place where wow will come out from the mouth a few times! great history and well-maintained place. There is a boat ride included in the ticket as well, but it is only 2-3 mins long if there is a long queue than not worth it as the bridge goes the same path as the boat.",
          "Impressive set of caves with lost of stalactites and stalagmites. Nice concert at the end with a finishing boat trip (albeit quite short but sweet) on the lake at the end. Nice family outing.",
          "Booked a half day with no frills. Good price & service the trip itself was really good. Kids & adults loved it. Booked a half day thinking the full day we would have been too hot & bothered but with hindsight we were in the air conditioned bus or the cool caves so a bit of",
          "Visited Drach Caves during a recent visit to Majorca. Simply stunning! Advisable to book in advance or you might be in for a very long wait as there are set times for the visit. You won't be disappointed, the finale is awesome!",
          "I have to admit that, at the beginning, we chose visiting these caves just to escape the scorching heat of a summer afternoon and our expectations were quite low. On the contrary, we have been impressed by the vastness of the inner halls and the complexity of the stallattite",
          "We enjoyed each moment in the cave of drach and visiting Porto cristo beach, everything around is magic and you can spend the day on this village in Mallorca",
          "Well organised but so so busy. Easy to find - buy tickets on line to save queuing. Concert at the end was magical.",
          "ok this is an awesome sight and certainly worth a visit. Its very overcrowded and you basically have to shuffle along with the crowd, not great in my opinion. The classical concert at the bottom on the lake is lovely, I just expected more, not sure why. Then its a massive rush",
          "The tour takes approximately 45 min including a 10minutes classical concert inside. It was absolutely beautiful and the concert stunning. the prices was reasonable and its possible to pay online aswell. Definitely recommand it",
          "Enjoyable hour out of the sun wandering through stalactite-ridden and extensive caves with classical music on water to end with. You can book online to save \u20ac1 each and select a time slot to avoid a long wait if the slots are full up when you arrive. You have to queue for a",
          "All the family enjoyed this trip. When we arrived the next available tour was in 3 hours due to previous ones being fully booked, so highly recommend booking in advance and planning your trip better than we did. However, this did allow us time to look round beautiful Porto",
          "The queue moves pretty fast. Book your tickets online to avoid the first ticket line. The past of the tour where you walk is indeed a bit crowded but if you hang back a bit and let the pushy people go.. It's just fine. The views are very nice. The concert is really nice, because",
          "Gorgeous food, very friendly staff and lovely atmosphere. We went here 3 times on hols as it was so good! I particularly enjoyed the Pina Colada and the vanilla ice cream with churros\ud83d\ude0b",
          "Had a fantastic time. Poured rain on the day we visited and was a great distraction! Lovely couple of shops and a cafe for refreshments.",
          "This is the biggest rip off ever. Seriously wondering how one can think this is good. Grabbing 500 people every hour and pushing them through a totally distroyed cave in constant queues, with ugly smells. Reminds the evening buffet queue of the shabby all inclusive resort. The",
          "An absolutely terrible experience, tour tells you you will find out about the history and in actual fact the guides did not speak English so found out nothing , herded in like a heard of cows squashed in to listen to a rubbish piece of music then everyone is fighting to get on a",
          "The caves were fantastic, worked really well for small children. Suggest getting there early as the queue can be long and you want to avoid queueing in the hot sun.",
          "A very busy attraction site. We booked our tickets prior to arriving at the caves. Plenty of parking including shade from the large trees. Very nice gift shop and place to eat and drink whilst waiting for your time slot. The queue look massive but it moves pretty quickly",
          "Beautiful caves! Super well organized and good price per ticket. I loooved the classical music concert inside the cave, simply beautiful!!",
          "Very big and very beautiful cave. Could be crowded as there are 600 people to go in one slot but manageable.",
          "An absolute must-see in Mallorca. The interiors of these vast caves are extraordinary. We were concerned the floor might be slippery or unstable but it was very easy to walk through. The absolute highlight was the stunning violin serenade at the end of the cave tour followed by",
          "Such a great time!! Took the advice of a fellow traveller on trip advisor and booked the 4pm slot and waited to the back of the queue and got the best view of the caves without all of the people. Nice and cool in the caves (20\u00b0) compared to outside (30\u00b0). A really nice",
          "The caves are just awesome but there\u2019s too many people. It\u2019s uncomfortable even to walk with everyone around taking pictures and pushing you (and don\u2019t get me into the smell thing...\ud83e\udd28) The place is worth seeing but the experience is not good.",
          "Fantastic caves, stunning to look at , and definitely has the wow factor, but so many people, it did spoil it a bit",
          "Was ok for what you can see of the caves as it\u2019s very busy shame as I think if it wasn\u2019t as crazy it would be brilliant to have a good look around without people pushing and taking photos as couple of steps.",
          "Last visited many years ago .. decided to re vist and we were not disappointed .. still very much a Wow factor as you enter the cave. The whole experience was well worth a return visit.",
          "A true natural wonder, my woefully limited vocabulary can't do justice to the caves, honestly they are stunning. When a 15 year old lad starts taking pics you know it's something special. Couple of bits, it's busy. Very busy, but well organised. The food bits aren't too",
          "Well worth a visit we were blown away by these caves and the orchestra\ud83d\ude03. Great value for money, I highly recommend.",
          "Not just a walk through some underground caves. Lovely boat show in the underground cavern with classical music",
          "We booked our visit for 11am when it first opens 500 people a time it is crazy busy you feel you don\u2019t get enough time to look at the caves however well worth the visit and time just on an hour but if you visit do go early. Porto Cristo is a lovely town to explore after it spent",
          "This is an attraction to do once. Entrance is timed and limited to 500 guests, but still is very crowded as you wind your way through the caves. You are able to take photos as long as you do not use flash (which makes selfies too dark). If you have never seen stalagmites in",
          "Visited as part of a trip to Porto Cristo and a pearl factory. Entrance is timed and is busy at the beginning until people spread out. The route is not claustrophobic and there are plenty of photo opportunties with some amazing stalactites and stalagmites. At the end there is an",
          "Not what I expected. Visited at 5pm. When gates opened to let you in, there must have been close to 1000 people going in together. If you are in the front/middle of queue, you are pushed forward with the throng of people and don't get chance to look at the formations. Guards are",
          "The ticket price is fair, you get an allocated time to go in and line up for a short amount of time before entering. Once inside it a quite amazing site to see, then there is a lovely short 10 minute classical concert to listen to, performed on row boats (one unfortunate thing",
          "We had a good afternoon out at Cuevas del Drach. There was only a short wait before we entered the caves. The walk into and around the caves is definitely worth doing even with a crowd. The orchestra and mini concert at the end was beautifully done. The boat ride out was a",
          "They advertise with boat trips into the caves, but it\u2019s not. After getting rushed through the cave (and not getting to see almost anything through hundreds of people), you sit down and there\u2019s people playing classical music in one of the boats. When the concert is done you get",
          "Lovely afternoon. The caves were beautiful and the performance and boat trip were delightful (although a little spoilt by the family behind who talked all through it).",
          "The caves are fantastic and visually spectacular. The lighting provided really brings out the features and you cannot cease to be amazed. We knew about the orchestra on the boats at the end of the tour beforehand but even though we knew it was coming it was still very good,",
          "The \u201cnatural\u201d part is quite impressive (the caves). But going down the big stairway ... after 3-4 turns... eveything looks pretty much the same. Walking like penguins with hundreds of people per shift. The final show is not futureproof (nor presentproof). Kids and teenagers (and",
          "Absolutely beautiful and well worth a visit ..the kids loved as much as we did ..theres a nice little surprise half way through.",
          "went with 2 kids and and elderly (86), well worth it, love the musicians floating in for the final concert! You best book in advance (online) unless you are ok to wait for long. Each group going in is very large so need to keep up pace if you want good seat for concert, good",
          "We read the reviews of best attractions to visit and hired a car for the day to drive across Majorca to visit the Caves of Drach. As you near Porto Cristo you start to see many massive wives for \u2018the caves\u2019...BEWARE! We were fooled into following the signs...pulled into the car",
          "We visited this caves during our holiday in Mallorca back in June. It was a good day out.The caves are great,a bit overcrowded,but not as good and dramatic as the \"Coves D`Arta\" which we visited a few years ago.The tour takes about an hour,good opportunities to take photos,and",
          "The caves themselves were absolutely stunning and the music that was played on the boat at the end was brilliant. My only issue here was that we were chaperoned through the caves very quickly and being towards the back of the group, I was constantly told to keep moving, each",
          "Another culmination you shouldn\u2019t miss when visiting the Islands of Mallorca: Situated on the Eastern coast, at the entrance of Porto Cristo, nobody expects the unique phenomenon and the magnificent charm on its own! By land or by sea (we made it by bus in the middle of the best",
          "The entrance price is very high. Only the 10 minutes classic music show was nice. More beautiful types of this caves are located in Turkey like Sivas Balica and Antalya Damlatas caves.",
          "Absolutely stunning caves but very very busy. Do book ahead and try to get there early. Sitting to the far left as you watch the musical performance will give you the best view throughout",
          "Views excelent, but the live music in the dark in the boats was amazing!! The atmosphere is unique! The boat rid was worth to wait!",
          "Yes it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d some caves. Yes it\u2019s expensive. But... yes you should go! There\u2019s a good deal of walking involved so I wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good place if you\u2019ve got mobility problems- but that\u2019s probably a given. The whole thing and the boat ride bit is a nice experience. It\u2019s",
          "Fantastic geology and amazing sights as you walk through the caves. The staff were helpful and good at keeping the crowd moving through. Music and boat trip are a beautiful ending to the caves. The one downside is that throughout the performance people in the stands made quite",
          "We were 5 of us ( 2 adults, 2 kids -6,5 yo and 14yo). To get in they organize a collective tour every hour starting from 10:00 until 17:00. There were too many people and impossible to have a normal walk inside, you couldn\u2019t stop to take a photo as people were everywhere. Very",
          "I have been to other fantastic caves around the world where you get a guided tour in small groups. Here hiwever was a different story. You queue up at your 1 hour slot time (I would advise booking online as when we got there we had to wait 90 mins due to the next time slot being",
          "Dont hesitate - just go and see! Fantastic stone structures and really close views. I loved it. Ends with a surprise that I will remember for a long time. My fatter turned 80 years and really loved it. Choose to sail when given the opportunity!!! Short ride but worth the wait",
          "I was hoping to see a nice natural cave but it was more like going on a ride. The \"ride\" takes about an hour. The fun starts with standing in line with a few hundred people while you wait for your time-slot to begin (tours start every hour on the hour). Then you go down some",
          "Took an organised tour to the caves arriving at 12noon. Queue was quite long on arrival but it moved quickly. The caves are simply breathtaking, unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before. It was busy but I didn\u2019t feel rushed and moved at my own pace taking lots of photos. The short",
          "The whole family really enjoyed this attraction, we bought tickets online as suggested and went for an early time which worked well. The caves were beautiful and access was good despite the many steps my 2 year old coped well. The show was lovely. The toilets and cafe were also",
          "Great experience for all family with kids 12-8-3 years old, only better book online as entrance is by timetable and some slots sold out in high season",
          "Interesting story of caves\u2019 discovery. 2nd half of tour is better than the 1st. Be aware there\u2019s quite a few steps to climb.",
          "The tour takes about an hour and includes a classical music concert of about 10 minutes. The concert is played by a quartet of musicians and they play on a boat. During the tour you can take pictures and film without using flash but you cannot take pictures and film during the",
          "The cave is beautiful but it is impossible to enjoy cuz it's so crowded. It Took 20 mins till everybody was seated to the concert the concert lasted 5 minutes and some idiot kids was disturbing the show with stupid noises. And we waited another 20 minutes to the boat till we",
          "An enjoyable morning visit. Good guide. Beware in July and August the crowds oh the crowds. Wonderful light/boat show. Tried but gave up attempting to get on a boat. Impressive caves,sturdy shoes required. For an attraction the cafeteria was excellent value.",
          "Price is 16\u20ac per person if bought on site, 15\u20ac online. The visit takes about 45 minutes. There is no guide inside the cave, after entering you follow the path by your own pace and take as many pictures as you want. When we visited it was very crowded. At the end, you have to",
          "The caves are fantastic. It is a large area full of stalagmites and stalactites. A most popular sight but the crowds are very well behaved. You end your visit there by being serenaded by musicians playing classical music on a boat on the underground lake. Something you just",
          "We went at 10am (Opens at 10.30), Initial queue to get in but moved quickly and go at your own pace own you go in. Fantastic to see and lovely concert. Worth the trip and nice and cool out of the heat for awhile.",
          "We visited the caves with two young children 6 and 9. Clearly the caves are impressive but I would recommend to absolutely avoid this experience. 46 euros for four, you pick an entry time. I thought you would join a group visit. In reality I was horrified when I saw groups",
          "We visited the caves in july and yes there were big queues and a lot of waiting around in the heat but the caves are extroadinary its like entering another subterranean world. It is fairly warm in the caves despite being below ground so you dont need to wrap-up. The scale of the",
          "I really enjoyed this trip, we booked to go and the day turned out to be pouring rain all day, so a perfect day for going into the caves, I would say try it.",
          "We visited the Caves here and while there is no guide during our visit the overall experience is well worth it. You book your time and then make your way through the caves eventually ending in a big cavern where you sit down and fhey perform live music on one of the boats in the",
          "We bought tickets on line and went right to the entrance. The cave is nice and the reflections on the underground lake were very pretty. The concert was very nice and the acoustics are good. However, we felt like we were in a herd of cattle. They allow too many people in at",
          "We had a lovely visit here. The caves are absolutely stunning!! Beautifully lit and just stunning. The staff were great having fun with the kids. (The \"Cave Man\" was our favourite) The show at the end was a happy surprise and phenomenal. Downside. Other people. It was quite",

          "This could be a very good program, if all the visitors behaved as can be required. There are too many people pushing and jostling one another and causing noises during the really enchanting concert. Sorry for that.",
          "Really big caves with several interesting point of views. The tour last around 1 hour and it include a 10 minutes live classic concert inside the cave. Suggested",
          "found this experience very good its not for those who are bad on there feet as there are steep steps to climb and goes very deep underground,the lighting is not too bad shows some of the stallectyes very eerie at times but the concert at the bottom was very good well worth a",
          "First of all, the online price is 15\u20ac. We wanted to buy the tickets at the counter because they are only 1\u20ac more so 16\u20ac. Nope, guess again, thats right 22\u20ac per person. Okay what the hell lets go. Packed like sardines in a group of at least 40 people we descend into a steaming",
          "Loved it Very busy but still well organised, music at the end was incredible! We decided against the boat trip and we\u2019re out in minutes.",
          "This was our excursion our family was looking forward to, a boat ride in the caves? We thought it was going to be awesome, but it was the worst experience I have ever had in Europe. There was a long line of people to get in for the 12 PM time slot. We were then headed through",
          "I booked a 11am slot online the day before which was easy to do and would recommend doing this rather than just turning up. You don\u2019t have to print anything off just show the barcode on your phone.These caves were stunning however the experience is not as good as it could be as",
          "A walk through the caves which was interesting but very busy at 10am for the opening time slot. An orchestra played on a boat for about 5/10 mins before having the option to go a short boat ride along the lake or just walk to the exit instead. A little boring for children but",
          "Fantastic experience and would highly recommend this trip. The duration in the caves is about an hour to hour fifteen minutes. What more can I say but spectacular and wonderful view of stalactites and stalagmites with an orchestral display at the end of the tour for 15mins",
          "Its quite a commercial tourist place, but it is well organised and not too tacky. The caves were warmer than I was expecting. I enjoyed the magic of the concert on the underground lake. It took a very long time to get on a boat destined for the exit, and the trip was brief, but",
          "Well,if you want to be stuffed into a cave with hundreds of people this is the place.shame as was not what was sold to us.so many people you couldn't see or enjoy the caves at there best,never again.",
          "What a remarkable hour this was... Its an amazing attraction and the caves were just superb... What I would say is go out of season as it gets very very busy and you get so rushed whilst taking pictures you get staff telling you to hurry up or you'll miss the concert... What if",
          "This cave is a natural wonder of the world. The beauty of the stalagmites and stalagtites is breathtaking. The pathway through the extensive cave is safe and easy to follow and has a sturdy handrail. The cave is beautifully lit. There is an auditaurium where hundreds of people",
          "We loved the caves, and have been twice. Tickets are slightly overpriced. We got the boat from cala bona marina, its hour to porto cristo. The afternoon boats get quite packed though.",
          "The Drach Caves might be beautiful, but the experience is such a tourist scam. First of all, there are no guides or information of any kind in the caves, and the operators push through an ungodly # of tourist through every hour. The caves provide a brochure to explain the",
          "Let\u2019s face it caves are cool, but I felt this experience was not worth my money. It did not feel special or noteworthy as we were not encouraged to gaze in wonder and amazement. There wasn\u2019t any information provided (or maybe I missed it) about the various formations/structures.",
          "amazing caves .bit hot inside but worth every penny the musical with the boats was amazing .not allowed to use flash on cameras so pictures are not the best",
          "For us was an unique experience to find more about stalactites and stalagmites... The tour is not guided and is actually really crowded but the cave is also huge. In the ticket there is also a short boat trip and an nice instrumental music moment on the lake.",
          "The Caves of Drach are a fairly long drive from Palma, the cruise port, and the airport but it's worth the trip to see this unusual site. The prices are fairly reasonable, and the trek into the caves offers relief from the midday sun and high temperatures. It's roughly 10 to",
          "More standing and waiting than walking and visiting. Concert was nice, but because of people who disturbed in all possible ways it was hard to enjoy. Boat trip took less than 5 minutes.",
          "I wasn't quite sure what to expect but wasn't disappointed! It was a cross between Harry Potter and Game of Thrones scenery; wonderfully natural and amazing scenery. The brief classical music performance on the underwater lake very good, and despite the queue, well worth waiting",
          "An absolute magical experience. You truly believe a dragon could live here. The whole place is incredible, and the orchestra playing classical music on the underground lake in the dark is something you will never forget.",
          "Really nice trip! Recommend it 100% the concert and the little boat ride was a really nice touch :) quite a few steps though. Which was fine for me but maybe not for others.",
          "After wandering down the caves with hundreds of other guests, we arrived to Lake Martell... and here is the concert that is worth the walk and the entrance ticket. If they could change something, it would be a little longer concert. 10 mins. is not a lot, but was worth to return",
          "First thought when my wife asked me to visit Drach Caves? Oh... caves again? But after we've visited them, I was speechless. You'll be continuously in awe while in the caves. Look there, look here, watch out! The lake! The concert on the underground lake! The trip on the boat!",
          "We were with my children, and they were very excited. The caves are amazing and we enjoyed the visit. The concert part of the experience is pleasant but short.",
          "This was a great find. Accessible to get around; you go as a group, but can look around at your leisure without a 'tourguide', as such. It's a place of incredible beauty and history, and is real food for thought in terms of how long it has existed. The classical boat concert on",
          "These are the biggest and most beautiful caces I have ever visited. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that they let alot of people in and it was a little crowded. At the end of the walk through the cave you get the most amazing live classical performance on the lake.",
          "I went to the caves with my mom and my teenage daughter and we were all impressed!!! The caves are beautiful, the grounds around are well equipped but food is not the best, but hey you don\u2019t go there to have lunch or dinner. I really struggle to understand the people",
          "Beautiful caves, but they cram as many people in as possible and shuttle you in and out. Makes for a very overcrowded and annoying visit.",
          "Long queues, lots of stalactites, thousand people watching a couple of boats playing some music you can just about hear. Could be great with louder music , spectacular lighting , water displays but suppose it attracts enough visitors without trying.",
          "Long waiting time to get accsses - and the tour itself had a small music stop - no popular with small kids. Would choose a different attraction if I could.",
          "It is a beautiful place, but I had no interest in the music that we were forced to listen to. It is a very busy attraction and I felt like I was falling over people the whole time. I would of preferred a shorter and cheaper option as an hour is too long.",
          "Really not impressed by this attraction. Yes the caves are stunning but so are the pictures on the flier!",
          "Overpriced is an understatement!! You pay nearly \u20ac40 for a trip that takes not even an hour. They cram so many people into the caves during the time slot that you can hardly move without risk of being pushed down the steps. The caves themselves could be impressive but lose",
          "We arrived at 11.30am, bought our tickets using the electronic machines and our time slot was 12pm, which we was very impressed about. The tickets cost \u20ac16 each for adults. The caves themselves were absolutely stunning, however it felt like we were being rushed to get down to",
          "I had visited before but years ago. The caves are amazing and we enjoyed the visit. The concert part of the experience is pleasant but very short as is the boat ride but still it was good to go on the boat as I hadn\u2019t done this before. The main change was the outside area where",
          "One of the oldest and well maintained cave Excellent night show display and the light and sound effects are great too! Worth going",
          "My partner and I visited the caves with two of our friends who happened to be on the island the same time as us and had a rental car. We arrived around 11:30 and the 12:00 tour was full, we booked on for 13:00 at around 15\u20ac each. With time to kill we went to get some food",
          "This must be one of the most amazing natural formations ever witnessed This is definitely a MUST SEE when visiting Mallorca The views are breath taking and the finale of an orchestra performance is outstanding",
          "Worthwhile taking time out to spend a morning here. Best to arrive for the early tour before the droves of coach excursions arrive... try to be at the back of the queue so you can take the walk at your own pace and not be washed along by the masses or the ushers... discover the",
          "This place is a must see, if you are going to majorca, absolutely stunning and the show in the final cave is breathtaking",
          "Most beautiful cave, a true wonder of nature. Rock formations are extremely beautiful, with outstanding lighting. Organization could be better. Too many people allowed at once, long queuing times. Concert was wonderful.",
          "Last visited in 1966 ...... still the same today plus lovely orchestra and trip across the lake. Well worth a visit",
          "My wife and I first visited the Caves of Drach in 1969! This year we were in Majorca with our 16 years old Grand Daughter and I took her for a trip down the Caves. She thought they were brilliant. This was my fourth trip over the years. Of the caves themselves there is",
          "Sensational place! Nature has done all its best! The lake is like cristal and the concert was presented in such a beautiful way..3 light boats floating on the lake along the cave..it was one hour tour, very crowded, but it worths all the effort.",
          "beautiful experience a bit of a walk into the caves but if you wear suitable footwear its fine best to go early or later as the coach tours arrive between 12-3 worth sitting at front on right hand side to get on the small boat journey after r the musical performance",
          "Lovely cave and a nice, little consert. Loved the little boattrip we god to take at the end too. But there is no need to bring small children here. They have to sit still and be quiet during the consert, or they will be \u00abhushed\u00bb. But for older kids and adults this is a nice",
          "Although feeling like cattle being herded going into the caves and typical impatient people thinking they are going to miss out on something, the caves themselves as by far bigger than I imagined and simply stunning! One the crowds spread out inside it really is a wonderful",
          "Visiting the caves with my son and grandson. Enjoyable in parts but not suitable for older people with mobility issues, as lots of stairs to climb to get yourself out of the cave. The music on the lake was nice but not worth \u20ac15.",
          "Visited the caves on an excursion whilst on holiday and it is a must visit if you can. At every turn there is something to catch your eye and the classical music on the boats at the end is amazing. We booked an excursion through our hotel which guarantees a ticket as i can",
          "Visited the caves with my wife, unfortunately she was unable to enter the cave due to her feeling closed in, She waited at the cafe while I did the cave tour.. What a beautiful and magical place. Walking to the lakes at the bottom gave many photo opportunity\u2019s, it\u2019s was like",
          "This visit to the caves were so impressive, it's hard to put into words how many times you come across different areas of beautiful staligmits and staligtights (sorry about the spelling ) then, as this wasn't all they tell you there will be a mini orchestra performing a",

          "Very beautiful cave, but they push thru a lot of people every hour, so hard to get photos or on the boat ride. The classical concert played from one of the boats in the dark with only the lights on the boats reflecting on the underground late was lovely.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed by a visiting couple. Plenty of free parking. Book online for discount and to ensure you don\u2019t have to wait an hour or more for next slot if you miss out. Don\u2019t try and be near the front during the experience, take your time and enjoy it as you need to",
          "Amazing place of natural beauty. There were teens and young children in our group, and everyone enjoyed it. The concert and short boat ride were a nice touch.",
          "Went here last week was quite crowded and we're ushered in quickly but was beautiful and lots of staligmites under water lakes all lit up the little concert at the end with the boats and classical music was lovley and little boat ride at end was nice not really for young",
          "Booked online with ease via an iPhone. Party of 4. @16:00. This avoids the bus trippers. Very interesting walk through the caves but it\u2019s a bit of a squeeze at the beginning. Concert bit was good but small kids screeching and people choosing to ignor the no video rule spoilt it.",
          "+ easy to walk + live music + short boat trip at the underwater lake + restaurant - very humid (but, well, of course...) Tip: don\u2019t try to be first in line, if you walk among the first ones, you\u2019ll have to wait seated quite a while until the live music starts. Take your time,",
          "I thought the \u20ac16 entry fee was a bit steep for what you get. Yes, the initial wow factor is there when you first walk in but once you\u2019ve been inside for five minutes, it all looks the same. The seated finale is beautifully done with the boats and live music but they let so",
          "Don\u2019t think this is a trip for small children, as if they become unhappy or start crying it ruins the experience for everyone. Went to these caves when I was a teenager, didn\u2019t have an interest then, but have gone back as a sentimental journey and found it a very emotional and",
          "What a lovely place very interesting and entertaining But would not be suitable for people with walking difficulties as there is lots of steps in and out (100+in 100 out ) a must see if got the time",
          "Good value for money. You enter at an alloted time but you are free to walk down at your own pace. We had a 2 year old who lived it. The concert is lovely. You have the option to take a boat ride. There is a nice cafe and it's only a short walk into Porto Cristo",
          "Definitely value for money but just seems a bit rushed and the staff can be a bit rude especially with the camera rules.I get why you can't film the show but don't get why you can't use a flash but rules are rules! Overall worth a visit",
          "Took a boat trip to Porto Cristo and visited the caves. Had been here many years ago but it had changed. Arrived at 11am and found that the next tor was at 12. However there is plenty to do, you can have a coffee and wander around the grounds. Once inside there are lots of steps",
          "Visited as a family - a little overpriced but an ok experience, the caves are spectacular and a natural wonder. There is a 10 minute concert performed on rowing boats which was a little surreal - but don\u2019t dare to make a noise or there\u2019ll be frantic people going shhhhh at you",
          "The caves themselves where brilliant, but the customer service was pretty awful. All the staff were miserable and not one of them smiles or gave eye contact. Disappointed that there were no guides telling you about the history of the caves or pointing out certainly parts of",
          "The cave is really extraordinary and worth seeing. Unfortunatelly it is also very popular and overcrowded. Get tickets on line and arrive on first slot.",
          "The caves are in Porto Cristo on the east coast of Majorca,and are a \"must\" for tourists,At 16 euros entry(8 for children) they are a fantasic natural cave system with a big underground lake,The highlight is the orchestra which plays classical music.",
          "You have to visit this caves, we took a bus from Can pastilla, about 45min travel. The pictures don\u2019t reveal how amazing they are",
          "Seven of us visited including two young children and we all really enjoyed the experience. Well worth a visit.",
          "To go there many meters under the normal earth level and evn the sea level is amazing with all those colors. Even a real concert at the deepest point feels great",
          "Stunning views, 10 min classical live music concert, boat ride free of charge inside caves. I reccommend!",
          "As others have said a little over priced but definetly worth a visit and a good activity for a cloudy morning especially. we visited with a 19 month old. No buggies allowed so be prepared for a bit of carrying etc but we had no problem with this. probably more of an issue if",
          "It's expensive - \u00a316.00. it takes around 1 1/2 hours. You're hearded in and then have to wait for about 500 people to take seats to listen to concert on boats... It is awesome and huge though.",
          "Excellent organized trip kids loved it good for young and old plenty to do though the water was freezing.",
          "What a great place to visit! I went with my daughter and we both really enjoyed the caves and the orchestra on the boats. It was busy but still could have a good look round and wasn't rushed along highly recommended this place.",
          "I've been twice, and yes it is very busy all year, but you can malinger behind the crowd to take in the amazing and deep caverns, and the lake/music moment is quite amazing if you can get a good seat near the front or the far right as you look up to the seating...the sheer scale",
          "Worth the visit. The different areas and the various formations of stalactites, stalagmites and columns are fascinating as a one off trip, with a nice boat display and music at the end, but the waiting times and the amount of ppl queuing to get in for the next viewing period is",
          "If I could have given zero stars I would have! This place is a tourist trap of the highest category. First the visitors are put in a waiting area for the next tour where you are surprised by the enormous amount of people in the waiting area and you prepare yourself for a long",
          "We had planned to book online, slightly cheaper and you can choose your time slot and skip the queues. However, when we tried the website wasn\u2019t working! So, we queued for tickets and didn\u2019t get the slot we wanted so had to wait for an hour before we were able to go in. They say",
          "We had been before as children (sister and I) but booked up again, as it had been 10+ years so couldn\u2019t remember any of it. We booked via our hotel and travelled with Excursions Mallorca by World Services. We were unaware that it was a full day trip. A lot of time was spent",
          "This is an interesting way to spend some time, a lot of thought has gone into the way the caves are presented with great lighting. There was a short video to give the history at the beginning and a \"concert\" at the end which was opera style music accompanying a man in a boat on",
          "Very good visit. It can feel a bit like you\u2019re walking in a long queue as it\u2019s very stop and start but with the amount of people visiting that\u2019s only to be expected. The caves themselves are amazing, vast and impressive and the lake is beautiful. Would recommend going but be",
          "This place is fantastic. Well worth a visit. We did it as part of an excursion and sadly felt we didn't get enough time here. We did the boat ride. Amazing. People will say try to get up front but they seat you in order. It's beautiful no matter where you are on the boat. An",
          "It was way more than my husband and I expected. The visiting area is huge. You feel like you're in a Hollywood studio. It's that impressive. At the end there's a 10min classical music concert performed by 4 musicians in a boat. So lovely and such a nice way to end the visit.",
          "We had a half day trip to the Caves of Drach stopping off at Porto Christo for 20 mins ! The queue was huge for the Caves but it soon moved, the paths are not suitable for wheelchairs, as the path is steep, there is lighting around giving a wow effect, but I was expecting a",
          "The caves were stunning. The Genesis story was nice. Enjoyed the light show with classical music at the second cave. The entire area is peaceful. Highly recommend it!",
          "It is a lovely place and certainly one of the biggest attractions in Majorca. At the end there is classical music and light illumination show, which is kind of a cherry on the top. Worth it!",
          "The Caves were amazing. It brings home to you how many thousands/millions of years it has taken to evolve as it has. Just a point for older or infirm visitors, there are 112 steps going down and 127 to climb coming up. This fact wasn't mentioned by our Tui rep when we booked.",
          "The guide took us through the cave system and we found them much better than Wookey Hole, when you read the lake you are invited to sit, all the lights are turned off and the boats with their haunting music make their way across the lake. Be aware if you have respiratory",
          "These are outstanding and the whole experience has been very well thought out, so our visit was very organised. An easy walk to in Porto Cristo, by a bus stop if you're coming from further afield and a huge car park if you're driving. There were small children (we left ours with",
          "Walk through the caves followed by 10 minute show and optional boat ride, Well worth the visit. I've had a hip replacement and even the steps out were not a problem!",
          "Short. No commentary. Nothing significant to see. 4 songs by a mini orchestra played with no enthusiasm. Save your money and time. Wish I hadn't gone.",
          "The caves were extremely beautiful near port cristo. The whole experience was surreal and the boat ride in the end adds more charm to the whole experience. It takes around an hour and after that you can explore the area around - port cristo (lot of good food options- Quince",
          "Just amazing! Beautiful and just as I remembered. People are so disrespectful they ask for no flash and even after the guards ask for no flash they put it straight back on. Please visit it\u2019s truly is a well worth hour x",
          "Well worth going to see ,not expensive and so pretty.The orchestra show is nice ,be prepared to que a while to go across the lake on a paddle boat ,or there is a option to walk across if you would rather. Tours are let in as large groups at different times but if you end up",
          "Well worth a visit! Only a 15 min walk from Porto Cristo. If you're not good with stairs avoid and wear good shoes - its sloppy inside the cave",
          "Well worth a visit to the east coast. Booking a time is advised. Some walking but easily manageable. The music and boats on the indoor lake is ethereal.",
          "What an amazing place. Very eerie but fascinating. Years and years of nature at work. Only downside is it can get to busy and with 2 small children it gets a little frustrating. The surprise of little boat concert in the middle of the experience was fantastic. Facilities where",
          "This was another tour organized by Celebrity Cruise. We usually do not book tours but we decided to give this one a try. What an experience! We are avid caves lovers and these are truly spectacular and one of a kind. The tour takes about 1 hour and includes a 10 minutes",
          "I have been to the caves when I first visited Mallorca more than 40 years ago and I still remember the amazing feeling of sitting in the bottom of the caves by the underground sea and then hear the music. Real musicians are rowed in front of you while they play and that is",
          "Wow what an experience. We were staying in Cala Bona, and took the bus directly to the caves. It was 1.9 Euro\u2019s each way and took around 45 minutes. On arrival at the caves, you purchase your tickets, which were 16 Euro\u2019s each and your start time is indicated on a board in the",
          "We took the first 10:00 tour. It was already pretty busy. I would recommend going early. The first part is by foot and the caves are gorgeous. We felt a little bit rushed as staff were telling everyone to keep moving but I do understand they have a schedule to keep. After the",
          "Impressive cave, lots to see, well designed and quite accessible public path through the cave. The highlight for our kids was the short boat trip on the underground Martell lake. Excellent coffee at the cafe outside. The show experience at the lake felt, however, out-of-date:",
          "Stalactites and stalagmites are a sight not to be missed and the ending with the boat and music are fantastic.",
          "We took a day trip to Porto Cristo and visited the caves. Were quite expansive, not quite sure what the idea was to sit everyone down to watch a quartet of musicians play classical music whilst in an illuminated row boat on a dark lake though!! That just seemed like a way to",
          "I went here with my family and we had to wait around 30-40 minutes to go in. The caves were fantastic but it sometimes git annoying as it was very slow moving as many people in front of you would be stopping to take multiple pictures and it could get very hot and crowded.",
          "Paris has the Eiffel tower, Australia has Ayers Rock, New York has the Empire State Building, and Mallorca has the Caves Of Drach. If you come to this island, you have to go. I think it is like the law or something. But seriously, a trip to this island is not complete without a",
          "50 euro for a family of four seemed extremely expensive to visit a cave but the show at the end was a very nice surprise",
          "These caves have been open for years, but sadly the format of a visit hasn\u2019t changed. They are beautiful but the form of herding hundreds of people through as quickly as possible to then see a short ( but peaceful ) musical performance is very 1970\u2019s ... in these days of led",
          "A wonderful, nice way to start our day and a beautifully immersive and unique nature experience. It\u2019s a bit touristy only in the sense that there are *a lot* of people, but it j bet bothered me and i felt able to see and experience everything fully even so. if you like crystals,",
          "Worth going to but not for the price. Also no warning of steps which if you have s family member with mobility issues is a problem, especially on way out!",
          "What a fantastic place to visit, the caves are beautiful to look at and the size of some of the caverns is breath taking. The classical musical ending was great, but unfortunately as it is not amplified it was drowned out by a lot of crying children in the audience. The boat",
          "Felt a bit like being herded through like cattle to the concert seats. Where you are treated to a classical perfomance of 3 or 4 short pieces. But no information as you're going round, would be good for kids at least to learn a bit of the history and how they were formed. Boat",
          "The caves are nice. There is no tour guide. You pretty much walk on your own (among hundreds of tourists) until you reach a big open area where they have benches and a boat comes out with musicians playing classical music. The acoustics are nice. It is a nice experience.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit! It felt so surreal and the performance at the end was spectacular. It really made our holiday and I couldn't recommend it enough. We went on a Monday at 11am and it wasn't overly busy and we didn't feel rushed through like other reviews",
          "Spent a fascinating hour here at the Caves of Drach. Apart from the gorgeous cave formations, the best part is the musical interlude at the end of the tour - really beautiful and moving. Give it a go - you won't be disappointed.",
          "This attraction was absolutely spectacular. With the delicately positioned lighting and makes the scenes fantastic for the camera. The auditorium by the lake was awesome and to hear a short classical concert by 4 musicians with the acoustics being fantastic. The only down side",
          "Went here in May 2019. Absolutely beautiful caves. Very humid but well worth the visit. Near the end of the tour you sit in a big area and there\u2019s a lovely surprise awaiting. Music but go and find out the rest. Lovely bar with snacks available also.",
          "Having read umpteen reviews, here\u2019s a summary: 1.yes there are two cave chambers : a. Cueves Del Drach and b. Cueves Del Hams 2. Every leaflet is geared towards promoting the cheaper ticket Cuevas Del Hams as are the road billboard signs so it is easy to get mixed up if you are",
          "Sold as the best caves in the world. Not so. Not bad but not well lit pathways. The concert on the underground lake was nice. But there was no time to loiter, everything works around the hourly concert. Get them in, get them round and get them out for the next batch.",
          "Amazing experience and well worth a visit, we really enjoyed it. The next time we are in Majorca we would return to enjoy the experience again.",
          "The formations are fascinating but the waiting around is tedious. From queuing to get in to stumbling behind groups of pensioners to waiting half an hour at the seating area for everyone to take their seats for the concert - it\u2019s all a bit meh! The concert arrives on a boat and",
          "We weren't sure what to expect so here it is to help others! There is about a 15 minutes brisk walk up a hill from the harbour (where the tourist boats take you) through the village to reach the caves. You queue for a ticket and then queue again for entry (or buy your ticket",
          "Visited by car on a bad weather day. Buy tickets online to skip huge queues at ticket booths. I would guess up to 1000 people are allowed in at one time so you will spend most of the hour of the visit in what is effectively a slow moving queue. Caves themselves are spectacular",
          "It's one of natures true wonders, with a little help from a lighting engineer to give it a special magic. The features in the caves are just awesome and it would have been nicer to spend a little more time looking at them, but there is a tight schedule and the guides keep you",
          "We visited this yesterday and it was awesome. No one told us about where to get the boat from so we missed it and with so many tourists I don\u2019t think we would have stood a chance getting on one of three boats they use. It\u2019s a very short ride so best to walk across on the path.",
          "We visited the caves of drach and had read it was a fabulous experience? Too many people in at one time . Would be better to have smaller groups but was interesting didn\u2019t really enjoy the concert but it was something different to do.",
          "We went here today as weather was dull and rainy.... got a taxi as the buses are so unreliable and didnt show up. Had a 2pm slot, think about 200/300 people had the same time slot. It was like a heard of cattle being pushed in all cramped up taking small steps. We had to wait",
          "We went to the caves as the weather had taken a turn for the worse. It is really worth a visit, there are a few stairs so if you have a baby or toddler you will have to carry them around as it\u2019s not really accessible for push chairs, however we didn\u2019t have a problem carrying.",
          "2nd time to visit . You better get there early to avoid the crowd that builds up later on . This place is amazing to see and the lake with the boats on is fab .worth getting there to see it . Also Porto Cristo down the hill is a lovely place too by the harbour .",
          "Visited during our holiday close by in Sa Coma. Have been here before- many years ago so we were looking forward to visiting again. They did not disappoint! Fantastic shapes and colours and very atmospheric.Quite a bit of walking involved including quite a few steep steps coming",
          "We stayed in Palma - spent about 1.5hrs to get to Drach Caves by bus, but was totally worth it for 60mins spent inside the caves. Top 5 quick tips- 1.Timing is bit important, especially if u r planning to cover other parts of island in the day- got there by 11.15 & got",
          "This is quite over priced for what it is. The queues are ridiculous and too many are herded in together so you don\u2019t really \u2018experience\u2019 the \u2018wow\u2019 of the stalectites and stalagmites. We went out of season at the start of May and found it ridiculously busy. This place would be",
          "we visited the caves in August 2018. it was nice to get out of the heat but there queue to get in the attraction and again to enter the caves was quite big. once inside the views were breathtaking. We especially loved the end of the tour which involved a musical performance on",
          "A great experience! Caves are very interesting to visit and the 4 piece orchestra on the row boat was a beauty to watch. I would suggest if you want to take the boat across the Lake then sit on the left hand side of the seating area looking out towards the lake as the boats are",
          "Just returned from day trip worth a visit local buses run often lot cheaper than a exsurtion just pay on door very interesting get a boat ride caves amaseing Had a guild end tour very interesting",
          "This took longer than expected, partly as we had to wait an hour for the next tour, and the whole trip took an hour, however, it was worth it. Spectacular formations very well presented and lit. At the end a lovely and haunting musical performance. Recommended.",
          "Cuevas del Drach caves (an understatement... CAVERNS) visit was breathtakingly beautiful and a wonderful experience. Extremely well planned for visitors and amazing in sheer quantity and variety of shapes and colours of the formations. Very moving and lovely floating musical",
          "If you were in two minds about this then don't be. The caves are really something quite spectacular and well worth the visit. A word of caution though - the walk down to the cave lake is easy, but the ascent back up could be challenging for some as it is quite a steep climb up a",
          "I was disapointed with this trip,as I was told there is a concert at the end which I was really looking forward to. The cave tour itself was quite interesting,but you are not allowed to use a flash on the camera. At the end of the tour we were seated by the water and small boats",
          "Good lots of steps to walk down then up . Convert good. Would of liked some talking or informations it\u2019s a silent tour until the concert then silent until you leave... Why is the cave like that? I still don\u2019t know! But good value for money!",
          "this is the third time we have visited the caves and they still amaze us. our son and family joined us for the first time and they were taken aback by the stunning formations of the caves",
          "Coach to the caves arrived 15mins late Massive queue to get into the entrance Way too over crowded to enjoy the caves everyone waddling at less then 1mph due to the vast amount of people. Only given 1 hour in the caves so not enough time to have a ride on the boats as",
          "Although the caves are interesting I've been to better ones before, lots of steps and didnt see a laser light show as we were sold, Maybe our expectations were to high",
          "These caves are popular. Expect hundreds, possibly thousands, of sightseers to be there at the same time as you. You will line up under a hanger-like roof and shuffle forward in a manner very reminiscent of the queue for a Disneyland ride, but without the themed scenery all",
          "Bigger than Sydney counterpart and not as deep (also not as deep as the Ardeche), it\u2019s a gentle walk down through beautifully lit rooms to a concert area where 3 phantom of the Opera lookalike boats paddled mysteriously past, one with musicians still playing Tales of Hoffman,",
          "A lot of people inside - moves like on assembly line 4/10 At the end of the path - hall, where you will experience small orchestra in boat, playing 3-4 songs. 6/10 Then you can feel like in sinking Titanic: wait 30 minutes (5 boats seating 10-12 people for 300 people crowd),",
          "Just visited the cuevas del drach this morning caught the bus down there from sa coma only 30 mins to get there. It only cost \u20ac16.00 euros each you had to queue for a bit but not for long. Once you got in and went down the steps you went be disappointed it was amazing to see",
          "Overpriced, you get everything you need from the pictures in the leaflet. The orchestra played over to the left which was annoying to sit turned. Not for kids. Underwhelming.",
          "Great natural attraction, extremely busy in our group but natural break gave us space with a 5yr old.was worth going to. However the tour vua tge hotel would have cost us \u20ac100 whereas we got the local bus - \u20ac1.90 & in total it cost us \u20ac43, but the tour would have cost \u20ac100+ the",
          "Came here on a coach trip .. cost for both of us \u20ac79! It took ages from Palmanova 90 mins! We were allocated 4pm for the hour visit. It was warm inside the caves but the number of people that are in makes it quite hazardous as the paths are dark and some slippery. Certainly",
          "Visited as a 30 year old couple. The caves were amazing, the size alone was astonishing. The orchestra and boat ride were a once in a lifetime kind of experience. The only downfall was how many people they let in at once, there were far too many people crammed in so you felt",
          "I loved the intricate formation in the caves. I also liked the musical performance. The boat ride across was a little disappointing, but all in all, a great experience",
          "Truly blown away by the immersive atmosphere and how impressive everything is. My 18 month old daughter was fascinating by the shapes and sensory experience. Just be conscious of having to carry a child around when they get tired! \ud83d\ude43",
          "i was looking forward to going here after seeing pictures. unfortunately due to the amount of people you get shuffled along and dont see much. once people start to string out you stop for a 10 mimute concert which really just means the whole group get stuck together again",
          "Whilst travelling around Mallorca we stopped off at the Caves, having read previous reviews. We were not disappointed. The caves are magnificent, and the added bonus of music in the underground cavern, in the dark - except for lights on the musicians' boat, made it more",
          "Whilst very busy and clearly packed with tourists from all over the island the one hour visit is worthwhile. It\u2019s a stunningly beautifully natural phenomenon and the acoustics are just exceptional for the little concert at the end of the tour. It\u2019s surprisingly vast and it\u2019s",
          "Far too many people, no good for disabled/elderly. Money making racket and you only see orchestra for 2 minutes. Total waste of \u20ac16. Wish we had just looked at pictures and stayed in porto cristo for the afternoon. Pretty inside the caves but terribly un organised and chaotic.",
          "A must see but you need to be able to walk without too much effort. Amazing things to see. I would recommend this place.",
          "Another stunning set of caves on the island of Mallorca. There are five lots of caves open to the public in this island. I have now visited four. Each one is outstanding and very individuality different. This is a great place to visit. Any time of year as the temperature inside",
          "We paid on arrival 16 euro, we got the 1 pm slot. There are places to eat and drink while you wait for your time slot. when we started to queue it did get a little confusing, the caves are absolutely stunning, and the boat orchestra at the end is a nice little show. they do not",
          "We have been to the cave before, in the winter it was not so busy, we were able to take our time going through, look at more of the magical structure's the cave have formed over thousands of years, this time, however, was so different. l walk with a walking stick an at the time",
          "The caves are a very short walk from the marina of Porto Cristo. Price for an adult is 16\u20ac for an hour tour of the caves. The caves allows 600 people to enter per hour and the experience is amazing. Towards the end of the tour you come to a lake where you take a boat to the",
          "the caves are a splendor but too many people at the same moment, so you have to wait that everybody is in the central cave to start the concert",
          "Although quite a high price to visit 16 euros adult, it is well worth it. Huge amount of people go through at the same time but you could walk slowly and not get pushed about. Lovely experience at the end where you have a short classical concert by three people on a boat over",
          "The caves themselves are beautiful, they are incredible and at the end of the visit there is a magnificent concert of classical music. However, I was very upset with the organization, as it is impossible to enjoy the beauty of the caves if you get inside together with other",
          "Caves with stalacites and stalatmites are always special to see, because of the story and wonder of creation. A good walk, and a lot to see. Its cool to see nature create something so wonderful. Its a good idea to book tickets before, just use the website, and bring the tickets",
          "Far too many people thrown in at the 12oclock showing.. like cattle. No pretty coloured lights in cave Pig ignorant people (pretending to clap when the prefoance is still on and coughing) whilst listening to the performance which was classical music played on boat Only exit is",
          "We\u2019ve been to similar caves elsewhere, but the Drach caves are worth a visit and compared favourably to the others. There are fixed entry times to ensure everyone sees the show at the end, see below, but that means it\u2019s a bit of a scrum to get in and then many people stop just",
          "...be prepared for crowds and very slow progress. Amazing underground cathedral type wonder, sensitively lit and the brief classical show is well done. The only gripe about that was the 15 minute wait, with nothing much to see, until it started. The outside snack area is",
          "It is a a great day out whilst in Mallorca. There is shops and food outlets to the entrance of the Caves. The caves tour is stunning with a nice musical piece at the end with a little boat ride whilst in the caves which my 8 and 11 year old enjoyed. It is a good family day",
          "This is one of the more impressive cave limestone formations I have seen. Stalagmites and stalactites galore in all sizes with perfect lighting incorporated by the operators. Buy your tickets online to avoid having to wait many hours for a slot as tickets sell out quickly. we",
          "Lovely place however very busy over 400 people in concert hall all using phones when it goes pitch black which made the darkness not as effective however the staff where flashing there torch at people using there phones and telling them off which was good to see would visit again",
          "A reasonably short walk through the caves on a single path which ended with a classical music concert and a short boat trip. The track took us through several caverns of stalactites and stalagmites with some spectacular views. The trip all in all lasted around an hour and that",
          "Beautiful place , highly recommend to see. I went with my family all of us was impressed . I recommend to book tickets online is cheaper and easier",
          "We had a lovely visit and the caves are so worth to see but oh my god the behavior of the staff is just awful that we will never come back again. The staff at the restaurant and shop are lovely but inside the caves when directing people where to sit for the concert, there was a",
          "The caves are amazing. Unfortunately when it comes to some tourists they think rules don't apply to them and take flash photos and videos when requested not to, spoiling the music event for the rest of us.",
          "The cave system is very impressive. It's a beautiful work of nature, that reminds one of fairytale landscapes. It's also a great place to explain the kids about how this came to be. The classical music performance is nice, and looks beautiful, even if there are still some idiots",
          "This is a must see especially for the adults. I could imagine kids would maybe not appreciate this and get a tad bored. Everything about these caves are beautiful. It's about an hour's trip and worth every penny.",

        "wiki": "S\u00f3ller (Catalan pronunciation: [\u02c8so\u028e\u0259]) is a town and municipality near the north west coast of Mallorca, in the Balearic Islands of Spain. The town is some 3 km inland from the Port de S\u00f3ller, in a large, bowl-shaped valley that also includes the village of Fornalutx and the hamlets of Biniaraix and Binibassi. The combined population is around 14,000. A famous tram, the Tranv\u00eda de S\u00f3ller operates in the town, linking S\u00f3ller to the Port de S\u00f3ller.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nS\u00f3ller is linked by the historic railway, the Ferrocarril de S\u00f3ller, and by a highway with a tunnel, to the Majorcan capital of Palma. The Ferrocaril was built on the profits from the orange and lemon trade and completed in 1911. The Andratx-Pollen\u00e7a highway also runs through the valley. The present-day economy is based mainly on tourism and the expenditure of foreign residents, complementary to the agricultural economy based around citrus and olive groves.  Soller is unique compared to towns on the rest of the island due to its geographical isolation, being surrounded by the Tramuntana mountain range. This isolation from all other major towns on the island, made it easier to trade with French merchants arriving by sea.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n \n\nThe focus of the town is the Pla\u00e7a Constituci\u00f3 which is surrounded by caf\u00e9s and has plane trees and a fountain in its centre. The tram passes through the Pla\u00e7a on its way to and from the main station which has been restored to incorporate a museum of Picasso and Joan Mir\u00f3. The church of Sant Bartomeu (Saint Bartholomew) facing the east side of the Pla\u00e7a is flanked by the ajuntament (town hall) and the Banco de S\u00f3ller, a remarkable 1912 Modernista building with defining ironwork, by the Catalan architect Joan Rubi\u00f3 i Bellver, a follower of Antoni Gaud\u00ed. The bank's organisation was founded in 1889 with the money of emigrants who returned prosperous to S\u00f3ller. On the other hand, the church can clearly be seen standing out from the canopy of the town from other parts of the Vall de S\u00f3ller (the surrounding valley). The original building dates from some time before 1236. The current main interior structure is now largely baroque (1688\u20131733).\nThe campanar (belltower) blends in well with its neo-gothic design. The remarkable fa\u00e7ade is a 1904 construction, also by Joan Rubi\u00f3. The old street plan is of Islamic origin and lined with historic houses of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. The town has a covered market and is bisected by a fast flowing river with a number of bridges. S\u00f3ller is also notable for the houses built in the early twentieth century by emigrants who returned wealthy to the town, particularly those on the Gran Via which reflect the fin de si\u00e8cle Art Nouveau styles of France.\nThe renowned Jard\u00ed Botanic (botanical garden) is on the outskirts of the town and is laid out with the plants of the Balearics and the Mediterranean islands. The Modernista mansion in the garden houses El Museu Balear de Ci\u00e8ncies Naturals (The Museum of Balearic Natural Sciences).\n\n\n== Events ==\nSince 1980, S\u00f3ller has hosted a week-long international folklore festival every May.\n\n\n== Personalities ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nS\u00f3ller Tourist Guide\nVeu de S\u00f3ller (local weekly newspaper), in Catalan\nSetmanari S\u00f3ller (local newspaper), in Catalan.\nJard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico (botanical garden), in Catalan and Spanish\nMuseu de Ciencias Naturales\nAjuntament de S\u00f3ller (Townhall of S\u00f3ller), in English",

          "We entered the garden not knowing we had to pay. We got far enough to pretty much see most of the garden before a lady told us we had to pay. This isn't because she was slow; it was because the garden was so small. It was meant to be 8 euros per person. Here is a list of things",

          "It is a nice place to spend an hour or two including the museum visit. There aren't so many plants but the view of the mountains that surround the area is beautiful. We paid aroun 10 euro/person...not so expensive but we went at noon and we walked in the hot sun...",
          "This is about conservation rather than beauty..... I wouldn't go back a second time and we did well to make it last forty minutes.",

          "I've visited the botanical gardens in Madeira, Capetown, Kew and Sheffield. I didn't expect these to compare, but to frank - I've seen less weeds on a council roundabout. Guess these are suffering from lack of State funding and relying on volunteers to put he time and effort in.",

          "A bit tired and said, but it still has it charm, in some sad rundown way. Don't expect too much from it!",
          "I normally enjoy botanic gardens, but thus one was terrible. Dull, scurfy, ill cared for, uninformative signage, and pretty small. Also awkward to access on foot, involving a walk along a very busy fast road. A complete waste of time and 6 euros.",

          "This garden has the wonderful backdrop of the Majorcan mountains. It is fascinating for plant lovers with the plants grouped according to their country of origin and each area is well designed. Plants were mostly labelled and we spent an enjoyable 2 hours working our way around",
          "For a newish botanical garden you'll be surprised by its maturity. Set out in rooms which reflect themes. Shady on a hot day - cafe and museum too.",
          "On our fifth year of visiting the Island we purposefully visited the gardens in late April when they were bursting into life with both native and exotic plants. Set out as as series of rooms, the water features were especially well presented with dragonflys and native bees",
          "A wide range of native plant species. I visited in September so most of the flowers had disappeared, but I am sure it is quite spectacular in the spring.",
          "Situated a short and pleasant walk away on the edge of town. It's not huge, and there are no hot houses etc, but what is there is a good mix of plants that are indigenous to this part of the world. Worth the detour.",

          "We spent an hour or so wandering around this botanical garden which represents many (all?) of the various climatic regions in Spain and includes the Balearic islands as well. It was a bit tricky to walk to from the town square but we managed to find the entrance eventually.",
          "This may well be a great attraction for gardeners but even though my wife is such a person and she marveled at the lay-out of the place, I found it uninspiring, probably because the plants were not at their best. The museum had some interesting artefacts but only gave",

          "I think this is worth going to but when I went I was the only person there and the gardens looked a bit shabby and unloved. The museum attached would probably be quite interesting for kids.",

          "The gardens were opened in the mid 80s and are a great idea - to show a range of site-relevant plants - but a few specimens were in very poor shape/needed replacing and many of the fruit trees had a severe fungal infection. There is a laminated English spiral-bound translation",

          "A very pleasant way to enjoy a morning, interesting and inexpensive. A ten minute walk from the centre of Soller. Where you can enjoy a tapas lunch at Cafe de Soller.",

          "You'd just drive past if you didn't chance to spot it or the little sign but the botanical gardens (for that is what they are) are a real treasure trove of Mallorquean natural history. Upon entering there is a small museum and fascinating library recording the cataloging work",

          "The setting is amazing- water clear, beautiful- the surroundings are magical. Parking was easy- but looks like it could get crowded- 5 euro was totally reasonable. The beach was very crowded, but we were able to stake out a spot.",
          "The beach here is fab and quite popular, but it benefits from having a car park, and proper paths. The beach has a path along the rocks and interesting places to swim or sun bathe. The sea is of course azure blue but so much nicer for not being surrounded by buildings. There",
          "A beautiful place to visit, the turquoise clear waters are stunning. Good places to get food and drink, but beware the public toilets have an attendant who expected a tip, so have some loose change at the ready, although if you eat in the restaurant they do have toilets, inside",

          "I love this area. It is absolutely stunning. There are two beaches of beautiful whitish sand. It's very hot here as it is surrounded by trees and rocks. The sea is beautifully clear. It's worth a day out here. You can go by car \" Hire one for the day\" or if you are lucky enough",

          "We we happy that we stopped by this beach. Water was clear and made this beach more amassing. I think we stopped in wrong car park because we had to walk about 15 minutes - lady which was selling car part tickets said it will be 5 minutes walk. It wasn't with kids.. they were",
          "One of our favourite beaches on Majorca. Short walk from the car park. Always busy, but all the good beaches on Majorca are busy. The restaurant is very good. Local dishes freshly cooked and good value. Try the fish with green sauce (literal translation).",

          "So worth the trip to find this park, the walks along the sea edges on the rocks/cliffs are so enjoyable and the views are truly stunning. There are 3 or 4 lovey beaches with a couple being quite secluded and a joy to swim from and seemingly very safe as the sandy sea beds are a",
          "This was not just a day at the beach. We went for a nice, long walk along one of the marked paths, walked to the top of the cliff and enjoyed incredible views of the clear, blue water. Eventually we walked back down to have lunch at one of the restaurants and had a lie down in",

          "After a long ride and then short walk down to the beaches we were instantly impressed. We arrived later in the day so did not make a beach day out of it. We walked from beach to beach, had a snack and cocktail and as the place was closing up, headed back to the car. Shortly",

          "We in group of 6 went to this beach. There are couple of non entry banners along the way to the beach. We felt the banners are old and passed through them, i would recommend you also to do the same. Do drive to the beach as it is the only way, there are parking options",
          "Visited Mondrago twice during our stay, first trip to enjoy the gorgeous coves, beaches and sea. The second to investigate some of the nature trails. We saw loads of Spotted Fly catchers and even had the pleasure of seeing a tortoise which was a real treat. Great little area",

          "We took a cab from Cala Esmeralda and we were so happy we did! This place is beautiful!! We rented sun loungers for the day and jumped off the cliffs into the water. Even though it was crowded (not completely unexpected for July!) -- it was worth the trip.",

          "Worth the visit. Absolutely beautiful. Can get a taxi from Cala d'Or for about 10 euro or a bus. There are two beaches. One smaller and busier with pedelos and one further on with a beach bar and toilets. Worth going further round.",

          "Favourite place on the island Either drive to the main beach and swim over to the nearby beach for a small cruzcampo at the beach shack or get the glass bottom boat there for fun. The waters are Crystal clear warm plenty of fish spotting and the setting is just superb plus",
          "After a little map difficulty found this idyllic spot on the coast. Parking was 5 euro and there is a short walk to the guarded beach. One Cafe on the beach and portaloos, the latter were a little dirty and basic. Sea area fabulous enjoyed by lots of people. Made up for any",

          "Definitely worth a visit, easy parking and a short walk down to a beautiful beach, the locals use this beach and I don\u2019t blame them. As its a conservation area only a small shack selling drinks, chips etc. You won\u2019t regret making the effort to visit",
          "We caught the Star Fish boat from Cala Gran. It was a beautiful trip, passing some of the other lovely beaches and ports. Our teenage boys loved the stop off to use the slides, jumping off the boat, etc. When we arrived at Mondrago there were plenty of picnic benches available",

          "These two coves are beautiful and less touristy than Cala D'or and the surrounding beaches. But because of that there is only two bars and one small shop at the site, all charging a premium, but well worth a visit. Taxi from Cala D'or/ Cala Egos is around 10 euros, the 507 bus",
          "The beaches here are very pretty with safe bathing areas, there is beach bars and local hotel bar both serving food. After walking a couple of the short trails available we spotted numerous wildlife, loved the light blue large dragonflies. Lovely place to spend a day out.",
          "Very nice indeed. Went there as part of star fish cruises. A little crowded though but not too bad if you take the early departure.",
          "We loved that place and will definetely come back! expect the clearest and freshest water on Mallorca! We use to get there early and leave early, as the beautiful beaches are crowded later every day.",
          "This is a small bay which we travelled to on a catamaran. Only a tiny beach but with a lifeguard and bar/restaurant etc. I dont think they did sunbeds etc, everyone was laying on towels or had taken their own chairs. Great atmosphere, staff were lovely, the water crystal",

          "We walked in 15 minutes from Porto Petro to the Parc. Inside are six different routes to walk. The routes are not so long (about 20 minutes) and not very difficult. The views are stunning, we spotted only turtlles on route 5. We also did 2 and 3. There are three different bays",

          "We visited from cala d'or for half a day and it was the most beautiful place we saw on our trip. Roughly \u20ac1.70pp each way on bus 507, about 30-40mins. We did walking routes 2&3, both easily manageable in 20mins (with my pregnant wife). As others have said, take a quick walk",
          "Truly beautiful beaches. Had a morning, around 4 hours, here with my daughters aged 11 and 15. Got a taxi from Cala Egos for 8 Euros. Beachea fairly busy but not as bad as I was expecting from reading other reviews. Beach bars, snack bars and toilets available. Crystal clear",

          "This was a wonderful place to visit with great walks amazing views good facilities snack bar restaurant etc. It was cold and wet the day we went there but we still enjoyed it. Would be fantastic on a hot day to relax on the beach after walking the trails.",

          "As we had the pushchair for our toddler, we didn't get to go and do as much trekking around the nature reserve as we would have liked as some of it is off the beaten path. However the little beach was so pretty and didn't feel too busy. The sea in May is freezing still but is so",
          "There is a wonderful beach with beach bars. There is 5 trails if you would like to go a little. There is not much else to see while on the trails but the sea and some really old stone buildings. Good for a one day trip if you wanna take all the trails (it takes about 2-2,5",

          "Lovely beach and walks . 20 mins from the car park which is 5 euros for the day but worth the walk . Toilets and cafes and two lovely beaches to choose from . Was very windy and cloudy the day we went but still worth a visit",
          "After paying our 5euro car park (which is donated to charity) we walked down to the beaches and were taken aback by the beauty of the first cove we came to. We walked around to the next beach which was also stunning. The sea is so clear and has the occasional boat coming into",
          "We got the by boat and spent the afternoon there, it was very nice. Seen that there are so many people on the beach we decided to explore a bit outside and I'd recommend that to anyone, it's very beautiful!",

          "Whilst staying in Cala d'Or my wife and I explored most of the south east coast, walking an average of 8 miles a day. Mondrago was right on our doorstep and we didn't expect it to be as good as it turned out. The majority of people who visit go to enjoy the 3 beautiful beaches",

          "Great beach, beautiful clear sea. We liked the beach and visited twice during our 5 day holiday. Just to mention the beach bar has a serious wasp problem and the man who takes the payment for the sun-beds and peddle boats was rude and aggressive towards us on the two occasions",

          "My wife and I wanted to see more of Mallorca's beaches, so we rented a car and drove out here. Easy to find and even easier parking, it was well worth the trip. The beaches were beautiful. Obviously popular, they weren't overcrowded. Two restaurants at the first beach, I",
          "Spent 2 days here. Beautiful. Take a picnic though as the 2 cafes are extortionate and of very poor standard. walk through the natural park and then take a taxi or bus back to your resort. Not within walking distance . Water crystal clear . Stunning.",
          "We visited this location and were lleasantly surprised by the beautiful location Beach was very good",
          "Stunning beach! Very enjoyable, the sea seemed to have quite a few little jellyfish in though and people got stung, nothing major, nothing more than a stinging nettle really, but he aware if you have small children.",
          "This is stunning stunning spot - the reviews are right. My only addition is that it really is very very busy. I thought a Wednesday in mid-sept would be fine, but we had to queue for the car park and squeeze our towels onto the last patch of sand. It was still worth it for us",
          "Good beach with safe access to the sea. Snorkelling worth doing with plenty of fish to see. rocks to dive from. restaurants were standard and not to pricey disappointed only one shower working out of four!!! Hopefully will be repaired for next year worth the \u20ac10 taxi fair from",
          "Enjoyed visiting the beach. We walked round to second beach which was quieter. Seaweed plentiful but once you got passed that not too bad. Quite a bit of rubbish in the sea. Might be from boats that come into the cove visiting!! Spotted a jellyfish whilst swimming which",

          "We spent a day at the Cala Mondrago, and it is a really beautiful setting. Very rocky, natural bay, with a soft, sandy beach. Lots of beds/umbrellas to rent, (we laid on our towels). There are pedaloes ro rent for keeping the kids happy, a shop and a couple of restaurants.",
          "There are two beaches here, first one is very busy a walk around the headland takes you to the second which is quieter, still busy, sand and scenery are great, but the water quality is a little below the mark, its in a cove with lots of big boats visiting, well out of the way,",
          "Took a local bus to Cala mondrago beaches are spectacular you could spend days trying to cover all the walks with plenty of fantastic scenery to photograph . You have to stay on the paths because they are trying to maintain the habitat and ask you not to stray from the paths.",
          "Two lovely beaches within the national park and so not at all built up or spoilt. The water is lovely and great for snorkelling. An easy way to visit is to take the Starfish catamaran which can leave you there for the day or just a 45min swim on the way elsewhere.",
          "We were devastated that the beach bar and restaurant at Cala Mondrago had closed. We thought this could be the end of our holidays here after 5 years. it made such a difference to our day to day goings on. We have 2 young children and would basically spend most of our days",
          "We went with our ten month old. It was super busy at 1pm as you would expect. Parked off road which was a good 10 mins from the beach. Not ideal with a baby but otherwise very nice.",
          "Visited a lovely beach S'Amarador in the national park, the park itself looks lovely and I would like to explore again more some time great sea views and beautiful coastline. Worth a visit for sure.",
          "Really lovely beach and blue water. There is a lot of seaweed as you walk in and out of the sea. I had it all over me. There are 4 showers on the beach but unfortunately only 2 were working so quite a long queue. We paid 15 euros for 2 sunbed with a parasol, the chap that we",

          "Travelled with Starfish, great boat and trip, but when arriving at Mondrago was very disappointed to find the beach way too busy.i was led to believe it was away from the crowds, just natural with no bars etc. Not that special, plenty of other pretty bays that are worth a visit",
          "Worth a visit, as the walks are very pretty. I'd go early as it starts to get busy around mid day on the beaches. The sea was quite rough when I visited in July so just go careful although, If you are a stronger swimmer you will be fine. Watch out for the wasps!!! I got",
          "Great 'Starfish' boat ride there. The best part being the 45-min play in the bay of Mondrago, however we found the beaches busy and the general area dirty (litter and not as clean sea water) compared to other beaches in Cala D'Or. Expensive (as expected) drinks at the beach bar!",
          "We were advised to visit this area as it had a \"beautiful beach\". On arrival we found 2 beaches in close proximity. Avoid the first one as it is smaller and gets very crowded. Walk along the headland for about 10 minutes and you come to the larger beach. It's worth the walk and",
          "Absolutely gorgeous place - made all the better by travelling via the Starfish glass bottom boat. When the boat arrives in the bay, it lays anchor and allows passengers to slide, dive or simply gently disembark into the sea for a good 45 minutes. Really good snorkelling as",
          "Gorgeous place - stunning natural beauty and the sea is just as blue as it gets. There is also a lovely beach here and the waters are shallow which is good for youngsters",
          "We went here for a walk but it was too hot to walk a round. Had a look at the beach. Looks like barbados with the clear blue sea and white sands. Parking is 5\u20ac in the carpark so quite pricey unless you can get on the road. The beach is big so plenty of space.",
          "This was a very picturesque beach .. It was busy but very pleasant. You could walk around the area or along the path. Pay to park ..",
          "Gorgeous. Busy, but if you accept that a Majorcan beach will be busy, this is what be of the best! Two great restaurants, a local, simple shop and perfect sand!",
          "Nice way marked walks to follow; three lovely clear coves to choose from to swim in. Beach bars for snacks and drinks. Caught local bus there and back easily but be at bus stop early and be ready to assert yourself in the queue not everyone got on and people do push in.",
          "A short drive from Cala D'or with a \u20ac5 parking charge it's then a 10-minute walk on the trail across the park land down to the beach, though most persons stuck to the path on the road instead, missing out on the national park. Arriving around 10.30 the beach was already busy but",
          "Being in a nature reserve I expected a little more. After parking at the top of the hill (we parked just up from the car park for free, rather than pay \u20ac5), we wandered down the hill to the beach. The setting is nice and wooded and there are a couple of small hotels on the",
          "Beautiful sandy cove with excellent bar & restaurant options. The beach gets very very busy and has limited sun loungers. So get there early! There is a car park which costs 5 euros then a walk downhill to the beach say no more than 10 minutes. Well worth a visit.",
          "If you are holidaying in this area this Park is a most visit, there are a numerous cliff walks walks which take you along the coast taking you various beautiful little beach coves.... make sure you have some sturdy foot ware on your feet as some of the stones can be quite sharp",
          "Read the reviews about how amazing this beach was so wanted to have a look. Planned a day at the beach but ended up getting there later than planned. At 11 am parking was easy with loads of spaces in the car park or along the road. Walked down to the beach which was already",
          "We struggled to find the place unfortunately and found many other people did as well! Because the map asks you to go down a road that says permit residents only. We took a risk and drove down it and it led to a road on the left of a crossroads that took you to a little corner",
          "A place that should be on everyone's itinerary. Only downside is that it's very crowded in the peak season. Probably best in the late afternoon.",
          "Have been to Mondrago for 20 years & this year the beach bar & beach have changed hands. The menu is so disappointing and very expensive for what is on offer. The chairs and tables (benches) so uncomfortable. Went once this summer & wont be back. Try the restaurant on the far",
          "Amongst the beautiful beaches there is plenty of fantastic walks to be explored, the scenery is nothing short of amazing! And the waters are perfect for snorkelling! We took a pack up after being advised how expensive the shop on the beaches are! \u20ac2.20 for a small water and",
          "In May 2017 visited Mondrago beach. The mobile toilet was disgusting and the other toilets were locked. Luckily we were able to use toilets at the beach bar. I love Majorca and in 2016 visited mondrago and it was much cleaner. Also no sun beds or parasols were available.",

          "I have visited this beach for 27 years and it has always been the best beach in mallorca - we visited the other day and it was dirty and not as great a it used to be - feeling disappointed",
          "We have been visiting Mondrago for over twenty years and geographically it is still as beautiful as ever - but if you prefer your beach experience to not be likened to being lined up like sardines then you would be better off going to one of the coves nearby. Even the second",
          "Beautiful beach although sun beds lacking! Went on Star ferry one day - great to jump off into the clear blue sea! We may have been unlucky with the tides etc but I was surprised how much plastic was in the sea Also hired bikes and cycled from Cala D'or which is about 5 kms",

          "Beach was dirty with trash and debris from the surrounding trees. Water was filled with urine (you could smell it as you swam back to the shore). However, we took the Starfish boat to the park, which was a good time and worth the money. If you are renting a car, I",

          "The beach was very clean and pretty. It is definitely worth a visit if you're in majorca! There was a man that would make the rounds with fresh fruit e.g. mangos, pineapples, watermelon etc which was nice",

          "This beach was so beautiful and natural with crystal blue/green waters. There were two bays but it was worth walking to the furthest one as there was more of a breeze on this one. The last bus was at half six so after that you have to get a cab ( cab details are on a board",

          "Took the Starfish cataramaran to Mondrago. Boat trip was good, enjoyed seeing the coast and swim stop was fab. Mandragora itself was a bit disappointing. Beach busy and not very clean, lots of litter in the water. A few jellyfish about which was a shame. Beach bar was nice. Too",

          "This is a lovely place to visit, with a very nice beach and a couple of decent restaurants for lunch or drinks. There is a great little pathway between the beaches and the views are stunning - the water is as clear as anywhere I've ever been. Only slight 'downside' is that it",

          "We cycled from cala dor to Mondrago as the reviews were so good. It's a beautiful place but I wouldn't say it's better than cala d'or beach or cala Esmeralda. The scenery is impressive and the beaches are a bit bigger which I suppose in the high season would make it much better.",

          "The beach at mondrago is stunning, there's a couple of places to eat if you are wanting lunch. The beach and sea are really picturesque, we've visited quite a few times with our young son. Definitely worth a visit, you can get a bus/taxi from Cala egos/Cala d'or.",
          "I walked to this park several times from Cala Figuera and went snorkelling at the beach. The walk was very peaceful especially in the woods and I saw quite a lot of wildlife including a hoopoe which was very satisfying . The beach was nice and sandy and safe and there was plenty",
          "This park is easily accessible East of Pama,via Santanyi. Most of the journey is on the motorway so it is about 50 minutes from Palma. The area has a selection of walks that can be covered in 20 to 50 minutes. If you follow the coves you are treated to some fabulous scenery or",
          "We took a boat trip here and stayed all day. It's so beautiful and there was a restaurant on the beach we had lunch at.",
          "Really enjoyed our visit. Initially passed through in the morning when hardly anyone was there and had a good walk around the trail on the rocks above the beach. Much busier on our return in mid afternoon but that didn't affect our enjoyment too much. Had a good swim in",
          "The amazing natural place, two nice beaches with clean water. The problem is so many tourists are there that you cant enjoy of all beauties.",
          "Mondrago is a must visit park/reserve on the way to Cala Dor. A walkers, swimmers, explorers paradise.",
          "Everything you want from a small, seaside national park - especially the color, clarity and warmth of the water.",
          "This place is incredibly beautiful a bit secluded but fantastic when you get there. Quite full in summer but perfect in June. You can Go for a Nice walk in the surrounding national park along the beautiful coastline.",
          "We took the bus to this national park with friends. The first beach which is where you get dropped off, has lots of facilities including a bar and restaurant and good loos etc. and to be fair looked rather nice. It did look quite busy though so we thought we would be adventurous",
          "Amazing park.lots of nice coves and walks.you can just get a bus out there.about 25 minutes. Well worth a visit.have nice clean toilets near the beach area and a couple of eating places which were really reasonable.",
          "Again absolutely love this place, was nice to visit in the autumn rather than the hot summer as it gave us a chance to go on one of the walks, incredible, love it, always will",
          "Unimpressed by signage, unimpressed by setting .......just unimpressive. On what basis is this a national park? Just a beach with a bar and a couple of short walking trails. Not good.",
          "There are 5 short trails to choose from. All about 30 min to 1h long east walking. Discover mediteranean coastline as well as ancient culture plus fauna and flora! Nice morning activity with bathing possibility!",
          "Fabulous beaches (if you want to walk a bit) with great views, hiking along the way marked tracks is limited but worth the effort",
          "Enjoyed the walk but be careful of the volcanic rocks, our friend fell and badly cut her knee needing a doctor's treatment with stitches. Make sure you wer suitable footwear, not sandals or flip flops.",
          "This beach would give the caribbean a run for its money! Really beautiful and lovely for a day with friends.",
          "Beautiful location to take time out . need to be well equipped as this is a national park great beach fantastic walks .(must be able to walk over rough ground) facilities are very limited.",
          "Realy worth of wisit, amasing views. You can come there by car, public bus or sile by \"STARFISH\" boat, which siles from Cala D'or few times s day, cost around 25\u20ac per adult.",
          "After walking about 10 minutes from parking place we reached this lovely beach. Quiet and lots of space. The beach is very good for children as the water does not become deep so quickly. There also is a little caf\u00e9 whete you can buy coffee as well as beer.",
          "Lovely beaches but can become busy. Easily accessible by bus from Cala d'or .There are marked walking trails through the countryside behind the beaches which are very peaceful.",
          "This was our favorite beach during our recent visit. We followed instructions in a guidebook we found at our rental house, and had a fun time driving and seeing the countryside on our way. Official parking in the supervised Parc parking lot was 5\u20ac, but the lot was large and had",
          "Spent the morning hiking this lovely national park. Visited again the next day to relax by the beach. Highly recommend a visit!",
          "Two beaches linked by an accessible pathway. Main beach about half a mile from the car park (5\u20ac), two restaurants/bars under canvas on the first beach. Surrounded by a nature reserve with good paths. Highly recommended.",
          "Beautiful beach, nice beach bar but loads and loads of wasps. The beach toilets are very smelly but looked clean",
          "Hired a little boat to the bay, great day trip to a lovely park, didn't stop there too long as had loads to do.",
          "The park is a beautiful natural cove and is worth the see. We were going to take the starfish boat trip and then found it was about \u20ac10 on the bus return fron cala grand bus stop. Got there and walked to the far side beach, really nice beach but that's it, if you want to top up",
          "Come here for the two great beaches linked by a path running round the rocks or swim between the two as they are protected by being at the ends of an inlet. One is smaller and more commercialised with two restaurants. The other is bigger and more natural. Gets very busy and a",
          "Very nice scenery and lovely two beaches connected by a stretch of sea and a rock path. Very busy though! Two nice bars too",
          "This place is touted as a national park and probably equivalent to a SSSI site in the UK. Well, what a complete anti-climax. Drove out there managed the squeeze into a parking spot which should have raised alarm bells! The place was absolutely heaving with people. Walked for",
          "The beaches here are well worth the walk. If you park in the car park at the top of the hill the money goes to a good cause, a charity helping people with a disability get work. The walk isn't really that far down a hill where you arrive at the first beach and you can drive",
          "Lovely place food was good not overpriced down side long walk from car park and back again but would return",
          "On the first day of our holiday we visited the beach area and it was busy with a lot of visitors in the afternoon so get there early is my tip!",
          "Three fantastic beaches with scenic walks between each. Great for beach lovers, photographers, cliff jumpers, families, couples. Easy and cheap to get bus from cala d'or. Well worth a visit.",
          "We arrived too late not enough sun beds or shade . Very easy to get there as bus stops there plenty of little restaurants and fresh fruit vendors on the beach . Downside was the horrible toilets",
          "What a wonderful find. It's a beautiful little bay in a lovely setting. Make sure you get there early on as it fills up quickly!",
          "We spent two days here with our children. There are two beaches, one with two restaurants, pedalo's, loungers etc and one 5 minutes walk further round with just a small place for ice creams and snacks. The second feels a bit more relaxed with a few less people but the first one",
          "This place is magical, do not miss it if you visit Mallorca! They even have buses available for you to get there. Its beautiful and has a lovely beach and a nice landscape with tables for you to eat or bbq. Lovely nature",
          "This place is definitely worth a visit. The views are amazing! We parked for \u20ac5 which is a fair price and walked down to the beach and along the wall and sat on the rocks.. Had a lovely afternoon here, if you like sitting on the beach then it's perfect for you!",
          "Lovely beach, 2 beaches actually.Adult price is \u20ac1.70 e/w and it's about 30 mins on the bus from Cala D'or.",
          "The best beach is nice sand is white and fine grained (so I guess that can also be annoying because it sticks too much but I prefer it to big stones and pebbles) the view from the various points on the coast is amazing.",
          "We booked a boat trip to Mondrago but were slightly disappointed. It's literally just a beach.. and miles of fields/trees. The boat trip there was good- glass bottom boat and nice opportunity to see more coves, ports and take pretty pics but when we got to mondrago we just",
          "Beach was extremely busy and bars/ restaurants were a little expensive . The boat trip to it how ever was amazing.",
          "The beaches are beautiful and the sea is as clear as any I've ever been in. The park walk is also interesting with plenty of historical information provided along the route. It can be extremely busy though so best be there early to get a good spot. There are also 2 restaurants",
          "A hidden gem! Beautiful with fantastic swimming but does get busy. There are two handy beach cafes, which are good also there is a convenience shop although a bit pricey. The beach does get busy so get there early, although a short walk takes you to a second beach. The parking",
          "What an absolutely beautiful place , hired a small boat from the marina for 4 hrs and sailed down to cala mondrago.Total bliss.",
          "very busy on both beaches and too many boats moored there to swim properly. A lot of rubbish floating in the water from the visitors to lazy to put in the bin. but worth a visit.",
          "With its crystal clear waters and golden sand you would mistake it for being a tropical island in the Caribbean. I couldn't get my kids away and we spent a whole happy day playing in the water and building sand castles. Bliss xx",
          "By far the best 2 beaches in the area they are so much bigger than the others around Cala D'or so although busy are not as packed as the small ones. The sea is as clear as anything and the sand is almost white. Beautiful location - we accessed it by bus from Cala Egos took",
          "Beautiful, picturesque area. Gorgeous blue sea surrounded by lush green forest. Cute little road train can take you here from Cala Egos and other surrounding resorts. Lovely sandy beach (though im sure this probably gets very crowded in high season!). A couple of",
          "We visited the beach at Mondrago, the car park cost 5 euros, and is about a 10 min walk from car park to beach. The sea was quite sea weedy when we were there but it was nice & warm!",
          "Didn't walk much around the Parc as was a very hot day the one day we did go out. However the bit we did was good and although well signposted in parts with specific walks highlighted in kilometres and minutes it would take, where we started from the sign didn't give us an idea",
          "10 euros taxi ride from Cala dor well worth it as much longer beach with crystal sea and white sand.",
          "There are actually two beaches here where you can swim in the crystal clear turquoise sea. There's a cafe and beach shop",
          "Great beach, especially in the morning. 2 deckchairs and parasol for rent are 12\u20ac.... In the shop in nearby hotel you can buy second hand parasol:-) Fresh fruit from local guy is 4\u20ac per piece - 1/2 pineapple, slice of watermelon, mango, coconut... He will give you banana for",
          "Short drive from Cala D'Or brings you to this beach. Cala Mondrago itself was excellent with a nice cafe, if slightly overpriced. But if you walk approx 400 metres around the cliffside pathway it brings you to S'Amarador beach which is even better. White sand and crystal clear",
          "A frequent visitor over the last ten years. Fab beach and swimming. Unfortunately the car parking next to the beach and on the approach road has been removed which now means a decent walk up a steep hill to the car park. Best time to visit late afternoon in the summer or",
          "Visited here one day last week, lovely natural park with beautiful water to swim,snorkel or float in, two beaches, far one is quieter, two restaurants/cafes on beach also toilets and showers to use, recommend a pedalo with slide was 20 euros for an hour,great place to spend few",
          "A short drive from where we were staying (Porta Petra). Definitely need some form of transport to get to this place but we'll worth it. The beach was stunning as were the surroundings. Warm crystal clear waters.",
          "This is paradise! For hiking & snorkeling! It's perfect for families, friends, couples. will always come back here.",
          "Our guide didn't tell us really nothing about this place but because I het bored on the beach I decided to take a walk and what a surprise! Very pleasant walk under the trees and I find another small cale/beach. Don't be lazy and do the same!:)",
          "Gorgeous bay with nice, but overpriced restaurants. There are public toilets here though and a nice walk around to the next bay. Snorkelling is good, quite a few boats moored out beyond the yellow buoys, you can hire pedallos with slides on the back. Parking is 5 Euros and is",
          "Well worth a visit,one of the most beautiful beaches we have ever seen , voted in the top 10 in the world !! Get on the local bus and spend a couple of hours here !!",
          "Brilliant location for some GoPro action whilst snorkeling or rock jumping. A good spot for the latter is on the seaward side of the arch you can see from the first beach you get to down the hill. You can swim out and double check depth or walk out on the path from the left side",
          "Lovely beach beautiful clear water!! With toilet and restaurants facilities. The beach is right on the edge of a national park so there are trees surrounding the shore line, providing excellent shade for midday sun!",
          "Went here on a Starfish boat trip. A lovely beach but like others in this area it gets a bit packed. The beach and sea were great for kids with a gradual drop off. Good snorkeling. Overall an enjoyable visit.",
          "A pretty beach and only a 5 min walk from the car park . However what a great shame that one of only a few beaches in Mallorca,deemed to be part of the National Parc allows two very brightly coloured tourist catamarans ( The Starfish) with slides, into the cove. Worst of all is",
          "Spent a good few hours snorkelling and chasing fish. Beach was crowded but no more than any where else. Parking by the info centre was a little walk from beach. Best to drive down to the beach drop off and the come back to park. Arrive early to guarantee a parking spot as places",
          "Amazing scenery, very few sun beds and very very busy but worth it! Be prepared for a bit of a walk to get to the second beach. Probably the busiest beach I've been on in years, towel city springs to mind yet still amazing.",
          "Whilst very busy, this beach was gorgeous and one of the few that you can stay on all day. We went on the star fish boat trip which was good and the kids loved the glass bottom. If you just want to go to the beach and not do the boat trip I would recommend taking a taxi from",
          "We visited this beach numerous times and it had a lovely beach, great swimming but also shade for the midday sun if you walked over to the second beach. Both beaches had somewhere to get a drink and ice-cream from. Also you could get food from the first beach, plus toilet",
          "A good beach for children with facilities of food and drink as well as toilets. The water was clean and clear.",
          "Stunning, absolutely stunning. Visited initially on a Starfish boat trip then by hire car and enjoyed both visits. Amazing rocks, caves and coves. Clear water.",
          "We visited here one busy Saturday. I would advise anyone planning on coming here during the summer holiday (especially Sunday's) to get here early especially if you want chairs and parasols. Beach is beautiful, water is crystal clear and very warm. Quite shallow too, so perfect",
          "We visited on the Star Fish excursion and were not disappointed. It is a very beautiful beach with its crystal clear waters and fine white sand could be compared to the carribean. It was quite busy and we found the resturants on the beach a little expensive. Still, recommend a",
          "We visited several beaches near Cala d'Or during our family holiday and this was the best - long strip of sand, water very clean, no rows of parasols and sun loungers. Car park at the top of the road was always busy and a 5 minute walk to the beach. First beach was crowded but",
          "The Parc Natural contAins 2 beautiful beaches; the 1st is suitable for children and has restaurants and shops in vicinity whereas the 2nd is a 5 min walk round sea edge and more isolated but beautiful. The trails are well marked out and take you round some beautiful scenery.",
          "Beautiful little bay, very sheltered with no real tide. It was very crowded and loads of boats parked up. I didn't think the water was as clear when we snorkelled compared at other beaches around Mallorca. It's on a nature reserve which we found a little difficult to find and",
          "Get here early in the morning for a decent spot on the beach- although people arriving later seemed to have no qualms about squeezing into the tiniest spaces between other people's towels! I should imagine this is stunning in quieter months, with the natural park surrounding the",
          "Visited the beach on a catamaran tour , we were able to relax on the beautiful beach , we never bothered with a sun lounger so I couldn't say what price they are. It's a pretty good spot for snorkeling close to the rocks",
          "fantastic place but take your own drinks and snacks, the bars are very expensive and service was slow!",
          "We hired a car to reach this beach as we had read it was a beautiful paradise. After queuing for ages to get into the car park and walking 10 minutes in baking heat, we were very disappointed to find a dirty beach, covered literally in cigarette ends and other rubbish! We",
          "On the east side of the beach you can find 1) a swim through cave, you can see it from the beach 2) after you have pasted #1 you can find a smaller narrow cave 3) after #2, round the corner towards the outside you can find a large cave that you can swim through",
          "Gorgeous beach but gets really busy in the summer months. Get there early if u want a sunbed. Parking a bit of a nightmare, have to park at the top in the carpark & walk quite a way! Ok in the evening but with towels etc can b a bit of a trek in the heat. Definately worth a",
          "This is the most beautiful place I have seen in Majorca. I would recommend to arrive early to avoid the croud.",
          "A must visit if you are in the area as this is an area of outstanding natural beauty. Gently shelving sand takes you into a wonderfully refreshing sea. The kids were loving the waves. Make sure you pick up a sun umbrella - 10 euros at any Spar shop before you go as there is",
          "This was a lovely day out, we did however go on a day with the temperatures tipping 38c and found it to be unbearable in the sun this did not detract from the natural beauty of the Parc however",
          "This was a treat for the last day of our holiday together. We did this in style ... From a boat trip, anchored so that we could jump in to our hearts content. So rare to find such clear warm water, unspoilt and relatively uncrowded. I would really recommend this for anyone",
          "We went twice arriving before 9.30 as it gets very busy by 10.30 so we had a choice of both bays and a spot by the sea. My photos were taken before the crowds. The smaller bay has two cafe/resturants and a hotel near by and toilets. The larger bay small shop/snack bar. Lovely",
          "Two beautiful beaches - lovely swims You can walk from one to another - S'Amarador tends to have better parking spaces - you can also take a walk into the nature if you want to escape the summer crowds!!",
          "It's difficult to add more to the many great reviews. The beaches are clean. The water is crystal clear. We got there early (9am) and parked easily. You must walk the extra 5 min to the second beach. We could of claimed a pair of sun loungers and umbrella but as we planned to",
          "Absolutely stunning. 5 euros to park nearby Beautiful cove, very busy with bars and snack bars Lovely walk or swim around the cove to the over beach Well worth a visit",
          "We took the boat here and dropped the anchor in clear sea at a depth of 5 metres. Excellent conditions for swimming and snorkelling. The only problem is that too many boats get into the small bay. You can swim to two different beaches or watch people jump from the rocks. Near",
          "There are some nice coves with beaches but there is not much to distinguish them from the other beaches in Cala d'Or other than it is less built up around them. The beaches were very busy. There are nature trails but when I visited it was just too hot to try these.",
          "We drove to the car park, which cost 5 Euros but was worth it. 10 minute walk to 2 beaches in 2 coves and there were great. Plenty of restaurant & restroom facilities available. But great to be able to swim out in the coves and although beaches busy, it wasn't too bad for most",
          "We caught the boat to visit this place as it was recommended by the thomson rep. Beautiful beach with a excellent restaurant which serves mega Meals! Most of the beach Is surrounded by woodland which you can also walk round. Excellent for sunbathing",
          "Started coming here 20 years ago and now sadly everyone knows about it..... Visit it for a day - it's beautiful You won't get a sun lounger much after 9am so take a parasol and a few towels. Lovely beach bar - well enjoyed",
          "We had all the intentions of going to porto petra for the day so we got on the bus which was right outside our hotel. We got of the bus at porto petra and walked round the place, which must of took all of 50 mins. It's an absolutely beautiful quaint fishing village but to be",
          "Absolutely gorgeous beach...It was a bit of a trek down the path from the car park but worth it past a lovely natural woodland. The woodland trails also looked tempting but too hot for us...we just wanted the beach....Absolutely worth the visit",
          "Absolutely beautiful . Prefer the walk round to cove to right hand side just to avoid the more commercial side . Great photo opportunity",
          "Growing up in Australia with endless access to white sandy beaches and crystal clear water it's not often that I find myself reviewing beaches but this one was just beautiful. We arrived super early which I would recommend to anyone visiting as by the afternoon there were hoards",
          "Visited the beach and natural park for a full day. the beach was clean and water crystal clear. A few bars/shops nearby and lifeguards on all beaches. While returning to the parking lot we discovered our purse which contained the key for the car was stolen and while we",
          "A wonderful place. Several beaches in a beautiful land- and seascape. A bit crowdy if you go by car because parking is limited, We went by bus from Cala D'or. Cheap and easey. You can go for a walk on marked trails through the park - it's really worth the effort. There are 2",
          "A lovely area, two beautiful beaches. Good parking (though you have to walk 10 min to get to the beach). Lots of people, but usually quieter at the \"opposite\" beach.",
          "We visited a couple of times but only went to the beaches as it was too warm with a toddler to attempt any walks. It's a bit out of the way but we had hired a car so it wasn't an issue. You could get taxis and I think I did see buses. We parked in the top car park which costs 5",
          "Well worth a visit but can get very busy so go early. Very popular with boats dropping anchor in the bay . The water is very clear and you can snorkel and see lots of fish .",
          "We caught the 507 bus from Cala gran bridge for \u20ac1.75 each to Mondrago. Perfect escape from the busy resort beaches! We rented sun beds and umbrella for \u20ac12 and lunch in one of the cafes for a good price too. Beautiful, natural park, crystal clear waters and fantastic scenery.",
          "There are two main beaches one that has the facilities you'd expect but the other is unspoilt. It makes a nice change from the tourist centres of Cala D'or",
          "Natural park is not so far from Palma. Go there by car parking is 5e for whole day. Mondrago is park with few natural beaches with cristal water. You can rest on the beach and you can go and walk through wood and see all beaches. It is bay with 3 winderful places for swim. It is",
          "We hired a car for 2 days whilst we were in Majorca. When arriving at cala modrago park in the car park, we payed 5euros for all day, and all the money goes to a charity for children with mental health problems. We took a small nature walk to the beach, and the views were great.",
          "it is interesting nature reserve, just to see and walk around, we have been in a very hot day, so won't been too long, went to the beach after, but it's worth visit while using a boat",
          "Absolutely love this place, can honestly say it's my favourite place in Majorca and could happily spend day after day here.A must place to go.",
          "Beautiful place to visit, sea is lovely and clear, although the beach gets very very busy. If going by boat you have to trek across uneven ground and rocks to get the the beach which was not fun with 2 young children",
          "Two bays with stunning beaches. We went here from earlier visit to Cala Figuera. Was the Bigger of the two bays. Large beach. Car park is big and about a 10 minute walk down to the beach. Beautiful Turquoise waters. Worth a visit. Surrounded by spectacular Mondrago National",
          "Great for bathing, but if you want a sunbed, get here early, popular with families, there are a couple of restaurants on the beach, the car park is a 8 minute walk away and cost 5 euros for the day.",
          "The two beaches here are beautiful, the second day we went the winds had brought in seaweed which was a shame. The rocks around the beaches are great for jumping off, although there's very few places you can climb back out. Lovely to walk out along the cliffs too. It's 5 euros",
          "For those who love a bit of hiking, even for those who don't. You must go up there and enjoy the fantastic view. Breathtakingly beautiful!",
          "Need sensible shoes. The walks are enhanced by the views. 2 beaches. Bars/restaurants. Ideal family day out.",
          "We had a great trip here during our holiday to cala ferrera recently. The coastal walk is gorgeous and the water was the clearest I've ever seen. Beach was noisy and busy so don't go if you like to moan about noise. I would also avoid the 'WC' available as they are just",
          "Was on a boat trip from cala egos and this was our stop point to chill out on beach. Two nice beaches, nice walk around the sea. Beautiful clear water, swim from one beach to the other. Apart from beaches there is nothing there to do.",
          "Walked in the park and went to the beach afterwards. This was my wife's favourite beach (and we went to a few). It's a lovely cove, tree fringed and lovely golden sand. We hired sun beds and an umbrella at 12 e and had something from the cafe bar. Compared to many of the",

          "Wonderful unspoilt location in beautiful setting. The colours are wonderful. Good and well stocked beach bars",
          "The national park was great, it had two lovely beaches which our group relaxed on for around 3 or four hours. On our trip we also went on a walk around the park and found beautiful cliffs and vistas over the sea and the bay. The food available on the beach was a little pricey,",
          "I had hoped for somewhere relatively quiet but the lovely beaches were very busy and the bay full of boats",

          "Saw great reviews so went on a cloudy morning when it wasn't so hot. The trails are well marked out (with lots of trip hazzards) but the scenery was unimpressive and monotonous. We only completed two of the trails. Would not like to have tried this on a hot cloudless day.",

          "We visited Mondrago not really knowing what to expect. Firstly, the car park is a little stroll to the first beach. (5euros to park). We started off with one of the walks, which took us along the coastline, amazing views and brought us back to the first beach. We had a coffee",
          "The nature park is just beautiful. With a lot off different walking routes. In the park there are two magnificent beaches. When you are early in the morning (around 10) it is very quiet and the views are just breathtaking (you would think you are on Bora Bora or some other",

          "To me, this is my favorite place in Mallorca. We were not lucky with weather that day and waves were crazy wild, but anyway we had great time. You will find 2 parking places, I know one ask 5 euros, im not sure about the other one. You will find walkway next to the sea which",
          "We visited Mondrago twice in our stay at Cala D'Or. It's a wonderful location and although it is stunning in the bright sunshine, we visited it on a dull/cloudy day and enjoyed the walks around the woodland more as you get to see more wildlife - the Hoopoe being our favourite.",
          "Fab beach with beautiful pine trees surrounding area. Amenities to hand, nice beach bar for lunch, ice creams etc. On beach showers and toilets and limited parking. Pedalos to hire which is fun.",

          "We spent the day there and it was such a beautiful spot to relax and do lots of swimming, my sons loved jumping off the cliffs into the sea, it's something that should not be missed",
          "If you rented a car, you should visit this place for beach and sunshine. Well worth your time. It is not too difficult to find the car park once u get there, i think there are two routes, one by actual hotel of one of the beaches and the other on the opposite end (the one i",

          "We planned to spend a day on a walk with kids. We found about this park on the reception of a hotel, as it was nearest to our resort Cala D'Or (20 min drive). Park itself is huge with two amazing beaches. My first suggestion is to park on the western side of park, as you will",

          "We had a car however there is a regular bus from Cala D'or. Stunning beach in the national park. Only 4 or 5 miles from Cala D'or. Well worth a visit.",
          "We went there along with a few thousand others. The water in the bay was filthy, really disgusting. I've swam in many places around Europe and South America and this is the worst. Don't bother.",

          "We walked there from Cala D'or in about an hour. The beach is small but nice, water is clean and turquoise in color.",
          "Good for easy walks and nearby beaches, especially Cala Burget. Bar/restaurant on beach is expensive for coffee, better going to hotel.",
          "Well Cala d/or I first stayed there 10 years ago and was shocked to see the change and got to say not for the better ok the marina is still worth a visit but the rest nar during the day up in the town ok but night time keep away its bad constantly harassed by groups of people",

          "We were really let down during our visit to Cala Mondrago. The amount of litter along the walks & all over the beaches in what is supposed to be a national park is beyond a joke & quite honestly 'Disgusting'! There are plenty of signs saying how much money has been donated &",
          "Reached by following some tight roads in a quiet part of the island, the Parc Natural Mondrago is a great place for a stroll or for nature lovers. The car park is quite large, and the five euro parking fee goes to help disabled people get into jobs, so it's worth paying. There",

          "A little off the beaten track, but well worth it. If you walk around to the 2nd beach, it is also much quieter than other local beaches. The National Park Trail is well worth the walk, for some stunning views too.",

          "We visited Mondrago on the Starfish boat. The boat trip was fantastic - the beach was very disappointing. Admittedly it was August but both beaches were incredibly crowded, there was lots of weed in the water and also lots of rubbish. We were also surprised by the nearby",
          "Great beach, good food at the 2 outdoor restaurants and a view to die for ! Don't be put off by the 10 minute walk from the car park it's well worth it. It's only 5 euros to park & money goes to charity so I don't know why people park in the road when you consider the cost of",

          "Beautiful place to visit when in Majorca, it has two lovely sandy beaches and two lovely restaurants..",
          "Definitely a great place to spend an afternoon or day. Has two beaches so make sure you walk around coast - about 5-10 min- and find the other larger horseshoe shaped beach. You can't go wrong. What you expect and want the Mediterranean to be.",
          "After all the recommendations and reading the tourist reviews, we were looking forward to an idyllic beach paradise, however, the beauty of the area was somewhat taken away by the number of other visitors so the beach was very crowded even though it was outside of British school",

          "Cala Mondrago's nature truly is beautiful, color of the sea is just wow! But it is very popular, so beaches are pretty crowded. There is also a path through the pine forest behind the beach so I recommend you take a short walk to take a rest from sunbathing. One downside I can",

          "Always well kept beaches and the surrounding nature trails are fantastic. Parking is a reasonable walk from the beach at 5 euro a day but that is well worth it as it goes towards the upkeep. Even the restaurants on the beach are very good and worth visits.",

          "The sand and water were very clean. The beach resort provide umbrellas and comfortable lounges. A very pleasant afternoon at the beach. convenient, immaculate restrooms are on the premises. A restaurant and tasty gelato bar are also available.",
          "A beautiful beach near Palma. Great for hanging out at the beach but if you are into watersports it is not for you there are peddalboats for rent but that\u2019s it. You better come early if you want to rent a sunbed and umbrella. A bit pricey but really nice.",
          "Really great beach, but gets packed at weekends as bus from Palma stops here.. chairs and some water sports available.. also payable beach chairs and umbrellas",
          "Great little beach just a bus ride from Palma, or grab a cab there. Just make sure you know how to get home as there wont be many cabs around, but bus 3 runs just next to the beach. Clean water, ok for snorkling and swimming. Bar and restaurant available, both to go or to sit",

          "Very nice place to go and relax, we paid for our sun beds in a roped off area which was well worth 27 euro, as it does get very busy and you are well looked after with drinks and they book your table for lunch and escort you to the table, beach is lovely ,water beautifully clear",

          "We love Illetas beach. First time 14 years ago when it was very basic with toilets and a little snack bar. Now a much more \"classy\" affair. It's lost a lot of its basic charm as well as the public toilets. Gained a fancy eatery, hammocks and cocktails. Always clean and beds",

          "Crystal clear water, white sand (just pass through the first wee bit of seaweed when the tides coming in), idyllic location which is less than 20 euros from central Palma or 15 euros from Porto Pi cruise terminal, I can't recommend enough. Free wifi if you sit close enough to",

In the year 1399 Martin of Aragon yielded all the royal possessions of Valldemossa to the Carthusian monks. These founded the Charterhouse and inhabited it until 1835, when it happened to private hands by the Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendiz\u00e1bal.The church, a neoclassical building decorated by great artists and craftsmen of the time, began to be built in 1751 on the primitive church erected in 1446. The complex has a cloister -one of the oldest parts of the current buildings-, the old pharmacy of the Carthusians, garden and the rooms of the Prioral Cell-chapel, former library, audience room, bedroom ...- where the historical and artistic legacy of the Carthusians is preserved, showing how the monks lived. In the cells there are the documents and memories of the stay of the musician Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and the writer George Sand the winter of the years 1838-1839. In the cell 4 Chopin composed his  Preludes Op. 28, \u201c Scherzo no. 3, op. 39 in C-Sharp Minor\u201d and Sand wrote A Winter in Majorca.Saint Catherine of Palma, one of the Patron Saints of Mallorca was born at the Monastery in 1533.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of music museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Valldemossa Charterhouse at Wikimedia Commons\n\nVisita Valldemossa's Charterhouse\nCeld 4.

          "Stopped into the Monastery on a lovely day trip from Palma. It is easy to take the bus to/from Palma. It's worth walking through and around the monastery. My favorite areas were the outside spaces. The building itself is quite cold inside during January. Some rooms had signs",

          "This turned into an enjoyable way to spend a hot summer morning. Very interesting insight into the world of a Majorcan monk, very beautiful, great gardens, cool and shady. Don't bother paying extra for the Chopin rooms - you get the sense of where Chopin and George Sand stayed",

          "It is laid out around the cloisters of the original monastery. I found the pharmacy and the exhibits about Archduke Louis Salvador particularly interesting. There is also a separate museum dedicated to Frederic Chopin and George Sands but this has an additional charge",

          "It's a completely different place from the others in Mallorca. If you want to see and feel the world not the modern one but this beautiful , old-fashioned peaceful piece on the earth where you can sit,listen to the concert of Chopin music, imagine the love of two people from two",
          "Went on a weekday and although it was a hot sunny day had no trouble parking. The streets are pretty and a walk through the gardens was nice. Stopped for a strawberry milkshake at a little cafe and it was very good. Didn't go in the monastery as was such a lovely day. Thoroughly",

          "Valdemosa is very disappointing and definitely not worth the drive. Went on a Sunday (so hard to park). Local market was part produce, part street sellers. The local shops sell nothing but tourist \"tat\". I noticed that a previous reviewer had described Valdemossa as the",
          "It is a shame to have to grouse about prices but I think it is sharp practice to promote the monastery on the back of Chopin and George Sand and then, having paid to enter the monastery, to charge extra to see the cell where briefly the two lived. On buying our entrance tickets",
          "And nobody mentioned that Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas has a place there (just to let you know that even Hollywoood knows this \"not so secret\" place. It really is a great place!",
          "Although definitely worth a visit, the location of the ticket sales and how it is organized is very strange. Each area of the monastery has its own little ticket that is torn off by the local guard. However, the biggest surprise was when in one of the rooms, about 3 places in we",
          "The old charterhouse or Carthusian monastery of Valldemossa is a gem. You will not only get to see the monastery, but also the Municipal Museum of Valldemossa and the Chopin Museum. The Carthusian monks lived here for 500 years. They did (and still do in other monasteries) live",

          "Do you want to pay \u20ac8.50 to see the monastery or would you prefer to have coffee and a pastry with change left over. The church part is lacklustre and the monastery itself looks rather tired. The connection with Chopin is somewhat tenuous and, surprisingly, you are now asked to",
          "Interesting Monastery where Chopin lived with George Sands 8.50 euro to go in but to go into the rooms Chopin stayed in it was another 3.50 Euro each. Lovely views across the mountains and down the valley. Valldemossa pretty little village. Would recommend but go by local bus",

          "You have to go through in order - the tickets have tear off strips to keep you right. But this means that you get a whole variety of experiences, from church to museum cabinets to gardens to art. There is enough to read but not too much (it's about the experience not the",
          "As a fan of Chopin, it was interesting to walk through the monastery and learn of its musical history as well as being able to enjoy a short concert. The museum portions of the monastery included a diverse collection from Chopin to old pharmacopeia. It was also quiet, peaceful",
          "The monastery was very interesting, especially the cell where Chopin and George Sand spent a winter, the library and the pharmacy. An added bonus was a piano concerto of Chopin's music. We did find the entry charge very confusing and ended up paying the full entry fee to see",
          "I couldn\u2019t agree more with Jeffrey\u2019s contribution below (28 February 2013) although I give it one star rather than two. The price is a complete rip-off: \u20ac8.50 plus \u20ac3.50 to visit Chopin\u2019s cell (we too refused to pay the extra \u20ac3.50 as we were fed up with the place). This is",
          "As a musician I love Chopin's music and was thrilled to be able to visit this Monastery whilst on holiday in Majorca, and to see where he stayed to write many of his preludes. The plus was to visit Chopin's rooms and see his manuscripts and the original piano he composed and",
          "we were surprised how reasonable the price was for a family of 5. Part of the trip included a concert by a pianist playing Chopin. Well worth a visit.",
          "We spent a whole day in Valdemossa and we couldn't get enough! We strolled all around, enjoyed the sites, the view, the architecture. It was the most picturesque place in the island! Don't miss the opportunity to walk all around the village, to visit the monastery, to eat at the",
          "Well, yes, it may be quaint. But is it really worth the sometimes difficult journey by road from Soller? And then 15 coach loads of tourists fill every nook and cranny so any hint of quaint-ness is quickly lost. Really it's not somewhere to take young kids, unless you want to",
          "Beautiful Valldemossa lies in a pretty valley surrounded by terraced hills with olive and almond groves. It's a 14th century village and has wonderful photo opportunities from many cobbled terraces, of the valley below. Fat sheep graze on grasses and fat friendly cats sun",

          "We only spent a short time at this beautiful mountain village but the beauty will remain one of my fondest memories of my trip to Europe. I would recommend spending several hours or a half day...the village is simply beautiful with charming shops, cobblestone streets, wonderful",
          "We visited this Monastery as a shore excursion from our recent cruise.Valldemossa is a beautiful,scenic, mountain village with this huge monastery in the center.It was the home to Frederik Chopin and his companion George Sand for a winter.George Sand wrote her book- A Winter in",

          "By far this was one of the most photogenic villages I have been to in Spain! This small village in the mountains between Palma and the northern coast has a micro-climate of its own. Get here early in the morning 9am to watch the village wake up and have a moment to yourself as",
          "We loved the town and it's meandering streets. The Valdemossa monastery building was really interesting to see and we were treated to a piano concerto. Wonderful!!!",
          "This place could be very good but because it has been cut up into little small private areas (,museums ?) it has taken the whole thing down to a commercial point of view and I think diluted the whole potential enjoyment of the experience .... who do I pay and what bit can I see",
          "From the hype we were expecting great things of Valldemossa. We came away very disappointed. The little town is very ordinary, only enlivened by the Coll Bardolet Cultural Centre, which is a wonderfully restored building with some fine displays. The biggest disappointment,",
          "Quite expensive for what it is but the views from some of the rooms are fantastic and make it worth your while. Full of history and has a great connection with Chopin and George Sands.",
          "On visiting I was reminded of Polish Museums, a bit like the previous traveller , another 4 euros here another 4 euros there & you are being watched all the time . I am sure for the Chopin Fan it is well worth it , I left the town feeling as though that this was a tourist trap",
          "One thing irritates me was they tried to charge people twice for seeing Chopin's room, which is the main reason people are visiting this place. The overpriced entrance ticket only get you to several show rooms. Then the cellar Chopin and George Sand actually lived costs you",
          "When Chopin and George Sand spent a winter there in 1855 they said that it was the most beautiful place in the world. They were right. Wherever you see is like a postcard. It is like going back in time and everything is pristine. You can spend the whole day and you'll ask for",

          "I always love going to places where I can take in all of the history. The exhibits are extremely interesting. Everything from the monastery's library with original books to Chopin's piano and his actual compositions framed on the walls. My favorite part were the views from the",

          "This is a quaint town that is roughly a 25 min drive outside of Palma. There is also a convenient bus service running from central Palma that takes a longer, albeit scenic, route up to the town. There's a local gallery displaying/selling works from a variety of artists - entry",

        "wiki": "Palma de Mallorca Airport (Catalan: Aeroport de Palma de Mallorca, Spanish: Aeropuerto de Palma de Mallorca; IATA: PMI, ICAO: LEPA; also known as Son Sant Joan Airport or Aeroport de Son Sant Joan) is an international airport located 8 km (5.0 mi) east of Palma, Mallorca, Spain, adjacent to the village of Can Pastilla. The airport on the Balearic Islands is Spain's third largest airport after Madrid\u2013Barajas and Barcelona-El Prat. Palma de Mallorca was used by 29.7 million passengers in 2019. The airport is the main base for the Spanish carrier Air Europa and also a focus airport for Ryanair, EasyJet, Vueling and Jet2.com. The airport shares runways with the nearby Son Sant Joan Air Force Base, operated by the Spanish Air Force.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe interest of the Spanish Government in developing airmail during the first decades of the 20th century, led to a study of the possibility of establishing an air mail line to the Balearic Islands. Finally, in 1921, the company Aeromar\u00edtima Mallorquina established the postal line Barcelona - Palma, which used seaplanes in the port of Palma de Mallorca. Before the creation of this airline, trials were complete in two flat fields: Son Sant Joan and Son Bonet, both of which were later chosen for the construction of aerodromes.In 1934, the company Aero-Taxi de Mallorca was created with the intention of starting tourist flights to the island, establishing a flight school in Son Sant Joan. A year later, another one was founded in Son Bonet.In May 1935 the company LAPE, L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Postales Espa\u00f1olas (Spanish Postal Airlines), a predecessor of Iberia; was founded. A month later, in August, the first regular air route between Madrid and Palma, stopping at Valencia, was created using the Son Sant Joan aerodrome. A year later, this line was replaced by a new one connecting Palma and Barcelona. Three years later, Lufthansa and Iberia established new lines in Son Bonet, while Son Sant Joan was beginning to be used by the military. Through the years, Son Bonet became the main civilian airport in the island, while the creation of Son Sant Joan Air Force Base limited further civilian enterprises at the aerodrome.In 1954, the runway was enlarged and paved to enable the operation of F-86 Sabre fighters, which also meant the diversion of the Palma - Llucmajor road. During those years, the first paved taxiways and aprons were built, while Son Bonet received the first big groups of European tourists through the airlines BEA, Air France and Aviaco.\n\n\n=== The creation of the international airport ===\nThe increase in traffic, and the inability to enlarge Son Bonet, led the authors of the 1958 National Airport Plan to propose building a large civilian airport near the Son Sant Joan airbase. The National Airport Council approved this plan the following year and commercial traffic was transferred from Son Bonet to Son Sant Joan. This was the birth of what today is known as the Palma de Mallorca Airport. During that year, a terminal and a civilian apron were built south of the military facilities, along with a VHF communication center. Also, a VOR was installed in the island.Finally, on 7th July 1960, the airport was opened to both domestic and international traffic.Just two weeks later, expansion of the airport was declared urgent by the government, and on summer 1961 the works of extension of the runway and taxiway were started. At the end of the year, more plans were made, including a power plant, a communications centre and fire and rescue facilities.\n\n\n=== Growth since the 1960s ===\nAfter reaching 1 million passengers for the first time in 1962, in 1965, a new terminal was constructed, and air navigation services were completed at the end of the following year. Also in 1965 Air Spain (1965 - 1975) began operating from the airport and a smaller terminal (today's Terminal B) was planned. Passenger numbers increased rapidly, reaching 2 million in 1965. Construction of a second runway, parallel to the existing one, was begun in 1970. Two years later, terminal B went into service, and the second runway (06L/24R) opened in 1974.\nIn 1980, the airport carried 7 million passengers. However, this increased to nearly 10 million in 1986. This led to the construction of yet another new terminal building, the current central terminal building. This building is now the airport's primary entrance and exit and houses the airport's checkin and baggage claim areas. Construction started in mid-1993 and it was designed by the Majorcan architect Pere Nicolau Bover. During the construction in 1995, passenger numbers exceeded 15 million. The new terminal finally opened in 1997.\n\n\n=== Today ===\nFollowing a decline in passenger numbers at the airport following the September 11 attacks in 2001, passenger numbers rose steadily between 2002 and 2007 when traffic peaked at 23.2 million passengers. From 2007 onward there was a decline in passenger numbers, with 21.1 million using the airport in 2010. Today, Palma de Mallorca airport carries over 29.7 million passengers per year to their destinations, with 178,253 aircraft movements, mostly to mainland Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom.\nIn November 2015, Air Berlin (1978 - 2017) announced that it would shut down its hub operations at the airport which it had maintained for over ten years. All seven domestic connection routes to the mainland, such as flights to Valencia, Bilbao and Sevilla, as well as the route to Faro in Portugal ceased during spring 2016.During the Summer months the dual-runway airport handles as many movements as London\u2013Gatwick. On the busiest day of the week it handles as many as 1,100 movements, almost as many as London\u2013Heathrow, the busiest airport in Europe. According to the operational data provided by AENA, the airport can handle 66 movements per hour, or almost 1,600 movements over a 24-hour operational period.\n\n\n== Terminals ==\n\nPalma de Mallorca Airport occupies an area of 6.3 km2 (2.4 sq mi). Due to rapid growth of passenger numbers, additional infrastructure was added to the two terminals A (1965) and B (1972). This main terminal was designed by local architect Pere Nicolau Bover and was officially opened on 12 April 1997. The airport now consists of four modules: Module A (the former Terminal A Building), Module B (the former Terminal B Building), Module C and Module D (the last two were completely new sets of buildings and gates that opened along with the new central terminal and check in area in 1997). The airport can handle 25 million passengers per year, with a capacity to dispatch 12,000 passengers per hour.\n\n\n=== Module A ===\nThe former Terminal A Building is located in the north of the airport. It has 28 gates of which 8 have airbridges. This is the only Module that has double airbridges attached to gates. The Pier is mainly used by flights to non-Schengen destinations including the UK and Ireland. This part of the terminal building used to be closed during winter months and is only used in the summer. For winter 2018/2019 it will remain open.\n\n\n=== Module B ===\nThe former Terminal B Building is the smallest module, located in the north east. It has 8 gates located on the ground floor, of which none have airbridges. It is used by regional aircraft of Air Nostrum, mainly operating flights to Ibiza Airport, Menorca Airport, Valencia Airport, Lleida Airport, Asturias Airport and Santiago de Compostela Airport.\n\n\n=== Module C ===\nThe largest of the Modules located in the east. It has 33 gates of which 9 have airbridges. It is used by Condor along with EasyJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle flights to Schengen destinations. The majority of airbridges have airberlin.com written on them. The southern area of the Module was worked on and reopened in May 2010. The refurbishment and expansion is so that the Module can handle more flights, and to improve ways to get into the pier as it is the longest walk from security control. There will also be a further 8 gates with airbridges, but there will still be 33 in total.\n\n\n=== Module D ===\nLocated in the south. It has 19 gates of which 10 have airbridges. All odd numbered gates are gates with a bus transfer. During the closure of the southern area of Module C, it was used mainly for flights to Europe.\n\n\n== Other facilities ==\nPreviously Spanair (1986 - 2012) had its head office in the Spanair Building on the airport property. Both Futura International Airways and Iberworld had large operational offices on the premises of the airport but these are no longer in use.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Palma de Mallorca Airport:\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n=== Passenger statistics ===\n\n\n=== Route statistics ===\n\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nOn 4 January 1991, Douglas DC-3 EC-EQH of Aeromarket Express overran the runway on a cargo flight to Menorca Airport and was damaged beyond repair.\nOn 8 March 1993, Douglas C-47A EC-FAH of Aeromarket Express crashed on take-off while on a cargo flight to Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport. Both crew were killed.\nOn 12 April 2002 Tadair Flight 306 operated by a Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner EC-GKR a cargo flight from Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport to Palma de Mallorca. Flight 306 crashed on landing on runway 24L, killing both pilots.\n\n\n== See also ==\nENAIRE\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Palma de Mallorca Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nAENA (airport operator) official website\nCurrent weather for LEPA at NOAA/NWS\nPalma de Mallorca Airport Guide in English & German",

        "wiki": "Calvi\u00e0 (locally [k\u0259lvi\u02c8a]) is a municipality on the island of Majorca, part of the Spanish autonomous community of the Balearic Islands.  It is located in the southwestern part of the island of Majorca, between the Serra de Tramuntana and the Serra de Na Burguesa. The municipal seat is the town of Vila Calvia.Calvi\u00e0 has an approximate area of 145 km2 (56 sq mi). It is bordered on the north by the municipalities of Puigpunyent and Estellencs, Palma de Mallorca (Palma), the island's capital to the east, Andratx to the west and to the south by the Mediterranean Sea.\nAccording to the 2008 census, the municipality had a population of 50,777 inhabitants, of whom 18,046 were foreigners. Today, it is the second most populated area of the entire archipelago Balearic after Palma, and also an area that has the largest number of tourists in the islands.  Its population is scattered around the different urban centers created as a result of tourism development and twentieth century urbanization.\nThe historical epic that marked the most important local culture and traditions regarding the rest of Mallorca is the landing in Santa Ponsa on 10 September 1229 of King James I of Aragon, and the subsequent conquering of Muslims who had arrived in the year 903. Since 1248, Calvi\u00e0 has had its own parochial church, Sante Ihoannes Caviano.  Despite the popularity and use of the official shield locally, the municipality has no flag.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe origin of the place name is subject to conjecture but is believed to be from the patronymic Latin calvianum, derived from the personal name of Calvius. According to the philologist Antoni Maria Alcover, it comes from the word Caluus, meaning \"burn\" or \"be hot\", testament to the arid land that contains no vegetation.  The official name is Calvi\u00e0 (with a grave accent), but in Castilian, Calvi\u00e1 (with an acute accent) is used.Officially, the adjective to refer to inhabitants of Calvi\u00e0 is calvienses or calvieros. However, more widespread use in both Catalan and in its Castilian translation is calvianero/a. This is used by agencies such as the Institut Calvianer d'Esports del Ajuntament de Calvi\u00e0 and the Asociaci\u00f3n Calvianera.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\nThe municipality does not have a flag but has a distinctive coat of arms, defined as an azure blue shield with a paschal lamb holding a flag with a St George's Cross, capped by a crown. The coat of arms was approved on 25 June 1976 emblazoned with De azur y el cordero de plata que empu\u00f1a en su mano derecha una bandera de aquel metal, cargada con cruz de gules. Al timbre corona real, cerrada..\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nCalvi\u00e0 first appears in history as a village 2,000 years BCE, although the area was first populated in the Neolithic Era.  Later, sailors coming from the east stopped in the Balearics on their way to the Iberian Peninsula, where they sought metals. They came from Italy, from other Mediterranean islands, and from the Near East, and constructed small settlements along the coast. Historians call this period the \"Cave Culture\", because caves were frequently used as habitations and burial areas. Some vestiges of this area have been catalogued in an archaeological excavation called the Puig de sa Morisca Archaeological Park, which conserves remains of what was a talaiot 9 metres (30 ft) in diameter. It is located on a small mountainous elevation in Calvi\u00e0's Santa Ponsa district.\nThe Roman era lasted from 123 BCE until the 4th century CE, but left no significant vestiges. Among the few archaeological remnants of this era are the remains of a Roman villa in Santa Ponsa known as Sa Mesquida, which has an oven that was used to make ceramics, the horse-shoe shaped Naveta Alemany and the Tur\u00f3 de Ses Abelles.\nIn 425, the area was invaded by the Vandals, who ended up settling. Lack of remains or written record means little is known about this area other than the decline that began with the destruction of Pollen\u00e7a. The Byzantine general Flavius Belisarius ordered the conquest of the archipelago in 534, bringing an end to this era.\nThe first Muslim arrivals were in 707. They quickly ended the Byzantine domination and established their own hegemony. Until 903, the island was part of the Umayyad Caliphate.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 903, the Almoravid general Isam al-Jawlani conquered the island on behalf of Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi, Emir of C\u00f3rdoba. The city of Palma passed from the Almoravids to the Almohads, eventually becoming part of one of the taifas. Calvi\u00e1 was part of the administrative division Juz' d' Ahwaz al-Madina.\nIn 1229, after the Conquest of Mallorca by King James I of Aragon, colonists brought the Catalan language and culture, which survive to the present time. In the division of the conquered territory, Calvi\u00e0 formed part of the medietas magnatum that the king granted to nobles Guillermo II de Montcada, Hugo de Ampurias, Nu\u00f1o S\u00e1nchez and Berenguer de Palou, all of whom had participated in the conquest. Calvi\u00e0 in particular was granted to Berenguer de Palou, Bishop of Barcelona, becoming part of the Barony of the Bishops of Barcelona. There were many tensions among the conquering nobles who were granted various feudal rights; these were resolved through a pariatge or condominium under which feudal rights were shared. Therefore, the surroundings of the municipality are also known as the comarca of the Pariatge. Ultimately, though, the rights accrued to the Bishopric, which held them until 1834 when the Spanish Church lost many of its feudal properties.\n\nThe conquerors came, in various proportions from a variety of places. Thus, and according to the Llibre del Repartiment (\"Book of Distribution\"), the conquered lands were distributed among people from Catalonia (39.71%), Occitania (24.26%), Italy (16.19%), Aragon (7.35%), Navarra (5.88%), France (4.42%), Castile (1.47%) and Flanders (0.73%). Owing to the extermination or expulsion of the greater part of the prior local populace, there were not enough laborers to cultivate the land. In 1230 a set of privileges called the Franquezas de Mallorca were granted in order to attract new settlers to cultivate the countryside. Most of these new settlers of Mallorca came from Catalonia, more specifically the northeast and, within the east, from Ampurd\u00e1n. As a result, the dialect spoken today (Mallorqu\u00ed) is an eastern Catalan dialect.\nSince 1248, Calvi\u00e0 has had its own parish church, Sante Ihoannes Caviano, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. In 1285, during the reign of James II of Aragon, second son of James I, it gained the status of a villa. This meant it would have its own mayor, named by the king or governor. The mayor would execute orders from higher levels of government and would also maintain public order and administer justice. Nonetheless, he did not have the power to administer the villa, which fell within the purview of the jurados de prohombre, (a medieval office that was essentially a district overseer).\n\nIn the Middle Ages, various watchtowers were built to defend against Mediterranean piracy.To sustain the parish and its clerics, the king and the tenured landowners of the jurisdiction ceded one fourth of the diezmos paid to them by those who cultivated the land. This was, in turn, divided into four parts, three of which were granted to the rector of the parish and the fourth to the parish priest or vicar.James II of Majorca reigned over the islands for more than two decades and made great efforts to guarantee the viability of his kingdom. He undertook a broad policy of agrarian colonization, with the creation of rural nuclei; increased the royal revenue; favored the creation of consulates in North Africa and in the kingdom of Granada; created a new monetary system for the kingdom; promoted the creation of textile industries; increased royal power relative to that of the nobility and Church; and promoted the construction of palaces and castles such as the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, the La Seu Cathedral in Palma, and the Bellver Castle. The opening of the trials of the Knights Templar and the later suppression of the order allowed the Crown to take over their revenues in the islands.\nThe health system consisted mainly of physicians of Jewish origins, so-called Xuetas, descendants of Mallorcan Jews who had converted to Christianity, but continued to form a largely endogamous community. The nearest hospital to Calvi\u00e0 was in Sant Elm, founded in 1303 by Jaime II. Fundamentally it was dedicated to merchants and sailors of the ships that were heading from Palma to Barcelona. They also used it  as a refuge in bad weather.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nFrom the 13th century to the mid-20th century, the region was almost entirely agricultural. The first area to be cultivated was along the banks of the Bay of Santa Ponsa; at the time, the area was referred to as the t\u00e9rmino de Santa Ponsa; the expression t\u00e9rmino de Calvi\u00e1 came far later. Despite the long coast, people turned their backs to the sea, deriving their living from the dry and none-too-fertile land.\nAgriculture was based on latifundia\u2014large estates\u2014from the 14th century into the 20th. Most of the land was owned by a small number of nobles. In 1863, continuing a longstanding pattern 66.3% of the land was owned by four proprietors. At a slightly earlier date, Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana owned 2,516 hectares (6,220 acres), including all of Bendinat, Paguera, as well as an additional 990 hectares (2,400 acres) in the municipality of Andraitx. The Marquis of Bellpuig owned 4,376 hectares (10,810 acres) in Santa Ponsa, the largest latifundium in Mallorca at the beginning of the 19th century. On the other hand, there was a small group of peasants known as els roters, to whom the nobility had ceded land near the sea. These roters cultivated cereals, and lived in miserable conditions.\nIn the 16th century, Calvi\u00e0 itself largely escaped the plague that decimated the population elsewhere, although other nearby municipalities such as Andraitx suffered the scourge of the epidemic. Still, the population suffered other epidemics associated with the era and their way of life, particularly malaria which only a few escaped, such as the priest or the few artisans who did not work in Ses Rotes. The daily wage of a farm laborer was between four and six sous (a dozen eggs cost one-and-a-half sous). In that era there were also Arab slaves, although not in the maritime zones, where they were seen as liable to escape or to collaborate with pirates. In the 18th century a severe drought and bad cereal harvest led to a long period of famine. On 28 November 1715, Philip V of Spain abolished the fueros and privileges of the Balearics, as the Nueva Planta decrees extended the administrative organization of the Kingdom of Castile, prohibited the Catalan language, and required the use of Castilian Spanish in the islands. In 1748 the wretchedness of the municipality had become so severe that chronicler Pere Xamena Fiol described it as follows:\n\nWheat became so expensive that one paid 25 Sous per barchilla (unit to measure cereals, approximately 13.75 litres or 14.53 US quarts), and fortunate was he who could find some. Hunger reached the point where each house got no more than two doblers of bread, even if the family was large, and they gave permission to eat meat during Lent, and many people who didn't have the money to buy meat ate herbs, and they told me that some people had gone more than a fortnight eating only boiled herbs, and the poor people and workers were so thin that they couldn't work for lack of food.\nThe economic system rooted in latifundia underlay the Caciquism that made moot the theoretically democratic Spanish constitutions the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century. In Restoration Spain the power of the dominant classes remained intact. Both major political parties of the time, the Conservative Party led by Canovas del Castillo and the Liberal Party led by Sagasta relied on a system where day laborers and smallholders beholden to the caciques and voted accordingly, producing an orderly alternation of the two parties in power, the turno pac\u00edfico. In the late 19th century, hunger and poverty sparked emigration to the Americas, especially to Cuba and Argentina, as well as to France and Algeria.Calvi\u00e1 at that time lacked industrial establishments, except for the manufacturing of cement and plaster. The latifundia system was largely an impoverished agrarian autarky. In 1923 the Federaci\u00f3 Obrera Calvianera (\"Federation of Calvian Workers\") was founded as a member of the socialist Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores, followed by the Uni\u00f3 Agr\u00e0ria de Calvi\u00e0 (Calvian Agrarian Union) and La Fraternal. On 30 September 1923, Spain's socialist party, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, inaugurated a Casa del pueblo (a cultural and service center), which represented an investment of half a million Spanish pesetas. The labor movement and socialism played an important part in politics during the Second Spanish Republic, but were squashed during the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\n=== Contemporary era ===\n\nThe first seed of the modern tourism-based economy came when steamboat service from Barcelona to Palma began in 1838. This made travel to Mallorca easier for travelers from the Iberian peninsula and beyond. Some came to visit the municipality's coves and beaches. At this time Mallorca drew visitors who were motivated by the desire for adventure, an interest in exploring a different world and society than the one they knew, but also those who came to the island for therapeutic reasons. Among this last group was the composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. Works published by travelers, learned people, artists and geographers increasingly promoted Mallorca as a preferred destination.\nIn 1962, Calvi\u00e0 had four butcher shops, three bakeries, a dairy, ten grocery shops, three caf\u00e9s, two haberdashers, five carpenter's shops, two blacksmiths, a bicycle shop, and one bus line. Its scant industry consisted of five master masons, various ventures in shipping and transport, two cement and plaster factories, a trader in nuts and dried fruit, a machine for shucking almonds, a flour mill, a carob crusher, a wood dealer, and an oil press.\nThe first urban nuclei in the municipality began development in 1920, built on failed agricultural land sold well below its potential value. By 1960, changes in ownership had been so fundamental as to facilitate immediate development. Three quarters of the coast was rapidly developed, including all of the most desirable areas. Through their real estate affiliates, some of the last large landowners, such as Miguel Nigorra Oliver, president of the Banco de Cr\u00e9dito Balear, came to control nearly all of the development of Santa Ponsa. By 1986, the municipality had 10,000 of the dwellings locally known as chal\u00e9s (\"chalets\").On 30 July 2009, around two in the afternoon, the Palmanova neighborhood suffered a bombing attack by ETA. Two members of the Civil Guard were killed by a bomb placed under a patrol car outside their barracks; a second similar bomb was discovered and successfully defused.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nCalvi\u00e0 is located in the western part of the island of Majorca, next to the Sierra de Tramontana, the main mountain of the Balearic Islands, and extends to the Sierra de Na Burguesa, a mountain located in Calvia. Calvia has an area of about 145.02 km 2. Of a total of 14,372 hectares, 81% is protected rural land, 18% is developed urban land and 1% are soils with low protection.  It is bordered on the north by the municipality of Puigpunyent and Estellencs, Palma de Mallorca (Palma), the island's capital to the east, Andratx to the west and to the south by the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe highest point of the municipality is the Puig de Galatz\u00f3 at 1,026 m (3,366 ft) above sea level. The second is 926 metres above sea level, the Mola del Esclop, an area which consists of many valleys and ravines, between the hills of Puig Batiat and Penya Blanca.The peninsula on which the municipality is located is marked by the presence of wetlands to the east and west, at Magalluf, Palma Nova and Santa Ponsa, that lead to a narrowing similar to an isthmus to the north.The urban area has expanded around its coastline, converting into several villages on the main beaches. The coast extends from Cape Andritxol, until the area of Cas Catal\u00e0 Ses Illetas. It is 54 km (34 mi) long and very rocky, but still has 34 beaches and coves. There is 35.5 kilometres of rocky shores, 4.5 kilometres of sandy beaches, 10 islets and 7,000 hectares of coast, with a maximum depth of 5 m (16 ft). Islets include El Sec, Sa Porrassa, D'en Sales, Ses Illetes, D'estenedor and Sa Caleta. The most important though, ecologically, are the Malgrats and El Toro, having been designated as marine reserves and a special protection area for birds.\n\n\n=== Localities ===\nThe municipality contains eighteen settlements. The most important are the resorts. Palma Nova was one of the first tourist resorts to be built on the island within the grounds of an old farm called Ses Planes and began as a project intended to build a residential type Garden City, but due to the Spanish Civil War, this idea was discarded. In 2009, it was considered one of the most important tourist areas of Majorca. It is bounded on the west by the busy town of Magaluf which contains the largest hotel and greatest infrastructural services of the municipality to accommodate the many tourists.  Another of the localities, Santa Ponsa, has historical significance as the place that James I of Aragon landed. The town of Portals Nous is also a renowned meeting point for businessmen, celebrities, high society figures and members of the Spanish Royal Family during their summer stays in the Marivent Palace. Another of its main tourist areas is Paguera, where many residents spend their summer holidays, as well as a number of German tourists. Similarly, the urbanized residential areas of El Toro, which has a marina and a small beach, and Son Ferrer, are of note.\n\n\n=== Geology and relief ===\n\nThe topography is marked by the contrast between the mountains in the north and the rest of the municipality, where the features are flatter.\nThe main mountain range is called the Serra de Na Burguesa, situated between Son Falconer and Son Vida in Palma. It is the southernmost range of the Serra de Tramuntana. It was formerly known as Portop\u00ed or d'en Bou. It has an average height of 500 meters and is covered by large formations of Mediterranean pine forest and scrubland. The hills are composed of Triassic and Jurassic materials, mainly limestone and dolomite, with marl and gypsum present as well. The hills have a complex tectonic structure, forming a relief fold with many faults. The karst nature of the Tramuntana has led to the formation of numerous caves and sinkholes.The rest of the municipality is relatively flat, with broad valleys filled by quaternary and tertiary materials and small hills, with Mesozoic materials surfacing occasionally. This area contains a number of cavities divided between the area of Es Coll des Pastors and around the Puig Gros de Bendinat, Son Boronat, Benatiga Nou and Valldurgent. The Puig Gros de Bendinat depression contains abundant late Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments.  Its coastline is composed of calcareous materials.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCalvi\u00e0 has a mild Mediterranean climate with an average annual temperature of 19 \u00b0C and an average annual rainfall of 410 mm (16 in). It is influenced by two types of atmospheric circulation manifested in two distinct seasons: a hot, dry summer with little pressure gradient and occasional rainfall, as opposed to a cool, wet winter. The coldest month is January, with 15.1 / 3.5 \u00b0C and the hottest is August, with 31.0 / 18.2 \u00b0C. Rainfall averages 51 days a year and there are approximately 2,756 hours of sunshine. The average temperature in the summer is 27 \u00b0C, and 14 \u00b0C in winter. The driest month is July, at an average of 7.8 l / m2, while the wettest is December with an average of 81.1 l / m2.  The area is sheltered from the Nordic Tramuntana wind by mountains that are over a thousand feet high.\nThe thermal variation of the water has a range of around 15 \u00b0C. During the winter, it drops down to about 13 \u00b0C. In the late spring, warming occurs, raising the temperature one degree each week. During the summer, a 25 cm deep water layer reaches temperatures above 25 \u00b0C.(something of a thermocline).\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\nAccording to the Instituto Geol\u00f3gico y Minero de Espa\u00f1a (IGME), the area receives 4,900,000 cubic metres (6,400,000 cu yd) of rain per year, plus 100,000 cubic metres (130,000 cu yd) runoff from irrigation and 200,000 cubic metres (260,000 cu yd) infiltration of treated waste-water. 6,700,000 cubic metres (8,800,000 cu yd) is pumped annually for the water supply, but the current Balearic Hydrological Plan intends to reduce this to 4,100,000 cubic metres (5,400,000 cu yd).\n\n\n==== Ravines ====\nBecause of the torrential rains in October and November, Mallorca has many ravines, narrow channels that bring the rainwater to the sea. Among these are the Torrente (ravine) des Gorg, which rises in Es Capdell\u00e0 and enters the sea at Peguera. The Torrente Vial, rises on the outskirts of the village of Vial and runs to the Cala (cove) de Santa Ponsa; it receives the water of hundreds of smaller ravines, among which are the Barranco des Cobaix and the Barranco des Pas de la Mula. Among the longest is the Torrente de Galatz\u00f3, running 23 kilometres (14 mi) and draining a basin of 72 square kilometres (28 sq mi). It begins on the west slope of the Puig de Galatz\u00f3 and reaches the sea at the Bay of Santa Ponsa (Santa Pon\u00e7a).\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n\nMore than 49% of Calvi\u00e0's 14,552 hectares (35,960 acres) consists of woods and garrigues (low, soft-leaved scrubland), with pines as the dominant trees, although there has been some deforestation in recent decades. Cultivable land amounts to about 32% of the municipality; the main crops are almonds, carob (Ceratonia siliqua), olives and, to a lesser extent, figs. There is also still some farming of cereals and grains.\nAlthough the area has a harsh climate with few natural resources it is also densely populated by humans and there are relatively few populations of wild animals. The most notable zones for fauna are the rocky shore and the islands of Cala Figuera (Figuera Cove), such as El Toro, the islet of Refeubetx and the group of islets known as the Malgrats. This area has international recognition by the European Commission as a Special Protection Area for birds. In 2008, a diver in this reserve sighted and photographed a monk seal (Monachus monachus); it is believed that no more than 500 monk seals survive in the entire world. The Balearic government has studied the possibility of reintroducing monk seals to the islands.Local native plant species include holm oak (Quercus ilex) and various pine species. There are over 1,000 animal species; notable among them are the seabirds Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), various cormorants (Phalacrocorax), the common swift (Apus apus), and the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) as well as numerous reptiles, such as the endemic Lilford's wall lizard (Podarcis lilfordi) found on several of the islets of the archipelago. The islets are also home to one of Spain's few colonies of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni; other colonies are in Murcia and Almer\u00eda).Although the vegetation on the cliffs is sparse, it merits special interest as a habitat for endemic plant species such as the perennial herb Hippocrepis balearica, and Dianthus alpinus, whose Spanish-language names variously designate it as the \"cliff carnation\", \"forest carnation\" or \"Mediterranean carnation\". The cliff also provides a habitat for birds, especially raptors such as Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae) and osprey (Pandion haliaetus) as well as the world's only remaining insular cinereous vultures (black vulture, Aegypius monachus). Also worthy of mention, if only for gastronomical reasons, are two species of snail, Cornu aspersum and Helix pomatia.\nAmong the fungi, the autumn rains bring out the reproductive structures of the mushrooms. Of particular note is  Lactarius sangifluus, known locally as esclata-sang. This Lactarius is much appreciated for its singular flavor, and figures prominently in the local cuisine.The forest plants of the region can be divided into four groups:\n\nHerbaceous plants: the most common of these are nettles, fiddle dock (Rumex pulcher), and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare); heather(Calluna vulgaris) can also be found. Five endemic species of Limonium have evolved in the salty soils of Magalluf. In the garrigue of Santa Ponsa are several varieties of orchid (Orchis collina).\nShrubs: the most common shrub is the Mediterranean buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus), but there are also rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis),  thyme, a species of rock rose (Cistus albidus) several species of asparagus (Asparagus acutifolius, Asparagus albus, Asparagus officinalis), and common ivy (Hedera helix). Protected species include Mediterranean fan palm (Chamaerops humilis), myrtles, and Phoenicean juniper (Juniperus phoenicea).\nFerns: ferns of the Polypodium genus can be found in cooler or more shaded areas.\nTrees: the most common tree in the region's forests is Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis). These are plagued by a moth known as the pine processionary (Thaumetopoea pityocampa). A special brigade targets this moth, setting traps and destroying their nests. In the northern part of the province, although in lesser measure, there is holm oak (Quercus ilex), white poplar (Populus alba), narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), and strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMost of the people are either Spaniards from the mainland\u2014mainly from Andalusia\u2014or their descendants, who reached the island in the early 1960s, or they are foreign immigrants. According to the 2008 census, the municipality has a population of 50,777 inhabitants, of whom 25,548 were males and 25,229 were women ( 50.31% versus 49.69%).  The municipality has the second highest population in the Balearic Islands, second only to the capital, Palma de Mallorca.In 2017 the population was 49,063, including 14,822 foreigners (non-Spanish) registered with the town hall. The total population reached above 50,000 in 2008 but in 2015 began decreasing; in 2016 it had 49,580 people, including 15,623 registered foreigners.\n\n\n=== Population pyramid ===\nAnalysis of the population pyramid shows that:\n\n21% of the population is under the age of 20.\n32% of the population is aged 20\u201339 years.\n32% of the population is aged 40\u201359 years.\n15% of the population is 60 or older.This structure is typical of the modern demographic regime seen in much of Western Europe, with a population slowly aging as the birth rate diminishes.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe area contains many of Majorca's major tourism hotspots, with the localities of Magaluf (3,865), Santa Ponsa (8,188), El Toro (2,002), Paguera (3,400), Illetas (3,286), Portals Nous (2,395) and Palma Nova (5,975). It embraces six tourist zones with 60 kilometres of coastline, 27 beaches, 4 sport ports and 120.000 tourist units. The proximity of Palma with major road connections means that it can take as little as 15 minutes to reach the city centre. With massive tourism, estimated at 1.6 million visits per year and with a resident population that itself includes many expatriates, it is impossible to evaluate municipal income or expenditure as it relates only to the residents. What one can say is that Calvi\u00e0 appears to be one of the wealthiest municipalities in Europe, based on per capita public investment. In the early 1960s, Calvi\u00e0 began building a complete infrastructure for massive tourism, such as rapid construction of hotels. Later, more touristic features were added which included four professional golf courses (Club de Golf Poniente, Golf Sta Pon\u00e7a I, Golf Sta Pon\u00e7a II, Golf Sta Pon\u00e7a III and Golf Bendinat), water parks, a modern promenade called Paseig Calvi\u00e0. The 2004 World Chess Olympiad was held in Calvi\u00e0.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBisson, T. N. (1988). Hist\u00f2ria de la Corona d'Arag\u00f3 a l'Edat Mitjana (in Catalan).

          "We have visited during a big rain and storm in mid september 2017, as we have expected to have some place to play with our baby (18 months) and to find a place where to walk. Unfortunately, both the playground, and the passage are open, so a full load of rain was running into",
          "This is a very cool shopping for the days that we catch some rain. It is not huge but a decent size for an island. You will find all the best stores and you have a petrol station as well. This Shopping has Carrefour that for me is one of the best retails I know.",

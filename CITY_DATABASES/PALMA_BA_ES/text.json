        "wiki": "Bellver Castle (Catalan: Castell de Bellver) is a Gothic-style castle on a hill 3 km to the west of the center of Palma on the Island of Majorca, Balearic Islands, Spain. It was built in the 14th century for King James II of Majorca, and is one of the few circular castles in Europe. First serving as the residence of the Kings of Majorca, and afterward long used as a military prison throughout the 18th to mid-20th century, it is now under civilian control, being one of the main tourist attractions of the island, as well as the seat for the city's History Museum.\n\n\n== Origins and evolution ==\n\nThe castle's plan, a circular floor with round towers attached to it, seems to have been inspired by the upper complex of the Herodion, a 15 BCE hilltop palace in the West Bank, that was also circular and had a large principal tower and three minor towers as well. They are attached while the principal one is coupled to the complex by a high bridge over the surrounding moat.\nThe main part of the fortification was built by architect Pere Salv\u00e0, who also worked in the construction of the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, together with other master masons between 1300 and 1311 for King James II of Aragon and Majorca. Rock from the hill where the castle sits was used for the building, which has eventually led to the appearance of cracks.\nOnce the castle had been built, and following the introduction of artillery, the battlements on the top balconies and the barbican disappeared, being soon followed by those in every tower; loopholes were built instead.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe castle originally served as a residence for the Kings of Mallorca whenever they were not staying in mainland Europe, and was subsequently seldom used as a residence for viceroys during the 17th century. As a fortification, it suffered and successfully resisted two sieges during the Middle Ages; the first of them in 1343, during Peter IV of Aragon's campaign to reincorporate the Majorcan territories to the Crown of Aragon, and then again in 1391 during an anti-semitic peasant revolt. The castle has only fallen once in its history into enemy hands, in 1521 after an assault during the Majorcan seconds Revolt of the Brotherhoods.\nThe castle was usually governed by a Lord Warden. In 1408, King Martin I of Aragon gave the lordship of Bellver to the Charterhouse of Jesus of Nazareth in Valldemossa. Charles of Viana arrived in 1459 to take possession of both the island and the castle, as he had agreed with his father King John II of Aragon, even though finally the king did not grant the lordship or Bellver Castle.\nBeing an enclosed site, since the end of the 14th century it was used as a prison, firstly to hold Queen Violant of Mallorca, her children James and Isabella and other supporters of King James III of Mallorca after his death in the Battle of Llucmajor in 1349. During the War of Spanish Succession it was used to imprison first supporters of Phillippe d'Anjou, and after the Bourbon victory, Maulets (supporters of the Habsburg pretender). During the Spanish Independence War it was used to hold several prisoners captured at the battle of Bail\u00e9n and later, political prisoners, the most famous of these being the minister Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos (1802\u20131808) who first made a description of the castle and commissioned the first blueprints and drawings of it. The castle served from then on as a political prison, used to lock up several important supporters of the subsequent Habsburg pretendants to the Spanish Throne during the 19th century, and later notable republican and Catalanist leaders during the 20th century, including Alexandre Jaume, Member of the Parliament who first won the castle for the city, and Emili Darder, who was the mayor of the city, both subsequently shot.\n\n\n== Features ==\nHaving been founded as a seat for the royal court of James of Mallorca, its structure combines the needs of a palace with defensive elements. The most notable feature in its structure is its circular shape, unique in Spain. Both its surrounding wall and the inner yard are so-shaped, and so are the three minor towers and the donjon. A moat is found surrounding the castle and its donjon.\nThe circular inner yard must be highlighted. It has a well in the middle of it, which indicates there is a cistern underneath. The palace itself is structured as a two-story building around the central yard. All its dependencies face this yard through a gallery of gothic semi-circular arches.\n\n\n== Current uses ==\nIn 1931, the Spanish Second Republic gave the castle to the city of Palma, along with the forest surrounding it. It became a museum in 1932, being restored in 1976 to become the city's History museum. Thanks to the parking lot and road built next to the castle, it currently welcomes a great number of visitors. The main yard is the seat to many different public ceremonies, such as protocollary and cultural acts, and concerts. Due to its location and visibility from the sea or any other point of the city, it has become one the city's symbols.\nThe surrounding forest encloses the stables of the city's Mounted Peelers. There is also a chapel dedicated to Saint Alphonsis Rodriguez, built between 1879 and 1885.\nThe Sunday following Easter Sunday, the citizens gather at the forest and the castle for the celebration of the Diumenge de l'\u00c0ngel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirtual 3D-tour of del Castillo de Bellver\nIm\u00e1genes del Castillo de Bellver\nCastillo de Bellver en la p\u00e1gina del Ayuntamiento de Palma de Mallorca\nArt\u00edculo en MallorcaWeb (en mallorqu\u00edn)\nVista a\u00e9rea del castillo en la p\u00e1gina web del Ayuntamiento de Palma\nVista del Castillo de Bellver en Google Maps\nCastillo de Bellver en castillosnet.org",

        "wiki": "Mallorca (Catalan: [m\u0259\u02c8\u028e\u0254\u027ek\u0259], Spanish: [ma\u02c8\u028eo\u027eka]) or Majorca (English:  m\u0259-YOR-k\u0259, -\u2060JOR-) is the largest island in the Balearic Islands, which are part of Spain and located in the Mediterranean.  The local language, as on the rest of the Balearic Islands, is Catalan, which is co-official with Spanish.\nThe capital of the island, Palma, is also the capital of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. The Balearic Islands have been an autonomous region of Spain since 1983. There are two small islands off the coast of Mallorca: Cabrera (southeast of Palma) and Dragonera (west of Palma). The anthem of Mallorca is \"La Balanguera\".\nLike the other Balearic Islands of Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera, the island is an extremely popular holiday destination, particularly for tourists from Germany and the United Kingdom. The international airport, Palma de Mallorca Airport, is one of the busiest in Spain; it was used by 28 million passengers in 2017, with use increasing every year since 2012.The name derives from Classical Latin insula maior, \"larger island\". Later, in Medieval Latin, this became Maiorica, \"the larger one\", in comparison to Menorca, \"the smaller one\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric settlements ===\n\nLittle is recorded of the earliest inhabitants of the island. Burial chambers and traces of habitation from the Neolithic period (6000\u20134000 BC) have been discovered, particularly the prehistoric settlements called talaiots, or talayots. They raised Bronze Age megaliths as part of their Talaiotic culture. A non-exhaustive list is the following:\n\nCapocorb Vell (Llucmajor municipality)\nNecr\u00f2poli de Son Real (east of Can Picafort, Santa Margalida municipality)\nNovetiforme Alemany (Magaluffa, Calvi\u00e0, Miconio)\nPoblat Talai\u00f2tic de S'Illot (S'Illot, Sant Lloren\u00e7 des Cardassar municipality)\nPoblat Talai\u00f2tic de Son Forn\u00e9s (Montu\u00efri municipality)\nSa Canova de Morell (road to Col\u00f2nia de Sant Pere, Art\u00e0 municipality)\nSes Pa\u00efsses (Art\u00e0 municipality)\nSes Talaies de Can Jordi (Santany\u00ed municipality)\nS'Hospitalet Vell (road to Cales de Mallorca, Manacor municipality)\n\n\n=== Phoenicians, Romans, and Late Antiquity ===\n\nThe Phoenicians, a seafaring people from the Levant, arrived around the eighth century BC and established numerous colonies. The island eventually came under the control of Carthage in North Africa, which had become the principal Phoenician city. After the Second Punic War, Carthage lost all of its overseas possessions and the Romans took over.The island was occupied by the Romans in 123 BC under Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus. It flourished under Roman rule, during which time the towns of Pollentia (Alc\u00fadia), and Palmaria (Palma) were founded. In addition, the northern town of Bocchoris, dating back to pre-Roman times, was a federated city to Rome. The local economy was largely driven by olive cultivation, viticulture, and salt mining. Mallorcan soldiers were valued within the Roman legions for their skill with the sling.In 427, Gunderic and the Vandals captured the island. Geiseric, son of Gunderic, governed Mallorca and used it as his base to loot and plunder settlements around the Mediterranean  until Roman rule was restored in 465.\n\n\n=== Middle Age and Modern history ===\n\n\n==== Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages ====\nIn 534, Mallorca was recaptured by the Eastern Roman Empire, led by Apollinarius. Under Roman rule, Christianity thrived and numerous churches were built.\nFrom 707, the island was increasingly attacked by Muslim raiders from North Africa. Recurrent invasions led the islanders to ask Charlemagne for help.\n\n\n==== Moorish Mallorca ====\n\nIn 902, Issam al-Khawlani(es)(ca) (Arabic: \u0639\u0635\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u064a\u200e) conquered the Balearic Islands, and it became part of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba. The town of Palma was reshaped and expanded, and became known as Medina Mayurqa. Later on, with the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba at its height, the Moors improved agriculture with irrigation and developed local industries.\nThe caliphate was dismembered in 1015. Mallorca came under rule by the Taifa of D\u00e9nia, and from 1087 to 1114, was an independent Taifa. During that period, the island was visited by Ibn Hazm. However, an expedition of Pisans and Catalans in 1114\u201315, led by Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, overran the island, laying siege to Palma for eight months. After the city fell, the invaders retreated due to problems in their own lands. They were replaced by the Almoravides from North Africa, who ruled until 1176. The Almoravides were replaced by the Almohad dynasty until 1229. Ab\u00fa Yahya was the last Moorish leader of Mallorca.\n\n\n==== Medieval Mallorca ====\n\nIn the ensuing confusion and unrest, King James I of Aragon, also known as James the Conqueror, launched an invasion which landed at Santa Pon\u00e7a, Mallorca, on 8\u20139 September 1229 with 15,000 men and 1,500 horses. His forces entered the city of Medina Mayurqa on 31 December 1229. In 1230 he annexed the island to his Crown of Aragon under the name Regnum Maioricae.\n\n\n==== Modern era ====\n\nFrom 1479, the Crown of Aragon was in dynastic union with that of Castile. The Barbary corsairs of North Africa often attacked the Balearic Islands, and in response, the people built coastal watchtowers and fortified churches. In 1570, King Philip II of Spain and his advisors were considering complete evacuation of the Balearic islands.In the early 18th century, the War of the Spanish Succession resulted in the replacement of that dynastic union with a unified Spanish monarchy under the rule of the new Bourbon Dynasty. The last episode of the War of Spanish Succession was the conquest of the island of Mallorca. It took place on 2 July 1715 when the island capitulated to the arrival of a Bourbon fleet. In 1716, the Nueva Planta decrees made Mallorca part of the Spanish province of Baleares, roughly the same to present-day Illes Balears province and autonomous community.\n\n\n=== 20th century and today ===\nA Nationalist stronghold at the start of the Spanish Civil War, Mallorca was subjected to an amphibious landing, on 16 August 1936, aimed at driving the Nationalists from Mallorca and reclaiming the island for the Republic. Although the Republicans heavily outnumbered their opponents and managed to push 12 km (7.5 mi) inland, superior Nationalist air power, provided mainly by Fascist Italy as part of the Italian occupation of Majorca, forced the Republicans to retreat and to leave the island completely by 12 September. Those events became known as the Battle of Majorca.Since the 1950s, the advent of mass tourism has transformed the island into a destination for foreign visitors and attracted many service workers from mainland Spain. The boom in tourism caused Palma to grow significantly.\nIn the 21st century, urban redevelopment, under the so\u2011called Pla Mirall (English \"Mirror Plan\"), attracted groups of immigrant workers from outside the European Union, especially from Africa and South America.\n\n\n==== Archaeology ====\nA 3,200-year-old well-preserved Bronze Age sword was discovered by archaeologists under the leadership of Jaume Deya and Pablo Galera on the Mallorca Island in the Puigpunyent from the stone megaliths site called Talaiot. Specialists assumed that the weapon was made when the Talaiotic culture was in critical comedown. The sword will be on display at the nearby Majorca Museum.\n\n\n=== Palma ===\n\nThe capital of Mallorca, Palma, was founded as a Roman camp called Palmaria upon the remains of a Talaiotic settlement. The turbulent history of the city had it subject to several Vandal sackings during the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It was later reconquered by the Byzantines, established by the Moors (who called it Medina Mayurqa), and finally occupied by James I of Aragon. In 1983, Palma became the capital of the autonomous region of the Balearic Islands. Palma has a famous tourist attraction, the cathedral, Catedral-Bas\u00edlica de Santa Mar\u00eda de Mallorca, standing in the heart of the City looking out over the ocean.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate of Mallorca is a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa), with mild and stormy winters and hot, bright, dry summers. Precipitation in the Serra de Tramuntana is markedly higher. Summers are hot in the plains, and winters mild, getting colder in the Tramuntana range, where brief episodes of snow during the winter are not unusual. The two wettest months in Mallorca are October and December.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nMallorca and the other Balearic Islands are geologically an extension of the fold mountains of the Betic Cordillera of Andalusia. They consist primarily of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea during the Mesozoic era. These marine deposits have given rise to calcareous rocks which are often fossiliferous. The folding of the Betic Cordillera and Mallorcan ranges resulted from subduction of the African plate beneath the Eurasian plate with eventual collision. Tectonic movements led to different elevation and lowering zones in the late Tertiary period, which is why the connection to the mainland has been severed at the current sea level. \nThe limestones, which predominate throughout Mallorca, are readily water-soluble, and have given rise to extensive areas of karst. In addition to limestone, dolomitic rocks are mainly present in the mountainous regions of Mallorca; the Serra de Tramuntana and the Serres de Llevant. The Serres de Llevant also contain marl, the more rapid erosion of which has resulted in the lower elevations of the island's southeastern mountains. Marl is limestone with a high proportion of clay minerals. The eroded material was washed into the sea or deposited in the interior of the island of the Pla de Mallorca, bright marls in the north-east of the island and ferrous clays in the middle of Mallorca, which gives the soil its characteristic reddish colour.\n\n\n=== Regions ===\n\nMallorca is the largest island of Spain by area and second most populated (after Tenerife in the Canary Islands).\nMallorca has two mountainous regions, the Serra de Tramuntana and Serres de Llevant. Both are about 70 km (43 mi) in length and occupy the northwestern and eastern parts of the island respectively.\nThe highest peak on Mallorca is Puig Major at 1,445 m (4,741 ft) in the Serra de Tramuntana. As this is a military zone, the neighbouring peak at Puig de Massanella is the highest accessible peak at 1,364 m (4,475 ft). The northeast coast comprises two bays: the Badia de Pollen\u00e7a and the larger Badia d'Alc\u00fadia.\nThe northern coast is rugged and has many cliffs. The central zone, extending from Palma, is a generally flat, fertile plain known as Es Pla.  The island has a variety of caves both above and below the sea \u2013 two of the caves, the above sea level Coves dels Hams and the Coves del Drach, also contain underground lakes and are open to tours.  Both are located near the eastern coastal town of Porto Cristo.  Small uninhabited islands lie off the southern and western coasts; the Cabrera Archipelago is administratively grouped with Mallorca (in the municipality of Palma), while Dragonara is administratively included in the municipality of Andratx. Other notable areas include the Alfabia Mountains, Es Cornadors and Cap de Formentor.\n\n\n=== World Heritage Site ===\nThe Cultural Landscape of the Serra de Tramuntana was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.\n\n\n=== Municipalities ===\n\nThe island (including the small offshore islands of Cabrera and Dragonera) is administratively divided into 53 municipalities. The areas and populations of the municipalities (according to the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, Spain) are:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria ===\n\nArchduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria (Catalan: Arxiduc Llu\u00eds Salvador) was the architect of tourism in the Balearic Islands. He first arrived on the island in 1867, travelling under his title \"Count of Neuendorf\". He later settled on Mallorca, buying up wild areas of land in order to preserve and enjoy them. Nowadays, a number of trekking routes are named after him.Ludwig Salvator loved the island of Mallorca. He became fluent in Catalan, carried out research into the island's flora and fauna, history, and culture to produce his main work, Die Balearen, a comprehensive collection of books about the Balearic Islands, consisting of 7 volumes. It took him 22 years to complete.\n\n\n=== Chopin in Mallorca ===\n\nThe Polish composer and pianist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, together with French writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (pseudonym: George Sand), resided in Valldemossa in the winter of 1838\u201339. Apparently, Chopin's health had already deteriorated and his doctor recommended that he go to the Balearic Islands to recuperate, where he still spent a rather miserable winter.Nonetheless, his time in Mallorca was a productive period for Chopin. He managed to finish the Preludes, Op. 28, that he started writing in 1835. He was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.\n\n\n=== Literature and painting ===\nFrench writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (pseudonym: George Sand), at that time in a relationship with Chopin, described her stay in Mallorca in A Winter in Majorca, published in 1855. Other famous writers used Mallorca as the setting for their works: While on the island, the Nicaraguan poet Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo started writing the novel El oro de Mallorca, and wrote several poems, such as La isla de oro. Many of the works of Baltasar Porcel take place in Mallorca. Ira Levin set part of his dystopian novel This Perfect Day in Mallorca, making the island a centre of resistance in a world otherwise dominated by a computer.\nAgatha Christie visited the island in the early 20th century and stayed in Palma and Port de Pollen\u00e7a. She would later write the book Problem at Pollensa Bay and Other Stories, a collection of short stories, of which the first one takes place in Port de Pollen\u00e7a, starring Parker Pyne.\nJorge Luis Borges visited Mallorca twice, accompanied by his family. He published his poems La estrella (1920) and Catedral (1921) in the regional magazine Baleares. The latter poem shows his admiration for the monumental Cathedral of Palma.Nobel prize winner Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela came to Mallorca in 1954, visiting Pollen\u00e7a, and then moving to Palma, where he settled permanently. In 1956, Cela founded the magazine Papeles de Son Armadans. He is also credited as founder of Alfaguara.\n\nThe English poet Robert Graves moved to Mallorca with his family in 1946. The house is now a museum. He died in 1985 and his body was buried in the small churchyard on a hill at Dei\u00e0.\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\nThe Ball dels Cossiers is the island's traditional dance. It is believed to have been imported from Catalonia in the 13th or 14th century, after the Aragonese conquest of the island under King Jaime I. In the dance, three pairs of dancers, who are typically male, defend a \"Lady,\" who is played by a man or a woman, from a demon or devil. Another Mallorcan dance is Correfoc, an elaborate festival of dance and pyrotechnics that is also of Catalan origin. The island's folk music strongly resembles that of Catalonia, and is centered around traditional instruments like the xeremies (bagpipe) and guitarra de canya (a reed or bone xylophone-like instrument suspended from the neck). While folk music is still played and enjoyed by many on the island, a number of other musical traditions have become popular in Mallorca in the 21st century, including electronic dance music, classical music, and jazz, all of which have annual festivals on the island.\n\n\n=== Art ===\nJoan Mir\u00f3, a Spanish painter, sculptor, and ceramicist, had close ties to the island throughout his life, he married Pilar Juncosa in Palma in 1929 and settled permanently in Mallorca in 1954. The Fundaci\u00f3 Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3 in Mallorca has a collection of his works. Es Baluard in Palma is a museum of modern and contemporary art which exhibits the work of Balearic artists and artists related to the Balearic Islands.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe Evolution Mallorca International Film Festival is the fastest growing Mediterranean film festival and has occurred annually every November since 2011, attracting filmmakers, producers, and directors globally. It is hosted at the Teatro Principal in Palma de Mallorca\n\n\n=== Mallorcan cartographic school ===\n\nMallorca has a long history of seafaring. The Majorcan cartographic school or the \"Catalan school\" refers to a collection of cartographers, cosmographers, and navigational instrument makers that flourished in Mallorca and partly in mainland Catalonia in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. Mallorcan cosmographers and cartographers developed breakthroughs in cartographic techniques, namely the \"normal portolan chart\", which was fine-tuned for navigational use and the plotting by compass of navigational routes, prerequisites for the discovery of the New World.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nIn 2005, there were over 2,400 restaurants on the island of Mallorca according to the Mallorcan Tourist Board, ranging from small bars to full restaurants. Olives and almonds are typical of the Mallorcan diet. Among the foods that are typical from Mallorca are sobrassada, arr\u00f2s brut (saffron rice cooked with chicken, pork and vegetables), and the sweet pastry ensa\u00efmada. Also Pa amb oli is a popular dish.Herbs de Majorca is a herbal liqueur.\n\n\n== Language ==\nThe main language spoken on the island is Catalan. The two official languages of Mallorca are Catalan and Spanish. The local dialect of Catalan spoken in the island is Mallorqu\u00ed, with slightly different variants in most villages. Education is bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, with some teaching of English.In 2012, the then-governing People's Party announced its intention to end preferential treatment for Catalan in the island's schools to bring parity to the two languages of the island. It was said that this could lead Mallorcan Catalan to become extinct in the fairly near future, as it was being used in a situation of diglossia in favour of the Spanish language. As of 2016, with the most recent election in May 2015 sweeping a pro-Catalan party and president into power, the Popular Party's policy of trilingualism (Catal\u00e1n, Spanish, English) has been dismantled, making this outcome unlikely.\n\n\n== Population ==\nMallorca is the most populous island in the Balearic Islands and the second most populous island in Spain, after Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, being also the fourth most populous island in the Mediterranean after Sicily, Sardinia and Cyprus. It had an officially estimated population of 896,038 inhabitants at the start of 2019.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSince the 1950s, Mallorca has become a major tourist destination, and the tourism business has become the main source of revenue for the island. With thousands of rooms available Mallorca's economy is largely dependent on its tourism industry. Holiday makers are attracted by the large number of beaches, warm weather, and high-quality tourist amenities. Due to the climate and diversity in roads, Majorca attracts a lot of cyclists.\nThe island's popularity as a tourist destination has steadily grown since the 1950s, with many artists and academics choosing to visit and live on the island. Visitors to Mallorca continued to increase with holiday makers in the 1970s approaching 3 million a year. In 2010 over 6 million visitors came to Mallorca. In 2013, Mallorca was visited by nearly 9.5 million tourists, and the Balearic Islands as a whole reached 13 million tourists. In 2017, ten million tourists visited the island. The rapid growth of the tourism industry has led to some locals protesting the effects of mass tourism on the island.Mallorca has been jokingly referred to as the 17th Federal State of Germany, due to the high number of German tourists.Attempts to build illegally caused a scandal in 2006 in Port Andratx that the newspaper El Pa\u00eds named \"caso Andratx\". A main reason for illegal building permits, corruption and black market construction is that communities have few ways to finance themselves other than through permits. The former mayor was incarcerated in 2009 after being prosecuted for taking bribes to permit illegal house building.\n\n\n=== Top 10 arrivals by nationality ===\nData from Institute of Statistics of Balearic Islands\n\n\n== Politics and government ==\n\n\n=== Regional government ===\nThe Balearic Islands, of which Mallorca forms part, are one of the autonomous communities of Spain. As a whole, they are currently governed by the Balearic Islands Socialist Party (PSIB-PSOE), with Francina Armengol as their President.\n\n\n=== Insular government ===\nThe specific government institution for the island is the Insular Council of Mallorca, created in 1978.It is responsible for culture, roads, railways (see Serveis Ferroviaris de Mallorca) and municipal administration. As of July 2019, Catalina Cladera (PSIB-PSOE) serves as president of the Insular Council.\n\n\n== Mallorcans ==\n\nSome of the earliest famous Mallorcans lived on the island before its reconquest from the Moors.

In La Almudaina, the monarchs of the Kingdom of Majorca, the Aragonese monarchs and Spanish monarchs had their court successively. Philip II of Spain destined the \"Tinell\" to Real Audiencia and installed in the rest of the building the General Captaincy of the Islands.\nThe current structure of La Almudaina corresponds to the one built in the 14th century with its different spaces; the palaces of the King and of the Queen, the chapel of Saint Anne or the baths, are the most outstanding.\nIts decoration presents two environments, on the ground floor the medieval style is recreated with works from the 15th to the 20th centuries. The upper floor, used for the celebration of official acts of the Royal Family, is decorated with objects and furniture from other Royal Sites of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.\nThe current castle, of Roman origin, is a modification of the Muslim alc\u00e1zar begun in 1281, it lasted until 1343, during the reigns of James II of Majorca , son of James I of Aragon, Sancho of Majorca and James III of Majorca. La Almudaina was the seat of the prosperous Majorcan kingdom of 14th century, during the reigns of the aforementioned monarch and his successors Sancho of Majorca and James III of Majorca, until passing to the Crown of Aragon with Peter IV in 1349.\nDuring the first half of 16th century the upper floor was built by order of the king Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.\nIn the same way as in the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, is the official summer residence of the King, as well as other members of the Spanish Royal Family, who also reside in the Palace of Marivent and in the Palacio de la Zarzuela in Madrid.\n\n\n== External links ==\nPatrimonio Nacional | Royal Palace of La Almudaina\nAlmudaina Palace, NorthSouthGuides Royal Almudaina Palace, Mallorca",

        "wiki": "Palma, unofficially known as Palma de Mallorca ( or , Catalan: [\u02c8palm\u0259], Spanish: [\u02c8palma]), is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands in Spain. It is situated on the south coast of Mallorca on the Bay of Palma. The Cabrera Archipelago, though widely separated from Palma proper, is administratively considered part of the municipality. As of 2018, Palma Airport serves over 29 million passengers per year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPalma was founded as a Roman camp upon the remains of a Talaiotic settlement. The city was subjected to several Vandal raids during the fall of the Western Roman Empire, then reconquered by the Byzantine Empire, then colonised by the Moors (who called it Medina Mayurqa) and, in the 13th century, by James I of Aragon.\n\n\n=== Roman period ===\nAfter the conquest of Mallorca, the city was loosely incorporated into the province of Tarraconensis by 123 BC; the Romans founded two new cities: Palma on the south of the island, and Pollentia in the northeast \u2013 on the site of a Phoenician settlement. Whilst Pollentia acted as a port to Roman cities on the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, Palma was the port used for destinations in Africa, such as Carthage, and Hispania, such as Saguntum, Gades and Carthago Nova. Though present-day Palma has no significant remains from this period, occasional archaeological finds are made in city centre excavations.  For example, the remains of the Roman Wall can be seen at Can Bordils, the Municipal Archive, and below it, at the Maim\u00f3 ben Faraig Center.\n\n\n=== Byzantine period ===\nThough the period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Muslim conquest is not well understood (due to lack of documents), there is clear evidence of a Byzantine presence in the city, as indicated by mosaics found in the oldest parts of the Cathedral, which was in early medieval times part of a paleo-Christian temple.\n\n\n=== Muslim period ===\nBetween 902 and 1229, the city was under Islamic control. It remained the capital of the island and it was known as Medina Mayurqa, which in Arabic means \"City of Majorca\".\n\n\n==== Under the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba ====\nThe arrival of the Moors in the Balearic Islands occurred at the beginning of the 8th century. During this period, the population developed an economy based on self-sufficiency and piracy, and even showed evidence of a relative hierarchy. The dominant groups took advantage of the Byzantine withdrawal due to Islamic expansion across the Mediterranean, to reinforce their domination upon the rest of the population, thus ensuring their power and the gradual abandonment of Imperial political structures.\nIn 707, a Muslim fleet, under the command of Abd Allgaht ibn Musa, son of the governor of Ifriqiya, Musa ibn Nusayr, stopped off at the island. It appears that Abd Allah convinced the powers of the city to accept a peace treaty. This treaty was granted in exchange for a tax, respect for social, economic and political structures to the communities that subscribed to it, as well as the continuity of their religious beliefs.\nAfter 707, the city was inhabited by Christians who were nominally in allegiance to the sovereignty of the Umayyad Caliphate, yet who, de facto, enjoyed absolute autonomy. The city, being in Mallorca, constituted an enclave between western Christian and Islamic territories, and this attracted and encouraged increased levels of piracy in the surrounding waters. For wide sectors of the city's population, the sacking of ships (whether Muslim or Christian) which passed through Balearic waters was a source of riches over the next fifteen decades. Eventually, continued piracy in the region lead to a retaliation by Al-Andalus which launched a naval fleet against the city and the whole of the Islands.\nThe Islands were defended by the emperor Charlemagne in 799 from a Muslim pirate incursion.\nIn 848 (maybe 849), four years after the first Viking incursions had sacked the whole island, an attack from C\u00f3rdoba forced the authorities to ratify the treaty to which the city had submitted in 707. As the city still occupied an eccentric position regarding the commerce network established by the Moors in the western Mediterranean, the enclave was not immediately incorporated into Al-Andalus.\nWhile the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba reinforced its influence upon the Mediterranean, Al-Andalus increased its interest in the city. The consequence of this was the substitution of the submission treaty for the effective incorporation of the islands to the Islamic state. A squad under the command of Isam al-Jawlani took advantage of instability caused by several Viking incursions and disembarked in Mallorca, and after destroying any resistance, incorporated Mallorca, with Palma as its capital, to the C\u00f3rdoban state.\nThe incorporation of the city into the Emirate set the basis for a new society. Commerce and manufacturing developed in a manner that was previously unknown. This caused considerable demographic growth, thereby establishing Medina Mayurqa as one of the major ports for trading goods in and out of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba.\n\n\n==== D\u00e9nia\u2014Balearic taifa (1015\u20131087) ====\n\nThe Umayyad regime, despite its administrative centralisation, mercenary army and struggle to gain wider social support, could neither harmonise the various ethnic groups inside al-Andalus nor dissolve the old tribes which still organised sporadic ethnic fighting. During the 11th century, the Caliphate's control waned considerably. Provinces broke free from the central Cordoban administration, and became effectively sovereign states \u2014 taifas \u2014 under the same governors that had been named by the last Umayyad Caliphs. According to their origin, these \"taifas\" can be grouped under three broad categories: people of Arab, Berber or Slavic origin.\nPalma was part of the taifa of D\u00e9nia. The founder of this state was a client of the Al-Mansur family, Muyahid ibn Yusuf ibn Ali, who could profit from the progressive crumbling of the Caliphate's superstructure to gain control over the province of D\u00e9nia. Subsequently, Muyahid organised a campaign throughout the Balearic Islands to consolidate the district and incorporated it into their \"taifa\" in early 1015.\nDuring the following years Palma became the main port from where attacks on Christian vessels and coasts could be launched. Palma was the base from where a campaign against Sardinia was launched between 1016 and 1017, which caused the Pisans and Genoese forces to intervene. Later, this intervention set the basis for Italian mercantile penetration of the city.\nThe Denian dominion lasted until 1087, a period during which the city, as well as the rest of the islands, was relatively peaceful. Their supremacy at sea was still not rivalled by the Italian merchant republics, thus there were few external threats.\n\n\n==== Balearic Taifa (1087\u20131115) and Western Mediterranean ====\nThe Banu Hud conquest of D\u00e9nia and its incorporation to the Eastern district of the taifa of Zaragoza meant the destruction of the legacy of Muyahid. The islands were freed from mainland dominion and briefly enjoyed independence, during which Medina Mayurqa was the capital.\nThe economy during this period depended on both agriculture and piracy. In the latter 11th century, Christian commercial powers took the initiative at sea against the Muslims. After centuries of fighting defensively in the face of Islamic pressure, Italians, Catalans and Occitans took offensive action. Consequently, the benefits of piracy diminished causing severe economic stress on the city.\nThe clearest proof of the new ruling relation of forces, from 1090, is the Crusade organised by the most important mercantile cities of the Christian states against the Islands. This effort was destined to finally eradicate Muslim piracy mainly based in Palma and surrounding havens. In 1115, Palma was sacked and later abandoned by an expedition commanded by Ramon Berenguer III the Great, count of Barcelona and Provence, which was composed of Catalans, Pisans and other Italians, and soldiers from Provence, Corsica, and Sardinia, in a struggle to end Almoravid control.\nAfter this, the Islands became part of the Almoravid dynasty. The inglobement of all the taifa to a larger state helped to re-establish a balance along the frontier that separated western Christian states from the Muslim world.\n\n\n==== Period of the Banu Ganiya (1157\u20131203) ====\nThe situation changed in the mid-12th century, when the Almoravids were displaced from al-Andalus and western Maghreb by the Almohad. Almoravid dominions, from 1157 on, were restricted to the Balearic Islands, with Palma again acting as the capital, governed by Muhammad ibn Ganiya. Massive arrival of al-Andalus refugees contributed to reinforce the positions of the last Almoravid legitimatists, the Banu Ganiya, who, conscious of their weakness in the Western Mediterranean context, started to get closer to the growing powers represented by Italian maritime republics. Genoa and Pisans obtained in this period their first commercial concessions in the city and the rest of the islands.\nThe Banu Ganiya, taking advantage of the great loss suffered by Abu Yuqub Yusuf in the Siege of Santar\u00e9m, attacked Ifriqiya, where the Almohad dominion had not been consolidated yet, in the same year. However, this attack was repelled and the Almohad authorities encouraged anti-Almoravid revolts in the Islands. The city was captured by the Almohads in 1203.\n\n\n=== Christian reconquest and late Middle Ages ===\n\nOn 31 December 1229, after three months of siege, the city was reconquered by James I of Aragon and was renamed Ciutat de Mallorca (Mallorca City). In addition to being kept as capital of the Kingdom of Majorca, it was given a municipality that comprised the whole island. The governing arm was the University of the City and Kingdom of Majorca.\nAfter the death of James I of Aragon, Palma became joint capital of the Kingdom of Majorca, together with Perpignan. His son, James II of Majorca, championed the construction of statues and monuments in the city: Bellver Castle, the churches of St. Francesc and St. Domingo, reformed the Palace of Almudaina and began the construction of the Cathedral of Majorca.\n\nIn 1391, anti-Jewish riots broke out. The Jewish community of Inca was completely wiped out, as were those of S\u00f3ller, Sineu, and Alcudia. In spite of the governor's prohibition on leaving the island, many Jews fled to North Africa. The remaining Jews were forced to convert under threat of death.Abraham Cresques was a 14th-century Jewish cartographer of the Majorcan cartographic school from Palma; Cresques is credited with the authorship of the famous Catalan Atlas.\nThe river that cut through the city gave rise to two distinct areas within the city; the \"Upper town\" and \"Lower town\", depending upon which side of the river one was situated.\n\nThe city's advantageous geographical location allowed it extensive commerce with Catalonia, Valencia, Provence, the Maghreb, the Italian republics and the dominions of the Great Turk, which heralded a golden age for the city.\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, the Rebellion of the Brotherhoods (a peasant uprising against Charles V's administration) and the frequent attack of Turkish and Berber pirates caused a reduction of commercial activities and a huge inversion in defensive structures. As a consequence, the city entered a period of decadence that would last till the end of the 17th century.\n\n\n=== 17th to 19th centuries ===\n\nThe 17th century was characterised by the division of the city into two sides or gangs, named Canamunts and Canavalls (from Majorcan Catalan \"the ones from the upper/lower side\"), with severe social and economic repercussions. During this period, the port became a haven for pirates. During the last quarter of the century, the Inquisition continued its persecution of the city's Jews, locally called xuetes.\nThe fall of Barcelona in 1714 meant the end of the War of the Spanish Succession and the defeat and destruction of the Crown of Aragon, and this was reflected on the Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip V of Spain in 1715. These occupation decrees changed the government of the island and separated it from the municipality's government of Palma, which became the official city name. By the end of the 19th century, the name  Palma de Mallorca was generalised in written Spanish, although it is still colloquially named Ciutat (\"city\") in Catalan. In the 18th century Charles III of Spain removed interdiction of commerce with Spanish colonies in America and the port and commercial activity of the city grew once again.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Palma became a refuge for many who had exiled themselves from the Napoleonic occupation of Catalonia and Valencia; during this period freedom flourished, until the absolutist restoration. With the establishment of contemporary Spanish state administrative organization, Palma became the capital of the new Balearic Islands province in the 1833 territorial division of Spain. The French occupation of Algeria in the 19th century ended the fear of Maghrebi attacks in Majorca, which favoured the expansion of new maritime routes, and consequently, the economic growth of the city.\n\n\n=== Modern period ===\n\nSince the advent of mass tourism in the 1950s, the city has been transformed into a tourist destination and has attracted many workers from mainland Spain. This has contributed to a huge change in the city's traditions, its language, and its economic power.\nThe boom in tourism has caused Palma to grow significantly. In 1960, Mallorca received 500,000 visitors, in 1997 it received more than 6,739,700. In 2001 more than 19,200,000 people passed through Son Sant Joan airport near Palma, with an additional 1.5 million coming by sea.\nIn the 21st century, urban redevelopment, by the so-called Pla Mirall (English \"Mirror Plan\"), had attracted groups of immigrant workers from outside the European Union, especially from Africa and South America.\nMore than half of the population works in tourism, approximately 80%, therefore being the main economic portal of Palma. Tourism has affected the rapid economic growth of Palma, making the island of Mallorca wealthier compared to other regions in Spain.\nThe second economic portal of Palma is agriculture. Main exports of Palma's agriculture are, almonds, oranges, lemons and olives. The island is also gifted with a wide variety of natural resources, such as mines of copper, lead and marble.The city also has several surrounding neighborhood communities including Establiments, Nord, Son Espanyol, Ces Cases Noves, and Sa Creu Vermella.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPalma is a major city and seaport located in the southwest of Mallorca, a western mediterranean island belonging to the Balearic Islands archipelago. The land area of the city is about 21.355 square kilometres (8.245 sq mi) with an altitude of 13 metres (43 feet) above sea level.\nThe city center of Palma is located north of the homonymous bay (Badia de Palma in the local Catalan language). The area that extends eastwards is mostly a flat fertile plain known as Es Pla. To the north and west, the city borders the Serra de Tramuntana, the island's major mountain range and a Unesco World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs of the 2009 census, the population of the city of Palma proper was 401,270, and the population of the entire urban area was 550,000, making it the twelfth largest urban area of Spain. By the start of 2019 the population of the city had risen to 416,065. Almost half of the total population of Mallorca lives in Palma.\nAs of 2017 over 60,000 non-Spanish foreigners registered with the town hall lived in Palma; the registered foreign population from 2016 to 2017 declined by 832, the numerically highest decline in the Balearics.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPalma has a Mediterranean climate, the climate classification named after the sea surrounding the city. There is a significant maritime influence to the mild winters, but summers are warmed by the surrounding continental landmasses. These warm up the offshore sea surface temperatures compared to in an ocean and as a result the small confines of Mallorca are still able to build up and sustain heat in spite of being on an island. There is vast seasonal lag, especially in late summer courtesy of the sea water peaking in temperatures long after the summer solstice.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya ===\nThe Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya is the transport hub of Palma. The Estaci\u00f3 Intermodal caters for buses and trains (the latter controlled by TIB). The two old buildings are home to the tourist information centre and several caf\u00e9s sit either side of the two large escalators which lead into the Estaci\u00f3, which sits underneath a large and popular park. On the lawns are several glass boxes, which let in light and ventilation to the station below ground. There are also train-themed playing structures, each one shaped like a train carriage and named after towns along the line of the Ferrocarril de S\u00f3ller, a railway dating back to 1911 which has its Palma Station right next to the park. Just down the street from here a new bus station is under construction. At the centre of the plaza is a statue of James I, Conquistador of Majorca.\n\n\n=== Cathedral area ===\n\nPalma is famous for La Seu, its vast cathedral built on a previous mosque which was built atop an original Christian church. Although construction of the present Cathedral began in 1229, it did not finish until 1601. Local architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed was drafted in to restore the building in 1901. The Parc de la Mar (Park of the Sea) lies just south, overlooked by the great building which sits above it on the city's stone foundations. Between the two are the town walls.\n\n\n=== The Rocks ===\nThe rocks located a short walk from the cathedral are a place of calm and tranquility.\n\n\n=== Old city ===\n\nThe Old City (in the south-east area of Palma behind the cathedral) is a maze of streets clearly hinting at an Arab past. With the exception of a few streets and squares which allow traffic and are populated with tourists most of the time, the walkways of this city quarter are fairly narrow, quiet streets, surrounded by a diverse range of interesting buildings, the architecture of which is comparable to cities such as Florence. The majority are private houses, some of which are open to the public as discreet museums or galleries. The Old City is also home to the Ajuntament (or Town Hall), the Convent of the Cathedral and the Banys \u00c0rabs.\n\n\n==== Banys \u00c0rabs ====\n\nThe Banys \u00c0rabs, or Arab Baths, one of the few remnants of Palma's Moorish past , are accessed via the quiet Ca'n Serra street near the Convent of the Cathedral, and include the lush gardens of Ca'n Fontirroig, home to Sardinian warblers, house sparrows, cacti, palm trees and a wide range of flowers and ferns. The small two-roomed brick building that once housed the baths is of Byzantine origin, dating back to the 11th century and possibly once part of the home of a Muslim nobleman. The bathroom has a cupola with five oculi which let in dazzling light. The twelve columns holding up the small room were pillaged from an earlier Roman construction. The floor over the hypocaust has been worn away by people standing in the centre, mainly to photograph the entrance and the garden beyond it. The whole room is in a rather dilapidated condition. The other room is a brick cube with a small model of the baths as they once were in the corner.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nNotable people who were born in the city include the following individuals.\n\n\u00c1lex Abrines, basketball player for the Oklahoma City Thunder\nMarco Asensio, footballer for Real Madrid\nConcha Buika, singer\nRudy Fern\u00e1ndez, basketball player for Real Madrid\nRamon Llull, philosopher and writer\nJorge Lorenzo, motorcyclist and five time MotoGP champion\nJoan Mir, motorcyclist and moto 3 champion\nGuillermo Pont, footballer\nLuis Salom, motorcyclist\nAgust\u00ed Villaronga, filmmaker\nRossy de Palma, actress\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nFootball is the most popular sport on the island, led by the Palma-based Segunda Divisi\u00f3n club Real Mallorca, who play at the Estadi de Son Moix, and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B club CD Atl\u00e9tico Baleares.\nBasketball is also a popular sport. Palma's top team is CB Bah\u00eda San Agust\u00edn, which plays its home games at the 5,076 capacity Palau Municipal d'Esports Son Moix.\nBecause of its maritime location all sea sports have also a big presence in Palma. Maybe the most important sporting event in the city is the Ciutat de Palma Prizes.\nRoad cycling is very popular in Mallorca. An international race for professional cyclists, the Vuelta a Mallorca, is held in February, the first day of which consists of a circuit race around the streets of Palma. The city is also home to the Palma Arena, a multi-platinum venue featuring a velodrome. The arena also hosted the Battle of Surfaces tennis event.\nIn June 2016, the city of Palma participated in the First World Company Sports Games which included five days of culture, sport and inclusivity within the community of Mallorca as a whole. It was operated through the World Federation Company Sport and was promoted for both local people and tourists to come together in the city. It became a large business venture by offering packages including accommodations close to the events and additional tourism information for future events.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPalma de Mallorca Metro\nMajorca rail network\nPalma de Mallorca Airport\nThe city bus system, which includes a loop line through the historic centre, is run by the EMT (See external link below).\nThere is also a bus system run by the TIB. This includes routes to and from the municipalities Calvi\u00e0 and Palma.\nIn the City of Palma there is a fleet of 1246 taxis. All equipped with air conditioning and most of them have a radiotelephone station, with four existing companies: Taxis Palma Radio, Radio-Taxi Ciutat, Taxi Tel\u00e9fono and Taxis adapted for users with reduced mobility. Until the change of colour regulated through the Municipal Decree No. 19985 of 15 October 1999, the taxis of Palma for 50 years had been of the characteristic black and ivory colours. Currently they are white.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nPalma de Mallorca is twinned with:\n\n Naples, Italy\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDuchess of Palma de Mallorca\nEdwin Lewis Snyder, \"Spain's Magic Island\", The Architect and Engineer, 110:10, 37\u201345, August 1932\nList of municipalities in Balearic Islands\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPalma sightseeing guide\nPalma de Mallorca\u00b4s city council\nOfficial Website for Tourism in Mallorca",

        "wiki": "Palma, unofficially known as Palma de Mallorca ( or , Catalan: [\u02c8palm\u0259], Spanish: [\u02c8palma]), is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands in Spain. It is situated on the south coast of Mallorca on the Bay of Palma. The Cabrera Archipelago, though widely separated from Palma proper, is administratively considered part of the municipality. As of 2018, Palma Airport serves over 29 million passengers per year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPalma was founded as a Roman camp upon the remains of a Talaiotic settlement. The city was subjected to several Vandal raids during the fall of the Western Roman Empire, then reconquered by the Byzantine Empire, then colonised by the Moors (who called it Medina Mayurqa) and, in the 13th century, by James I of Aragon.\n\n\n=== Roman period ===\nAfter the conquest of Mallorca, the city was loosely incorporated into the province of Tarraconensis by 123 BC; the Romans founded two new cities: Palma on the south of the island, and Pollentia in the northeast \u2013 on the site of a Phoenician settlement. Whilst Pollentia acted as a port to Roman cities on the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, Palma was the port used for destinations in Africa, such as Carthage, and Hispania, such as Saguntum, Gades and Carthago Nova. Though present-day Palma has no significant remains from this period, occasional archaeological finds are made in city centre excavations.  For example, the remains of the Roman Wall can be seen at Can Bordils, the Municipal Archive, and below it, at the Maim\u00f3 ben Faraig Center.\n\n\n=== Byzantine period ===\nThough the period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Muslim conquest is not well understood (due to lack of documents), there is clear evidence of a Byzantine presence in the city, as indicated by mosaics found in the oldest parts of the Cathedral, which was in early medieval times part of a paleo-Christian temple.\n\n\n=== Muslim period ===\nBetween 902 and 1229, the city was under Islamic control. It remained the capital of the island and it was known as Medina Mayurqa, which in Arabic means \"City of Majorca\".\n\n\n==== Under the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba ====\nThe arrival of the Moors in the Balearic Islands occurred at the beginning of the 8th century. During this period, the population developed an economy based on self-sufficiency and piracy, and even showed evidence of a relative hierarchy. The dominant groups took advantage of the Byzantine withdrawal due to Islamic expansion across the Mediterranean, to reinforce their domination upon the rest of the population, thus ensuring their power and the gradual abandonment of Imperial political structures.\nIn 707, a Muslim fleet, under the command of Abd Allgaht ibn Musa, son of the governor of Ifriqiya, Musa ibn Nusayr, stopped off at the island. It appears that Abd Allah convinced the powers of the city to accept a peace treaty. This treaty was granted in exchange for a tax, respect for social, economic and political structures to the communities that subscribed to it, as well as the continuity of their religious beliefs.\nAfter 707, the city was inhabited by Christians who were nominally in allegiance to the sovereignty of the Umayyad Caliphate, yet who, de facto, enjoyed absolute autonomy. The city, being in Mallorca, constituted an enclave between western Christian and Islamic territories, and this attracted and encouraged increased levels of piracy in the surrounding waters. For wide sectors of the city's population, the sacking of ships (whether Muslim or Christian) which passed through Balearic waters was a source of riches over the next fifteen decades. Eventually, continued piracy in the region lead to a retaliation by Al-Andalus which launched a naval fleet against the city and the whole of the Islands.\nThe Islands were defended by the emperor Charlemagne in 799 from a Muslim pirate incursion.\nIn 848 (maybe 849), four years after the first Viking incursions had sacked the whole island, an attack from C\u00f3rdoba forced the authorities to ratify the treaty to which the city had submitted in 707. As the city still occupied an eccentric position regarding the commerce network established by the Moors in the western Mediterranean, the enclave was not immediately incorporated into Al-Andalus.\nWhile the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba reinforced its influence upon the Mediterranean, Al-Andalus increased its interest in the city. The consequence of this was the substitution of the submission treaty for the effective incorporation of the islands to the Islamic state. A squad under the command of Isam al-Jawlani took advantage of instability caused by several Viking incursions and disembarked in Mallorca, and after destroying any resistance, incorporated Mallorca, with Palma as its capital, to the C\u00f3rdoban state.\nThe incorporation of the city into the Emirate set the basis for a new society. Commerce and manufacturing developed in a manner that was previously unknown. This caused considerable demographic growth, thereby establishing Medina Mayurqa as one of the major ports for trading goods in and out of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba.\n\n\n==== D\u00e9nia\u2014Balearic taifa (1015\u20131087) ====\n\nThe Umayyad regime, despite its administrative centralisation, mercenary army and struggle to gain wider social support, could neither harmonise the various ethnic groups inside al-Andalus nor dissolve the old tribes which still organised sporadic ethnic fighting.

In 1960, Mallorca received 500,000 visitors, in 1997 it received more than 6,739,700. In 2001 more than 19,200,000 people passed through Son Sant Joan airport near Palma, with an additional 1.5 million coming by sea.\nIn the 21st century, urban redevelopment, by the so-called Pla Mirall (English \"Mirror Plan\"), had attracted groups of immigrant workers from outside the European Union, especially from Africa and South America.\nMore than half of the population works in tourism, approximately 80%, therefore being the main economic portal of Palma. Tourism has affected the rapid economic growth of Palma, making the island of Mallorca wealthier compared to other regions in Spain.\nThe second economic portal of Palma is agriculture. Main exports of Palma's agriculture are, almonds, oranges, lemons and olives. The island is also gifted with a wide variety of natural resources, such as mines of copper, lead and marble.The city also has several surrounding neighborhood communities including Establiments, Nord, Son Espanyol, Ces Cases Noves, and Sa Creu Vermella.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPalma is a major city and seaport located in the southwest of Mallorca, a western mediterranean island belonging to the Balearic Islands archipelago. The land area of the city is about 21.355 square kilometres (8.245 sq mi) with an altitude of 13 metres (43 feet) above sea level.\nThe city center of Palma is located north of the homonymous bay (Badia de Palma in the local Catalan language). The area that extends eastwards is mostly a flat fertile plain known as Es Pla. To the north and west, the city borders the Serra de Tramuntana, the island's major mountain range and a Unesco World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs of the 2009 census, the population of the city of Palma proper was 401,270, and the population of the entire urban area was 550,000, making it the twelfth largest urban area of Spain. By the start of 2019 the population of the city had risen to 416,065. Almost half of the total population of Mallorca lives in Palma.\nAs of 2017 over 60,000 non-Spanish foreigners registered with the town hall lived in Palma; the registered foreign population from 2016 to 2017 declined by 832, the numerically highest decline in the Balearics.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPalma has a Mediterranean climate, the climate classification named after the sea surrounding the city. There is a significant maritime influence to the mild winters, but summers are warmed by the surrounding continental landmasses. These warm up the offshore sea surface temperatures compared to in an ocean and as a result the small confines of Mallorca are still able to build up and sustain heat in spite of being on an island. There is vast seasonal lag, especially in late summer courtesy of the sea water peaking in temperatures long after the summer solstice.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya ===\nThe Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya is the transport hub of Palma. The Estaci\u00f3 Intermodal caters for buses and trains (the latter controlled by TIB). The two old buildings are home to the tourist information centre and several caf\u00e9s sit either side of the two large escalators which lead into the Estaci\u00f3, which sits underneath a large and popular park. On the lawns are several glass boxes, which let in light and ventilation to the station below ground. There are also train-themed playing structures, each one shaped like a train carriage and named after towns along the line of the Ferrocarril de S\u00f3ller, a railway dating back to 1911 which has its Palma Station right next to the park. Just down the street from here a new bus station is under construction. At the centre of the plaza is a statue of James I, Conquistador of Majorca.\n\n\n=== Cathedral area ===\n\nPalma is famous for La Seu, its vast cathedral built on a previous mosque which was built atop an original Christian church. Although construction of the present Cathedral began in 1229, it did not finish until 1601. Local architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed was drafted in to restore the building in 1901. The Parc de la Mar (Park of the Sea) lies just south, overlooked by the great building which sits above it on the city's stone foundations. Between the two are the town walls.\n\n\n=== The Rocks ===\nThe rocks located a short walk from the cathedral are a place of calm and tranquility.\n\n\n=== Old city ===\n\nThe Old City (in the south-east area of Palma behind the cathedral) is a maze of streets clearly hinting at an Arab past. With the exception of a few streets and squares which allow traffic and are populated with tourists most of the time, the walkways of this city quarter are fairly narrow, quiet streets, surrounded by a diverse range of interesting buildings, the architecture of which is comparable to cities such as Florence. The majority are private houses, some of which are open to the public as discreet museums or galleries. The Old City is also home to the Ajuntament (or Town Hall), the Convent of the Cathedral and the Banys \u00c0rabs.\n\n\n==== Banys \u00c0rabs ====\n\nThe Banys \u00c0rabs, or Arab Baths, one of the few remnants of Palma's Moorish past , are accessed via the quiet Ca'n Serra street near the Convent of the Cathedral, and include the lush gardens of Ca'n Fontirroig, home to Sardinian warblers, house sparrows, cacti, palm trees and a wide range of flowers and ferns. The small two-roomed brick building that once housed the baths is of Byzantine origin, dating back to the 11th century and possibly once part of the home of a Muslim nobleman. The bathroom has a cupola with five oculi which let in dazzling light. The twelve columns holding up the small room were pillaged from an earlier Roman construction. The floor over the hypocaust has been worn away by people standing in the centre, mainly to photograph the entrance and the garden beyond it. The whole room is in a rather dilapidated condition. The other room is a brick cube with a small model of the baths as they once were in the corner.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nNotable people who were born in the city include the following individuals.\n\n\u00c1lex Abrines, basketball player for the Oklahoma City Thunder\nMarco Asensio, footballer for Real Madrid\nConcha Buika, singer\nRudy Fern\u00e1ndez, basketball player for Real Madrid\nRamon Llull, philosopher and writer\nJorge Lorenzo, motorcyclist and five time MotoGP champion\nJoan Mir, motorcyclist and moto 3 champion\nGuillermo Pont, footballer\nLuis Salom, motorcyclist\nAgust\u00ed Villaronga, filmmaker\nRossy de Palma, actress\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nFootball is the most popular sport on the island, led by the Palma-based Segunda Divisi\u00f3n club Real Mallorca, who play at the Estadi de Son Moix, and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B club CD Atl\u00e9tico Baleares.\nBasketball is also a popular sport. Palma's top team is CB Bah\u00eda San Agust\u00edn, which plays its home games at the 5,076 capacity Palau Municipal d'Esports Son Moix.\nBecause of its maritime location all sea sports have also a big presence in Palma. Maybe the most important sporting event in the city is the Ciutat de Palma Prizes.\nRoad cycling is very popular in Mallorca. An international race for professional cyclists, the Vuelta a Mallorca, is held in February, the first day of which consists of a circuit race around the streets of Palma. The city is also home to the Palma Arena, a multi-platinum venue featuring a velodrome. The arena also hosted the Battle of Surfaces tennis event.\nIn June 2016, the city of Palma participated in the First World Company Sports Games which included five days of culture, sport and inclusivity within the community of Mallorca as a whole. It was operated through the World Federation Company Sport and was promoted for both local people and tourists to come together in the city. It became a large business venture by offering packages including accommodations close to the events and additional tourism information for future events.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPalma de Mallorca Metro\nMajorca rail network\nPalma de Mallorca Airport\nThe city bus system, which includes a loop line through the historic centre, is run by the EMT (See external link below).\nThere is also a bus system run by the TIB. This includes routes to and from the municipalities Calvi\u00e0 and Palma.\nIn the City of Palma there is a fleet of 1246 taxis. All equipped with air conditioning and most of them have a radiotelephone station, with four existing companies: Taxis Palma Radio, Radio-Taxi Ciutat, Taxi Tel\u00e9fono and Taxis adapted for users with reduced mobility. Until the change of colour regulated through the Municipal Decree No. 19985 of 15 October 1999, the taxis of Palma for 50 years had been of the characteristic black and ivory colours. Currently they are white.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nPalma de Mallorca is twinned with:\n\n Naples, Italy\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDuchess of Palma de Mallorca\nEdwin Lewis Snyder, \"Spain's Magic Island\", The Architect and Engineer, 110:10, 37\u201345, August 1932\nList of municipalities in Balearic Islands\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPalma sightseeing guide\nPalma de Mallorca\u00b4s city council\nOfficial Website for Tourism in Mallorca",

        "wiki": "Es Baluard Museu d\u2019Art Modern i Contemporani de Palma, located in Palma and inaugurated on 30 January 2004, has a reserve of more than 700 works of art linked to artists from the Balearic Islands and/or of international renown.\nAs well as conserving and publicising its collection, Es Baluard runs a programme of temporary exhibitions, cultural activities and educational and training cycles. The main artists and movements related to the Balearic Islands form a body which took shape after the initial presentation of the collection which was made in the year the museum opened. \nSince then, the original nucleus of the museum\u2019s reserves \u2013 made up of donations and the deposit of works by the Art Serra Foundation (Fundaci\u00f3 d\u2019Art Serra), as well as works deposited by Palma City Council (Ajuntament de Palma), the Council of Mallorca (Consell de Mallorca) and the Government of the Balearic Islands (Govern de les Illes Balears) \u2013 has been added to as a result of the introduction of further works that have been acquired, donated and temporarily ceded by artists, collectors and entities.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe main building was designed in 2003 by Llu\u00eds Garc\u00eda-Ruiz, Jaume Garc\u00eda-Ruiz, Vicente Tom\u00e1s and Angel S\u00e1nchez Cantalejo. It has a total surface area of 5,027 m\u00b2, of which 2,500 are used as exhibition spaces. It is divided into three storeys which are connected to the outside, to the city walls and to each other by means of ramps, skylights and large interior balconies, in an attempt to reflect an indoor street concept.\n\n\n== The collection ==\n\nThe Collection of Es Baluard Museu d\u2019Art Modern i Contemporani de Palma includes works of art by the most significant artists and movements that have converged in the past and continue to converge in the Balearic Islands, from the late 19th century to the present.\nIt begins with the works of pictorial modernism and the renovation of the landscape genre in Spain, showcasing the importance of Mallorca in its development. Joaquim Mir, Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol, Hermen Anglada-Camarasa, Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla, Antoni Gelabert and Tito Cittadini are some of the key artists from this period, placed between the late 19th century and the 1930s; alongside them are two female creators, Pilar Montaner de Sureda and Norah Borges, who were associated to the artistic and literary trends of the day.The early years of the 20th century, meanwhile, bear witness to the emergence in Europe of the different avant-garde movements which rebelled against the hegemony of western figurative art, a state of cultural crisis that was heightened after World War One and which would continue in the 1940s and \u201850s, advocating a questioning of the artistic object. The artists represented include Mar\u00eda Blanchard, Wifredo Lam, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Roberto Matta, Joan Mir\u00f3, Robert Motherwell, Jorge Oteiza, Picasso, Juli Ramis and Antoni T\u00e0pies, among others.\nNew figuration, pop, minimalism or conceptual art are just some of the tendencies that arose from the \u2018sixties onwards, a period in which social and cultural ensued and which would later be called \u201cpostmodernism\u201d. Erwin Bechtold, Joan Brossa, Err\u00f3, Juan Genov\u00e9s, Hans Hartung, Rebecca Horn, Antoni Miralda, Pablo Palazuelo, Antonio Saura and Rafael Tur Costa, for example, precede the new generation of recognised painters: Miquel Barcel\u00f3, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Broto, Miguel \u00c1ngel Campano, Maria Carbonero, Ramon Canet, Luis Gordillo, Anselm Kiefer and Juan Usl\u00e9.\nA wide diversity of languages shapes today\u2019s artistic panorama, with creators such as Lida Abdul, Marina Abramovi\u0107, Pilar Albarrac\u00edn, Christian Boltanski, Daniel Canogar, Toni Catany, \u00d1aco Fabr\u00e9, M\u00f3nica Fuster, Alberto Garc\u00eda-Alix, N\u00faria Marqu\u00e9s, Jorge Mayet, Joan Morey, Michael Najjar, Marina N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Bernard\u00ed Roig, Francisco Ruiz de Infante, Amparo Sard, Antoni Soc\u00edas and Nicholas Woods as examples of this evolution of contemporary artistic practice.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Es Baluard museum website",

It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits, its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the Province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people, making it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid, and Milan. It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s, and bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of which is 512 metres (1,680 feet) high.\nFounded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After merging with the Kingdom of Aragon, Barcelona continued to be an important city in the Crown of Aragon as an economic and administrative centre of this Crown and the capital of the Principality of Catalonia. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed and Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Since 1450, it is home to the University of Barcelona, widely considered the most prestigious university in Spain. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions and also many international sport tournaments.\nBarcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe, as well as the main biotech hub in Spain. As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port, an international airport, Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport, which handles over 50 million passengers per year, an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe name Barcelona comes from the ancient Iberian Ba\u0155keno, attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as , in ancient Greek sources as \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd, Barkin\u1e53n; and in Latin as Barcino, Barcilonum and Barcenona.Some older sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC, but there is no evidence that Barcelona was ever a Carthaginian settlement, or that its name in antiquity, Barcino, had any connection with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as Barchinona, Bar\u00e7alona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona.\nInternationally, Barcelona's name is wrongly abbreviated to 'Bar\u00e7a'. However, this name refers only to FC Barcelona, the football club. The common abbreviated form used by locals is Barna.\nAnother common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport.\nThe city is also referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan, and Ciudad Condal in Spanish (i.e. Comital City or City of Counts), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history ===\nThe origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been \nfound, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC. The founding of Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes the founding of the city to the mythological Hercules. The second legend attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city Barcino after his family in the 3rd century BC, but there is no historical or linguistic evidence that this is true.\n\n\n=== Roman Barcelona ===\nIn about 15 BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred on the \"Mons Taber\", a little hill near the contemporary city hall (Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume). Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia, or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino or Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour. It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens. The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive.\n\nImportant Roman vestiges are displayed in Pla\u00e7a del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the Barri G\u00f2tic (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral. The cathedral, known very formally by the long name of Catedral Bas\u00edlica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called La Seu, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan. It is said to have been founded in 343.\n\n\n=== Medieval Barcelona ===\nThe city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Arabs in the early 8th century, it was conquered in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian \"Hispanic March\" (Marca Hispanica), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.\nThe Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include all of Catalonia, although on 6 July 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor. The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved. In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century.\nBarcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia. It initially fed from eastern and balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.The forging of a dynastic link between the Crowns of Aragon and Castile marked the beginning of Barcelona's decline. The Bank of Barcelona (Taula de canvi), probably the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).\n\n\n=== Barcelona under the Spanish monarchy ===\nThe marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 united the two royal lines. Madrid became the centre of political power whilst the colonisation of the Americas reduced the financial importance (at least in relative terms) of Mediterranean trade. Barcelona was a centre of Catalan separatism, including the Catalan Revolt (1640\u201352) against Philip IV of Spain. The great plague of 1650\u20131654 halved the city's population.\n\nIn the 18th century, a fortress was built at Montju\u00efc that overlooked the harbour. In 1794, this fortress was used by the French astronomer Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9 M\u00e9chain for observations relating to a survey stretching to Dunkirk that provided the official basis of the measurement of a metre. The definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialisation saw the fortunes of the province improve.\n\n\n=== The Spanish Civil War and the Franco period ===\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivised by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'\u00e9tat was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished, and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.\n\n\n=== Late twentieth century ===\nIn 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and two miles of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\n\nThe death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratisation throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government. Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (\u221216.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla in the city, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nBarcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5 km (3 mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the Bes\u00f2s river to the north. This plain covers an area of 170 km2 (66 sq mi), of which 101 km2 (39.0 sq mi) are occupied by the city itself. It is 120 kilometres (75 miles) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France.\nTibidabo, 512 m (1,680 ft) high, offers striking views over the city and is topped by the 288.4 m (946.2 ft) Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanised, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (267 metres or 876 feet), Putget (181 metres or 594 feet) and Rovira (261 metres or 856 feet). The escarpment of Montju\u00efc (173 metres or 568 feet), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montju\u00efc Castle, a fortress built in the 17\u201318th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montju\u00efc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens.\nThe city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adri\u00e0 de Bes\u00f2s to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Barcelona has a maritime Mediterranean climate (Csa), with mild winters and warm to hot summers, while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterised by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as \"Portuguese\" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) found in inland areas such as the Po Valley (e.g. Milan), whose rainfall is greater in summer, a feature of continental climates.\nIts average annual temperature is 21.2 \u00b0C (70.2 \u00b0F) during the day and 15.1 \u00b0C (59.2 \u00b0F) at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F). In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to 18 \u00b0C (54 to 64 \u00b0F) during the day, 6 to 12 \u00b0C (43 to 54 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F). In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31 \u00b0C (81 to 88 \u00b0F) during the day, about 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F). Generally, the summer or \"holiday\" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months \u2013 April and November \u2013 are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of 18\u201319 \u00b0C (64\u201366 \u00b0F) during the day and 11\u201313 \u00b0C (52\u201355 \u00b0F) at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent.\nBarcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (\u2265 1 mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September\u2013November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June\u2013August), with a secondary winter minimum (February\u2013March). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10 hours of sunshine a day) in July.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to Barcelona's City Council, Barcelona's population as of 1 January 2016 was 1,608,746 people, on a land area of 101.4 km2 (39 sq mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 square kilometres (246 square miles) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000. It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it. Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system.\nIn 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000 people, which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialised parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 with 1,906,998 people, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 people, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.\n\n\n=== Population density ===\n\nNote: This text is entirely based on the municipal statistical database provided by the city council.\nBarcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.\nIn the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and Montju\u00efc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 square kilometres (20 square miles) at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.\nOf the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square km. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.\n\n\n=== Age structure ===\nIn 1900 almost a third (28.9 percent) were children (aged younger than 14 years), In 2017 this age group constituted only 12.7; those aged between 15 and 24 years in 2017 were 9 percent; those aged between 25 and 44 years a 30.6 percent. In contrast, in 2017 the aged between 45 and 64 years formed the 56.9% of all Barcelonans; while in 1900 the aged 65 and older were just the 6.5 percent, in 2017 reached a 21.5.\n\n\n=== Migration ===\nIn 2016 about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% respectively 3.9%.The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506). Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.There exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines. There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nMost of the inhabitants state they are Roman Catholic (208 churches). In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCat\u00f3lica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic. This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians. The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined. In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).The province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion. A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain). In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim, which makes 5.6% of total population.\nThe city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city. There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations), and Eastern Orthodox.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== General information ===\n\nThe Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to \u20ac28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177 billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009. Barcelona city had a very high GDP of \u20ac80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat. Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of 2009.Barcelona was the 24th most \"livable city\" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine Monocle. Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on Innovation Cities\u2122 Global Index. At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.\nBorsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.\nBarcelona was recognised as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential, by FDi Magazine in their bi-annual rankings.\n\n\n=== Trade fair and exhibitions ===\n\nDrawing upon its tradition of creative art and craftsmanship, Barcelona is known for its award-winning industrial design. It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona \u2013 the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.\nAn important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona's Port Vell harbour.\nThe city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nBarcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011. By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors. With its Rambles, Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.Barcelona as internationally renowned a tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world, mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016 including 35 five star hotels, and developed tourist infrastructure.\nDue to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. For this reason, most travel guides recommend that visitors take precautions to ensure their possessions' safety, especially inside the metro premises. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of health security and personal safety, mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider.While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report, the city is \"overrun [by] hordes of tourists\". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included \"Tourists go home\", \"Barcelona is not for sale\" and \"We will not be driven out\". By then, number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated \u20ac30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.A May 2017 article in England's The Telegraph newspaper included Barcelona among the Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, \"We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop [like Venice]\". To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb with a \u20ac30,000. The mayor has suggested an additional tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors. One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an \"overtourism crisis\" in several major European cities. \"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success.\", he said. \"Managing tourism more responsibly can help\", Francis later told a journalist, \"but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that\".\n\n\n=== Manufacturing sector ===\nIndustry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region, with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production. The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.Barcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, Art\u00e9s de Arcos, Balandr\u00e1s, Baradat-Esteve, Bisc\u00fater, J. Castro, Cl\u00faa, David, Delf\u00edn, D\u00edaz y Grill\u00f3, Ebro trucks, Edis, Elizalde, Autom\u00f3viles Espa\u00f1a, Eucort, Fenix, F\u00e1brica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga, F\u00e1brica Espa\u00f1ola de Autom\u00f3viles Hebe, Hispano-Suiza, Hurac\u00e1n Motors, Talleres Hereter, Junior SL, Kapi, La Cuadra, M.A., Autom\u00f3viles Matas, Motores y Motos, Nacional Custals, National Pescara, Nacional RG, Nacional Rubi, Nacional Sitjes, Autom\u00f3viles Nike, Orix, Otro Ford, Partia, Pegaso, PTV, Ricart, Ricart-Espa\u00f1a, Industrias Salvador, Siata Espa\u00f1ola, Stevenson, Romagosa y Compa\u00f1\u00eda, Garaje Storm, Talleres Hereter, Trimak, Autom\u00f3viles Victoria, Manufacturas Mec\u00e1nicas Aleu.Today, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city. The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nThe traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably Gaudi Home.Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organisers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought \u20ac100 m to the city in just three days.Since 2009, The Brandery, an urban fashion show, has been held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milano and before Berlin in 2015.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nAs the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the Barcelon\u00e8s comarca (district).\nBarcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006. According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administrates the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level. This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions. It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.\n\nThe Comissi\u00f3 de Govern (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors. The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions. The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary. The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the Gu\u00e0rdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.\n\nThe executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.The seat of the city council is on the Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.\nAfter 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nSince 1987, the city has been divided into 10 administrative districts (districtes in Catalan, distritos in Spanish):\n\nCiutat Vella\nEixample\nSants-Montju\u00efc\nLes Corts\nSarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi\nGr\u00e0cia\nHorta-Guinard\u00f3\nNou Barris\nSant Andreu\nSant Mart\u00edThe districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nBarcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these is the University of Barcelona (established in 1450), a world-renowned research and teaching institution with campuses around the city. It is one of the degree-awarding bodies of the Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals (IBEI), a prestigious interuniversity postgraduate institution for international affairs located in the center of the city. Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and the newer Pompeu Fabra University, and, in the private sector the EADA Business School founded in 1957, became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona.\n\nThe city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as escoles concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (escoles privades).\nThe language of instruction at public schools and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or escola concertada offer International Baccalaureate programmes.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBarcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network. It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nBarcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simf\u00f2nica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue. It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente.\nThe major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers.\nYearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the S\u00f3nar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nEl Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya, La Vanguardia and Ara are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, Ara only in Catalan) while Sport and El Mundo Deportivo (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as Ara and El Punt Avui (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions like El Pais (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and El Mundo (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like 20 minutos and Qu\u00e8 (all bilingual).\nBarcelona's oldest and main online newspaper VilaWeb is also the oldest one in Europe (with Catalan and English editions).\nSeveral major FM stations include Catalunya R\u00e0dio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV stations, BTV, owned by city council. The headquarters of Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are located in Sant Joan Desp\u00ed, in Barcelona's metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nBarcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.\n\nFC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the second richest in the world. It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals. It is the only male football team in the world to win six trophies in a calendar year (in 2009). FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national and/or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona.\n\nBarcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornell\u00e0-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal Narc\u00eds Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000 (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500.\nBarcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.\n\nSeveral road running competitions are organised year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Ingl\u00e9s in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la Merc\u00e8, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and the San Silvestre. There's also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes 85 kilometres (53 miles) through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat God\u00f3, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each Christmas, a swimming race across the port is organised. Near Barcelona, in Montmel\u00f3, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.\n\n\n=== Squatter's Movement ===\nBarcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists. Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services. The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organise various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu. Police have repeatedly tried to shut down the squatters movement with waves of evictions and raids, but the movement is still going strong.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nBarcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about 17 km (11 mi) from the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend. It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009.\nSome low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about 90 km (56 mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77 km (48 mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150 km (93 mi) to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nThe Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013. The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south.\n\nThe Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a most important Mediterranean turnaround base. In 2013, 3,6 million of pleasure cruises passengers used services of the Port of Barcelona.The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums \u2013 Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.\n\n\n=== National and international rail ===\n\nBarcelona is a major hub for RENFE, the Spanish state railway network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona.\nRENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of 310 km/h (193 mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the Madrid\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseilles and Toulouse, through Perpignan\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.\n\n\n=== Metro and regional rail ===\n\nBarcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolit\u00e0 (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.The Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines.\nIn addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nThe city's two modern tram systems, Trambaix and Trambes\u00f2s, are operated by TRAMMET. A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.\n\n\n=== Funicular and cable car ===\nBarcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montju\u00efc up Montju\u00efc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montju\u00efc Cable Car, which serves Montju\u00efc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebasti\u00e0 over the port.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nBuses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as Aerob\u00fas, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.\nThe Estaci\u00f3 del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.\n\n\n=== Taxi ===\n\nBarcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut Metropolit\u00e0 del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.On 22 March 2007, Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station. The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.\n\n\n=== Roads and highways ===\n\nBarcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60.\nThe city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.\nThe city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Gl\u00f2ries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe Barri G\u00f2tic (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan modernista architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015, completion is planned for 2026.Barcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolise modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms \"less is more\" and \"God is in the details.\" The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.\nBarcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture, the first (and as of 2015, only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect.\n\n\n=== World Heritage Sites ===\nBarcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:\n\n\n=== Historic buildings and monuments ===\n\nMinor basilica of Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, the symbol of Barcelona.\nPalau de la M\u00fasica Catalana and Hospital de Sant Pau, designed by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, included in the UNESCO Heritage List in 1997.\nWorks by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, including Park G\u00fcell, Palau G\u00fcell, Casa Mil\u00e0 (La Pedrera), Casa Vicens, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (Nativity fa\u00e7ade and crypt), Casa Batll\u00f3, crypt in Church of Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell. The first three works were inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1984. The other four were added as extensions to the site in 2005.\nThe Cathedral of the Holy Cross and St. Eulalia (Gothic)\nGothic basilica of Santa Maria del Mar\nGothic basilica of Santa Maria del Pi\nRomanesque church of Sant Pau del Camp\nPalau Reial Major, medieval residence of the sovereign Counts of Barcelona, later Kings of Aragon\nThe Royal Shipyard (gothic)\nMonastery of Pedralbes (gothic)\nThe Columbus Monument\nThe Arc de Triomf, a triumphal arch built for entrance to 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition.\nExpiatory church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on the summit of Tibidabo.\nThe Historic Building of the University of Barcelona\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nBarcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, Picasso Museum, and Fundaci\u00f3 Antoni T\u00e0pies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundaci\u00f3 Vila Casas.\nSeveral museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of \"Museo Martorell de Arqueolog\u00eda y Ciencias Naturales\" (Spanish for \"Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences\"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the Laboratori de Natura, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too.\nThe FC Barcelona Museum has been the most visited museum in the city of Barcelona, with 1,506,022 visitors in 2013.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nBarcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest. They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres). The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year, with a proportion of 18.1 square metres (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.Of Barcelona's parks, Montju\u00efc is the largest, with 203 ha located on the mountain of the same name. It is followed by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old military citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and several museums); 31 ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the Guinard\u00f3 Park (19 ha or 47.0 acres), Park G\u00fcell (designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed; 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal Mar Park (13.3 ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central Park (13.2 ha or 32.6 acres), Can Drag\u00f3 Sports Park and Poblenou Park (both 11.9 ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10 ha or 22.5 acres), named after the garden maze it contains. There are also several smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aig\u00fces (2 ha or 4.9 acres). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona. Also, within the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride.\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\n\nBarcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to National Geographic and Discovery Channel. Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5 kilometres (2.8 miles) of coastline. Sant Sebasti\u00e0, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100 m (3,610 ft) in length, are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona.\nThe Olympic Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Ic\u00e0ria, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material.

        "wiki": "Joan Mir\u00f3 i Ferr\u00e0 ( mi-ROH, also US:  mee-ROH, Catalan: [\u0292u\u02c8am mi\u02c8\u027eo j f\u0259\u02c8ra]; 20 April 1893 \u2013 25 December 1983) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, and ceramicist born in Barcelona. A museum dedicated to his work, the Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, was established in his native city of Barcelona in 1975, and another, the Fundaci\u00f3 Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3, was established in his adoptive city of Palma de Mallorca in 1981.\nEarning international acclaim, his work has been interpreted as  Surrealism but with a personal style, sometimes also veering into Fauvism and Expressionism. He was notable for his interest in the unconscious or the subconscious mind, reflected in his re-creation of the childlike. His difficult to classify works also had a manifestation of Catalan pride. In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Mir\u00f3 expressed contempt for conventional painting methods as a way of supporting bourgeois society, and declared an \"assassination of painting\" in favour of upsetting the visual elements of established painting.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn into a family of a goldsmith and a watchmaker, Mir\u00f3 grew up in the Barri G\u00f2tic neighborhood of Barcelona. The Mir\u00f3 surname indicates possible Jewish roots (in terms of marrano or converso Iberian Jews who converted to Christianity). His father was Miquel Mir\u00f3 Adzerias and his mother was Dolors Ferr\u00e0. He began drawing classes at the age of seven at a private school at Carrer del Regomir 13, a medieval mansion. To the dismay of his father, he enrolled at the fine art academy at La Llotja in 1907. He studied at the Cercle Art\u00edstic de Sant Lluc and he had his first solo show in 1918 at the Galeries Dalmau, where his work was ridiculed and defaced. Inspired by Fauve and Cubist exhibitions in Barcelona and abroad, Mir\u00f3 was drawn towards the arts community that was gathering in Montparnasse and in 1920 moved to Paris, but continued to spend his summers in Catalonia.\n\n\n=== Career ===\n\nMir\u00f3 initially went to business school as well as art school. He began his working career as a clerk when he was a teenager, although he abandoned the business world completely for art after suffering a nervous breakdown. His early art, like that of the similarly influenced Fauves and Cubists, was inspired by Vincent van Gogh and Paul C\u00e9zanne. The resemblance of Mir\u00f3's work to that of the intermediate generation of the avant-garde has led scholars to dub this period his Catalan Fauvist period.A few years after Mir\u00f3's 1918 Barcelona solo exhibition, he settled in Paris where he finished a number of paintings that he had begun on his parents' summer home and farm in Mont-roig del Camp. One such painting, The Farm, showed a transition to a more individual style of painting and certain nationalistic qualities. Ernest Hemingway, who later purchased the piece, compared the artistic accomplishment to James Joyce's Ulysses and described it by saying, \"It has in it all that you feel about Spain when you are there and all that you feel when you are away and cannot go there. No one else has been able to paint these two very opposing things.\" Mir\u00f3 annually returned to Mont-roig and developed a symbolism and nationalism that would stick with him throughout his career. Two of Mir\u00f3's first works classified as Surrealist, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and The Tilled Field, employ the symbolic language that was to dominate the art of the next decade.Josep Dalmau arranged Mir\u00f3's first Parisian solo exhibition, at Galerie la Licorne in 1921.In 1924, Mir\u00f3 joined the Surrealist group. The already symbolic and poetic nature of Mir\u00f3's work, as well as the dualities and contradictions inherent to it, fit well within the context of dream-like automatism espoused by the group. Much of Mir\u00f3's work lost the cluttered chaotic lack of focus that had defined his work thus far, and he experimented with collage and the process of painting within his work so as to reject the framing that traditional painting provided. This antagonistic attitude towards painting manifested itself when Mir\u00f3 referred to his work in 1924 ambiguously as \"x\" in a letter to poet friend Michel Leiris. The paintings that came out of this period were eventually dubbed Mir\u00f3's dream paintings.\nMir\u00f3 did not completely abandon subject matter, though. Despite the Surrealist automatic techniques that he employed extensively in the 1920s, sketches show that his work was often the result of a methodical process. Mir\u00f3's work rarely dipped into non-objectivity, maintaining a symbolic, schematic language. This was perhaps most prominent in the repeated Head of a Catalan Peasant series of 1924 to 1925. In 1926, he collaborated with Max Ernst on designs for ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev. With Mir\u00f3's help, Ernst pioneered the technique of grattage, in which one trowels pigment onto a canvas then scrapes it away.Mir\u00f3 returned to a more representational form of painting with The Dutch Interiors of 1928. Crafted after works by Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh and Jan Steen seen as postcard reproductions, the paintings reveal the influence of a trip to Holland taken by the artist. These paintings share more in common with Tilled Field or Harlequin's Carnival than with the minimalistic dream paintings produced a few years earlier.\nMir\u00f3 married Pilar Juncosa in Palma (Majorca) on 12 October 1929. Their daughter, Mar\u00eda Dolores Mir\u00f3, was born on 17 July 1930. In 1931, Pierre Matisse opened an art gallery in New York City. The Pierre Matisse Gallery (which existed until Matisse's death in 1989) became an influential part of the Modern art movement in America. From the outset Matisse represented Joan Mir\u00f3 and introduced his work to the United States market by frequently exhibiting Mir\u00f3's work in New York.Until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Mir\u00f3 habitually returned to Spain in the summers. Once the war began, he was unable to return home. Unlike many of his surrealist contemporaries, Mir\u00f3 had previously preferred to stay away from explicitly political commentary in his work. Though a sense of (Catalan) nationalism pervaded his earliest surreal landscapes and Head of a Catalan Peasant, it was not until Spain's Republican government commissioned him to paint the mural The Reaper, for the Spanish Republican Pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exhibition, that Mir\u00f3's work took on a politically charged meaning.In 1939, with Germany's invasion of France looming, Mir\u00f3 relocated to Varengeville in Normandy, and on 20 May of the following year, as Germans invaded Paris, he narrowly fled to Spain (now controlled by Francisco Franco) for the duration of the Vichy Regime's rule. In Varengeville, Palma, and Mont-roig, between 1940 and 1941, Mir\u00f3 created the twenty-three gouache series Constellations. Revolving around celestial symbolism, Constellations earned the artist praise from Andr\u00e9 Breton, who seventeen years later wrote a series of poems, named after and inspired by Mir\u00f3's series. Features of this work revealed a shifting focus to the subjects of women, birds, and the moon, which would dominate his iconography for much of the rest of his career.\nShuzo Takiguchi published the first monograph on Mir\u00f3 in 1940. In 1948\u201349 Mir\u00f3  lived in Barcelona and made frequent visits to Paris to work on printing techniques at the Mourlot Studios and the Atelier Lacouri\u00e8re. He developed a close relationship with Fernand Mourlot and that resulted in the production of over one thousand different lithographic editions.\nIn 1959, Andr\u00e9 Breton asked Mir\u00f3 to represent Spain in The Homage to Surrealism exhibition alongside Enrique T\u00e1bara, Salvador Dal\u00ed, and Eugenio Granell. Mir\u00f3 created a series of sculptures and ceramics for the garden of the Maeght Foundation in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, which was completed in 1964.\nIn 1974, Mir\u00f3 created a tapestry for the World Trade Center in New York City together with the Catalan artist Josep Royo. He had initially refused to do a tapestry, then he learned the craft from Royo and the two artists produced several works together.  His World Trade Center Tapestry was displayed at the building and was one of the most expensive works of art lost during the September 11 attacks.In 1977, Mir\u00f3 and Royo finished a tapestry to be exhibited in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.In 1981, Mir\u00f3's The Sun, the Moon and One Star\u2014later renamed Mir\u00f3's Chicago\u2014was unveiled. This large, mixed media sculpture is situated outdoors in the downtown Loop area of Chicago, across the street from another large public sculpture, the Chicago Picasso.  Mir\u00f3 had created a bronze model of The Sun, the Moon and One Star in 1967. The maquette now resides in the Milwaukee Art Museum.\n\n\n=== Late life and death ===\nIn 1979 Mir\u00f3 received a doctorate honoris causa from the University of Barcelona. The artist, who suffered from heart failure, died in his home in Palma (Majorca) on 25 December 1983. He was later interred in the Montju\u00efc Cemetery in Barcelona.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Early fauvist ===\nHis early modernist works include Portrait of Vincent Nubiola (1917), Siurana (the path), Nord-Sud (1917) and Painting of Toledo. These works show the influence of C\u00e9zanne, and fill the canvas with a colorful surface and a more painterly treatment than the hard-edge style of most of his later works. In Nord-Sud, the literary newspaper of that name appears in the still life, a compositional device common in cubist compositions, but also a reference to the literary and avant-garde interests of the painter.\n\n\n=== Magical realism ===\nStarting in 1920, Mir\u00f3 developed a very precise style, picking out every element in isolation and detail and arranging them in deliberate composition. These works, including House with Palm Tree (1918), Nude with a Mirror (1919), Horse, Pipe and Red Flower (1920), and The Table \u2013 Still Life with Rabbit (1920), show the clear influence of Cubism, although in a restrained way, being applied to only a portion of the subject. For example, The Farmer's Wife (1922\u201323), is realistic, but some sections are stylized or deformed, such as the treatment of the woman's feet, which are enlarged and flattened.The culmination of this style was The Farm (1921\u201322). The rural Catalan scene it depicts is augmented by an avant-garde French newspaper in the center, showing Mir\u00f3 sees this work transformed by the Modernist theories he had been exposed to in Paris. The concentration on each element as equally important was a key step towards generating a pictorial sign for each element. The background is rendered in flat or patterned in simple areas, highlighting the separation of figure and ground, which would become important in his mature style.\nMir\u00f3 made many attempts to promote this work, but his surrealist colleagues found it too realistic and apparently conventional, and so he soon turned to a more explicitly surrealist approach.\n\n\n=== Early surrealism ===\nIn 1922, Mir\u00f3 explored abstracted, strongly coloured surrealism in at least one painting. From the summer of 1923 in Mont-roig, Mir\u00f3 began a key set of paintings where abstracted pictorial signs, rather than the realistic representations used in The Farm, are predominant. In The Tilled Field, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and Pastoral (1923\u201324), these flat shapes and lines (mostly black or strongly coloured) suggest the subjects, sometimes quite cryptically. For Catalan Landscape (The Hunter), Mir\u00f3 represents the hunter with a combination of signs: a triangle for the head, curved lines for the moustache, angular lines for the body. So encoded is this work that at a later time Mir\u00f3 provided a precise explanation of the signs used.\n\n\n=== Surrealist pictorial language ===\nThrough the mid-1920s Mir\u00f3 developed the pictorial sign language which would be central throughout the rest of his career.\nIn Harlequin's Carnival (1924\u201325), there is a clear continuation of the line begun with The Tilled Field. But in subsequent works, such as The Happiness of Loving My Brunette (1925) and Painting (Fratellini) (1927), there are far fewer foreground figures, and those that remain are simplified.\nSoon after Mir\u00f3 also began his Spanish Dancer series of works. These simple collages, were like a conceptual counterpoint to his paintings. In Spanish Dancer (1928) he combines a cork, a feather and a hatpin onto a blank sheet of paper.\n\n\n=== Livres d'Artiste ===\nMir\u00f3 created over 250 illustrated books. These were known as \"Livres d' Artiste.\" One such work was published in 1974, at the urging of the widow of the French poet Robert Desnos, titled Les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s de l'enfer ou les nouvelles H\u00e9brides (\"The Penalties of Hell or The New Hebrides\"). It was a set of 25 lithographs, five in black, and the others in colors.\nIn 2006 the book was displayed in \"Joan Mir\u00f3, Illustrated Books\" at the Vero Beach Museum of Art. One critic said it is \"an especially powerful set, not only for the rich imagery but also for the story behind the book's creation. The lithographs are long, narrow verticals, and while they feature Mir\u00f3's familiar shapes, there's an unusual emphasis on texture.\" The critic continued, \"I was instantly attracted to these four prints, to an emotional lushness, that's in contrast with the cool surfaces of so much of Mir\u00f3's work. Their poignancy is even greater, I think, when you read how they came to be. The artist met and became friends with Desnos, perhaps the most beloved and influential surrealist writer, in 1925, and before long, they made plans to collaborate on a livre d'artiste. Those plans were put on hold because of the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Desnos' bold criticism of the latter led to his imprisonment in Auschwitz, and he died at age 45 shortly after his release in 1945. Nearly three decades later, at the suggestion of Desnos' widow, Mir\u00f3 set out to illustrate the poet's manuscript. It was his first work in prose, which was written in Morocco in 1922 but remained unpublished until this posthumous collaboration.\"\n\n\n== Styles and development ==\nIn Paris, under the influence of poets and writers, he developed his unique style: organic forms and flattened picture planes drawn with a sharp line. Generally thought of as a Surrealist because of his interest in automatism and the use of sexual symbols (for example, ovoids with wavy lines emanating from them), Mir\u00f3's style was influenced in varying degrees by Surrealism and Dada, yet he rejected membership in any artistic movement in the interwar European years. Andr\u00e9 Breton described him as \"the most Surrealist of us all.\" Mir\u00f3 confessed to creating one of his most famous works, Harlequin's Carnival, under similar circumstances:\n\nHow did I think up my drawings and my ideas for painting? Well I'd come home to my Paris studio in Rue Blomet at night, I'd go to bed, and sometimes I hadn't any supper. I saw things, and I jotted them down in a notebook. I saw shapes on the ceiling...\nMir\u00f3's surrealist origins evolved out of \"repression\" much like all Spanish surrealist and magic realist work, especially because of his Catalan ethnicity, which was subject to special persecution by the Franco regime. Also, Joan Mir\u00f3 was well aware of Haitian Voodoo art and Cuban Santer\u00eda religion through his travels before going into exile. This led to his signature style of art making.\n\n\n=== Experimental style ===\nJoan Mir\u00f3 was among the first artists to develop automatic drawing as a way to undo previous established techniques in painting, and thus, with Andr\u00e9 Masson, represented the beginning of Surrealism as an art movement. However, Mir\u00f3 chose not to become an official member of the Surrealists to be free to experiment with other artistic styles without compromising his position within the group. He pursued his own interests in the art world, ranging from automatic drawing and surrealism, to expressionism, Lyrical Abstraction, and Color Field painting. Four-dimensional painting was a theoretical type of painting Mir\u00f3 proposed in which painting would transcend its two-dimensionality and even the three-dimensionality of sculpture.Mir\u00f3's oft-quoted interest in the assassination of painting is derived from a dislike of bourgeois art, which he believed was used as a way to promote propaganda and cultural identity among the wealthy. Specifically, Mir\u00f3 responded to Cubism in this way, which by the time of his quote had become an established art form in France. He is quoted as saying \"I will break their guitar,\" referring to Picasso's paintings, with the intent to attack the popularity and appropriation of Picasso's art by politics.\nThe spectacle of the sky overwhelms me. I'm overwhelmed when I see, in an immense sky, the crescent of the moon, or the sun. There, in my pictures, tiny forms in huge empty spaces. Empty spaces, empty horizons, empty plains \u2013 everything which is bare has always greatly impressed me. \u2014Joan Mir\u00f3, 1958, quoted in Twentieth-Century Artists on Art\nIn an interview with biographer Walter Erben, Mir\u00f3 expressed his dislike for art critics, saying, they \"are more concerned with being philosophers than anything else.  They form a preconceived opinion, then they look at the work of art.  Painting merely serves as a cloak in which to wrap their emaciated philosophical systems.\"In the final decades of his life Mir\u00f3 accelerated his work in different media, producing hundreds of ceramics, including the Wall of the Moon and Wall of the Sun at the UNESCO building in Paris. He also made temporary window paintings (on glass) for an exhibit. In the last years of his life Mir\u00f3 wrote his most radical and least known ideas, exploring the possibilities of gas sculpture and four-dimensional painting.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThroughout the 1960s, Mir\u00f3 was a featured artist in many salon shows assembled by the Maeght Foundation that also included works by Marc Chagall, Giacometti, Brach, Cesar, Ubac, and Tal-Coat.\nThe large retrospectives devoted to Mir\u00f3 in his old age in towns such as New York (1972), London (1972), Saint-Paul-de-Vence (1973) and Paris (1974) were a good indication of the international acclaim that had grown steadily over the previous half-century; further major retrospectives took place posthumously. Political changes in his native country led in 1978 to the first full exhibition of his painting and graphic work, at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid. In 1993, the year of the hundredth anniversary of his birth, several exhibitions were held, among which the most prominent were those held in the Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, Barcelona, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, Madrid, and the Galerie Lelong, Paris. In 2011, another retrospective was mounted by the Tate Modern, London, and travelled to Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3 and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.. Joan Mir\u00f3, Printmaking, Fundaci\u00f3n Joan Mir\u00f3 (2013). And two exhibitions in 2014, Mir\u00f3: From Earth to Sky at Albertina Museum, and Masterpieces from the Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich, National Art Center, Tokyo.\nExhibitions entitled Joan Mir\u00f3: Instinct & Imagination and \"Mir\u00f3: The Experience of Seeing\" were held at the Denver Art Museum from 22 March \u2013 28 June 2015 and at the McNay Art Museum from 30 September 2015 \u2013 10 January 2016 (respectively), showing works made by Mir\u00f3 between 1963 and 1981, on loan from the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid.In Spring 2019, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, launched Joan Mir\u00f3: Birth of the World. Running until July 2019, the exhibit showcases 60 pieces of work from the inception of Mir\u00f3's career, and including the influence of the World Wars. The exhibit features 60-foot canvasses as well as smaller 8-foot paintings, and the influences range from cubism to abstraction.\n\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\nMir\u00f3 has been a significant influence on late 20th-century art, in particular the American abstract expressionist artists such as Motherwell, Calder, Gorky, Pollock, Matta and Rothko, while his lyrical abstractions and color field paintings were precursors of that style by artists such as Helen Frankenthaler, Olitski and Louis and others.\nHis work has also influenced modern designers, including Paul Rand and Lucienne Day, and influenced recent painters such as Julian Hatton.One of Man Ray's 1930s photographs, Mir\u00f3 with Rope, depicts the painter with an arranged rope pinned to a wall, and was published in the single-issue surrealist work Minotaure.\nIn 2002, American percussionist/composer Bobby Previte released the album The 23 Constellations of Joan Mir\u00f3 on Tzadik Records. Inspired by Mir\u00f3's Constellations series, Previte composed a series of short pieces (none longer than about 3 minutes) to parallel the small size of Mir\u00f3's paintings. Privete's compositions for an ensemble of up to ten musicians was described by critics as \"unconventionally light, ethereal, and dreamlike\".\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 1954 he was given the Venice Biennale print making prize, in 1958 the Guggenheim International Award.In 1981, the Palma City Council (Majorca) established the Fundaci\u00f3 Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3 a Mallorca, housed in the four studios that Mir\u00f3 had donated for the purpose.In October 2018, the Grand Palais in Paris opened the largest retrospective devoted to the artist until this date. The exhibition included nearly 150 works and was curated by Jean Louis Prat.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nToday, Mir\u00f3's paintings sell for between US$250,000 and US$26 million; US$17 million at a U.S. auction for the La Caresse des \u00e9toiles (1938) on 6 May 2008, at the time the highest amount paid for one of his works. In 2012, Painting-Poem (\"le corps de ma brune puisque je l'aime comme ma chatte habill\u00e9e en vert salade comme de la gr\u00eale c'est pareil\") (1925) was sold at Christie's London for $26.6 million. Later that year at Sotheby's in London, Peinture (Etoile Bleue) (1927) brought nearly 23.6 million pounds with fees, more than twice what it had sold for at a Paris auction in 2007 and a record price for the artist at auction. On 21 June 2017, the work Femme et Oiseaux (1940), one of his Constellations, sold at Sotheby's London for 24,571,250 GBP.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJacques Dupin, Joan Mir\u00f3 Life and Work, Harry N.

Located in the municipality of Calvi\u00e0, it is 18 kilometres from the capital Palma.\n\n\n== History ==\nSanta Ponsa derives its name from a Roman villa called Sancta Pontia. Santa Ponsa is where King James I of Aragon (Jaume in Catalan) landed on September 12, 1229 in his successful quest to conquer the island and take it from the Moors after more than 300 years of Muslim rule. Majorca became part of the Crown of Aragon following James's conquest, and was later annexed to the Monarchy of Spain. A cross at the sea entrance to the marina marks the spot where James landed. Every September there is a grand fiesta to commemorate the landing with a mock battle between the Moors and Christians on the beach. It is a two-week fiesta which incorporates a pop concert and firework display.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe town is a popular holiday destination and attracts people from countries with colder climates such as Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and Great Britain, especially from May to October. Some have bought villas and apartments in the hills on each side of the bay. In recent years, it has become a popular party destination among youths due to its great nightlife and its close distance to Magaluf, another party area.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nSanta Ponsa has two 18-hole (I, II) and one 9-hole golf courses (III). Santa Ponsa II has hosted a PGA European Tour event and is open only to club members. Its 18th green is in the shape of the island of Majorca within a pond, reached by a bridge.\nThe Baleares International College, an English school founded in 1956, is located on the road to the nearby village of Magaluf.\nSanta Ponsa also has a private marina, Club N\u00e1utico Santa Ponsa (Santa Ponsa Yacht Club), built in 1975 within the natural cove known as \"Sa Caleta\".  The marina can accommodate up to 522 boats from 7m to 20m in length as well as offering dry dock services.\nSanta Ponsa hosts the Balearic Islands node of the COMETA electric power transmission system from the Spanish mainland.\n\nSanta Ponsa is a well known holiday location for people of all ages, However, it is especially well recognised to be a holiday location for teens of the age 17 and up and was listed as the top ten holiday spot for older teens.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSanta Ponsa tourist information\nSanta Ponsa tourist information UK\nSanta Ponsa - Mallorca\nVideo \"Santa Ponsa: Beaches & Golf\" in Mallorca TV Teleweb+\nSanta Ponsa - Majorca",

        "wiki": "This is a complete list of basilicas of the Catholic Church. A basilica is a church with certain privileges conferred on it by the Pope.\nNot all churches with \"basilica\" in their title actually have the ecclesiastical status, which can lead to confusion, since it is also an architectural term for a church-building style.\nIn the 18th century, the term took on a canonical sense, unrelated to this architectural style. Basilicas in this canonical sense are divided into major (\"greater\") and minor basilicas. Today only four, all in the Diocese of Rome, are classified as major basilicas: the major basilicas of St John Lateran, St Peter's, St Paul outside the Walls, and St Mary Major. The other canonical basilicas are minor basilicas.\nBy canon law no Catholic church can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. The Basilica di San Nicola da Tolentino was the first minor basilica to be canonically created, in 1783. The 1917 Code of Canon Law officially recognised churches using the title of basilica from immemorial custom as having such a right to the title of minor basilica. Such churches are referred to as immemorial basilicas.\n\n\n== Basilicas in Asia ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in Africa ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in North and Central America and the Caribbean ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in South America ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in Australia and Oceania ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in Europe ==\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nAs of November 2019, there were 1,690 basilicas (four of them major; the rest minor) in the world.\n\n\n=== Countries with more than 100 basilicas ===\nItaly (573)\nFrance (168)\nSpain (123)\nPoland (105)\n\n\n=== Countries with between 10 and 100 basilicas ===\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with more than 10 basilicas ===\nRome (66)\nBuenos Aires (15)\nKrak\u00f3w (13)\nBologna (11)\nFlorence (11)\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with between five and 10 basilicas ===\nNaples (9)\nBarcelona (9)\nMilan (9)\nVenice (8)\nCologne (6)\nLima (6)\nMadrid (6)\nSantiago (6)\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with five basilicas ===\nJerusalem\nParis\nPiacenza\nGenoa\nTurin\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with four basilicas ===\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with three basilicas ===\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with two basilicas ===\n\n\n== Other basilicas ==\nThe following churches are often referred to as basilicas, but there does not appear to be evidence of their officially holding that status:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of basilicas in Italy\nBasilicas of New Zealand\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nList of all Minor Basilicas from GCatholic\nList of all Basilicas in India from Notes on India\nBunson, Matthew, ed.

Apart from urban areas and public baths (some of which offer nude swimming days), nude bathing is common in Germany: unofficial clothing optional areas exist at most lakes and rivers and other sites, such as abandoned sand and rock quarries. Many designated Freik\u00f6rperkultur (FKK \u2013 Free Body Culture) areas exist at the seaside, at lakes and in baths, especially in the former East Germany, where nudism remains more widespread than in the west. Many unregulated clothing optional (FKK) free beaches are available along the Nordsee and Baltic seashores, R\u00fcgen and other islands. The attitude is: all beaches are nude beaches until somebody complains. Families especially like to spend their leisure time in naturist areas; sauna bathing is generally practiced in the nude.The list of social nudity places in Germany includes:\nThe Sch\u00f6nfeldwiese in the Englischer Garten, Munich as well as the southern part of Feldmochinger See, in the northwestern suburb, the peninsula in Lake Feringasee in the northeast and the Flaucher at the river Isar south of the city center of Munich.\nThe Tiergarten, Berlin\nStrandbad Wannsee, Gro\u00dfer Wannsee, Wannsee, Berlin\nTravem\u00fcnde\nSylt\nGr\u00f6mitz\nBorkum\nNorderney\nLake Senftenberg, Oberspreewald-Lausitz, Brandenburg\nBaden-Baden is a city located near the French border.

        "wiki": "Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu (Catalan pronunciation: [\u02c8sant\u0259 \u0259w\u02c8la\u027ei\u0259 \u00f0\u0259z \u02c8riw], Spanish: Santa Eulalia del R\u00edo) is a coastal town on the south eastern seaboard of the Spanish island of Ibiza. The town is located on the designated road PM 810. Santa Eul\u00e0ria is the third largest town on the island and also has the only river on the island which flows into the sea at the western end of the town.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe town is 9.3 miles (15.0 km) north east of Ibiza Town and 13.6 miles (21.9 km) of Ibiza Airport. The town sits next to a wide bay with the promontory of Punta Arab\u00ed at the east end of the Bay. Also at the eastern end of the bay is new harbour, mariner called Port Esportiu which is full of restaurants, shops and bars. The town has two beaches which are kept clean and tidy and have gently sloping sands and are ideal for young families. At the western end of the bay is the prominent hill of \u2018Puig d\u2019 en Fita\u2019 which dominates the landscape. The hill is dotted with apartments, hotels and private houses, and at night is dotted with the dwellings lights.\n\n\n== The Town ==\nAt the centre of the town on the \u2018Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Espanya\u2019 is the Ajuntament (town hall) which is now one of the last historical buildings of the town. The present building, which has been renovated, dates from 1795 and reflects the typical architecture of the period on the island. Nowadays the building is less functional as a town hall and is used with a civic representative purpose. In front of the Ajuntament is a small square which has a fountain with a stone surround which faces the busy main street of \u2018Carrer Saint Jaume\u2019. Behind the fountain is a stone monument, erected by the city of Palma, Mallorca to thank and honour the local fishermen who, On 17 January 1913, rescued victims of the shipwrecked steamboat \u2018Mallorca\u2019 which had run aground on a reef near the rocky inlet of Redona at Punta Arab\u00ed.  The town streets run grid like from the \u2018Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Espanya\u2019 with the \u2018Carrer Saint Jaume\u2019 running west to east. The \u2018Carrer da Sant Vincent\u2019 runs parallel, one street back from \u2018Carrer Saint Jaume\u2019 with the western end of \u2018Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Espanya\u2019. This street is pedestrianized and is filled with typical Tavernas and restaurants. There are also one or two lively bars. The \u2018Carrer Saint Jaume\u2019  is full of stores, banks, bars and restaurants. The \u2018Passeig de s\u2019Alamera\u2019 is an attractive thoroughfare which runs south from the \u2018Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Espanya\u2019 down to the seafront. This boulevard has a tree lined central pedestrianized area with gardens. In the summer this shady \u2018Ramblas\u2019 is lined with market stalls selling jewellery, sarongs, tie-dye Thai garb and trinkets of all kinds. At the southern end of \u2018Passeig de s\u2019Alamera\u2019 is Santa Eulalia's harbour front with views of the bay. Running in either direction is a paved and landscaped promenade. Below the promenade are the resorts two sandy beaches which have safe designated bathing areas which in the season are patrolled by lifeguards. Behind the promenade the bay is ringed by concrete apartment blocks, some of which have shops, bars, caf\u00e9 and restaurants opening on to the promenade.\n\n\n== The River ==\nThe river is called Riu de Santa Eulalia, it is more of a small stream and only ever becomes a raging torrent following very heavy rainfall. The source of the river is below the 342-metre-high Puig d\u2019en Sopes close to Sant Miquel. The river then meanders for 17 kilometres (11 mi) through the countryside to the sea at the western end of the town. A small way inland from the mouth of the river there is a small triple arched bridge, the Pont Vell, the bridge crosses the rocky valley and is claimed to have been built by the Romans as part of the imperial road building schemes on the island between 200 BC and AD 400, although the bridge's earliest mention is in a document of 1720. The river is also the only one of its kind in the Balearic Islands, and is fed by several small tributaries, notably the Torrent de Labritja, which originates at the northern village of Sant Joan de Labritja.\n\n\n== The Parish Church of Santa Eul\u00e0ria ==\nTo the west of the town centre is the hill called \u2018Puig de Missa\u2019. The hill is 52 metres above sea level and its summit is dominated by the Esgl\u00e9sia de Puig de Missa. The church is dedicated to Saint Eulalia. The Path to the church spirals up around the hillside before arriving in a courtyard beside the church come Fortress. The Church is thought to have been built in 1568 although it is recorded that there was a chapel dedicated to the saint as far back as 1302. Despite the huge natural advantage of constructing the church on this hilltop, the small community of Santa Eul\u00e0ria, employed the skills of military designer Giovanni Calvi to fortify the church you see here today. Calvi had a rounded bastion constructed in the style of the islands many watchtower although the church's bastion is solid and has no internal guardrooms. The churches nave roof is higher than the Bastion which restricted the range and scope of any cannon placed on the bastion, although it is thought that at one time the roof may have been lower than the bastion. The Porch of the church, added in the eighteenth century, is larger than most on the island and stands separate from the main church building. It has multiple pillars and rounded arches which has been compared to the Moorish style of architecture, and this does compare well with a mosque and its prayer halls still seen on main land Spain. The porch is probably the newest part of this church. On the west elevation of the church there is a small chapel which is topped with a plain stone dome complete with a lantern. This chapel is an addition to the original church, and is entered through a ponderous arch bored through the massively thick walls. The interior is square and rather small with the dome above supported on squat arches over each corner. The lantern above has stained glass lights. There is another similar chapel on the opposite wall which gives the nave a footprint in the shape of the crucifix. There is a gilded altarpiece which was brought and installed from Segovia in 1967. the rest of the church is very sparse and has been heavily restored due to the extreme damage done to the church by iconoclast Republicans during the Spanish Civil War of 1936 who viewed the church as a hotbed of sedition.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n=== Ball Pag\u00e8s ===\nTHE DANCES\nThe roles of men and women are clearly differentiated in our dances. The woman, indifferent, holds her arms close to her body, walking with short and rapid steps, circling around a central point. The man, however, does not have previously determined steps. He tries to show his force and manliness by taking great leaps, in order to win the favour of the woman. The dances and the popular culture are part of rural, or country, society. The people who lived in and from the countryside did not have many opportunities for socialising or parties. The songs have a decidedly Oriental sound. The words have to be guessed, with syllables cut off so they fit into the monotonous and unvarying melody. Christian influence is perhaps the strongest. In 1235, Catalan men during the reign of Jaime I took the island from the Arabs. Its influence is seen in the jewels, the men's dress and the language we speak. In spite of the Christianisation of the dances and the inclusion of music in the liturgy, the profane nature of the same can be easily recognised.\nLA CURTA\nThis is a short dance. The steps and the rhythm are suitable for the elderly. Generally, the elderly, the well owner with the heir to the house, or the in-laws of the couple marrying \u2013 depending on the occasion \u2013 started and finished the party with this dance, granting permission to the rest to continue.\nLA LLARGA\nYoung people display their energy with this much faster dance. In almost all the dances, the dancer selects his partner with a bang on the castanets. This gesture, a quite rude way to issue an invitation to a woman, is forgiven at the end of the dance when the man kneels before her. The woman reciprocates with a small curtsy.\nSA FILERA\nA man dances with three women in a line. It seems like a wedding dance where the recently married bride is accompanied by two friends or ladies. The rhythm is the same as the Llarga.\nSES NOU RODADES\nThis may be the prettiest and most important dance in our repertoire. Parties culminate with this dance and it is a nuptial ceremony. The newly married couple dance in a series of circles, separating and then meeting again in the centre, where they link elbows. After the sixth turn, the wife flashes her rings (twenty-four in total) that her husband has presented her.\nTHE INSTRUMENTS\nThe basic rhythm of our music is percussion and wind. It may seem surprising that such a Mediterranean island does not include string instruments in their music. The drum, the flute, the espas\u00ed (a metal sword-shaped piece) and the castanets always accompany our dances and fiestas.\nTHE DRUM\nA hollowed pine trunk. The outsides are adorned with carvings or paint, with red and green colours predominating here. The motifs are vegetal or geometric. The skin is made from rabbit.\nTHE FLUTE\nAn oleander branch hollowed out with fire. With only three holes, it is also adorned with vegetable and geometric shapes. This instrument requires greater skill, even though composers do not have a conventional knowledge of musical theory or other disciplines and play accompanied by the drum.\nTHE ESPAS\u00cd\nA piece of metal in the shape of a sword. The stridency of the metal backs up the music.\nTHE CASTANETS\nThis may possibly be the strangest instrument, due to both its size and its sound. Created from juniper wood, they are carved with vegetable or geometric shapes using knives. While castanets are widely used throughout the Mediterranean, we use the largest ones available. The sound resembles a trotting horse.\nTHE XEREMIA\nAnother wind instrument, which was used principally by shepherds. It is created with two young bamboo shoots, with a vibrating reed. You can see an instrument identical to the xeremia at the British Museum in London, which is the Egyptian maid. Besides accompanying our dances, some of these instruments can be heard at religious celebrations and other solemn occasions. Ses Caramelles is the song played on Christmas Eve. Sa Pujadeta and Sa Calera are songs that are already classics and enjoy great popularity amongst the Ibizans.\nTHE DRESS\nThe originality and authenticity of some of the native dress styles offer some samples that are over three hundred years old. In the different villages of the island, similar to how the exact dance style varies, there are also small variations in dress. We can distinguish between three different types of dress, both for men and women, in accordance with their function and age.\nTHE BLACK GONELLA\nThis is the oldest dress for women, probably dating from the 18th century. It is a tunic of knitted wool, consisting of an underskirt, a serge jerkin with embroidered satin sleeves, silver buttons and coloured ribbons. This is topped with an apron, a yellow silk shawl and a cambuix, a lace scarf tied under the neck. It is usually worn with a black, felt, wide-brimmed hat. Jewels on the dress are silver and red coral. Gold, which was traditionally used, became scarce during this time. The jewels are affixed to the body with coloured, embroidered ribbons.\nTHE WHITE GONELLA OR WHITE DRESS \nA luminous white colour, consisting of the same garments as the gonella (underskirts, jerkin, apron, shawl and scarf), but with some particularities. A hat is never worn. The bride layered on underskirts until their width no longer allowed her to pass through the door of her bedroom. The jewels are made from gold. This was generally the dowry that her family contributed to the wedding. The cross, la joia, hung with eighteen spans of golden braid (6 or 7 times over the chest) and two or three necklaces. The sleeves were adorned with gold buttons. The rings could be in different shapes - the family seal, the heart and key to the house, etc. These were gifts from her fianc\u00e9e, with a total of twenty-four rings.\nCOLOURED GONELLA OR COLOURED DRESS\nOld women that still wear this dress on a daily basis can be seen in isolated villages. On the day of the town festival, they wear their best dresses adorned with jewellery and then go to the church, following a long tradition. They have essentially the same clothing items, but the apron is normally long, short if undergarments are worn. It can be accompanied with a wide-brimmed hat made from pita fibres (capell de floc), with a yellow scarf, but never together with the undergarments. There are also three types of dress for the men. Recognised as the oldest, it seems to have come from a military uniform, and we can place it next to the gonella. Black holds prominence over white. A large rosary with silver and ebony beads is worn at the neck. The following is possibly the most popular. Worn for summer festivals, it is made with luminous white cloth and a highly embroidered shirt. The sash has bright colours and the waistcoat has silver button work: 14 or 24 buttons, depending on the man's wealth. Lastly, the most modern outfit that disappeared only quite recently, was worn by the elderly. All signs of ostentation have been suppressed here: there is no button work or adornments. It consists of a loose-fitting shirt closed only at the neck that goes over the inside shirt. Dark-coloured, and worn with a silk scarf, generally yellow. Topped by a black felt hat. All these dresses were worn with handmade pita-fibre espadrilles. The most common colours for men were red and white. Women put much more imagination into the colouring of their clothing. The jewels merit special mention. S'emprendada, a set of gold, silver and coral jewels, has an artistic and historical value much greater than their economic value. And we could not finish without mentioning the importance that dance, music and dress play within our culture and as an extremely relevant part of our entity.\n\n\n=== Hippy Markets ===\nThere are two Hippy Markets which attract large numbers of tourists and locals: Punta Arabi, located in Es Canar runs all day every Wednesday from April through October. Las Dalias, near Sant Carles, runs all day every Saturday, throughout the year. Las Dalias also has a \"Night Market\" which runs Monday and Tuesday evenings from June through September.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nThe town was depicted, in the time before and up to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, in Elliot Paul's Life and Death of a Spanish Town (1937).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nCarola Li\u00f1ares Serantes, Local Student, actual 3 times champion of Spain in Athleticism (1600 m)  willing to become P.E.

        "wiki": "Palma, unofficially known as Palma de Mallorca ( or , Catalan: [\u02c8palm\u0259], Spanish: [\u02c8palma]), is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands in Spain. It is situated on the south coast of Mallorca on the Bay of Palma. The Cabrera Archipelago, though widely separated from Palma proper, is administratively considered part of the municipality. As of 2018, Palma Airport serves over 29 million passengers per year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPalma was founded as a Roman camp upon the remains of a Talaiotic settlement. The city was subjected to several Vandal raids during the fall of the Western Roman Empire, then reconquered by the Byzantine Empire, then colonised by the Moors (who called it Medina Mayurqa) and, in the 13th century, by James I of Aragon.\n\n\n=== Roman period ===\nAfter the conquest of Mallorca, the city was loosely incorporated into the province of Tarraconensis by 123 BC; the Romans founded two new cities: Palma on the south of the island, and Pollentia in the northeast \u2013 on the site of a Phoenician settlement. Whilst Pollentia acted as a port to Roman cities on the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, Palma was the port used for destinations in Africa, such as Carthage, and Hispania, such as Saguntum, Gades and Carthago Nova. Though present-day Palma has no significant remains from this period, occasional archaeological finds are made in city centre excavations.  For example, the remains of the Roman Wall can be seen at Can Bordils, the Municipal Archive, and below it, at the Maim\u00f3 ben Faraig Center.\n\n\n=== Byzantine period ===\nThough the period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Muslim conquest is not well understood (due to lack of documents), there is clear evidence of a Byzantine presence in the city, as indicated by mosaics found in the oldest parts of the Cathedral, which was in early medieval times part of a paleo-Christian temple.\n\n\n=== Muslim period ===\nBetween 902 and 1229, the city was under Islamic control. It remained the capital of the island and it was known as Medina Mayurqa, which in Arabic means \"City of Majorca\".\n\n\n==== Under the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba ====\nThe arrival of the Moors in the Balearic Islands occurred at the beginning of the 8th century. During this period, the population developed an economy based on self-sufficiency and piracy, and even showed evidence of a relative hierarchy. The dominant groups took advantage of the Byzantine withdrawal due to Islamic expansion across the Mediterranean, to reinforce their domination upon the rest of the population, thus ensuring their power and the gradual abandonment of Imperial political structures.\nIn 707, a Muslim fleet, under the command of Abd Allgaht ibn Musa, son of the governor of Ifriqiya, Musa ibn Nusayr, stopped off at the island. It appears that Abd Allah convinced the powers of the city to accept a peace treaty. This treaty was granted in exchange for a tax, respect for social, economic and political structures to the communities that subscribed to it, as well as the continuity of their religious beliefs.\nAfter 707, the city was inhabited by Christians who were nominally in allegiance to the sovereignty of the Umayyad Caliphate, yet who, de facto, enjoyed absolute autonomy. The city, being in Mallorca, constituted an enclave between western Christian and Islamic territories, and this attracted and encouraged increased levels of piracy in the surrounding waters. For wide sectors of the city's population, the sacking of ships (whether Muslim or Christian) which passed through Balearic waters was a source of riches over the next fifteen decades. Eventually, continued piracy in the region lead to a retaliation by Al-Andalus which launched a naval fleet against the city and the whole of the Islands.\nThe Islands were defended by the emperor Charlemagne in 799 from a Muslim pirate incursion.\nIn 848 (maybe 849), four years after the first Viking incursions had sacked the whole island, an attack from C\u00f3rdoba forced the authorities to ratify the treaty to which the city had submitted in 707. As the city still occupied an eccentric position regarding the commerce network established by the Moors in the western Mediterranean, the enclave was not immediately incorporated into Al-Andalus.\nWhile the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba reinforced its influence upon the Mediterranean, Al-Andalus increased its interest in the city. The consequence of this was the substitution of the submission treaty for the effective incorporation of the islands to the Islamic state. A squad under the command of Isam al-Jawlani took advantage of instability caused by several Viking incursions and disembarked in Mallorca, and after destroying any resistance, incorporated Mallorca, with Palma as its capital, to the C\u00f3rdoban state.\nThe incorporation of the city into the Emirate set the basis for a new society. Commerce and manufacturing developed in a manner that was previously unknown. This caused considerable demographic growth, thereby establishing Medina Mayurqa as one of the major ports for trading goods in and out of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba.\n\n\n==== D\u00e9nia\u2014Balearic taifa (1015\u20131087) ====\n\nThe Umayyad regime, despite its administrative centralisation, mercenary army and struggle to gain wider social support, could neither harmonise the various ethnic groups inside al-Andalus nor dissolve the old tribes which still organised sporadic ethnic fighting. During the 11th century, the Caliphate's control waned considerably. Provinces broke free from the central Cordoban administration, and became effectively sovereign states \u2014 taifas \u2014 under the same governors that had been named by the last Umayyad Caliphs. According to their origin, these \"taifas\" can be grouped under three broad categories: people of Arab, Berber or Slavic origin.\nPalma was part of the taifa of D\u00e9nia. The founder of this state was a client of the Al-Mansur family, Muyahid ibn Yusuf ibn Ali, who could profit from the progressive crumbling of the Caliphate's superstructure to gain control over the province of D\u00e9nia. Subsequently, Muyahid organised a campaign throughout the Balearic Islands to consolidate the district and incorporated it into their \"taifa\" in early 1015.\nDuring the following years Palma became the main port from where attacks on Christian vessels and coasts could be launched. Palma was the base from where a campaign against Sardinia was launched between 1016 and 1017, which caused the Pisans and Genoese forces to intervene. Later, this intervention set the basis for Italian mercantile penetration of the city.\nThe Denian dominion lasted until 1087, a period during which the city, as well as the rest of the islands, was relatively peaceful. Their supremacy at sea was still not rivalled by the Italian merchant republics, thus there were few external threats.\n\n\n==== Balearic Taifa (1087\u20131115) and Western Mediterranean ====\nThe Banu Hud conquest of D\u00e9nia and its incorporation to the Eastern district of the taifa of Zaragoza meant the destruction of the legacy of Muyahid. The islands were freed from mainland dominion and briefly enjoyed independence, during which Medina Mayurqa was the capital.\nThe economy during this period depended on both agriculture and piracy. In the latter 11th century, Christian commercial powers took the initiative at sea against the Muslims. After centuries of fighting defensively in the face of Islamic pressure, Italians, Catalans and Occitans took offensive action. Consequently, the benefits of piracy diminished causing severe economic stress on the city.\nThe clearest proof of the new ruling relation of forces, from 1090, is the Crusade organised by the most important mercantile cities of the Christian states against the Islands. This effort was destined to finally eradicate Muslim piracy mainly based in Palma and surrounding havens. In 1115, Palma was sacked and later abandoned by an expedition commanded by Ramon Berenguer III the Great, count of Barcelona and Provence, which was composed of Catalans, Pisans and other Italians, and soldiers from Provence, Corsica, and Sardinia, in a struggle to end Almoravid control.\nAfter this, the Islands became part of the Almoravid dynasty. The inglobement of all the taifa to a larger state helped to re-establish a balance along the frontier that separated western Christian states from the Muslim world.\n\n\n==== Period of the Banu Ganiya (1157\u20131203) ====\nThe situation changed in the mid-12th century, when the Almoravids were displaced from al-Andalus and western Maghreb by the Almohad. Almoravid dominions, from 1157 on, were restricted to the Balearic Islands, with Palma again acting as the capital, governed by Muhammad ibn Ganiya. Massive arrival of al-Andalus refugees contributed to reinforce the positions of the last Almoravid legitimatists, the Banu Ganiya, who, conscious of their weakness in the Western Mediterranean context, started to get closer to the growing powers represented by Italian maritime republics. Genoa and Pisans obtained in this period their first commercial concessions in the city and the rest of the islands.\nThe Banu Ganiya, taking advantage of the great loss suffered by Abu Yuqub Yusuf in the Siege of Santar\u00e9m, attacked Ifriqiya, where the Almohad dominion had not been consolidated yet, in the same year. However, this attack was repelled and the Almohad authorities encouraged anti-Almoravid revolts in the Islands. The city was captured by the Almohads in 1203.\n\n\n=== Christian reconquest and late Middle Ages ===\n\nOn 31 December 1229, after three months of siege, the city was reconquered by James I of Aragon and was renamed Ciutat de Mallorca (Mallorca City). In addition to being kept as capital of the Kingdom of Majorca, it was given a municipality that comprised the whole island. The governing arm was the University of the City and Kingdom of Majorca.\nAfter the death of James I of Aragon, Palma became joint capital of the Kingdom of Majorca, together with Perpignan. His son, James II of Majorca, championed the construction of statues and monuments in the city: Bellver Castle, the churches of St. Francesc and St. Domingo, reformed the Palace of Almudaina and began the construction of the Cathedral of Majorca.\n\nIn 1391, anti-Jewish riots broke out. The Jewish community of Inca was completely wiped out, as were those of S\u00f3ller, Sineu, and Alcudia. In spite of the governor's prohibition on leaving the island, many Jews fled to North Africa. The remaining Jews were forced to convert under threat of death.Abraham Cresques was a 14th-century Jewish cartographer of the Majorcan cartographic school from Palma; Cresques is credited with the authorship of the famous Catalan Atlas.\nThe river that cut through the city gave rise to two distinct areas within the city; the \"Upper town\" and \"Lower town\", depending upon which side of the river one was situated.\n\nThe city's advantageous geographical location allowed it extensive commerce with Catalonia, Valencia, Provence, the Maghreb, the Italian republics and the dominions of the Great Turk, which heralded a golden age for the city.\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, the Rebellion of the Brotherhoods (a peasant uprising against Charles V's administration) and the frequent attack of Turkish and Berber pirates caused a reduction of commercial activities and a huge inversion in defensive structures. As a consequence, the city entered a period of decadence that would last till the end of the 17th century.\n\n\n=== 17th to 19th centuries ===\n\nThe 17th century was characterised by the division of the city into two sides or gangs, named Canamunts and Canavalls (from Majorcan Catalan \"the ones from the upper/lower side\"), with severe social and economic repercussions. During this period, the port became a haven for pirates. During the last quarter of the century, the Inquisition continued its persecution of the city's Jews, locally called xuetes.\nThe fall of Barcelona in 1714 meant the end of the War of the Spanish Succession and the defeat and destruction of the Crown of Aragon, and this was reflected on the Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip V of Spain in 1715. These occupation decrees changed the government of the island and separated it from the municipality's government of Palma, which became the official city name. By the end of the 19th century, the name  Palma de Mallorca was generalised in written Spanish, although it is still colloquially named Ciutat (\"city\") in Catalan. In the 18th century Charles III of Spain removed interdiction of commerce with Spanish colonies in America and the port and commercial activity of the city grew once again.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Palma became a refuge for many who had exiled themselves from the Napoleonic occupation of Catalonia and Valencia; during this period freedom flourished, until the absolutist restoration. With the establishment of contemporary Spanish state administrative organization, Palma became the capital of the new Balearic Islands province in the 1833 territorial division of Spain. The French occupation of Algeria in the 19th century ended the fear of Maghrebi attacks in Majorca, which favoured the expansion of new maritime routes, and consequently, the economic growth of the city.\n\n\n=== Modern period ===\n\nSince the advent of mass tourism in the 1950s, the city has been transformed into a tourist destination and has attracted many workers from mainland Spain. This has contributed to a huge change in the city's traditions, its language, and its economic power.\nThe boom in tourism has caused Palma to grow significantly. In 1960, Mallorca received 500,000 visitors, in 1997 it received more than 6,739,700. In 2001 more than 19,200,000 people passed through Son Sant Joan airport near Palma, with an additional 1.5 million coming by sea.\nIn the 21st century, urban redevelopment, by the so-called Pla Mirall (English \"Mirror Plan\"), had attracted groups of immigrant workers from outside the European Union, especially from Africa and South America.\nMore than half of the population works in tourism, approximately 80%, therefore being the main economic portal of Palma. Tourism has affected the rapid economic growth of Palma, making the island of Mallorca wealthier compared to other regions in Spain.\nThe second economic portal of Palma is agriculture. Main exports of Palma's agriculture are, almonds, oranges, lemons and olives. The island is also gifted with a wide variety of natural resources, such as mines of copper, lead and marble.The city also has several surrounding neighborhood communities including Establiments, Nord, Son Espanyol, Ces Cases Noves, and Sa Creu Vermella.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPalma is a major city and seaport located in the southwest of Mallorca, a western mediterranean island belonging to the Balearic Islands archipelago. The land area of the city is about 21.355 square kilometres (8.245 sq mi) with an altitude of 13 metres (43 feet) above sea level.\nThe city center of Palma is located north of the homonymous bay (Badia de Palma in the local Catalan language). The area that extends eastwards is mostly a flat fertile plain known as Es Pla. To the north and west, the city borders the Serra de Tramuntana, the island's major mountain range and a Unesco World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs of the 2009 census, the population of the city of Palma proper was 401,270, and the population of the entire urban area was 550,000, making it the twelfth largest urban area of Spain. By the start of 2019 the population of the city had risen to 416,065. Almost half of the total population of Mallorca lives in Palma.\nAs of 2017 over 60,000 non-Spanish foreigners registered with the town hall lived in Palma; the registered foreign population from 2016 to 2017 declined by 832, the numerically highest decline in the Balearics.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPalma has a Mediterranean climate, the climate classification named after the sea surrounding the city. There is a significant maritime influence to the mild winters, but summers are warmed by the surrounding continental landmasses. These warm up the offshore sea surface temperatures compared to in an ocean and as a result the small confines of Mallorca are still able to build up and sustain heat in spite of being on an island. There is vast seasonal lag, especially in late summer courtesy of the sea water peaking in temperatures long after the summer solstice.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya ===\nThe Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya is the transport hub of Palma. The Estaci\u00f3 Intermodal caters for buses and trains (the latter controlled by TIB). The two old buildings are home to the tourist information centre and several caf\u00e9s sit either side of the two large escalators which lead into the Estaci\u00f3, which sits underneath a large and popular park. On the lawns are several glass boxes, which let in light and ventilation to the station below ground. There are also train-themed playing structures, each one shaped like a train carriage and named after towns along the line of the Ferrocarril de S\u00f3ller, a railway dating back to 1911 which has its Palma Station right next to the park. Just down the street from here a new bus station is under construction. At the centre of the plaza is a statue of James I, Conquistador of Majorca.\n\n\n=== Cathedral area ===\n\nPalma is famous for La Seu, its vast cathedral built on a previous mosque which was built atop an original Christian church. Although construction of the present Cathedral began in 1229, it did not finish until 1601. Local architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed was drafted in to restore the building in 1901. The Parc de la Mar (Park of the Sea) lies just south, overlooked by the great building which sits above it on the city's stone foundations. Between the two are the town walls.\n\n\n=== The Rocks ===\nThe rocks located a short walk from the cathedral are a place of calm and tranquility.\n\n\n=== Old city ===\n\nThe Old City (in the south-east area of Palma behind the cathedral) is a maze of streets clearly hinting at an Arab past. With the exception of a few streets and squares which allow traffic and are populated with tourists most of the time, the walkways of this city quarter are fairly narrow, quiet streets, surrounded by a diverse range of interesting buildings, the architecture of which is comparable to cities such as Florence. The majority are private houses, some of which are open to the public as discreet museums or galleries. The Old City is also home to the Ajuntament (or Town Hall), the Convent of the Cathedral and the Banys \u00c0rabs.\n\n\n==== Banys \u00c0rabs ====\n\nThe Banys \u00c0rabs, or Arab Baths, one of the few remnants of Palma's Moorish past , are accessed via the quiet Ca'n Serra street near the Convent of the Cathedral, and include the lush gardens of Ca'n Fontirroig, home to Sardinian warblers, house sparrows, cacti, palm trees and a wide range of flowers and ferns. The small two-roomed brick building that once housed the baths is of Byzantine origin, dating back to the 11th century and possibly once part of the home of a Muslim nobleman. The bathroom has a cupola with five oculi which let in dazzling light. The twelve columns holding up the small room were pillaged from an earlier Roman construction. The floor over the hypocaust has been worn away by people standing in the centre, mainly to photograph the entrance and the garden beyond it. The whole room is in a rather dilapidated condition. The other room is a brick cube with a small model of the baths as they once were in the corner.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nNotable people who were born in the city include the following individuals.\n\n\u00c1lex Abrines, basketball player for the Oklahoma City Thunder\nMarco Asensio, footballer for Real Madrid\nConcha Buika, singer\nRudy Fern\u00e1ndez, basketball player for Real Madrid\nRamon Llull, philosopher and writer\nJorge Lorenzo, motorcyclist and five time MotoGP champion\nJoan Mir, motorcyclist and moto 3 champion\nGuillermo Pont, footballer\nLuis Salom, motorcyclist\nAgust\u00ed Villaronga, filmmaker\nRossy de Palma, actress\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nFootball is the most popular sport on the island, led by the Palma-based Segunda Divisi\u00f3n club Real Mallorca, who play at the Estadi de Son Moix, and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B club CD Atl\u00e9tico Baleares.\nBasketball is also a popular sport. Palma's top team is CB Bah\u00eda San Agust\u00edn, which plays its home games at the 5,076 capacity Palau Municipal d'Esports Son Moix.\nBecause of its maritime location all sea sports have also a big presence in Palma. Maybe the most important sporting event in the city is the Ciutat de Palma Prizes.\nRoad cycling is very popular in Mallorca. An international race for professional cyclists, the Vuelta a Mallorca, is held in February, the first day of which consists of a circuit race around the streets of Palma. The city is also home to the Palma Arena, a multi-platinum venue featuring a velodrome. The arena also hosted the Battle of Surfaces tennis event.\nIn June 2016, the city of Palma participated in the First World Company Sports Games which included five days of culture, sport and inclusivity within the community of Mallorca as a whole. It was operated through the World Federation Company Sport and was promoted for both local people and tourists to come together in the city. It became a large business venture by offering packages including accommodations close to the events and additional tourism information for future events.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPalma de Mallorca Metro\nMajorca rail network\nPalma de Mallorca Airport\nThe city bus system, which includes a loop line through the historic centre, is run by the EMT (See external link below).\nThere is also a bus system run by the TIB. This includes routes to and from the municipalities Calvi\u00e0 and Palma.\nIn the City of Palma there is a fleet of 1246 taxis. All equipped with air conditioning and most of them have a radiotelephone station, with four existing companies: Taxis Palma Radio, Radio-Taxi Ciutat, Taxi Tel\u00e9fono and Taxis adapted for users with reduced mobility. Until the change of colour regulated through the Municipal Decree No. 19985 of 15 October 1999, the taxis of Palma for 50 years had been of the characteristic black and ivory colours. Currently they are white.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nPalma de Mallorca is twinned with:\n\n Naples, Italy\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDuchess of Palma de Mallorca\nEdwin Lewis Snyder, \"Spain's Magic Island\", The Architect and Engineer, 110:10, 37\u201345, August 1932\nList of municipalities in Balearic Islands\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPalma sightseeing guide\nPalma de Mallorca\u00b4s city council\nOfficial Website for Tourism in Mallorca",

        "wiki": "Portofino (Italian pronunciation: [\u02ccp\u0254rto\u02c8fi\u02d0no]; Ligurian: Portofin [\u02ccp\u0254\u027etu\u02c8fi\u014b]) is an Italian fishing village and holiday resort famous for its picturesque harbour and historical association with celebrity and artistic visitors. It is a comune located in the Metropolitan City of Genoa on the Italian Riviera. The town is clustered around its small harbour, and is known for the colourfully painted buildings that line the shore.\n\n\n== History ==\nPliny the Elder (AD 23 \u2013 AD 79) referred to Portus Delphini (Port of the Dolphin) as on the Ligurian coast between Genoa and the Gulf of Tigullio.The village is mentioned in a diploma from 986 by Adelaide of Italy, which assigned it to the nearby Abbey of San Fruttuoso di Capodimonte. In 1171, together with the neighbouring Santa Margherita Ligure, it was included in Rapallo's commune jurisdiction. After 1229 it was part of the Republic of Genoa. The town's natural harbour supported a fleet of fishing boats, but was somewhat too cramped to provide more than a temporary safe haven for the growing merchant marine of the Republic of Genoa.\nIn 1409 Portofino was sold to the Republic of Florence by Charles VI of France, but when the latter was ousted from Genoa the Florentines gave it back. In the 15th century it was a fief of families such as the Fieschi, Spinola, Adorno, and Doria.\nIn 1815 it became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia and, from 1861, of the unified Kingdom of Italy.\nIn the late 19th century, first British, then other Northern European aristocratic tourists began to visit Portofino, which they reached by horse and cart from Santa Margherita Ligure. Aubrey Herbert and Elizabeth von Arnim were amongst the more famous English people to make the area fashionable. Eventually, more expatriates built expensive vacation houses, and by 1950 tourism had replaced fishing as the town's chief industry, and the waterfront was a continuous ring of restaurants and caf\u00e9s.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nStatue of Christ of the Abyss, placed underwater on 29 August 1954 in the inlet at a depth of 17 metres (56 ft). This statue was placed to protect fishermen and scuba divers and in memory of Dario Gonzatti, the first Italian to use SCUBA gear, who died in 1947. Sculpted by Guido Galletti, it represents Christ in the act of blessing while looking up towards the sky with open arms in a sign of peace.\nCastello Brown (16th century).\nChurch of St. Martin (Divo Martino, 12th century).\nChurch of St. George, housing some saints' relics.\nOratory of Santa Maria Assunta, in Gothic style.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Enchanted April, a 1922 best-selling novel by Elizabeth von Arnim based on the author's stay in Castello Brown, is credited with making Portofino fashionable. The novel was the basis of a 1991 feature filmed in the Castello, with a cast including Joan Plowright, Miranda Richardson and Alfred Molina. The film was nominated for three Oscars.Portofino is often thought to be the inspiration for Sir Clough Williams-Ellis' Italianate village named Portmeirion, built between 1925 and 1975, in north Wales. However, this was repeatedly denied by the architect. He stated only that he wanted to pay tribute to the atmosphere of the Mediterranean. He did, however, draw on a love of the Italian village, stating \"How should I not have fallen for Portofino? Indeed its image remained with me as an almost perfect example of the man-made adornment and use of an exquisite site.\"In 1959 Dalida released song \"Love in Portofino\", written by Leo Chiosso and composed by Fred Buscaglione. With lyrics in French and Italian language, it became a hit and was later iconized alongside the village's name. It also spawned several international covers, including Andrea Bocelli's in 2013 which was followed by a concert recorded and issued on DVD.Portofino is the eponym of Frank Schaeffer's Portofino: A Novel (1992). It was the first of Schaeffer's Calvin Becker Trilogy.Portofino is one of the shooting locations of the 1995 Antonioni / Wenders film, Beyond the Clouds.There is a full-scale replication, in authentic detail, of Portofino Bay at Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, USA, which opened in September 1999.Portofino inspired in 2001 a recreation of the seaside town in the Mediterranean Harbor area at Tokyo DisneySea in Chiba, Japan. It also served as the namesake for the restaurant Cafe Portofino.Portofino was also featured in 2008 for the television series Top Gear (Episode 5, Series 12). Richard Hammond, in a Ferrari Daytona raced James May in a carbon fibre powerboat from Portofino to St Tropez in France.Ferrari named one of their new V8 sports cars after Portofino in 2017.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nKing Richard I of England (1157-1199), in 1190\nPope Gregory XI (1330-1378), in 1377\nHenry Herbert (1831-1890), British Politician\nGuy de Maupassant (1850-1893), French writer\nGuglielmo Marconi (1874-1937), Italian engineer, inventor of radio\nGiuseppe Amisani (1879-1941), Italian painter\nMichele Cascella (1892-1989), Italian painter\nRex Harrison (1908-1990), English actor\nLilli Palmer (1914-1986), German actress, wife of Rex Harrison\n\n\n== Twin towns ==\n Kinsale, Republic of Ireland\n Palma, Spain\n Cassis, France\n\n\n== See also ==\nItalian Riviera\nList of castles in Italy\nCastello Brown\nCervara Abbey\nParaggi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Portofino travel guide from Wikivoyage\nPortofino\nPortofino tourism\nCity Hall\nPortofino Natural Park\nVirtual tour, Marine\nLove in Portofino song on YouTube",

        "wiki": "Calvi\u00e0 (locally [k\u0259lvi\u02c8a]) is a municipality on the island of Majorca, part of the Spanish autonomous community of the Balearic Islands.  It is located in the southwestern part of the island of Majorca, between the Serra de Tramuntana and the Serra de Na Burguesa. The municipal seat is the town of Vila Calvia.Calvi\u00e0 has an approximate area of 145 km2 (56 sq mi). It is bordered on the north by the municipalities of Puigpunyent and Estellencs, Palma de Mallorca (Palma), the island's capital to the east, Andratx to the west and to the south by the Mediterranean Sea.\nAccording to the 2008 census, the municipality had a population of 50,777 inhabitants, of whom 18,046 were foreigners. Today, it is the second most populated area of the entire archipelago Balearic after Palma, and also an area that has the largest number of tourists in the islands.  Its population is scattered around the different urban centers created as a result of tourism development and twentieth century urbanization.\nThe historical epic that marked the most important local culture and traditions regarding the rest of Mallorca is the landing in Santa Ponsa on 10 September 1229 of King James I of Aragon, and the subsequent conquering of Muslims who had arrived in the year 903. Since 1248, Calvi\u00e0 has had its own parochial church, Sante Ihoannes Caviano.  Despite the popularity and use of the official shield locally, the municipality has no flag.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe origin of the place name is subject to conjecture but is believed to be from the patronymic Latin calvianum, derived from the personal name of Calvius. According to the philologist Antoni Maria Alcover, it comes from the word Caluus, meaning \"burn\" or \"be hot\", testament to the arid land that contains no vegetation.  The official name is Calvi\u00e0 (with a grave accent), but in Castilian, Calvi\u00e1 (with an acute accent) is used.Officially, the adjective to refer to inhabitants of Calvi\u00e0 is calvienses or calvieros. However, more widespread use in both Catalan and in its Castilian translation is calvianero/a. This is used by agencies such as the Institut Calvianer d'Esports del Ajuntament de Calvi\u00e0 and the Asociaci\u00f3n Calvianera.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\nThe municipality does not have a flag but has a distinctive coat of arms, defined as an azure blue shield with a paschal lamb holding a flag with a St George's Cross, capped by a crown. The coat of arms was approved on 25 June 1976 emblazoned with De azur y el cordero de plata que empu\u00f1a en su mano derecha una bandera de aquel metal, cargada con cruz de gules. Al timbre corona real, cerrada..\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nCalvi\u00e0 first appears in history as a village 2,000 years BCE, although the area was first populated in the Neolithic Era.  Later, sailors coming from the east stopped in the Balearics on their way to the Iberian Peninsula, where they sought metals. They came from Italy, from other Mediterranean islands, and from the Near East, and constructed small settlements along the coast. Historians call this period the \"Cave Culture\", because caves were frequently used as habitations and burial areas. Some vestiges of this area have been catalogued in an archaeological excavation called the Puig de sa Morisca Archaeological Park, which conserves remains of what was a talaiot 9 metres (30 ft) in diameter. It is located on a small mountainous elevation in Calvi\u00e0's Santa Ponsa district.\nThe Roman era lasted from 123 BCE until the 4th century CE, but left no significant vestiges. Among the few archaeological remnants of this era are the remains of a Roman villa in Santa Ponsa known as Sa Mesquida, which has an oven that was used to make ceramics, the horse-shoe shaped Naveta Alemany and the Tur\u00f3 de Ses Abelles.\nIn 425, the area was invaded by the Vandals, who ended up settling. Lack of remains or written record means little is known about this area other than the decline that began with the destruction of Pollen\u00e7a. The Byzantine general Flavius Belisarius ordered the conquest of the archipelago in 534, bringing an end to this era.\nThe first Muslim arrivals were in 707. They quickly ended the Byzantine domination and established their own hegemony. Until 903, the island was part of the Umayyad Caliphate.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 903, the Almoravid general Isam al-Jawlani conquered the island on behalf of Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi, Emir of C\u00f3rdoba. The city of Palma passed from the Almoravids to the Almohads, eventually becoming part of one of the taifas. Calvi\u00e1 was part of the administrative division Juz' d' Ahwaz al-Madina.\nIn 1229, after the Conquest of Mallorca by King James I of Aragon, colonists brought the Catalan language and culture, which survive to the present time. In the division of the conquered territory, Calvi\u00e0 formed part of the medietas magnatum that the king granted to nobles Guillermo II de Montcada, Hugo de Ampurias, Nu\u00f1o S\u00e1nchez and Berenguer de Palou, all of whom had participated in the conquest. Calvi\u00e0 in particular was granted to Berenguer de Palou, Bishop of Barcelona, becoming part of the Barony of the Bishops of Barcelona. There were many tensions among the conquering nobles who were granted various feudal rights; these were resolved through a pariatge or condominium under which feudal rights were shared. Therefore, the surroundings of the municipality are also known as the comarca of the Pariatge. Ultimately, though, the rights accrued to the Bishopric, which held them until 1834 when the Spanish Church lost many of its feudal properties.\n\nThe conquerors came, in various proportions from a variety of places. Thus, and according to the Llibre del Repartiment (\"Book of Distribution\"), the conquered lands were distributed among people from Catalonia (39.71%), Occitania (24.26%), Italy (16.19%), Aragon (7.35%), Navarra (5.88%), France (4.42%), Castile (1.47%) and Flanders (0.73%). Owing to the extermination or expulsion of the greater part of the prior local populace, there were not enough laborers to cultivate the land. In 1230 a set of privileges called the Franquezas de Mallorca were granted in order to attract new settlers to cultivate the countryside. Most of these new settlers of Mallorca came from Catalonia, more specifically the northeast and, within the east, from Ampurd\u00e1n. As a result, the dialect spoken today (Mallorqu\u00ed) is an eastern Catalan dialect.\nSince 1248, Calvi\u00e0 has had its own parish church, Sante Ihoannes Caviano, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. In 1285, during the reign of James II of Aragon, second son of James I, it gained the status of a villa. This meant it would have its own mayor, named by the king or governor. The mayor would execute orders from higher levels of government and would also maintain public order and administer justice. Nonetheless, he did not have the power to administer the villa, which fell within the purview of the jurados de prohombre, (a medieval office that was essentially a district overseer).\n\nIn the Middle Ages, various watchtowers were built to defend against Mediterranean piracy.To sustain the parish and its clerics, the king and the tenured landowners of the jurisdiction ceded one fourth of the diezmos paid to them by those who cultivated the land. This was, in turn, divided into four parts, three of which were granted to the rector of the parish and the fourth to the parish priest or vicar.James II of Majorca reigned over the islands for more than two decades and made great efforts to guarantee the viability of his kingdom. He undertook a broad policy of agrarian colonization, with the creation of rural nuclei; increased the royal revenue; favored the creation of consulates in North Africa and in the kingdom of Granada; created a new monetary system for the kingdom; promoted the creation of textile industries; increased royal power relative to that of the nobility and Church; and promoted the construction of palaces and castles such as the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, the La Seu Cathedral in Palma, and the Bellver Castle. The opening of the trials of the Knights Templar and the later suppression of the order allowed the Crown to take over their revenues in the islands.\nThe health system consisted mainly of physicians of Jewish origins, so-called Xuetas, descendants of Mallorcan Jews who had converted to Christianity, but continued to form a largely endogamous community. The nearest hospital to Calvi\u00e0 was in Sant Elm, founded in 1303 by Jaime II. Fundamentally it was dedicated to merchants and sailors of the ships that were heading from Palma to Barcelona. They also used it  as a refuge in bad weather.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nFrom the 13th century to the mid-20th century, the region was almost entirely agricultural. The first area to be cultivated was along the banks of the Bay of Santa Ponsa; at the time, the area was referred to as the t\u00e9rmino de Santa Ponsa; the expression t\u00e9rmino de Calvi\u00e1 came far later. Despite the long coast, people turned their backs to the sea, deriving their living from the dry and none-too-fertile land.\nAgriculture was based on latifundia\u2014large estates\u2014from the 14th century into the 20th. Most of the land was owned by a small number of nobles. In 1863, continuing a longstanding pattern 66.3% of the land was owned by four proprietors. At a slightly earlier date, Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana owned 2,516 hectares (6,220 acres), including all of Bendinat, Paguera, as well as an additional 990 hectares (2,400 acres) in the municipality of Andraitx. The Marquis of Bellpuig owned 4,376 hectares (10,810 acres) in Santa Ponsa, the largest latifundium in Mallorca at the beginning of the 19th century. On the other hand, there was a small group of peasants known as els roters, to whom the nobility had ceded land near the sea. These roters cultivated cereals, and lived in miserable conditions.\nIn the 16th century, Calvi\u00e0 itself largely escaped the plague that decimated the population elsewhere, although other nearby municipalities such as Andraitx suffered the scourge of the epidemic. Still, the population suffered other epidemics associated with the era and their way of life, particularly malaria which only a few escaped, such as the priest or the few artisans who did not work in Ses Rotes. The daily wage of a farm laborer was between four and six sous (a dozen eggs cost one-and-a-half sous). In that era there were also Arab slaves, although not in the maritime zones, where they were seen as liable to escape or to collaborate with pirates. In the 18th century a severe drought and bad cereal harvest led to a long period of famine. On 28 November 1715, Philip V of Spain abolished the fueros and privileges of the Balearics, as the Nueva Planta decrees extended the administrative organization of the Kingdom of Castile, prohibited the Catalan language, and required the use of Castilian Spanish in the islands. In 1748 the wretchedness of the municipality had become so severe that chronicler Pere Xamena Fiol described it as follows:\n\nWheat became so expensive that one paid 25 Sous per barchilla (unit to measure cereals, approximately 13.75 litres or 14.53 US quarts), and fortunate was he who could find some. Hunger reached the point where each house got no more than two doblers of bread, even if the family was large, and they gave permission to eat meat during Lent, and many people who didn't have the money to buy meat ate herbs, and they told me that some people had gone more than a fortnight eating only boiled herbs, and the poor people and workers were so thin that they couldn't work for lack of food.\nThe economic system rooted in latifundia underlay the Caciquism that made moot the theoretically democratic Spanish constitutions the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century. In Restoration Spain the power of the dominant classes remained intact. Both major political parties of the time, the Conservative Party led by Canovas del Castillo and the Liberal Party led by Sagasta relied on a system where day laborers and smallholders beholden to the caciques and voted accordingly, producing an orderly alternation of the two parties in power, the turno pac\u00edfico. In the late 19th century, hunger and poverty sparked emigration to the Americas, especially to Cuba and Argentina, as well as to France and Algeria.Calvi\u00e1 at that time lacked industrial establishments, except for the manufacturing of cement and plaster. The latifundia system was largely an impoverished agrarian autarky. In 1923 the Federaci\u00f3 Obrera Calvianera (\"Federation of Calvian Workers\") was founded as a member of the socialist Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores, followed by the Uni\u00f3 Agr\u00e0ria de Calvi\u00e0 (Calvian Agrarian Union) and La Fraternal. On 30 September 1923, Spain's socialist party, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, inaugurated a Casa del pueblo (a cultural and service center), which represented an investment of half a million Spanish pesetas. The labor movement and socialism played an important part in politics during the Second Spanish Republic, but were squashed during the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\n=== Contemporary era ===\n\nThe first seed of the modern tourism-based economy came when steamboat service from Barcelona to Palma began in 1838. This made travel to Mallorca easier for travelers from the Iberian peninsula and beyond. Some came to visit the municipality's coves and beaches. At this time Mallorca drew visitors who were motivated by the desire for adventure, an interest in exploring a different world and society than the one they knew, but also those who came to the island for therapeutic reasons. Among this last group was the composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. Works published by travelers, learned people, artists and geographers increasingly promoted Mallorca as a preferred destination.\nIn 1962, Calvi\u00e0 had four butcher shops, three bakeries, a dairy, ten grocery shops, three caf\u00e9s, two haberdashers, five carpenter's shops, two blacksmiths, a bicycle shop, and one bus line. Its scant industry consisted of five master masons, various ventures in shipping and transport, two cement and plaster factories, a trader in nuts and dried fruit, a machine for shucking almonds, a flour mill, a carob crusher, a wood dealer, and an oil press.\nThe first urban nuclei in the municipality began development in 1920, built on failed agricultural land sold well below its potential value. By 1960, changes in ownership had been so fundamental as to facilitate immediate development. Three quarters of the coast was rapidly developed, including all of the most desirable areas. Through their real estate affiliates, some of the last large landowners, such as Miguel Nigorra Oliver, president of the Banco de Cr\u00e9dito Balear, came to control nearly all of the development of Santa Ponsa. By 1986, the municipality had 10,000 of the dwellings locally known as chal\u00e9s (\"chalets\").On 30 July 2009, around two in the afternoon, the Palmanova neighborhood suffered a bombing attack by ETA. Two members of the Civil Guard were killed by a bomb placed under a patrol car outside their barracks; a second similar bomb was discovered and successfully defused.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nCalvi\u00e0 is located in the western part of the island of Majorca, next to the Sierra de Tramontana, the main mountain of the Balearic Islands, and extends to the Sierra de Na Burguesa, a mountain located in Calvia. Calvia has an area of about 145.02 km 2. Of a total of 14,372 hectares, 81% is protected rural land, 18% is developed urban land and 1% are soils with low protection.  It is bordered on the north by the municipality of Puigpunyent and Estellencs, Palma de Mallorca (Palma), the island's capital to the east, Andratx to the west and to the south by the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe highest point of the municipality is the Puig de Galatz\u00f3 at 1,026 m (3,366 ft) above sea level. The second is 926 metres above sea level, the Mola del Esclop, an area which consists of many valleys and ravines, between the hills of Puig Batiat and Penya Blanca.The peninsula on which the municipality is located is marked by the presence of wetlands to the east and west, at Magalluf, Palma Nova and Santa Ponsa, that lead to a narrowing similar to an isthmus to the north.The urban area has expanded around its coastline, converting into several villages on the main beaches. The coast extends from Cape Andritxol, until the area of Cas Catal\u00e0 Ses Illetas. It is 54 km (34 mi) long and very rocky, but still has 34 beaches and coves. There is 35.5 kilometres of rocky shores, 4.5 kilometres of sandy beaches, 10 islets and 7,000 hectares of coast, with a maximum depth of 5 m (16 ft). Islets include El Sec, Sa Porrassa, D'en Sales, Ses Illetes, D'estenedor and Sa Caleta. The most important though, ecologically, are the Malgrats and El Toro, having been designated as marine reserves and a special protection area for birds.\n\n\n=== Localities ===\nThe municipality contains eighteen settlements. The most important are the resorts. Palma Nova was one of the first tourist resorts to be built on the island within the grounds of an old farm called Ses Planes and began as a project intended to build a residential type Garden City, but due to the Spanish Civil War, this idea was discarded. In 2009, it was considered one of the most important tourist areas of Majorca. It is bounded on the west by the busy town of Magaluf which contains the largest hotel and greatest infrastructural services of the municipality to accommodate the many tourists.  Another of the localities, Santa Ponsa, has historical significance as the place that James I of Aragon landed. The town of Portals Nous is also a renowned meeting point for businessmen, celebrities, high society figures and members of the Spanish Royal Family during their summer stays in the Marivent Palace. Another of its main tourist areas is Paguera, where many residents spend their summer holidays, as well as a number of German tourists. Similarly, the urbanized residential areas of El Toro, which has a marina and a small beach, and Son Ferrer, are of note.\n\n\n=== Geology and relief ===\n\nThe topography is marked by the contrast between the mountains in the north and the rest of the municipality, where the features are flatter.\nThe main mountain range is called the Serra de Na Burguesa, situated between Son Falconer and Son Vida in Palma. It is the southernmost range of the Serra de Tramuntana. It was formerly known as Portop\u00ed or d'en Bou. It has an average height of 500 meters and is covered by large formations of Mediterranean pine forest and scrubland. The hills are composed of Triassic and Jurassic materials, mainly limestone and dolomite, with marl and gypsum present as well. The hills have a complex tectonic structure, forming a relief fold with many faults. The karst nature of the Tramuntana has led to the formation of numerous caves and sinkholes.The rest of the municipality is relatively flat, with broad valleys filled by quaternary and tertiary materials and small hills, with Mesozoic materials surfacing occasionally. This area contains a number of cavities divided between the area of Es Coll des Pastors and around the Puig Gros de Bendinat, Son Boronat, Benatiga Nou and Valldurgent. The Puig Gros de Bendinat depression contains abundant late Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments.  Its coastline is composed of calcareous materials.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCalvi\u00e0 has a mild Mediterranean climate with an average annual temperature of 19 \u00b0C and an average annual rainfall of 410 mm (16 in). It is influenced by two types of atmospheric circulation manifested in two distinct seasons: a hot, dry summer with little pressure gradient and occasional rainfall, as opposed to a cool, wet winter. The coldest month is January, with 15.1 / 3.5 \u00b0C and the hottest is August, with 31.0 / 18.2 \u00b0C. Rainfall averages 51 days a year and there are approximately 2,756 hours of sunshine. The average temperature in the summer is 27 \u00b0C, and 14 \u00b0C in winter. The driest month is July, at an average of 7.8 l / m2, while the wettest is December with an average of 81.1 l / m2.  The area is sheltered from the Nordic Tramuntana wind by mountains that are over a thousand feet high.\nThe thermal variation of the water has a range of around 15 \u00b0C. During the winter, it drops down to about 13 \u00b0C. In the late spring, warming occurs, raising the temperature one degree each week. During the summer, a 25 cm deep water layer reaches temperatures above 25 \u00b0C.(something of a thermocline).\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\nAccording to the Instituto Geol\u00f3gico y Minero de Espa\u00f1a (IGME), the area receives 4,900,000 cubic metres (6,400,000 cu yd) of rain per year, plus 100,000 cubic metres (130,000 cu yd) runoff from irrigation and 200,000 cubic metres (260,000 cu yd) infiltration of treated waste-water. 6,700,000 cubic metres (8,800,000 cu yd) is pumped annually for the water supply, but the current Balearic Hydrological Plan intends to reduce this to 4,100,000 cubic metres (5,400,000 cu yd).\n\n\n==== Ravines ====\nBecause of the torrential rains in October and November, Mallorca has many ravines, narrow channels that bring the rainwater to the sea. Among these are the Torrente (ravine) des Gorg, which rises in Es Capdell\u00e0 and enters the sea at Peguera. The Torrente Vial, rises on the outskirts of the village of Vial and runs to the Cala (cove) de Santa Ponsa; it receives the water of hundreds of smaller ravines, among which are the Barranco des Cobaix and the Barranco des Pas de la Mula. Among the longest is the Torrente de Galatz\u00f3, running 23 kilometres (14 mi) and draining a basin of 72 square kilometres (28 sq mi). It begins on the west slope of the Puig de Galatz\u00f3 and reaches the sea at the Bay of Santa Ponsa (Santa Pon\u00e7a).\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n\nMore than 49% of Calvi\u00e0's 14,552 hectares (35,960 acres) consists of woods and garrigues (low, soft-leaved scrubland), with pines as the dominant trees, although there has been some deforestation in recent decades. Cultivable land amounts to about 32% of the municipality; the main crops are almonds, carob (Ceratonia siliqua), olives and, to a lesser extent, figs. There is also still some farming of cereals and grains.\nAlthough the area has a harsh climate with few natural resources it is also densely populated by humans and there are relatively few populations of wild animals. The most notable zones for fauna are the rocky shore and the islands of Cala Figuera (Figuera Cove), such as El Toro, the islet of Refeubetx and the group of islets known as the Malgrats. This area has international recognition by the European Commission as a Special Protection Area for birds. In 2008, a diver in this reserve sighted and photographed a monk seal (Monachus monachus); it is believed that no more than 500 monk seals survive in the entire world. The Balearic government has studied the possibility of reintroducing monk seals to the islands.Local native plant species include holm oak (Quercus ilex) and various pine species. There are over 1,000 animal species; notable among them are the seabirds Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), various cormorants (Phalacrocorax), the common swift (Apus apus), and the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) as well as numerous reptiles, such as the endemic Lilford's wall lizard (Podarcis lilfordi) found on several of the islets of the archipelago. The islets are also home to one of Spain's few colonies of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni; other colonies are in Murcia and Almer\u00eda).Although the vegetation on the cliffs is sparse, it merits special interest as a habitat for endemic plant species such as the perennial herb Hippocrepis balearica, and Dianthus alpinus, whose Spanish-language names variously designate it as the \"cliff carnation\", \"forest carnation\" or \"Mediterranean carnation\". The cliff also provides a habitat for birds, especially raptors such as Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae) and osprey (Pandion haliaetus) as well as the world's only remaining insular cinereous vultures (black vulture, Aegypius monachus). Also worthy of mention, if only for gastronomical reasons, are two species of snail, Cornu aspersum and Helix pomatia.\nAmong the fungi, the autumn rains bring out the reproductive structures of the mushrooms. Of particular note is  Lactarius sangifluus, known locally as esclata-sang. This Lactarius is much appreciated for its singular flavor, and figures prominently in the local cuisine.The forest plants of the region can be divided into four groups:\n\nHerbaceous plants: the most common of these are nettles, fiddle dock (Rumex pulcher), and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare); heather(Calluna vulgaris) can also be found. Five endemic species of Limonium have evolved in the salty soils of Magalluf. In the garrigue of Santa Ponsa are several varieties of orchid (Orchis collina).\nShrubs: the most common shrub is the Mediterranean buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus), but there are also rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis),  thyme, a species of rock rose (Cistus albidus) several species of asparagus (Asparagus acutifolius, Asparagus albus, Asparagus officinalis), and common ivy (Hedera helix). Protected species include Mediterranean fan palm (Chamaerops humilis), myrtles, and Phoenicean juniper (Juniperus phoenicea).\nFerns: ferns of the Polypodium genus can be found in cooler or more shaded areas.\nTrees: the most common tree in the region's forests is Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis). These are plagued by a moth known as the pine processionary (Thaumetopoea pityocampa). A special brigade targets this moth, setting traps and destroying their nests. In the northern part of the province, although in lesser measure, there is holm oak (Quercus ilex), white poplar (Populus alba), narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), and strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMost of the people are either Spaniards from the mainland\u2014mainly from Andalusia\u2014or their descendants, who reached the island in the early 1960s, or they are foreign immigrants. According to the 2008 census, the municipality has a population of 50,777 inhabitants, of whom 25,548 were males and 25,229 were women ( 50.31% versus 49.69%).  The municipality has the second highest population in the Balearic Islands, second only to the capital, Palma de Mallorca.In 2017 the population was 49,063, including 14,822 foreigners (non-Spanish) registered with the town hall. The total population reached above 50,000 in 2008 but in 2015 began decreasing; in 2016 it had 49,580 people, including 15,623 registered foreigners.\n\n\n=== Population pyramid ===\nAnalysis of the population pyramid shows that:\n\n21% of the population is under the age of 20.\n32% of the population is aged 20\u201339 years.\n32% of the population is aged 40\u201359 years.\n15% of the population is 60 or older.This structure is typical of the modern demographic regime seen in much of Western Europe, with a population slowly aging as the birth rate diminishes.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe area contains many of Majorca's major tourism hotspots, with the localities of Magaluf (3,865), Santa Ponsa (8,188), El Toro (2,002), Paguera (3,400), Illetas (3,286), Portals Nous (2,395) and Palma Nova (5,975). It embraces six tourist zones with 60 kilometres of coastline, 27 beaches, 4 sport ports and 120.000 tourist units. The proximity of Palma with major road connections means that it can take as little as 15 minutes to reach the city centre. With massive tourism, estimated at 1.6 million visits per year and with a resident population that itself includes many expatriates, it is impossible to evaluate municipal income or expenditure as it relates only to the residents. What one can say is that Calvi\u00e0 appears to be one of the wealthiest municipalities in Europe, based on per capita public investment. In the early 1960s, Calvi\u00e0 began building a complete infrastructure for massive tourism, such as rapid construction of hotels. Later, more touristic features were added which included four professional golf courses (Club de Golf Poniente, Golf Sta Pon\u00e7a I, Golf Sta Pon\u00e7a II, Golf Sta Pon\u00e7a III and Golf Bendinat), water parks, a modern promenade called Paseig Calvi\u00e0. The 2004 World Chess Olympiad was held in Calvi\u00e0.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBisson, T. N. (1988). Hist\u00f2ria de la Corona d'Arag\u00f3 a l'Edat Mitjana (in Catalan).

        "wiki": "Juan Alberto March Ordinas (4 October 1880 \u2013 10 March 1962) was a Spanish businessman closely associated with the Nationalist side, led by Francisco Franco during and after the Spanish Civil War. Juan March was the wealthiest man in Spain and the sixth richest man in the world. The March family are among the richest in Spain, reported to be worth over US$5 billion.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJuan March Ordinas was born in Santa Margalida on the island of Majorca. As a young man, he smuggled tobacco from North Africa into Spain. During World War I, he supplied goods to both sides, evading the Allied blockade of the Central Powers, and the German U-boats.\nHis power and influence increased under different Spanish governments during the reign of King Alfonso XIII. In 1926 he created the Banca March in Majorca.\nWhen the monarchy was replaced by the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, March lost his influence, and was convicted and imprisoned for his illegal dealings. He escaped from prison, and fled to Gibraltar where his influence with the British government protected him against extradition.\nMarch was an important backer of the 1936 military rebellion against the Republic which led to the Civil War. He arranged Franco's flight from the Canary Islands to Spanish Morocco, brought the colonial troops there into the rebellion, and personally financed the Italian airlift of those troops to southern Spain.\nWith the Nationalist victory in 1939, March regained all his former influence and more, and was greatly favored in Francoist Spain. During World War II, the Allies employed him to keep Spain from joining the Axis. According to recently declassified documents, in 1941 the British government gave him US$10,000,000 with which to influence the top Spanish generals.\nIn 1944, March became a supporter of the claim of Don Juan de Borb\u00f3n, who had turned pro-Allies, to the Spanish throne. He also owned newspapers and funded political parties.\nAfter World War II, he was the seventh-richest man in the world. In 1955, he established the Juan March Foundation to support the arts, music, and social sciences.\nJuan March married Leonor Servera (1887\u20131957). They had two children: Juan March Servera (Palma de Mallorca, 1906 \u2013 Madrid, 1973) and Bartolome March (Palma de Mallorca, 1917 \u2013 Paris, 1998).\nBartolome March amassed one of the greatest 20th century art collections. At a young age, he started buying books and manuscripts. Later, he collected 18th century French furniture, and Baroque, Impressionist, Modern, and contemporary art, including works of Murillo, Goya, Vel\u00e1zquez, Picasso, Monet, Van Gogh, Mir\u00f3, Kandinsky, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, L\u00e9ger, Dal\u00ed, Fontana, Rothko, Klein, Francis Bacon, and many others. The March family collection is one of the most important in the world, and is reported to be worth over 1 billion USD.\nThe March family are still one of the richest families in Spain (after Amancio Ortega from Zara). They live between Madrid, Majorca and Gstaad. The Casa March, an imposing villa overlooking Cala Ratjada, Majorca and surrounded by an expansive sculpture garden, was built by Juan March in 1915; the gardens are open to guided tours.\n\n\n== Barcelona Traction ==\nMarch was widely known for involvement in lucrative illegal activities, bribery, political influence, and bending the law whenever he saw a benefit. This was exemplified in his 1948 takeover of the Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power Company (BTLP) for a small fraction of its real worth.\nBTLP was a utility company which provided power and streetcar services in Barcelona; originally incorporated in Canada, it was mostly owned by Belgian investors. BTLP had come through the Spanish Civil War largely undamaged, and was quite profitable. Its assets were about \u00a310,000,000 (about $500 million in 2010). However, for the convenience of some of its foreign investors, BTLP had issued some bonds denominated in pounds, and the interest on these bonds was payable in pounds. The Spanish government had imposed currency restrictions: BTLP was unable to exchange its Spanish pesetas for pounds, and so could not pay the interest.\nThis was not viewed with any great alarm by the bondholders; BTLP had plenty of pesetas and would pay the interest arrears whenever the currency restrictions were relaxed.\nHowever, March sensed an opportunity. Agents secretly acting for him quietly bought up the bonds (about \u00a3500,000). Then in February 1948, they appeared in a Spanish court, asserted that BTLP was in default on the bonds, and demanded immediate relief. The judge agreed and awarded ownership of all BTLP's assets to them (in fact to March). BTLP's foreign investors appealed, but got no relief from Spanish courts. The Belgian government appealed to the International Court of Justice but to no avail: the final resolution coming in 1970, eight years after March's death.\nThere is an example of March's worldwide notoriety in John D. MacDonald's 1962 novel, The Girl, the Gold Watch & Everything. At one point, one of the chief villains of the story complains of the difficulties of operating in the United States, where the police are honest and the press interferes. He remarks:\n\nIt was always better elsewhere, particularly in Spain, where Juan March would help with the arrangements.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nJuan March Ordinas is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Spanish lizard, Algyroides marchi.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDe Benavides, Manuel (1934).

        "wiki": "Las Palmas (UK: , US: ; Spanish: [las \u02c8palmas]), officially Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, is a city and capital of Gran Canaria island, in the Canary Islands, on the Atlantic Ocean.\nIt is the capital (jointly with Santa Cruz de Tenerife), the most populous city in the autonomous community of the Canary Islands, and the ninth-largest city in Spain with a population of 383,308 in 2010. It is also the fifth-most populous urban area in Spain and (depending on sources) ninth- or tenth-most populous metropolitan area in Spain.Las Palmas is located in the northeastern part of the island of Gran Canaria, about 150 km (93 mi) off the Moroccan coast in the Atlantic Ocean. Las Palmas experiences a hot desert climate, offset by the local cooler Canary Current, with warm temperatures throughout the year. It has an average annual temperature of 21.2 \u00b0C (70.2 \u00b0F). According to a study carried out by Thomas Whitmore, director of research on climatology at Syracuse University in the U.S., Las Palmas enjoys \"the best climate in the world\".The city was founded in 1478, and considered the de facto (without legal recognition) capital of the Canary Islands until the seventeenth century. It is the home of the Canarian Ministry of Presidency (shared in a four-year term with Santa Cruz de Tenerife), as well as half of the ministries and boards of the Canarian government, and the High Court of Justice of the Canary Islands.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe city was founded by Juan Rej\u00f3n on 24 June 1478, with the name \"Real de Las Palmas\". Rej\u00f3n was head of the invading Castilian army, which then engaged in war with the locals.In 1492, Christopher Columbus (Spanish: Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n) anchored in the port of Las Palmas and spent some time on the island on his first trip to the Americas. He also stopped there on the way back to Spain. The Col\u00f3n House museum in the Vegueta area of the city is named after him.\nIn 1595, Francis Drake tried to plunder the town, leading to the Battle of Las Palmas. A Dutch raid under vice-admiral Pieter van der Does in 1599 was only slightly more successful; some of the town was destroyed, but the raiders were repelled.\nLas Palmas' seaport, Puerto de la Luz (known internationally as La Luz port), benefited greatly from the closure of the Suez Canal during the Suez Crisis. Many foreign workers migrated to the city at this time.\nLas Palmas is a sister city of San Antonio, Texas, in the United States, which was founded in 1718 by about 25 Canary Islanders.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nLas Palmas is divided into five administrative districts, which in turn are subdivided into districts, not necessarily consistent with the traditional neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city has four main beaches: Las Canteras, Las Alcaravaneras, La Laja, and El Confital.\n\nPlaya de Las Canteras (Las Canteras Beach) is the largest beach in the city, and is frequented throughout the year by city dwellers as well as by large numbers of foreign visitors. The beach lies on the west side of the isthmus of Guanarteme, which links the peninsula of La Isleta, located to the northeast, with the rest of the island of Gran Canaria. The 3,100 m beach is oriented toward the northwest in what is known as Confital bow or bay, and stretches from the foothills of La Isleta until shortly before the mouth of the ravine Tamaraceite. Along much of this length, the beach is sheltered from most of the waves and currents of the Atlantic by a natural barrier of coral sandstone popularly known as \"the bar\", which is in easy swimming distance from shore. A system for environmental management has been introduced, and the beach has received ISO 14001 certification \u2013 one of only three beaches in Spain to do so, namely La Concha in San Sebasti\u00e1n and La Victoria in C\u00e1diz. Inside the beach runs the Paseo de Las Canteras, a wide pedestrian boardwalk, or sidewalk, which runs parallel to the beach from near the Auditorio Alfredo Kraus to the area known as \"Puntilla\" until reaching Playa del Confital.  La Playa de Las Canteras covers three areas that correspond to the arches and inflections that it conducts on the coast. Each presents certain morphological characteristics.\n\nPlaya de Las Alcaravaneras (Las Alcaravaneras beach) extends from the rising side of the Isthmus of Guanarteme, an old spit of sand dunes and mountains linking the peninsula of La Isleta, located to the northeast, with the rest of the island of Gran Canaria. It extends from the Real Club N\u00e1utico de Gran Canaria to the new marina breakwater of the city, for just over 800 metres (1\u20442 mi) of fine golden sand. The whole beach is serviced by the promenade, which starts in Las Alcaravaneras, connects with the Playa de San Cristobal, and ends in Playa de La Laja, 16 kilometres (10 mi) to the south. The promenade is one of the recreational areas of the city and is popular with people who take the opportunity to walk, run, play sports, or cycle. The tranquility of the bay, and yacht clubs close to the existing beach, make Playa de Las Alcaravaneras a great place to practice sports such as sailing and canoeing. The beach also offers facilities for sports such as beach volleyball, beach soccer or futv\u00f3ley (which has organized tournaments in the summer) and court sports such as basketball, indoor soccer, and volleyball.\nPlaya de la Laja (La Laja Beach), with fine gray sand, is approximately 1200 m long and has an average width of 40 m. Its moderate waves and currents are no longer dangerous since the construction of a dam in the south in the 1990s. At the time, the Ministry of Environment also trawled the seabed to bring sand onto the beach, and the construction of a boardwalk has significantly improved pedestrian access. Due to the intensity of its streams and incoming waves, La Laja has been hailed as a favorite surfers' beach. It is the starting point for boat races that occur every weekend between April and October.\nPlaya del Confital (Confital Beach), southwest of the peninsula of La Isleta, is the northern part of the large bay which contains Playa de Las Canteras and Playa del Confital. While Playa de Las Canteras is a long and wide, sandy beach, Playa del Confital is a narrower and mostly hard, volcanic beach equipped with comfortable foot paths and large, slanted slabs of stone suitable for relaxing, exercising and sunbathing. Advanced off the beach surfing replaces swimming as the major water activity on Playa del Confital. Until some years ago, the beach was home to a small shanty town, which has since been eradicated and the land of the Playa del Confital returned to general, public use. Ensuing improvements, however, proved controversial as some environmental organizations and residents questioned the legality of the proceedings. The waves arriving at the beach are highly thought of by amateur and professional surfers alike, some of whom consider the Confital as having one of the best right hand breaks in Europe. Here, the ocean currents form a tube that is used by more experienced surfers for its speed and strong contrasts. Each year, qualifying events for the professional world surfing championship take place on this beach.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLas Palmas has a desert climate (BWh) with warm dry summers and warm enough winters to classify it as a tropical climate. Its average annual temperature is 21.2 \u00b0C (70.2 \u00b0F)\u201328 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) during the day and 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) at night. In January, the coldest month, the temperature typically ranges from 19 to 23 \u00b0C (66 to 73 \u00b0F) (and sometimes higher) during the day, and around 15 to 16 \u00b0C (59 to 61 \u00b0F) at night, with an average sea temperature at 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F). In the warmest months \u2013 August and September \u2013 the temperature typically ranges from 27 to 30 \u00b0C (81 to 86 \u00b0F) during the day, above 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) at night, with the average sea temperature at 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). Large fluctuations in temperature are rare.\nAugust 1990 was the warmest month on record, with the average maximum temperature of the month during the day being 30.6 \u00b0C (87.1 \u00b0F). The highest temperature ever recorded was 44.2 \u00b0C (111.6 \u00b0F), and the coldest temperature ever recorded was 9.4 \u00b0C (48.9 \u00b0F). The highest wind speed ever recorded was on 28 November 2005, measuring 113 km/h (70.21 mph). Las Palmas city has never recorded any snow or sleet.\nAnnual average relative humidity is 66%, ranging from 64% in March to 69% in October. The amount of annual sunshine hours is above 2,800 per year, from around 190 in winter (average of six hours a day) to around 300 in summer (average of 10 hours a day). It rains on average only 22 days a year, with total precipitation per year of only 151 mm (5.9 in).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 2008, nearly half (45.9%) of Gran Canaria's inhabitants live in Las Palmas, as well as 18.35% of the Canary Islands' total population. According to a study by the National Statistics Institute of Spain Las Palmas de Gran Canaria has a life expectancy of 80.9 years.\n\nThroughout history, Las Palmas received waves of immigrants from mainland Spain and countries from every continent. The majority of the population is Spanish, although large North- and sub-Saharan African and Latin American communities exist (especially the Venezuelan community, which is growing fast), as well as important historical minorities such as Indians (Sindhi) and Koreans and a growing Chinese population.\n\nEthnically, most autochthonous Canarians are descendants of a mixture of aboriginal people (guanches) of the Canary Islands (now extinct), the Spanish conquistadores and later European (mainly Spanish, Portuguese, Flemish, Irish, French, Italian, German, and British) colonizers.\n\n\n== Education ==\nLas Palmas is home to University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria was founded in 1989.\nThe city also has a wide variety of state and public primary and secondary schools.\nInternational schools include:\n\nDeutsche Schule Las Palmas (German)\nThe British School of Gran Canaria (Tafira School is in the city limits)\nThe American School of Las Palmas\nLyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Ren\u00e9-Verneau, the French international school, is in the city limits of Telde\nColegio Japon\u00e9s de Las Palmas, a Japanese international school, was formerly located within Tafira Alta in the city; opened in October 1973, and closed in March 2001.\nCanterbury School of Gran Canaria, a British international school.The Escuela Complementaria Japonesa de Las Palmas previously provided a weekend supplementary Japanese programme.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nLas Palmas offers a variety of theater, cinema, opera, concerts, visual arts and dance performances. The city hosts the Canary Islands Music Festival, the Theatre and Dance and the International Film Festival. The main City Festival, celebrating the foundation of the \"City Fiestas de San Juan\" is held in June. The Carnival of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is known not only in Spain but also worldwide, and is one of the main attractions for tourists. The city center of Las Palmas, specifically the Vegueta and Triana neighbourhoods, are included in the tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n=== Museums, theatres and exhibition halls ===\nThe Museo Canario is located in the historic district of Vegueta. Founded in 1879, it is an international partner of the Council for Scientific Research (CSIC). It has a valuable collection of Canary archaeological objects, which are exhibited in 16 halls. It is also equipped with a library of over 60,000 volumes, many of them dealing with the Canary Islands topics. Its archive covers the period from 1785 until today.\nThe Casa Museo de Col\u00f3n is in the Plaza de San Antonio Abad, behind the cathedral of Santa Ana. It focuses on the history of the Canary Islands and its relations with America. It has 13 permanent exhibition halls, a library and a dedicated study center, and diverse spaces for temporary activities. The complex consists of several houses, one of which was accessed by Christopher Columbus during his first trip to America in 1492; it was the residence of former Governor (now better known as the home of Columbus). It is organized into five subject areas: America before the Discovery, Columbus and his journeys, Canary enclave strategic base for experimenting with the New World, The history and genesis of the city of Palmas, and painting of the 16th century to start of the 20th century.\nThe Casa Museo P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s is located in the Triana neighborhood of the city. It is the birthplace of Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s. It has an extensive collection of documents, books, furniture and personal belongings of the writer.\nThe Museo N\u00e9stor is in the neighborhood of Garden City. Dedicated to the modernist painter N\u00e9stor Mart\u00edn-Fern\u00e1ndez de la Torre, the museum was opened in 1956 in the architectural ensemble of the Pueblo Canario, which was conceived and built by his brother Miguel. It has 10 exhibition halls, as well as a documentation center and pedagogy.\nThe Elder Museum of Science and Technology is an innovative, interactive, engaged in scientific and technological culture.

When the expansion is finished, will have a giant pool to simulate interactive bay, where a large ship can be handled by visitors.\nThe Atlantic Center of Modern Art (CAAM), opened in 1989, is one of the most important references for the cultural and artistic life of the Canary Islands, and is responsible for disseminating the art made in the islands to the rest of the world, especially Africa, America and Europe. It has permanent and temporary exhibitions that range from the historical avant-garde to the latest trends. It is located on Calle Los Balcones de Vegueta, and preserves the original fa\u00e7ade of the 18th century.\nThe Teatro P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s was designed by the architect Francisco Jare\u00f1o y Alarc\u00f3n in 1867. Its current appearance, with some modifications, is due to the intervention of Fernando Navarro and Miguel Mart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de la Torre after the fire that destroyed it almost entirely in 1928. Miguel Mart\u00edn's brother, the painter N\u00e9stor Mart\u00edn-Fern\u00e1ndez de la Torre, was commissioned to decorate the stalls, lounges and the stage. It was originally called Teatro Tirso de Molina until 1901, when, with the occasion of the premiere of Electra, the theatre was renamed after the canarian writer Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s. Following works of renovation, the theatre reopened in April 2007.\nThe Cuy\u00e1s Theater, on the stage of the former Cine Cuy\u00e1s is a work of rationalist Canarian architect Miguel Mart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de la Torre. Its main hall has a capacity for 940 people, divided between the stalls and two amphitheatres. It also has a large patio that allows the organization of outdoor events. It is currently constructing an alternative test room with a capacity for one hundred seats.\nThe Sala Insular de Teatro is a scenic area which lies in the main hall of an old church. In 2007, after some refurbishment, the Board reopened its doors to the public, welcoming small local assemblies.\nThe Guiniguada Theater after a decade long refurbishment, will reopen in 2011.\n\n\n=== Auditorium and Convention Centre ===\n\nThe Auditorio Alfredo Kraus, named after the world renowned Spanish operatic tenor Alfredo Kraus, who was born in Las Palmas, is located on the Atlantic, near the Playa de Las Canteras, one of the most privileged areas of the city. Its 13,200 m2 (142,084 sq ft) floor area has 11 rooms which accommodate from large conventions and concerts to conferences.\nThe Palais des congr\u00e8s de Gran Canaria is in the premises of the Instituci\u00f3n Ferial de Canarias with a capacity for 800 people on 16,000 m2 (172,223 sq ft).\nThe Center for Initiatives of the Caja de Ahorros de Canarias (CICC) is housed in a mid-19th-century building by the architect Manuel Ponce de Leon in the neighborhood of Triana.

It is considered a point of geological interest because of the Caldera de Bandama: this volcanic caldera reaches 569 m (1,867 ft) above sea level at the highest point on its rim, Pico de Bandama, and is about 1,000 m (3,300 ft) wide and 200 m (660 ft) deep. The steep walk to the bottom of the caldera takes about half an hour. Volcanic ash of different hues is in great abundance, and there are some interesting botanic species of Canary Islands origin. There are facilities for food and refreshments as well.\nArchaeological sites in Santa Br\u00edgida. In the valley of La Angostura and Las Meleguinas can find numerous traces of Aboriginal canaries that have prompted the declaration of the area as a Cultural, as groups of caves carved into rock, silos or sidewalks. In the archaeological site of El Tope, discovered on 16 July 1988, where you can see remnants that suggest the existence of an aboriginal burial mound, as well as ceramics, pottery and curious pintaderas. En la pared norte de la Caldera de Bandama se encuentra la Cueva de los Canarios, utilizada por los abor\u00edgenes como granero. It has been discovered Libyco-Berber inscriptions belonging to the ancient Guanche autochthones and some vessels (which are now in the Museo Canario). Also in the same area in the wall of the volcano in the stew is the Cueva de Los Frailes was discovered in 1933 a set of 37 caves.\nChurch of San Juan Bautista (also vulgarly known as Catedral de Arucas due to its big size) built entirely in Arucas stone by local master masons, and it dates from 1909 (Initial Configuration from the 17th century). Apart from the wealth of the carved stone columns and column heads, there are also some beautiful stained glass windows, the works of Canary Island painter Cristobal Hernandez de Quintana, and an extraordinary carving of the Reclining Christ, by Manuel Ramos.\nJard\u00edn de la Marquesa de Arucas \u2013 Botanical Garden in Arucas.\nIglesia de San Juan Bautista de Telde is the true spiritual centre of Telde. Located in the square of the same name and founded in 1483, the old church was erected by the Garcia del Castillo family at the time of the town's foundation. It still has the original gateway, an example of Sevillian\u2013Portuguese Gothic architecture. The towers, however, are an example of early 20th neo-Gothic construction. The real marvels are inside the building: the statue of Christ on the main altar, made from corn dough by the Pur\u00e9pecha Mexican Indians, brought here before 1550, the Flemish Gothic main altar, which dates back to before 1516, and the triptych of the Virgin Mary, brought from Flanders, also in the 16th century, depicting five religious scenes.\nBas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pino in Teror from 1760.\nArchaeological sites in Telde. Telde has 101 archaeological sites and 709 listed assets of ethnographic interest. In regard to the aboriginal time deposits, each year it expands its number or discover new aspects of old fields, but most are in disrepair and many are disappearing. Some of the most prominent are the coastal town of Tufia, in good condition and extensively excavated by archaeologists; Four Doors cave site, Telde, a large cave with four doors located on top of a mountain and overlooking the teldense plain; an almogar\u00e9n (religious vessel) at the top; a troglodyte village with collective barn in the back, the caves of Tara and Cendro remains of the ancient center of population, the town of Draguillo on the border with Ingenio, Las Cuevas Chalasia which consist of a labyrinthine series of artificial caves linked by tunnels and the impressive Necropolis of Jin\u00e1mar which includes more than 500 tombs of various types belonging to the old canary.\nBas\u00edlica de San Juan Bautista in Telde\nBas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pino in Teror from 1760.\nPalacete Rodriguez Quegles, an eclectic modernist mansion from the turn of the 20th century, it is a  venue for exhibitions and other cultural events, and the center for coordinating events around the city.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Diocese of Canarias (Catholic Church), Spanish Evangelical Church (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Union of Evangelical Baptists of Spain (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God. There are also Muslim mosques.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads and highways ===\n\nUrban road infrastructure is overburdened on workdays and in certain areas; the city street plan is not at all rectilinear, and may be confusing even to experienced drivers. However, there are no toll roads; entrances, exits, main streets and important zones are all well-signposted.\nLas Palmas, being the centre of the Las Palmas metropolitan area, is the hub for the island's motorway network. The city is linked with three highways: the GC-1 to the south, the GC-2 to the west and GC-3 to the center of the island.\nThe GC-1 links the capital with Puerto de Mog\u00e1n in the south. It is the fastest route from the top of the island to the bottom and vice versa with a speed limit of 120 km/h (75 mph). It is approximately 75 km (47 mi) in length and runs along the eastern and the southern coasts, and is also the second longest superhighway in the Canary Islands. The road provides easy access from the Airport to the major cities and resorts, which include Maspalomas and Playa del Ingl\u00e9s. The increase in tourism over the years has necessitated the route's upgrading and widening to cope with traffic growth. The GC-1 begins south of the downtown area of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the highway runs within the beach of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and 2 km (1 mi) south intersects with the GC-2 and later runs with a few clover leaf interchanges and later forms a junction with GC-5 and south, the GC-31.\n\nThe GC-2 North Highway connects Las Palmas with the small northern port and village of Agaete. The eastern portion \u2013 about 20 km (12 mi) in length \u2013 is a superhighway with interchange numbers, the rest of the highway is a two-laned; the western part is also only two-laned and has exit numbers. The highway begins by the beach area of the island, and runs through the downtown area, linking with the GC31 at a roundabout interchange. The freeway runs within the beaches and the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean for the half part but at around the 20th km, it becomes a highway after the unidirectional parclo interchanges and runs within the coastline, it later has several interchanges and several towns as it passes to the northwest and finally, it ends in Agaete.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nLas Palmas is served by Gran Canaria Airport, also called Las Palmas Airport (IATA: LPA, ICAO: GCLP).\nThe airport is located in the eastern part of the island, about 18 km (11 mi) from Las Palmas city centre. In 2008, it handled 10,212,106 passengers and 33,695,248 kg (74,285,306 lb) of cargo, and is the fourth busiest in Spain. It is also the only airport on the islands with two runways, thus can accommodate up to 53 landings and take-offs per hour. The lengthy runways made the airport an alternative landing site for the NASA Space Shuttle. This airport is also a base for Binter Canarias and Navegacion y Servicios A\u00e9reos Canarios, airlines which operate regional inter-island flights within the Canary Islands.\nAn airbase of the Spanish Air Force is located to the east of the runways. Beyond several hangars opposite the passenger terminal, the Gando Air Base (Base A\u00e9rea de Gando) contains ten shelters situated on the southern end of the eastern runway.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPuerto de Las Palmas (Las Palmas Port), also known as Puerto de la Luz, is a main port for fishing, commercial, passenger and sports in the northwest of the city. It has been the traditional base for scale and supplying ships on their way through the Middle Atlantic for five centuries. The Port of Las Palmas is not only the first port of the Canary Islands, it is one of the main ports of Spain and the first of the geographical area of West Africa. As the leading port in the mid-Atlantic, it serves as the crossroads between Europe, Africa and America. In 2007, the port received some 11,262 ships; it welcomed a total of 907,782 cruise passengers, a 16.26% increase on 2006. In terms of annual TEU, the port of Las Palmas ranks as the 5th in Spain, and is among the first 15 ports of Europe.The Port of Las Palmas is the first Mid-Atlantic fishing base, with an annual traffic of more than 4,500 stopovers and with some 400,000 tons of frozen fish processed. Despite experiencing some decline in recent years, it retains its dominance in the fishing industry over other ports in the Canary Islands. The port provides 175,000 m3 (6,180,067 cu ft) of cold storage facilities. At the foot of pier, special refrigerated containers and preparation rooms for frozen products can carry out the entire chain of post-processing and storage of fish, from refrigeration and distribution, to manufacture and supply of industrial ice. The port's EU-approved border inspection post is responsible for inspecting all types of imports and exports between the European Economic Union and its trading partners.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLas Palmas boasts a high quality bus system, provided by Guaguas Municipales. Municipal Bus Lines offers 40 urban transport routes, covering both the bottom and the top of the city. The main lines are the 1 (Teatro \u2013 Puerto), 2 (Alameda de Col\u00f3n \u2013 Puerto), 17 (Teatro \u2013 El Rinc\u00f3n), 25 (Campus Universitario \u2013 El Rinc\u00f3n), 12 (Puerto \u2013 Hoya de la Plata) and 30 (Alameda de Col\u00f3n \u2013 Santa Catalina, via Rehoyas). In addition, two circular lines (A: Santa Catalina \u2013 Santa Catalina, via Alcaraveneras) and B (Santa Catalina \u2013 Santa Catalina, via Ciudad Alta).\nThe most important bus lines have frequencies of between 3 and 15 minutes during the day and between 10 and 40 minutes at night; most lines have service throughout the night. The bright yellow buses are known simply as 'guaguas'. The unique tariff, paid directly to the driver, is 1.30 euro. A 10-ride ticket is available for \u20ac7.50 at official shops in the city. The Tarjeta Insular (Island Card) which offered a 20% discount on both municipal buses and Global buses was discontinued on 1 January 2011.\nGlobal, inter-hire company, has 119 lines, many to or from the capital. This company was formed in 2000, resulting from the merger of the previous Salcai and interurban lines Utinsa.\nThere is also the Guagua Tur\u00edstica, which covers the most interesting sites of the city with a guide in several languages.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThere is currently no rail transport system on Gran Canaria. Between 1893 and 1944 steam tram ran between Las Palmas and Puerto de La Luz. The line was electrified in 1910, although the line reverted to steam traction in 1944, when trams were hauled by a steam locomotive known as La Pepa. A reproduction of this locomotive is now on display in the Elder Museum in Las Palmas. In the early 1970s an experimental elevated railway line operated through Las Palmas. Called the Tren Vertebrado (\"vertebrate train\"), it was designed by Basque engineer Alejandro Goicoechea and consisted of an unusual low-profile train running on elevated concrete tracks through the city. The project was unsuccessful and was dismantled in 1974.In the early 21st century, plans were put forward by the Gran Canaria Cabildo to develop a rapid transit railway line on Gran Canaria. If built, the Tren de Gran Canaria (TGC) line would run along the eastern coast and connect Las Palmas with the airport and Maspalomas in the south. In 2004 the Spanish Ministry of Development put a contract out to competitive tender for a feasibility study on a 50 km railway line from Las Palmas to Maspalomas. This railway project is currently abandoned due to funding difficulties.\nAnother project is the Tramway Palmas (Gran Canaria), which would cover the same journey as the bus line 1, with an average frequency of 5 minutes and a journey time of 35 minutes.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nLas Palmas is home to three major professional sports teams. These are:\n\nUD Las Palmas \u2013 association football club playing in Spain\u2019s Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. The team play their home games at Estadio de Gran Canaria, with a capacity of 32,665. The team used to play at Estadio Insular (which is now closed), with a capacity of 22,000.

Real Club De Golf De Las Palmas, inaugurated on 17 December 1891, is the oldest golf club in Spain.\n\n\n== Health system ==\nThe two general hospitals of Gran Canaria are in Las Palmas. While Hospital Universitario de Gran Canaria Doctor Negr\u00edn (Doctor Negr\u00edn University Hospital of Gran Canaria) is geared to health care in the north and west of the island, Hospital Universitario Insular de Gran Canaria (Insular University Hospital of Gran Canaria) is geared to health care in the south and east of the island. There are also smaller private hospitals and clinics.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nLas Palmas is twinned with:\n Garachico, Spain\n San Antonio, United States\n Guanajuato, Mexico\n Nouadhibou, MauritaniaIn addition, the municipality has approved in plenary willingness twinning with the following cities, if they are not well formalized these twinning:\n Rabat, Morocco\n Praia, Cape Verde\n Vigo, Spain\n Gda\u0144sk, Poland\n Genoa, Italy\n Martinsicuro, Italy\n Jalisco, Mexico\n Xiamen, China\n Chengdu, China\n\n\n== People from Las Palmas ==\n\nWenceslao Benitez Inglott (1879-1954), counter admiral, scientist, and engineer.\nAlfredo Kraus (1927\u20131999), 20th-century tenor\nJavier Bardem (1 March 1969\u2013), actor\nAntonio Betancort (13 March 1937 \u2013 15 March 2015), former football player\nJuan Bordes (15 July 1948), sculptor\nJuan Hidalgo Codorniu (1927\u20132018), composer\nJos\u00e9 Comas Quesada (3 February 1928 \u2013 14 January 1993), painter\nJos\u00e9 Doreste (19 September 1956), Spanish sailor and olympic champion\nLuis Doreste (7 March 1961), Spanish sailor and 2x olympic champion\nNicol\u00e1s Est\u00e9vanez (1838\u20131914), military officer, politician and poet\nManuel Pablo Garc\u00eda D\u00edaz (25 January 1976), football (soccer) player\nNicol\u00e1s Garc\u00eda Hemme (20 June 1988), taekwondo olympic medalist\nSven Giegold (17 November 1969), German politician\nMateo Gil (23 September 1972), writer and film director\nPatricia Guerra (21 July 1965), sailor and Olympic champion\nJes\u00e9 (26 February 1993), footballer\nFrancisco Kraus (1926\u20132016), Spanish baritone and voice teacher\nJuan Fernando L\u00f3pez Aguilar (10 June 1961), former Spanish Minister of Justice\n\u00darsula L\u00f3pez (1870\u20131966), singer\nMarta Marrero (16 January 1983), tennis player\nKira Mir\u00f3 (13 March 1980), actress and presenter\nRoberto Molina (5 June 1960), Spanish sailor and olympic champion\nJuan Negr\u00edn (1892\u20131956), politician; President of Government of Republican Spain 1937\u201339\nPinito del Oro (1930\u20132017), trapeze artist, member of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey\nBenito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s (1843\u20131920), 19th-century writer\nSandro Ramirez (born 1995), football player\nLeticia Romero (28 May 1995), Spanish international basketball player\nJer\u00f3nimo Saavedra Acevedo (3 June 1936), President of the Government of the Canaries, minister of Public administrations, minister of Education and Sciences of Spain and Mayor\nAntonia San Juan (22 May 1961), Spanish actress, director and screenwriter\nMag\u00fci Serna (1 March 1979), tennis player\nCarla Su\u00e1rez Navarro (3 September 1988), tennis player\nJuan Carlos Valer\u00f3n (17 June 1975), footballer\nJos\u00e9 de Viera y Clavijo (28 December 1731 \u2013 1813), ecclesiastic historian and botanist\nRebeca Nuez Suarez (10 November 1993), Classical Violinist.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAndrews, Sarah; Quintero, Josephine (2007).

        "wiki": "Madrid (, Spanish: [ma\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei\u00f0]) is the capital and most-populous city of Spain. The city has almost 3.3 million inhabitants and a metropolitan area population of approximately 6.5 million. It is the second-largest city in the European Union (EU), surpassed only by Berlin, and its monocentric metropolitan area is the second-largest in the EU, surpassed only by Paris. The municipality covers 604.3 km2 (233.3 sq mi).Madrid lies on the River Manzanares in the center of both the country and the Community of Madrid region, of which it is also the capital. As the capital city of Spain, seat of government, residence of the Spanish monarch, Madrid is also the political, economic and cultural centre of the country. The mayor is Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida from the People's Party.\nThe Madrid urban agglomeration has the third-largest GDP in the European Union and its influence in politics, education, entertainment, environment, media, fashion, science, culture, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the world's major global cities. Madrid is home to two world-famous football clubs, Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Due to its economic output, high standard of living, and market size, Madrid is considered the major financial centre and the leading economic hub of the Iberian Peninsula and of Southern Europe. It hosts the head offices of the vast majority of major Spanish companies, such as Telef\u00f3nica, IAG or Repsol. Madrid is also the 10th most liveable city in the world according to Monocle magazine, in its 2017 index.Madrid houses the headquarters of the UN's World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB), the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI), and the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB). It also hosts major international regulators and promoters of the Spanish language: the Standing Committee of the Association of Spanish Language Academies, headquarters of the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE), the Instituto Cervantes and the Foundation of Urgent Spanish (Fund\u00e9u BBVA). Madrid organises fairs such as FITUR, ARCO, SIMO TCI and the Madrid Fashion Week.While Madrid possesses modern infrastructure, it has preserved the look and feel of many of its historic neighbourhoods and streets. Its landmarks include the Plaza Mayor, the Royal Palace of Madrid; the Royal Theatre with its restored 1850 Opera House; the Buen Retiro Park, founded in 1631; the 19th-century National Library building (founded in 1712) containing some of Spain's historical archives; many national museums, and the Golden Triangle of Art, located along the Paseo del Prado and comprising three art museums: Prado Museum, the Reina Sof\u00eda Museum, a museum of modern art, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, which complements the holdings of the other two museums. Cibeles Palace and Fountain has become one of the monument symbols of the city.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are three established theories regarding the origin of the toponym \"Madrid\" (all of them with problems when it comes to fully explain the phonetic evolution of the toponym along history), namely:\nA Celtic origin (Madrid < * Magetoritum; with the root \"-ritu\" meaning \"ford\").\nFrom the Arabic ma\u01e7r\u00e0 (meaning \"water stream\").\nA Mozarabic variant of the Latin matrix, matricis (also meaning \"water stream\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nAlthough the site of modern-day Madrid has been occupied since prehistoric times, and there are archaeological remains of Carpetani settlement, Roman villas, a Visigoth basilica near the church of Santa Mar\u00eda de la Almudena and three Visigoth necropoleis near Casa de Campo, Tet\u00faan and Vic\u00e1lvaro, the first historical document about the existence of an established settlement in Madrid dates from the Muslim age. At the second half of the 9th century, Cordobese Emir Muhammad I built a fortress on a headland near the river Manzanares, as one of the many fortresses he ordered to be built on the border between Al-Andalus and the kingdoms of Le\u00f3n and Castile, with the objective of protecting Toledo from the Christian invasions and also as a starting point for Muslim offensives. After the disintegration of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in the early 11th century, Madrid was integrated in the Taifa of Toledo.\nIn the context of the wider campaign for the conquest of the taifa of Toledo initiated in 1079, Madrid was seized in 1083 by Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile, who sought to use the town as an offensive outpost against the city of Toledo, in turn conquered in 1085. Following the conquest, Christians occupied the center of the city, while Muslims and Jews were displaced to the suburbs. Madrid, located near Alcal\u00e1 (under Muslim control until 1118), remained a borderland for a while, suffering a number of razzias during the Almoravid period and its walls were destroyed in 1110. The city was confirmed as villa de realengo (linked to the Crown) in 1123, during the reign of Alfonso VII. The 1123 Charter of Otorgamiento established the first explicit limits between Madrid and Segovia, namely the Puerto de El Berrueco and the Puerto de Lozoya. Since 1188, Madrid won the right to be a city with representation in the courts of Castile. In 1202, Alfonso VIII gave Madrid its first charter to regulate the municipal council, which was expanded in 1222 by Ferdinand III. The government system of the town was changed to a regimiento of 12 regidores by Alfonso XI on 6 January 1346.Since the mid-13th century and up to the late 14th century, the concejo of Madrid vied for the control of the Real de Manzanares territory against the concejo of Segovia, a powerful town north of the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range, characterised by its repopulating prowess and its husbandry-based economy, contrasted by the agricultural and less competent in repopulation town of Madrid. After the decline of Sep\u00falveda, another concejo north of the mountain range, Segovia had become a major actor south of the Guadarrama mountains, expanding across the Lozoya and Manzanares rivers to the north of Madrid and along the Guadarrama river course to its west.In 1309, the Courts of Castile convened at Madrid for the first time under Ferdinand IV, and later in 1329, 1339, 1391, 1393, 1419 and twice in 1435.\n\n\n=== Modern Age ===\nDuring the revolt of the Comuneros, led by Juan de Padilla, Madrid joined the revolt against Charles, Holy Roman Emperor, but after defeat at the Battle of Villalar, Madrid was besieged and occupied by the imperial troops. The city was however granted the titles of Coronada (Crowned) and Imperial.\n\nThe number of urban inhabitants grew from 4,060 in the year 1530 to 37,500 in the year 1594. The poor population of the court was composed of ex-soldiers, foreigners, rogues and Ruanes, dissatisfied with the lack of food and high prices. In June 1561 Phillip II set his court in Madrid, installing it in the old alc\u00e1zar. Thanks to this, the city of Madrid became the political centre of the monarchy, being the capital of Spain except for a short period between 1601 and 1606, in which the Court was relocated to Valladolid (and the Madrid population temporarily plummeted accordingly). The capitality was decisive for the evolution of the city and influenced its fate and during the rest of the reign of Philip II, the population boomed, going up from about 18,000 in 1561 to 80,000 in 1598.\n\nDuring the early 17th century, although Madrid recovered from the loss of the capital status, with the return of diplomats, lords and affluent people, as well as an entourage of noted writers and artists together with them, extreme poverty was however rampant. The century also was a time of heyday for theatre, represented in the so-called corrales de comedias.The city changed hands several times during the War of the Spanish succession: from the Bourbon control it passed to the allied \"Austracist\" army with Portuguese and English presence that entered the city in late June 1706, only to be retaken by the Bourbon army on 4 August 1706. The Habsburg army led by the Archduke Charles entered the city for a second time in September 1710, leaving the city less than three months after. Philip V definitely entered the capital on 3 December 1710.Seeking to take advantage of the Madrid's location at the geographic centre of Spain, the 18th century saw a sustained effort to create a radial system of communications and transports for the country through public investments.Philip V built the Royal Palace, the Royal Tapestry Factory and the main Royal Academies. The reign of Charles III, who came to be known as \"the best mayor of Madrid\", saw an effort to turn the city into a true capital, with the construction of sewers, street lighting, cemeteries outside the city and a number of monuments and cultural institutions. The reforms enacted by his Sicilian minister were however opposed in 1766 by the populace in the so-called Esquilache Riots, a revolt demanding to repeal a clothing decree banning the use of traditional hats and long cloaks aiming to curb crime in the city.\n\nIn the context of the Peninsular War, the situation in French-occupied Madrid after March 1808 was becoming more and more tense. On 2 May, a crowd began to gather near the Royal Palace protesting against the French attempt to evict the remaining members of the Bourbon royal family to Bayonne, prompting up an uprising against the French Imperial troops that lasted hours and spread throughout the city, including a famous last stand at the Montele\u00f3n barracks. Subsequent repression was brutal, with many insurgent Spaniards being summarily executed. The uprising led to a declaration of war calling all the Spaniards to fights against the French invaders.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Liberal State ===\n\nThe city was invaded on 24 May 1823 by a French army\u2014the so-called Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis\u2014called to intervene to restore the absolutism of Ferdinand that the latter had been deprived from during the 1820\u20131823 trienio liberal. Unlike other European capitals, during the first half of the 19th century the only noticeable bourgeois elements in Madrid (that experienced a delay in its industrial development up to that point) were merchants. The University of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares was relocated to Madrid in 1836, becoming the Central University.The economy of the city further modernized during the second half of the 19th century, consolidating his status as service and financial centre, although in the other hand the new industries were mostly focused in book edition, construction and low-tech sectors. The introduction of railway transport greatly helped Madrid's economic prowess, and it also led to changes in consumption patterns (such as substitution of salted fish by fresh fish from the Spanish coasts) as well as further strengthening of the city role as logistics node in the country's distribution network. Electric lightning in the streets was introduced in the 1890s.During the first third of the 20th century the population nearly doubled, reaching more than 850,000 inhabitants. New suburbs such as Las Ventas, Tetu\u00e1n and El Carmen became the homes of the influx of workers, while Ensanche became a middle-class neighbourhood of Madrid.\n\n\n=== Second Republic and Civil War ===\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1931 was the first legislated on the state capital, setting it explicitly in Madrid.\nDuring the 1930s, Madrid enjoyed \"great vitality\"; it was demographically young, but also young in the sense of its relation with the modernity. During this time the prolongation of the Paseo de la Castellana towards the North was projected. The proclamation of the Republic slowed down the building of new housing. The tertiary sector gave thrust to the economy. Illiteracy rates were down to below 20%, and the city's cultural life grew notably during the so-called Silver Age of Spanish Culture; the sales of newspaper also increased. Anti-clericalism and Catholicism lived side by side in Madrid; the burning of convents initiated after riots in the city in May 1931 worsened the political environment. The 1934 insurrection largely failed in Madrid.Madrid was one of the most heavily affected cities of Spain in the Civil War (1936\u20131939). The city was a stronghold of the Republican faction from July 1936 and became an international symbol of anti-fascist struggle during the conflict. Its western suburbs were the scene of an all-out battle in November 1936 and during the Civil War the city was also bombed by aeroplanes. The city fell to the Francoists in March 1939.\n\n\n=== Francoist dictatorship ===\n\nA staple of the Post-war Madrid (Madrid de la posguerra) was the widespread use of ration coupons. Meat and fish consumption was scarce, and starvation and lack of proteins were a cause of high mortality. As the protracted right-wing despise towards the city nurtured during the Second Republic turned up to eleven during the war, the victors toyed with the possibility of moving the capital elsewhere (most notably to Seville), yet such plans did not materialize, and the Francoist regime conducted then an attempt to resignificate the city, stemming from the Spanish Imperial ideal.The intense demographic growth experienced by the city via mass immigration from the rural areas of the country led to the construction of plenty of housing in the peripheral areas of the city to absorb the new population (reinforcing the processes of social polarization of the city), initially comprising substandard housing (with as many as 50,000 shacks scattered around the city by 1956). A transitional planning intended to temporarily replace the shanty towns were the poblados de absorci\u00f3n, introduced since the mid-1950s in locations such as Canillas, San Ferm\u00edn, Ca\u00f1o Roto, Villaverde, Pan Bendito, Zof\u00edo and Fuencarral, aiming to work as a sort of \"high-end\" shacks (with the destinataries participating in the construction of their own housing) but under the aegis of a wider coordinated urban planning.The municipality grew through the annexation of neighbouring municipalities, achieving the present extension of 607 km2 (234.36 sq mi). The south of Madrid became very industrialised, and there were massive migrations from rural areas of Spain into the city. Madrid's newly built north-western districts became the home of the new thriving middle class that appeared as result of the 1960s Spanish economic boom, while the south-eastern periphery became an extensive working-class settlement, which was the base for an active cultural and political reform.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nAfter the death of Franco and the start of the democratic regime, the 1978 constitution confirmed Madrid as the capital of Spain. The 1979 municipal election brought Madrid's first democratic mayor since the Second Republic.\nMadrid was the scene of some of the most important events of the time, such as the mass demonstrations of support for democracy after the failed coup, 23-F, on 23 February 1981. The first democratic mayors belonged to the centre-left PSOE (Enrique Tierno Galv\u00e1n, Juan Barranco Gallardo). Since the late 1970s and through the 1980s Madrid became the center of the cultural movement known as la Movida. Conversely, just like in the rest of the country, a heroin crisis took a toll in the poor neighborhoods of Madrid in the 1980s.\n\nBenefiting from increasing prosperity in the 1980s and 1990s, the capital city of Spain consolidated its position as an important economic, cultural, industrial, educational, and technological centre on the European continent. During the mandate as Mayor of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez del Manzano construction of traffic tunnels below the city proliferated. The following administrations, also conservative, led by Alberto Ruiz-Gallard\u00f3n and Ana Botella launched three unsuccessful bids for the 2012, 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympics. By 2005, Madrid was the leading European destination for migrants from developing countries, as well as the largest employer of non-European workforce in Spain. Madrid was a centre of the anti-austerity protests that erupted in Spain in 2011. As consequence of the spillover of the 2008 financial and mortgage crisis, Madrid has been affected by the increasing number of second-hand homes held by banks and house evictions. The mandate of left-wing Mayor Manuela Carmena (2015\u20132019) delivered the renaturalization of the course of the Manzanares across the city.\nSince the late 2010s, the challenges the city faces include the increasingly unaffordable rental prices (often in parallel with the gentrification and the spike of tourist apartments in the city centre) and the profusion of betting shops in working-class areas, equalled to an \"epidemics\" among the young people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nMadrid lies on the southern Meseta Central, 60 km south of the Guadarrama mountain range and straddling the Jarama and Manzanares river sub-drainage basins, in the wider Tagus River catchment area. There is a considerable difference in altitude within the city proper ranging from the 700 m (2,297 ft) around Plaza de Castilla in the north of city to the 570 m (1,870 ft) around La China wastewater treatment plant on the Manzanares' riverbanks, near the latter's confluence with the Fuente Castellana thalweg in the south of the city. The Monte de El Pardo (a protected forested area covering over a quarter of the municipality) reaches its top altitude (843 m (2,766 ft)) on its perimeter, in the slopes surrounding El Pardo reservoir located at the north-western end of the municipality, in the Fuencarral-El Pardo district.The oldest urban core is located on the hills next to the left bank of the Manzanares River. The city grew to the east, reaching the Fuente Castellana Creek (now the Paseo de la Castellana), and further east reaching the Abro\u00f1igal Creek (now the M-30). The city also grew through the annexation of neighbouring urban settlements, including those to the South West on the right bank of the Manzanares.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMadrid has an inland Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa) in the western half of the city transitioning to a semi-arid climate (BSk) in the eastern half. Winters are cool due to its altitude, which is approximately 667 m (2,188 ft) above sea level, including sporadic snowfalls and frequent frosts between December and February. Summers are hot, in the warmest month, July, average temperatures during the day range from 32 to 34 \u00b0C (90 to 93 \u00b0F) depending on location, with maxima commonly climbing over 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) during the frequent heat waves. Due to Madrid's altitude and dry climate, diurnal ranges are often significant during the summer. The highest recorded temperature was on 24 July 1995, at 42.2 \u00b0C (108.0 \u00b0F), and the lowest recorded temperature was on 16 January 1945 at \u221215.3 \u00b0C (4.5 \u00b0F). These records were registered at the airport, in the eastern side of the city. Precipitation is concentrated in the autumn and spring, and, together with Athens which has similar annual precipitation, Madrid is the driest capital in Europe. It is particularly sparse during the summer, taking the form of about two showers and/or thunderstorms during the season.\n\n\n=== Water supply ===\n\nIn the 17th century, the so-called \"viajes de agua\" (a kind of water channels or qanat) were used to provide water to the city. Some of the most important ones were the Viaje de Amaniel (1610\u20131621, sponsored by the Crown), the Viaje de Fuente Castellana (1613\u20131620) and Abro\u00f1igal Alto/Abro\u00f1igal Bajo (1617\u20131630), sponsored by the City Council. They were the main infrastructure for the supply of water until the arrival of the Canal de Isabel II in the mid-19th century.Madrid derives almost 73.5 percent of its water supply from dams and reservoirs built on the Lozoya River, such as the El Atazar Dam. This water supply is managed by the Canal de Isabel II, a public entity created in 1851. It is responsible for the supply, depurating waste water and the conservation of all the natural water resources of the Madrid region.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Madrid has overall increased since the city became the capital of Spain in the mid-16th century, and has stabilised at approximately 3 million since the 1970s.\nFrom 1970 until the mid-1990s, the population dropped. This phenomenon, which also affected other European cities, was caused in part by the growth of satellite suburbs at the expense of the downtown region within the city proper.\nThe demographic boom accelerated in the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century due to immigration in parallel with a surge in Spanish economic growth.\nThe wider Madrid region is the EU region with the highest average life expectancy at birth. The average life expectancy was 82.2 years for males and 87.8 for females in 2016.As the capital city of Spain, the city has attracted many immigrants from around the world, with most of the immigrants coming from Latin American countries. In 2020, around 76 % of the registered population was Spain-born, while, regarding the foreign-born population (24 %), the bulk of it relates to the Americas (around 16 % of the total population), and a lesser fraction of the population is born in other European, Asian and African countries.\nAs of 2019 the highest rising national group of immigrants was Venezuelans.Regarding religious beliefs, according to a 2019 Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) survey with a sample size of 469 respondents, 20.7% of respondents in Madrid identify themselves as practising Catholics, 45.8% as non-practising Catholics, 3.8% as believers of another religion, 11.1% as agnostics, 3.6% as indifferent towards religion, and 12.8% as atheists. The remaining 2.1% did not state their religious beliefs.The Madrid metropolitan area comprises Madrid and the surrounding municipalities. According to Eurostat, the \"metropolitan region\" of Madrid has a population of slightly more than 6.271 million people covering an area of 4,609.7 square kilometres (1,780 sq mi). It is the largest in Spain and the third largest in the European Union.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government and administration ===\n\nThe City Council (Ayuntamiento de Madrid) is the body responsible for the government and administration of the municipality. It is formed by the Plenary (Pleno), the Mayor (alcalde) and the Government Board (Junta de Gobierno de la Ciudad de Madrid).\nThe Plenary of the Ayuntamiento is the body of political representation of the citizens in the municipal government. Its 57 members are elected for a 4-year mandate. Some of its attributions are: fiscal matters, the election and deposition of the mayor, the approval and modification of decrees and regulations, the approval of budgets, the agreements related to the limits and alteration of the municipal term, the services management, the participation in supramunicipal organisations, etc.The mayor, the supreme representative of the city, presides over the Ayuntamiento. He is charged with giving impetus to the municipal policies, managing the action of the rest of bodies and directing the executive municipal administration. He is responsible to the Pleno. He is also entitled to preside over the meetings of the Pleno, although this responsility can be delegated to another municipal councillor. Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, a member of the People's Party, serves as Mayor since 2019.\nThe Government Board consists of the mayor, the deputy mayor(s) and a number of delegates assuming the portfolios for the different government areas. All those positions are held by municipal councillors.Since 2007, the Cybele Palace (or Palace of Communications) serves as City Hall.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nMadrid is administratively divided into 21 districts, which are further subdivided into 131 neighbourhoods (barrios):\n\n\n=== Regional capital ===\nMadrid is the capital of the Community of Madrid. The region has its own legislature and it enjoys a wide range of competencies in areas such as social spending, healthcare, education. The seat of the regional parliament, the Assembly of Madrid is located at the district of Puente de Vallecas. The presidency of the regional government is headquartered at the Royal House of the Post Office, at the very centre of the city, the Puerta del Sol.\n\n\n=== Capital of Spain ===\nMadrid is the capital of the Kingdom of Spain. The King of Spain, whose functions are mainly ceremonial, has his official residence in the Zarzuela Palace. As the seat of the Government of Spain, Madrid also houses the official residence of the President of the Government (Prime Minister) and regular meeting place of the Council of Ministers, the Moncloa Palace, as well as the headquarters of the ministerial departments. Both the residences of the Head of State and Government are located at the northwest of the city. Additionally, the seats of the Lower and Upper Chambers of the Spanish Parliament, the Cortes Generales (respectively, the Palacio de las Cortes and the Palacio del Senado), also lie on Madrid.\n\n\n=== Law enforcement ===\n\nThe Madrid Municipal Police (Polic\u00eda Municipal de Madrid) is the local law enforcement body, dependent on the Ayuntamiento. As of 2018, it had a workforce of 6,190 civil servants.The headquarters of both the Directorate-General of the Police and the Directorate-General of the Civil Guard are located in Madrid. The headquarters of the Higher Office of Police of Madrid (Jefatura Superior de Polic\u00eda de Madrid), the peripheral branch of the National Police Corps with jurisdiction over the region also lies on Madrid.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nLittle medieval architecture is preserved in Madrid, mostly in the Almendra Central, including the San Nicol\u00e1s and San Pedro el Viejo church towers, the church of San Jer\u00f3nimo el Real, and the Bishop's Chapel. Nor has Madrid retained much Renaissance architecture, other than the Bridge of Segovia and the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales.\n\nPhilip II moved his court to Madrid in 1561 and transformed the town into a capital city. During the Early Hapsburg period, the import of European influences took place, underpinned by the monicker of Austrian style. The Austrian style featured not only Austrian influences but also Italian and Dutch (as well as Spanish), reflecting on the international preeminence of the Hapsburgs. During the second half of the 16th-century the use of pointy slate spires in order to top structures such as church towers was imported to Spain from Central Europe. Slate spires and roofs consequently became a staple of the Madrilenian architecture at the time.Stand out architecture in the city dating back to the early 17th-century includes several buildings and structures (most of them attributed to Juan G\u00f3mez de Mora) such as the Palace of the Duke of Uceda (1610), the Monastery of La Encarnaci\u00f3n (1611\u20131616); the Plaza Mayor (1617\u20131619) or the C\u00e1rcel de Corte (1629\u20131641), currently known as the Santa Cruz Palace. The century also saw the construction of the former City Hall, the Casa de la Villa.The Imperial College church model dome was imitated in all of Spain. Pedro de Ribera introduced Churrigueresque architecture to Madrid; the Cuartel del Conde-Duque, the church of Montserrat, and the Bridge of Toledo are among the best examples.\n\nThe reign of the Bourbons during the eighteenth century marked a new era in the city. Philip V tried to complete King Philip II's vision of urbanisation of Madrid. Philip V built a palace in line with French taste, as well as other buildings such as St. Michael's Basilica and the Church of Santa B\u00e1rbara.\nKing Charles III beautified the city and endeavoured to convert Madrid into one of the great European capitals. He pushed forward the construction of the Prado Museum (originally intended as a Natural Science Museum), the Puerta de Alcal\u00e1, the Royal Observatory, the Basilica of San Francisco el Grande, the Casa de Correos in Puerta del Sol, the Real Casa de la Aduana, and the General Hospital (which now houses the Reina Sofia Museum and Royal Conservatory of Music). The Paseo del Prado, surrounded by gardens and decorated with neoclassical statues, is an example of urban planning. The Duke of Berwick ordered the construction of the Liria Palace.\nDuring the early 19th century, the Peninsular War, the loss of viceroyalties in the Americas, and continuing coups limited the city's architectural development (Royal Theatre, the National Library of Spain, the Palace of the Senate, and the Congress). The Segovia Viaduct linked the Royal Alc\u00e1zar to the southern part of town.\n\nThe list of key figures of madrilenian architecture during the 19th and 20th centuries includes authors such as Narciso Pascual y Colomer, Francisco Jare\u00f1o y Alarc\u00f3n, Francisco de Cubas, Juan Bautista L\u00e1zaro de Diego, Ricardo Vel\u00e1zquez Bosco, Antonio Palacios, Secundino Zuazo, Luis Guti\u00e9rrez Soto, Luis Moya Blanco and Alejandro de la Sota.From the mid-19th century until the Civil War, Madrid modernised and built new neighbourhoods and monuments. The expansion of Madrid developed under the Plan Castro, resulting in the neighbourhoods of Salamanca, Arg\u00fcelles, and Chamber\u00ed. Arturo Soria conceived the linear city and built the first few kilometres of the road that bears his name, which embodies the idea. The Gran V\u00eda was built using different styles that evolved over time: French style, eclectic, art deco, and expressionist.\nAntonio Palacios built a series of buildings inspired by the Viennese Secession, such as the Palace of Communication, the C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes, and the R\u00edo de La Plata Bank (now Instituto Cervantes). Other notable buildings include the Bank of Spain, the neo-Gothic Almudena Cathedral, Atocha Station, and the Catalan art-nouveau Palace of Longoria. Las Ventas Bullring was built, as the Market of San Miguel (Cast-Iron style).\n\nFollowing the Francoist takeover that ensued the end of Spanish Civil war, architecture experienced an involution, discarding rationalism and, eclecticism notwithstanding, going back to an overall rather \"outmoded\" architectural language, with the purpose of turning Madrid into a capital worthy of the \"Immortal Spain\". Iconic examples of this period include the Ministry of the Air (a case of herrerian revival) and the Edificio Espa\u00f1a (presented as the tallest building in Europe when it was inaugurated in 1953). Many of these buildings distinctly combine the use of brick and stone in the fa\u00e7ades. The Casa Sindical marked a breaking point as it was the first to reassume rationalism, although that relinking to modernity was undertaken through the imitation of the Italian Fascist architecture.With the advent of Spanish economic development, skyscrapers, such as Torre Picasso, Torres Blancas and Torre BBVA, and the Gate of Europe, appeared in the late 20th century in the city. During the decade of the 2000s, the four tallest skyscrapers in Spain were built and together form the Cuatro Torres Business Area. Terminal 4 at\nMadrid-Barajas Airport  was inaugurated in 2006 and won several architectural awards.\nTerminal 4 is one of the world's largest terminal areas and features glass panes and domes in the roof, which allow natural light to pass through.\n\n\n=== Parks and forests ===\n\nMadrid is the European city with the highest number of trees and green surface per inhabitant and it has the second highest number of aligned trees in the world, with 248,000 units, only exceeded by Tokyo. Madrid's citizens have access to a green area within a 15-minute walk. Since 1997, green areas have increased by 16%. At present, 8.2% of Madrid's grounds are green areas, meaning that there are 16 m2 (172 sq ft) of green area per inhabitant, far exceeding the 10 m2 (108 sq ft) per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization.\nA great bulk of the most important parks in Madrid are related to areas originally belonging to the royal assets (including El Pardo, Soto de Vi\u00f1uelas, Casa de Campo, El Buen Retiro, la Florida and the Pr\u00edncipe P\u00edo hill, and the Queen's Casino). The other main source for the \"green\" areas are the bienes de propios owned by the municipality (including the Dehesa de la Villa, the Dehesa de Arganzuela or Viveros).El Retiro is the most visited location of the city. Having an area bigger than 1.4 km2 (0.5 sq mi) (350 acres), it is the largest park within the Almendra Central, the inner part of the city enclosed by the M-30. Created during the reign of Philip IV (17th century), it was handed over to the municipality in 1868, after the Glorious Revolution. It lies next to the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid.\nLocated northwest of the city centre, the Parque del Oeste (\"Park of the West\") comprises part of the area of the former royal possession of the \"Real Florida\", and it features a slope as the height decreases down to the Manzanares. Its southern extension includes the Temple of Debod, a transported ancient Egyptian temple.Other urban parks are the Parque de El Capricho, the Parque Juan Carlos I (both in northeast Madrid), Madrid R\u00edo, the Enrique Tierno Galv\u00e1n Park, the San Isidro Park as well as gardens suchs as the Campo del Moro (opened to the public in 1978) and the Sabatini Gardens (opened to the public in 1931) near the Royal Palace.\nFurther west, across the Manzanares, lies the Casa de Campo, a large forested area with more than 1700 hectares (6.6 sq mi) where the Madrid Zoo, and the Parque de Atracciones de Madrid amusement park are located. It was ceded to the municipality following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931.The Monte de El Pardo is the largest forested area in the municipality. A holm oak forest covering a surface over 16,000 hectares, it is considered the best preserved mediterranean forest in the Community of Madrid and one of the best preserved in Europe. Already mentioned in the Alfonso XI's Libro de la monter\u00eda from the mid 14th-century, its condition as hunting location linked to the Spanish monarchy help to preserve the environmental value. During the reign of Ferdinand VII the regime of hunting prohibition for the Monte de El Pardo became one of full property and the expropriation of all possessions within its bounds was enforced, with dire consequences for the madrilenians at the time. It is designated as Special Protection Area for bird-life and it is also part of the Regional Park of the High Basin of the Manzanares.\nOther large forested areas include the Soto de Vi\u00f1uelas, the Dehesa de Valdelatas and the Dehesa de la Villa. As of 2015, the most recent big park in the municipality is the Valdebebas Park. Covering a total area of 4.7 km,2 it is sub-divided in a 3.4 km2 (1.3 sq mi) forest park (the Parque Forestal de Valdebebas), a 0.8 km2 (0.31 sq mi) periurban park as well as municipal garden centres and compost plants.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAfter it became the capital of Spain in the 16th century, Madrid was more a centre of consumption than of production or trade. Economic activity was largely devoted to supplying the city's own rapidly growing population, including the royal household and national government, and to such trades as banking and publishing.\nA large industrial sector did not develop until the 20th century, but thereafter industry greatly expanded and diversified, making Madrid the second industrial city in Spain. However, the economy of the city is now becoming more and more dominated by the service sector. A major European financial center, its stock market is the third largest stock market in Europe featuring both the IBEX 35 index and the attached Latibex stock market (with the second most important index for Latin American companies). It concentrates about the 75 % of banking operations in the country.Madrid is the 5th most important leading Centre of Commerce in Europe (after London, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam) and ranks 11th in the world. It is the leading Spanish-speaking city in terms of webpage creation.\n\n\n=== Economic history ===\nAs the capital city of the Spanish Empire from 1561, Madrid's population grew rapidly. Administration, banking, and small-scale manufacturing centred on the royal court were among the main activities, but the city was more a locus of consumption than production or trade, geographically isolated as it was before the coming of the railways.\nThe Bank of Spain is one of the oldest European central banks. Originally named as the Bank of San Carlos as it was founded in 1782, it was later renamed to Bank of San Fernando in 1829 and ultimately became the Bank of Spain in 1856. Its headquarters are located at the calle de Alcal\u00e1.\nThe Madrid Stock Exchange was inaugurated on 20 October 1831. Its benchmark stock market index is the IBEX 35.\nIndustry started to develop on a large scale only in the 20th century, but then grew rapidly, especially during the \"Spanish miracle\" period around the 1960s. The economy of the city was then centred on manufacturing industries such as those related to motor vehicles, aircraft, chemicals, electronic devices, pharmaceuticals, processed food, printed materials, and leather goods. Since the restoration of democracy in the late 1970s, the city has continued to expand. Its economy is now among the most dynamic and diverse in the European Union.\n\n\n=== Present-day economy ===\n\nMadrid concentrates activities directly connected with power (central and regional government, headquarters of Spanish companies, regional HQ of multinationals, financial institutions) and with knowledge and technological innovation (research centres and universities).

It is located on two campuses, the main one of Ciudad Universitaria in the Moncloa-Aravaca district, and the secondary campus of Somosaguas, located outside the city limits in Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n and founded in 1971. The Complutense University of Madrid was founded in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, old Complutum, by Cardinal Cisneros in 1499. Nevertherless, its real origin dates back to 1293, when King Sancho IV of Castile built the General Schools of Alcal\u00e1, which would give rise to Cisnero's Complutense University. During the course of 1509\u20131510 five schools were already operative: Artes y Filosof\u00eda (Arts and Philosophy), Teolog\u00eda (Theology), Derecho Can\u00f3nico (Canonical Laws), Letras (Liberal Arts) and Medicina (Medicine). In 1836, during the reign of Isabel II, the University was moved to Madrid, where it took the name of Central University and was located at San Bernardo Street. Subsequently, in 1927, a new University City (Ciudad Universitaria) was planned to be built in the district of Moncloa-Aravaca, in lands handed over by the King Alfonso XIII to this purpose. The Spanish Civil War turned the University City into a war zone, causing the destruction of several schools in the area, as well as the loss of part of its rich scientific, artistic and bibliographic heritage.\nIn 1970 the Government reformed the High Education, and the Central University became the Complutense University of Madrid. It was then when the new campus at Somosaguas was created to house the new School of Social Sciences. The old Alcal\u00e1 campus was reopened as the independent UAH, University of Alcal\u00e1, in 1977. Complutense also serves to the population of students who select Madrid as their residency during their study abroad period. Students from the United States for example, might go to Madrid on a program like API (Academic Programs International) and study at Complutense for an intense immersion into the Spanish Language. After studying at the University, students return home with a fluent sense of Spanish as well as culture and diversity.\n\nThe Technical University of Madrid (Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid; UPM), is the top technical university in Spain. It is the result of the merge of different Technical Schools of Engineering. It shares the Ciudad Universitaria campus with the UCM, while it also owns several schools scattered in the city centre and additional campuses in the Puente de Vallecas district and in the neighbouring municipality of Boadilla del Monte.\nThe Autonomous University of Madrid (Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid; UAM) was instituted under the leadership of the physicist, Nicol\u00e1s Cabrera. The Autonomous University is widely recognised for its research strengths in theoretical physics. Known simply as La Aut\u00f3noma by locals, its main site is the Cantoblanco Campus, located at the North of the municipality, close to its boundaries with the neighbouring municipalities of Alcobendas, San Sebasti\u00e1n de los Reyes and Tres Cantos.\nLocated on the main site are the Rectorate building and the Faculties of Science, Philosophy and Fine Arts, Law, Economic Science and Business Studies, Psychology, Higher School of Computing Science and Engineering, and the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education. The UAM is considered the institution to study Law in Spain, The Medical School is sited outside the main site and beside the Hospital Universitario La Paz.The private Comillas Pontifical University (Universidad Pontificia Comillas; UPC) has its rectorate and several faculties in Madrid. The private Nebrija University is also based in Madrid. Some of the big public universities headquartered in the surrounding municipalities also have secondary campuses in Madrid proper: it is the case of the Charles III University of Madrid (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; UC3M) with its main site in Getafe and an educational facility in Embajadores (after signing a deal with the regional government and the city council in 2011) and the King Juan Carlos University (Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; URJC) having its main site in M\u00f3stoles and a secondary campus in Vic\u00e1lvaro. The private Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela University (Universidad Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela; UCJC) has a postgrade school in Chamber\u00ed.\n\n\n=== Business schools ===\n\nIE Business School (formerly Instituto de Empresa) has its main campus on the border of the Chamart\u00edn and Salamanca districts of Madrid. IE Business School recently ranked #1 in WSJ's 2009 rankings for Best MBA Programs under 2 years. It scored ahead of usual stalwarts, INSEAD and IMD, giving it top billing among International MBA programs. Although based in Barcelona, both IESE Business School and ESADE Business School also have Madrid campuses. These three schools are the top-ranked business schools in Spain, consistently rank among the top 20 business schools globally, and offer MBA programs (in English or Spanish) as well as other business degrees. Madrid is a good destination for business schools and a city much desired by foreign students. The most important Spanish business schools (IESE, IE, ESADE) have invested 125 million euros in expanding their campuses in Madrid in 2020.Other Madrid business schools and universities that have MBA programs include: EAE Business School (in English and Spanish), the Charles III University of Madrid through the Centro de Ampliaci\u00f3n de Estudios (in English or Spanish); the Comillas Pontifical University (in Spanish only) and the Technical University of Madrid (in Spanish only).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nMadrid is served by several roads and three modes of public surface transport, and two airports, one of them being almost two different airports. A great many important road, rail and air links converge on the capital, providing effective connections with other parts of the metropolitan region and with the rest of Spain and other parts of Europe.\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\nMadrid Central\nCars (except for hybrid and electric vehicles as well as residents and guests) were banned in the Madrid Central low-emission zone in 2018. Pollution in the area dropped following the ban. In 2016 it was announced that Madrid will stop the use of all diesel powered cars and trucks within the next decade.\nRadial roads\nMadrid is the centre of the most important roads of Spain. Already in 1720, the Reglamento General de Postas enacted by Philip V configurated the basis of a radial system of roads in the country.Madrid features a number of the most prominent autov\u00edas (fast dualled highways), part of the State Road Network. Clock-wise starting from the north: the A-1 (Madrid\u2013Ir\u00fan\u2013French border), A-2 (Madrid\u2013Zaragoza\u2013Barcelona\u2013French border), A-3 (Madrid\u2013Valencia), A-4 (Madrid\u2013C\u00f3rdoba\u2013Sevilla\u2013C\u00e1diz), A-5 (Madrid\u2013Badajoz\u2013Portuguese border) and the A-6 (Madrid\u2013A Coru\u00f1a). The A-42, another highway connecting Madrid to Toledo, is also part of the State Network.\nThe M-607 connects Madrid to the Puerto de Navacerrada. It is a fast dualled highway in its initial stretch from Madrid to Colmenar Viejo, and part of the Regional Road Network (in relation to the concerning administration, not to the technical features of the road).\nDue to the large amount of traffic, new toll highways were built parallel to the main national freeways. Their names are R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-5 and they were intended to provide a paid alternative to the often overcrowded free radials. However, except the R-3, they do not end close to the M-30 innermost ring road, as the R-2 finishes in the M-40, the R-4 in the M-50 and the R-5 in the M-40.\n\nOrbital roads\nAlso Madrid road network includes four orbital ones at different distances from the centre.\nThe innermost ring-road, the M-30, is the only one with its path strictly located within the Madrid municipal limits. It is owned by the Madrid City Council and operated by Madrid Calle 30, S.A. It is the busiest Spanish road, famous for its traffic jams. A significant portion of the southern part runs underground parallel to the Manzanares, with tunnel sections of more than 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) in length and 3 to 6 lanes in each direction.\nThe second ring-road, the M-40 (part of the State Road Network) circles the city, while also extending to other surrounding municipalities. A NW stretch of the road runs underground, below the southern reaches of the Monte de El Pardo protected area.\nThe M-45 partially circles the city, connecting the M-40 and M-50, passing through areas like Villaverde and Vallecas in the South-East of the municipality.\nThe M-50, the Madrid's outer ring road, connects municipalities and cities in the metropolitan area, like Fuenlabrada, M\u00f3stoles, Getafe, Legan\u00e9s in the South and Boadilla del Monte and Las Rozas in the West.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThere are four major components of public transport, with many intermodal interchanges. The Consorcio Regional de Transportes de Madrid (CRTM) coordinates the public transport operations across multiple providers in the region, harmonizing fares for the commuter rail, rapid transit, light rail and bus transport services provided by different operators.\n\nMetro\nThe Metro is the rapid transit system serving Madrid as well as some suburbs. Founded in 1919, it underwent extensive enlargement in the second half of the 20th century. It is the second longest metro system in Europe (after London's) at 294 kilometres (183 miles). As of 2019, it has 302 stations. Only the M\u00e9tro of Paris has more stations. It features 13 lines; 12 of them are colour-coded and numbered 1 to 12 (Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 5, Line 6, Line 7, Line 8, Line 9, Line 10, Line 11 and Line 12), while the other one, the short Ramal (R), links \u00d3pera to Pr\u00edncipe P\u00edo.\nCercan\u00edas\nCercan\u00edas Madrid is the commuter rail service used for longer distances from the suburbs and beyond into Madrid, consisting of nine lines totalling 578 kilometres (359 miles) and more than 90 stations. With fewer stops inside the centre of the city they are faster than the Metro, but run less frequently. This system is connected with Metro (presently 22 stations) and Light Metro. The lines are named: C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10, respectively.\n\nBusesThere is a dense network of bus routes, run by the municipal company Empresa Municipal de Transportes (or EMT Madrid), which operates 24 hours a day; special services called \"N lines\" are run during nighttime. The special Airport Express Shuttle line connecting the airport with the city centre features distinctively yellow buses. In addition to the urban lines operated by the EMT, the green buses (interurbanos) connect the city with the suburbs. The later lines, while also regulated by the CRTM, are often run by private operators.\nAlmost half of all journeys in the metropolitan area are made on public transport, a very high proportion compared with most European cities.\nMadrid has 15723 taxis around all the city.\n\nTaxiThe taxicabs are regulated by a specific sub-division of taxi service, a body dependent of the Madrid City Council. The authorisation entails a badge for the vehicle and a license for the driver, who has to be older than 18. Since the 1970s, the fleet of taxis has remained stable roughly around 16,000 vehicles, accounting for 15,600 in 2014.\n\n\n=== Long-distance transport ===\n\nIn terms of longer-distance transport, Madrid is the central node of the system of autov\u00edas, giving the city direct fast road links with most parts of Spain and with France and Portugal. It is also the focal point of one of the world's three largest high-speed rail systems, Alta Velocidad Espa\u00f1ola (AVE), which has brought major cities such as Seville and Barcelona within 2.5 hours travel time. There are now 2,900 kilometres (1,800 miles) of AVE track, connecting Madrid with 17 provincial capitals, and further lines are under construction.Also Spain business are designing new high speed trains which will be the new generation AVE 104 like Talgo AVRIL.\nAside from the local and regional bus commuting services, Madrid is also a node for long-distance bus connections to plenty of national destinations. The Estaci\u00f3n Sur de Autobuses in M\u00e9ndez \u00c1lvaro, the busiest bus station in the country, also features international bus connections to cities in Morocco as well as to diverse European destinations.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nMadrid is also home to the Madrid-Barajas Airport, the sixth-largest airport in Europe, handling over 60 million passengers annually, of whom 70% are international travellers, in addition to the majority of Spain's air freight movements. Barajas is a major European hub, yet a largely westward facing one, specialized in the Americas, with a comparatively lighter connectivity to Asia. Madrid's location at the centre of the Iberian Peninsula makes it a major logistics base. Madrid-Barajas Airport has 4 Terminals and also the terminal 4S, called Satellite terminal, this terminal is 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) from the terminal 4 and connected by an Automated People Mover System (AMP) train.\nThe smaller (and older) Cuatro Vientos Airport has a dual military-civilian use and hosts several aviation schools. The Torrej\u00f3n Air Base, located in the neighbouring municipality of Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz, also has a secondary civilian use aside from the military purpose.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Diplomacy ===\nMadrid hosts 121 foreign embassies accredited before Spain, comprising all resident embassies in the country. The headquarters of the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation, the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation and the Diplomatic School are also located in the city.\n\n\n=== International organizations ===\nMadrid hosts the seat of international organizations such as the United Nations' World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB), the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI), the International Youth Organism for Iberoamerica (OIJ), the Ibero-American Organization of Social Security (OISS), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the Club of Madrid and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nMadrid has reached twin towns, sister city 'agreements' (acuerdos) with:\n\nMadrid has reached twin towns, sister city 'minutes' (actas) with:\nRabat, Morocco (1988)\nTripoli, Libya (1988)\n\n\n=== Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities ===\nMadrid is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities establishing brotherly relations with the following cities through the issuing of a collective statement in October 1982:\n\n\n=== Other city partnerships ===\n\n\n=== Partnerships with international organizations ===\nC-40 Cities (C40)\nInternational Labour Organization (OIT)\nIbero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB)\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)\nUnited Nations Human Settlements Programme (ONU-HABITAT)\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Honours ==\nMadrid Dome in Aristotle Mountains, Graham Land in Antarctica is named after the city.\n\n\n== See also ==\nC40 Cities Climate Leadership Group\nMadrid Conference of 1991\nMayor of Madrid\nList of tallest buildings in Madrid\nOPENCities\nList of films set in Madrid\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBahamonde Magro, \u00c1ngel; Otero Carvajal, Luis Enrique (1989).

        "wiki": "Mallorca (Catalan: [m\u0259\u02c8\u028e\u0254\u027ek\u0259], Spanish: [ma\u02c8\u028eo\u027eka]) or Majorca (English:  m\u0259-YOR-k\u0259, -\u2060JOR-) is the largest island in the Balearic Islands, which are part of Spain and located in the Mediterranean.  The local language, as on the rest of the Balearic Islands, is Catalan, which is co-official with Spanish.\nThe capital of the island, Palma, is also the capital of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. The Balearic Islands have been an autonomous region of Spain since 1983. There are two small islands off the coast of Mallorca: Cabrera (southeast of Palma) and Dragonera (west of Palma). The anthem of Mallorca is \"La Balanguera\".\nLike the other Balearic Islands of Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera, the island is an extremely popular holiday destination, particularly for tourists from Germany and the United Kingdom. The international airport, Palma de Mallorca Airport, is one of the busiest in Spain; it was used by 28 million passengers in 2017, with use increasing every year since 2012.The name derives from Classical Latin insula maior, \"larger island\". Later, in Medieval Latin, this became Maiorica, \"the larger one\", in comparison to Menorca, \"the smaller one\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric settlements ===\n\nLittle is recorded of the earliest inhabitants of the island. Burial chambers and traces of habitation from the Neolithic period (6000\u20134000 BC) have been discovered, particularly the prehistoric settlements called talaiots, or talayots. They raised Bronze Age megaliths as part of their Talaiotic culture. A non-exhaustive list is the following:\n\nCapocorb Vell (Llucmajor municipality)\nNecr\u00f2poli de Son Real (east of Can Picafort, Santa Margalida municipality)\nNovetiforme Alemany (Magaluffa, Calvi\u00e0, Miconio)\nPoblat Talai\u00f2tic de S'Illot (S'Illot, Sant Lloren\u00e7 des Cardassar municipality)\nPoblat Talai\u00f2tic de Son Forn\u00e9s (Montu\u00efri municipality)\nSa Canova de Morell (road to Col\u00f2nia de Sant Pere, Art\u00e0 municipality)\nSes Pa\u00efsses (Art\u00e0 municipality)\nSes Talaies de Can Jordi (Santany\u00ed municipality)\nS'Hospitalet Vell (road to Cales de Mallorca, Manacor municipality)\n\n\n=== Phoenicians, Romans, and Late Antiquity ===\n\nThe Phoenicians, a seafaring people from the Levant, arrived around the eighth century BC and established numerous colonies. The island eventually came under the control of Carthage in North Africa, which had become the principal Phoenician city. After the Second Punic War, Carthage lost all of its overseas possessions and the Romans took over.The island was occupied by the Romans in 123 BC under Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus. It flourished under Roman rule, during which time the towns of Pollentia (Alc\u00fadia), and Palmaria (Palma) were founded. In addition, the northern town of Bocchoris, dating back to pre-Roman times, was a federated city to Rome. The local economy was largely driven by olive cultivation, viticulture, and salt mining. Mallorcan soldiers were valued within the Roman legions for their skill with the sling.In 427, Gunderic and the Vandals captured the island. Geiseric, son of Gunderic, governed Mallorca and used it as his base to loot and plunder settlements around the Mediterranean  until Roman rule was restored in 465.\n\n\n=== Middle Age and Modern history ===\n\n\n==== Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages ====\nIn 534, Mallorca was recaptured by the Eastern Roman Empire, led by Apollinarius. Under Roman rule, Christianity thrived and numerous churches were built.\nFrom 707, the island was increasingly attacked by Muslim raiders from North Africa. Recurrent invasions led the islanders to ask Charlemagne for help.\n\n\n==== Moorish Mallorca ====\n\nIn 902, Issam al-Khawlani(es)(ca) (Arabic: \u0639\u0635\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u064a\u200e) conquered the Balearic Islands, and it became part of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba. The town of Palma was reshaped and expanded, and became known as Medina Mayurqa. Later on, with the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba at its height, the Moors improved agriculture with irrigation and developed local industries.\nThe caliphate was dismembered in 1015. Mallorca came under rule by the Taifa of D\u00e9nia, and from 1087 to 1114, was an independent Taifa. During that period, the island was visited by Ibn Hazm. However, an expedition of Pisans and Catalans in 1114\u201315, led by Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, overran the island, laying siege to Palma for eight months. After the city fell, the invaders retreated due to problems in their own lands. They were replaced by the Almoravides from North Africa, who ruled until 1176. The Almoravides were replaced by the Almohad dynasty until 1229. Ab\u00fa Yahya was the last Moorish leader of Mallorca.\n\n\n==== Medieval Mallorca ====\n\nIn the ensuing confusion and unrest, King James I of Aragon, also known as James the Conqueror, launched an invasion which landed at Santa Pon\u00e7a, Mallorca, on 8\u20139 September 1229 with 15,000 men and 1,500 horses. His forces entered the city of Medina Mayurqa on 31 December 1229. In 1230 he annexed the island to his Crown of Aragon under the name Regnum Maioricae.\n\n\n==== Modern era ====\n\nFrom 1479, the Crown of Aragon was in dynastic union with that of Castile. The Barbary corsairs of North Africa often attacked the Balearic Islands, and in response, the people built coastal watchtowers and fortified churches. In 1570, King Philip II of Spain and his advisors were considering complete evacuation of the Balearic islands.In the early 18th century, the War of the Spanish Succession resulted in the replacement of that dynastic union with a unified Spanish monarchy under the rule of the new Bourbon Dynasty. The last episode of the War of Spanish Succession was the conquest of the island of Mallorca. It took place on 2 July 1715 when the island capitulated to the arrival of a Bourbon fleet. In 1716, the Nueva Planta decrees made Mallorca part of the Spanish province of Baleares, roughly the same to present-day Illes Balears province and autonomous community.\n\n\n=== 20th century and today ===\nA Nationalist stronghold at the start of the Spanish Civil War, Mallorca was subjected to an amphibious landing, on 16 August 1936, aimed at driving the Nationalists from Mallorca and reclaiming the island for the Republic. Although the Republicans heavily outnumbered their opponents and managed to push 12 km (7.5 mi) inland, superior Nationalist air power, provided mainly by Fascist Italy as part of the Italian occupation of Majorca, forced the Republicans to retreat and to leave the island completely by 12 September. Those events became known as the Battle of Majorca.Since the 1950s, the advent of mass tourism has transformed the island into a destination for foreign visitors and attracted many service workers from mainland Spain. The boom in tourism caused Palma to grow significantly.\nIn the 21st century, urban redevelopment, under the so\u2011called Pla Mirall (English \"Mirror Plan\"), attracted groups of immigrant workers from outside the European Union, especially from Africa and South America.\n\n\n==== Archaeology ====\nA 3,200-year-old well-preserved Bronze Age sword was discovered by archaeologists under the leadership of Jaume Deya and Pablo Galera on the Mallorca Island in the Puigpunyent from the stone megaliths site called Talaiot. Specialists assumed that the weapon was made when the Talaiotic culture was in critical comedown. The sword will be on display at the nearby Majorca Museum.\n\n\n=== Palma ===\n\nThe capital of Mallorca, Palma, was founded as a Roman camp called Palmaria upon the remains of a Talaiotic settlement. The turbulent history of the city had it subject to several Vandal sackings during the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It was later reconquered by the Byzantines, established by the Moors (who called it Medina Mayurqa), and finally occupied by James I of Aragon. In 1983, Palma became the capital of the autonomous region of the Balearic Islands. Palma has a famous tourist attraction, the cathedral, Catedral-Bas\u00edlica de Santa Mar\u00eda de Mallorca, standing in the heart of the City looking out over the ocean.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate of Mallorca is a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa), with mild and stormy winters and hot, bright, dry summers. Precipitation in the Serra de Tramuntana is markedly higher. Summers are hot in the plains, and winters mild, getting colder in the Tramuntana range, where brief episodes of snow during the winter are not unusual. The two wettest months in Mallorca are October and December.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nMallorca and the other Balearic Islands are geologically an extension of the fold mountains of the Betic Cordillera of Andalusia. They consist primarily of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea during the Mesozoic era. These marine deposits have given rise to calcareous rocks which are often fossiliferous. The folding of the Betic Cordillera and Mallorcan ranges resulted from subduction of the African plate beneath the Eurasian plate with eventual collision. Tectonic movements led to different elevation and lowering zones in the late Tertiary period, which is why the connection to the mainland has been severed at the current sea level. \nThe limestones, which predominate throughout Mallorca, are readily water-soluble, and have given rise to extensive areas of karst. In addition to limestone, dolomitic rocks are mainly present in the mountainous regions of Mallorca; the Serra de Tramuntana and the Serres de Llevant. The Serres de Llevant also contain marl, the more rapid erosion of which has resulted in the lower elevations of the island's southeastern mountains. Marl is limestone with a high proportion of clay minerals. The eroded material was washed into the sea or deposited in the interior of the island of the Pla de Mallorca, bright marls in the north-east of the island and ferrous clays in the middle of Mallorca, which gives the soil its characteristic reddish colour.\n\n\n=== Regions ===\n\nMallorca is the largest island of Spain by area and second most populated (after Tenerife in the Canary Islands).\nMallorca has two mountainous regions, the Serra de Tramuntana and Serres de Llevant. Both are about 70 km (43 mi) in length and occupy the northwestern and eastern parts of the island respectively.\nThe highest peak on Mallorca is Puig Major at 1,445 m (4,741 ft) in the Serra de Tramuntana. As this is a military zone, the neighbouring peak at Puig de Massanella is the highest accessible peak at 1,364 m (4,475 ft). The northeast coast comprises two bays: the Badia de Pollen\u00e7a and the larger Badia d'Alc\u00fadia.\nThe northern coast is rugged and has many cliffs. The central zone, extending from Palma, is a generally flat, fertile plain known as Es Pla.  The island has a variety of caves both above and below the sea \u2013 two of the caves, the above sea level Coves dels Hams and the Coves del Drach, also contain underground lakes and are open to tours.  Both are located near the eastern coastal town of Porto Cristo.  Small uninhabited islands lie off the southern and western coasts; the Cabrera Archipelago is administratively grouped with Mallorca (in the municipality of Palma), while Dragonara is administratively included in the municipality of Andratx. Other notable areas include the Alfabia Mountains, Es Cornadors and Cap de Formentor.\n\n\n=== World Heritage Site ===\nThe Cultural Landscape of the Serra de Tramuntana was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.\n\n\n=== Municipalities ===\n\nThe island (including the small offshore islands of Cabrera and Dragonera) is administratively divided into 53 municipalities. The areas and populations of the municipalities (according to the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, Spain) are:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria ===\n\nArchduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria (Catalan: Arxiduc Llu\u00eds Salvador) was the architect of tourism in the Balearic Islands. He first arrived on the island in 1867, travelling under his title \"Count of Neuendorf\". He later settled on Mallorca, buying up wild areas of land in order to preserve and enjoy them. Nowadays, a number of trekking routes are named after him.Ludwig Salvator loved the island of Mallorca. He became fluent in Catalan, carried out research into the island's flora and fauna, history, and culture to produce his main work, Die Balearen, a comprehensive collection of books about the Balearic Islands, consisting of 7 volumes. It took him 22 years to complete.\n\n\n=== Chopin in Mallorca ===\n\nThe Polish composer and pianist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, together with French writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (pseudonym: George Sand), resided in Valldemossa in the winter of 1838\u201339. Apparently, Chopin's health had already deteriorated and his doctor recommended that he go to the Balearic Islands to recuperate, where he still spent a rather miserable winter.Nonetheless, his time in Mallorca was a productive period for Chopin. He managed to finish the Preludes, Op. 28, that he started writing in 1835. He was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.\n\n\n=== Literature and painting ===\nFrench writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (pseudonym: George Sand), at that time in a relationship with Chopin, described her stay in Mallorca in A Winter in Majorca, published in 1855. Other famous writers used Mallorca as the setting for their works: While on the island, the Nicaraguan poet Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo started writing the novel El oro de Mallorca, and wrote several poems, such as La isla de oro. Many of the works of Baltasar Porcel take place in Mallorca. Ira Levin set part of his dystopian novel This Perfect Day in Mallorca, making the island a centre of resistance in a world otherwise dominated by a computer.\nAgatha Christie visited the island in the early 20th century and stayed in Palma and Port de Pollen\u00e7a. She would later write the book Problem at Pollensa Bay and Other Stories, a collection of short stories, of which the first one takes place in Port de Pollen\u00e7a, starring Parker Pyne.\nJorge Luis Borges visited Mallorca twice, accompanied by his family. He published his poems La estrella (1920) and Catedral (1921) in the regional magazine Baleares. The latter poem shows his admiration for the monumental Cathedral of Palma.Nobel prize winner Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela came to Mallorca in 1954, visiting Pollen\u00e7a, and then moving to Palma, where he settled permanently. In 1956, Cela founded the magazine Papeles de Son Armadans. He is also credited as founder of Alfaguara.\n\nThe English poet Robert Graves moved to Mallorca with his family in 1946. The house is now a museum. He died in 1985 and his body was buried in the small churchyard on a hill at Dei\u00e0.\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\nThe Ball dels Cossiers is the island's traditional dance. It is believed to have been imported from Catalonia in the 13th or 14th century, after the Aragonese conquest of the island under King Jaime I. In the dance, three pairs of dancers, who are typically male, defend a \"Lady,\" who is played by a man or a woman, from a demon or devil. Another Mallorcan dance is Correfoc, an elaborate festival of dance and pyrotechnics that is also of Catalan origin. The island's folk music strongly resembles that of Catalonia, and is centered around traditional instruments like the xeremies (bagpipe) and guitarra de canya (a reed or bone xylophone-like instrument suspended from the neck). While folk music is still played and enjoyed by many on the island, a number of other musical traditions have become popular in Mallorca in the 21st century, including electronic dance music, classical music, and jazz, all of which have annual festivals on the island.\n\n\n=== Art ===\nJoan Mir\u00f3, a Spanish painter, sculptor, and ceramicist, had close ties to the island throughout his life, he married Pilar Juncosa in Palma in 1929 and settled permanently in Mallorca in 1954. The Fundaci\u00f3 Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3 in Mallorca has a collection of his works. Es Baluard in Palma is a museum of modern and contemporary art which exhibits the work of Balearic artists and artists related to the Balearic Islands.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe Evolution Mallorca International Film Festival is the fastest growing Mediterranean film festival and has occurred annually every November since 2011, attracting filmmakers, producers, and directors globally. It is hosted at the Teatro Principal in Palma de Mallorca\n\n\n=== Mallorcan cartographic school ===\n\nMallorca has a long history of seafaring. The Majorcan cartographic school or the \"Catalan school\" refers to a collection of cartographers, cosmographers, and navigational instrument makers that flourished in Mallorca and partly in mainland Catalonia in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. Mallorcan cosmographers and cartographers developed breakthroughs in cartographic techniques, namely the \"normal portolan chart\", which was fine-tuned for navigational use and the plotting by compass of navigational routes, prerequisites for the discovery of the New World.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nIn 2005, there were over 2,400 restaurants on the island of Mallorca according to the Mallorcan Tourist Board, ranging from small bars to full restaurants. Olives and almonds are typical of the Mallorcan diet. Among the foods that are typical from Mallorca are sobrassada, arr\u00f2s brut (saffron rice cooked with chicken, pork and vegetables), and the sweet pastry ensa\u00efmada. Also Pa amb oli is a popular dish.Herbs de Majorca is a herbal liqueur.\n\n\n== Language ==\nThe main language spoken on the island is Catalan. The two official languages of Mallorca are Catalan and Spanish. The local dialect of Catalan spoken in the island is Mallorqu\u00ed, with slightly different variants in most villages. Education is bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, with some teaching of English.In 2012, the then-governing People's Party announced its intention to end preferential treatment for Catalan in the island's schools to bring parity to the two languages of the island. It was said that this could lead Mallorcan Catalan to become extinct in the fairly near future, as it was being used in a situation of diglossia in favour of the Spanish language. As of 2016, with the most recent election in May 2015 sweeping a pro-Catalan party and president into power, the Popular Party's policy of trilingualism (Catal\u00e1n, Spanish, English) has been dismantled, making this outcome unlikely.\n\n\n== Population ==\nMallorca is the most populous island in the Balearic Islands and the second most populous island in Spain, after Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, being also the fourth most populous island in the Mediterranean after Sicily, Sardinia and Cyprus. It had an officially estimated population of 896,038 inhabitants at the start of 2019.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSince the 1950s, Mallorca has become a major tourist destination, and the tourism business has become the main source of revenue for the island. With thousands of rooms available Mallorca's economy is largely dependent on its tourism industry. Holiday makers are attracted by the large number of beaches, warm weather, and high-quality tourist amenities. Due to the climate and diversity in roads, Majorca attracts a lot of cyclists.\nThe island's popularity as a tourist destination has steadily grown since the 1950s, with many artists and academics choosing to visit and live on the island. Visitors to Mallorca continued to increase with holiday makers in the 1970s approaching 3 million a year. In 2010 over 6 million visitors came to Mallorca. In 2013, Mallorca was visited by nearly 9.5 million tourists, and the Balearic Islands as a whole reached 13 million tourists. In 2017, ten million tourists visited the island. The rapid growth of the tourism industry has led to some locals protesting the effects of mass tourism on the island.Mallorca has been jokingly referred to as the 17th Federal State of Germany, due to the high number of German tourists.Attempts to build illegally caused a scandal in 2006 in Port Andratx that the newspaper El Pa\u00eds named \"caso Andratx\". A main reason for illegal building permits, corruption and black market construction is that communities have few ways to finance themselves other than through permits. The former mayor was incarcerated in 2009 after being prosecuted for taking bribes to permit illegal house building.\n\n\n=== Top 10 arrivals by nationality ===\nData from Institute of Statistics of Balearic Islands\n\n\n== Politics and government ==\n\n\n=== Regional government ===\nThe Balearic Islands, of which Mallorca forms part, are one of the autonomous communities of Spain. As a whole, they are currently governed by the Balearic Islands Socialist Party (PSIB-PSOE), with Francina Armengol as their President.\n\n\n=== Insular government ===\nThe specific government institution for the island is the Insular Council of Mallorca, created in 1978.It is responsible for culture, roads, railways (see Serveis Ferroviaris de Mallorca) and municipal administration. As of July 2019, Catalina Cladera (PSIB-PSOE) serves as president of the Insular Council.\n\n\n== Mallorcans ==\n\nSome of the earliest famous Mallorcans lived on the island before its reconquest from the Moors. Famous Mallorcans include:\n\nAl-Humayd\u012b, Moorish historian, born on the island in 1029.\nAbraham Cresques, a 14th-century Jewish cartographer of the Majorcan cartographic school from Palma, believed to be the author of the Catalan Atlas;\nRobert Graves, English writer, lived for many years in Mallorca, buried in a small churchyard on a hill at Dei\u00e0.\nRamon Llull, a friar, writer and philosopher, who wrote the first major work of Catalan Literature;\nJun\u00edpero Serra, the Franciscan friar who founded the mission chain in Alta California in 1769.\nJoaqu\u00edn Jovellar y Soler, 19th century military commander.\nAntonio Maura, two-time Spanish Prime Minister.\n\n\n=== Notable residents, alive in modern times ===\nEaktay Ahn (1906\u20131965), founder of the Balearic Symphony Orchestra and composer of Korean national anthem, lived in Mallorca from 1946 until his death in 1965.\nJeffrey Archer, English novelist, owns a villa in Mallorca.\nMarco Asensio, Spanish footballer, plays for Real Madrid, was born in Palma, Mallorca.\nMiquel Barcel\u00f3, contemporary painter, created sculptures in Palma Cathedral.\nConcha Buika, contemporary flamenco singer.

        "wiki": "S\u00f3ller (Catalan pronunciation: [\u02c8so\u028e\u0259]) is a town and municipality near the north west coast of Mallorca, in the Balearic Islands of Spain. The town is some 3 km inland from the Port de S\u00f3ller, in a large, bowl-shaped valley that also includes the village of Fornalutx and the hamlets of Biniaraix and Binibassi. The combined population is around 14,000. A famous tram, the Tranv\u00eda de S\u00f3ller operates in the town, linking S\u00f3ller to the Port de S\u00f3ller.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nS\u00f3ller is linked by the historic railway, the Ferrocarril de S\u00f3ller, and by a highway with a tunnel, to the Majorcan capital of Palma. The Ferrocaril was built on the profits from the orange and lemon trade and completed in 1911. The Andratx-Pollen\u00e7a highway also runs through the valley. The present-day economy is based mainly on tourism and the expenditure of foreign residents, complementary to the agricultural economy based around citrus and olive groves.  Soller is unique compared to towns on the rest of the island due to its geographical isolation, being surrounded by the Tramuntana mountain range. This isolation from all other major towns on the island, made it easier to trade with French merchants arriving by sea.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n \n\nThe focus of the town is the Pla\u00e7a Constituci\u00f3 which is surrounded by caf\u00e9s and has plane trees and a fountain in its centre. The tram passes through the Pla\u00e7a on its way to and from the main station which has been restored to incorporate a museum of Picasso and Joan Mir\u00f3. The church of Sant Bartomeu (Saint Bartholomew) facing the east side of the Pla\u00e7a is flanked by the ajuntament (town hall) and the Banco de S\u00f3ller, a remarkable 1912 Modernista building with defining ironwork, by the Catalan architect Joan Rubi\u00f3 i Bellver, a follower of Antoni Gaud\u00ed. The bank's organisation was founded in 1889 with the money of emigrants who returned prosperous to S\u00f3ller. On the other hand, the church can clearly be seen standing out from the canopy of the town from other parts of the Vall de S\u00f3ller (the surrounding valley). The original building dates from some time before 1236. The current main interior structure is now largely baroque (1688\u20131733).\nThe campanar (belltower) blends in well with its neo-gothic design. The remarkable fa\u00e7ade is a 1904 construction, also by Joan Rubi\u00f3. The old street plan is of Islamic origin and lined with historic houses of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. The town has a covered market and is bisected by a fast flowing river with a number of bridges. S\u00f3ller is also notable for the houses built in the early twentieth century by emigrants who returned wealthy to the town, particularly those on the Gran Via which reflect the fin de si\u00e8cle Art Nouveau styles of France.\nThe renowned Jard\u00ed Botanic (botanical garden) is on the outskirts of the town and is laid out with the plants of the Balearics and the Mediterranean islands. The Modernista mansion in the garden houses El Museu Balear de Ci\u00e8ncies Naturals (The Museum of Balearic Natural Sciences).\n\n\n== Events ==\nSince 1980, S\u00f3ller has hosted a week-long international folklore festival every May.\n\n\n== Personalities ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nS\u00f3ller Tourist Guide\nVeu de S\u00f3ller (local weekly newspaper), in Catalan\nSetmanari S\u00f3ller (local newspaper), in Catalan.\nJard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico (botanical garden), in Catalan and Spanish\nMuseu de Ciencias Naturales\nAjuntament de S\u00f3ller (Townhall of S\u00f3ller), in English",

In the year 1399 Martin of Aragon yielded all the royal possessions of Valldemossa to the Carthusian monks. These founded the Charterhouse and inhabited it until 1835, when it happened to private hands by the Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendiz\u00e1bal.The church, a neoclassical building decorated by great artists and craftsmen of the time, began to be built in 1751 on the primitive church erected in 1446. The complex has a cloister -one of the oldest parts of the current buildings-, the old pharmacy of the Carthusians, garden and the rooms of the Prioral Cell-chapel, former library, audience room, bedroom ...- where the historical and artistic legacy of the Carthusians is preserved, showing how the monks lived.

        "wiki": "Palma de Mallorca Airport (Catalan: Aeroport de Palma de Mallorca, Spanish: Aeropuerto de Palma de Mallorca; IATA: PMI, ICAO: LEPA; also known as Son Sant Joan Airport or Aeroport de Son Sant Joan) is an international airport located 8 km (5.0 mi) east of Palma, Mallorca, Spain, adjacent to the village of Can Pastilla. The airport on the Balearic Islands is Spain's third largest airport after Madrid\u2013Barajas and Barcelona-El Prat. Palma de Mallorca was used by 29.7 million passengers in 2019. The airport is the main base for the Spanish carrier Air Europa and also a focus airport for Ryanair, EasyJet, Vueling and Jet2.com. The airport shares runways with the nearby Son Sant Joan Air Force Base, operated by the Spanish Air Force.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe interest of the Spanish Government in developing airmail during the first decades of the 20th century, led to a study of the possibility of establishing an air mail line to the Balearic Islands. Finally, in 1921, the company Aeromar\u00edtima Mallorquina established the postal line Barcelona - Palma, which used seaplanes in the port of Palma de Mallorca. Before the creation of this airline, trials were complete in two flat fields: Son Sant Joan and Son Bonet, both of which were later chosen for the construction of aerodromes.In 1934, the company Aero-Taxi de Mallorca was created with the intention of starting tourist flights to the island, establishing a flight school in Son Sant Joan. A year later, another one was founded in Son Bonet.In May 1935 the company LAPE, L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Postales Espa\u00f1olas (Spanish Postal Airlines), a predecessor of Iberia; was founded. A month later, in August, the first regular air route between Madrid and Palma, stopping at Valencia, was created using the Son Sant Joan aerodrome. A year later, this line was replaced by a new one connecting Palma and Barcelona. Three years later, Lufthansa and Iberia established new lines in Son Bonet, while Son Sant Joan was beginning to be used by the military. Through the years, Son Bonet became the main civilian airport in the island, while the creation of Son Sant Joan Air Force Base limited further civilian enterprises at the aerodrome.In 1954, the runway was enlarged and paved to enable the operation of F-86 Sabre fighters, which also meant the diversion of the Palma - Llucmajor road. During those years, the first paved taxiways and aprons were built, while Son Bonet received the first big groups of European tourists through the airlines BEA, Air France and Aviaco.\n\n\n=== The creation of the international airport ===\nThe increase in traffic, and the inability to enlarge Son Bonet, led the authors of the 1958 National Airport Plan to propose building a large civilian airport near the Son Sant Joan airbase. The National Airport Council approved this plan the following year and commercial traffic was transferred from Son Bonet to Son Sant Joan. This was the birth of what today is known as the Palma de Mallorca Airport. During that year, a terminal and a civilian apron were built south of the military facilities, along with a VHF communication center. Also, a VOR was installed in the island.Finally, on 7th July 1960, the airport was opened to both domestic and international traffic.Just two weeks later, expansion of the airport was declared urgent by the government, and on summer 1961 the works of extension of the runway and taxiway were started. At the end of the year, more plans were made, including a power plant, a communications centre and fire and rescue facilities.\n\n\n=== Growth since the 1960s ===\nAfter reaching 1 million passengers for the first time in 1962, in 1965, a new terminal was constructed, and air navigation services were completed at the end of the following year. Also in 1965 Air Spain (1965 - 1975) began operating from the airport and a smaller terminal (today's Terminal B) was planned. Passenger numbers increased rapidly, reaching 2 million in 1965. Construction of a second runway, parallel to the existing one, was begun in 1970. Two years later, terminal B went into service, and the second runway (06L/24R) opened in 1974.\nIn 1980, the airport carried 7 million passengers. However, this increased to nearly 10 million in 1986. This led to the construction of yet another new terminal building, the current central terminal building. This building is now the airport's primary entrance and exit and houses the airport's checkin and baggage claim areas. Construction started in mid-1993 and it was designed by the Majorcan architect Pere Nicolau Bover. During the construction in 1995, passenger numbers exceeded 15 million. The new terminal finally opened in 1997.\n\n\n=== Today ===\nFollowing a decline in passenger numbers at the airport following the September 11 attacks in 2001, passenger numbers rose steadily between 2002 and 2007 when traffic peaked at 23.2 million passengers. From 2007 onward there was a decline in passenger numbers, with 21.1 million using the airport in 2010. Today, Palma de Mallorca airport carries over 29.7 million passengers per year to their destinations, with 178,253 aircraft movements, mostly to mainland Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom.\nIn November 2015, Air Berlin (1978 - 2017) announced that it would shut down its hub operations at the airport which it had maintained for over ten years. All seven domestic connection routes to the mainland, such as flights to Valencia, Bilbao and Sevilla, as well as the route to Faro in Portugal ceased during spring 2016.During the Summer months the dual-runway airport handles as many movements as London\u2013Gatwick. On the busiest day of the week it handles as many as 1,100 movements, almost as many as London\u2013Heathrow, the busiest airport in Europe. According to the operational data provided by AENA, the airport can handle 66 movements per hour, or almost 1,600 movements over a 24-hour operational period.\n\n\n== Terminals ==\n\nPalma de Mallorca Airport occupies an area of 6.3 km2 (2.4 sq mi). Due to rapid growth of passenger numbers, additional infrastructure was added to the two terminals A (1965) and B (1972). This main terminal was designed by local architect Pere Nicolau Bover and was officially opened on 12 April 1997. The airport now consists of four modules: Module A (the former Terminal A Building), Module B (the former Terminal B Building), Module C and Module D (the last two were completely new sets of buildings and gates that opened along with the new central terminal and check in area in 1997). The airport can handle 25 million passengers per year, with a capacity to dispatch 12,000 passengers per hour.\n\n\n=== Module A ===\nThe former Terminal A Building is located in the north of the airport. It has 28 gates of which 8 have airbridges. This is the only Module that has double airbridges attached to gates. The Pier is mainly used by flights to non-Schengen destinations including the UK and Ireland. This part of the terminal building used to be closed during winter months and is only used in the summer. For winter 2018/2019 it will remain open.\n\n\n=== Module B ===\nThe former Terminal B Building is the smallest module, located in the north east. It has 8 gates located on the ground floor, of which none have airbridges. It is used by regional aircraft of Air Nostrum, mainly operating flights to Ibiza Airport, Menorca Airport, Valencia Airport, Lleida Airport, Asturias Airport and Santiago de Compostela Airport.\n\n\n=== Module C ===\nThe largest of the Modules located in the east. It has 33 gates of which 9 have airbridges. It is used by Condor along with EasyJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle flights to Schengen destinations. The majority of airbridges have airberlin.com written on them. The southern area of the Module was worked on and reopened in May 2010. The refurbishment and expansion is so that the Module can handle more flights, and to improve ways to get into the pier as it is the longest walk from security control. There will also be a further 8 gates with airbridges, but there will still be 33 in total.\n\n\n=== Module D ===\nLocated in the south. It has 19 gates of which 10 have airbridges. All odd numbered gates are gates with a bus transfer. During the closure of the southern area of Module C, it was used mainly for flights to Europe.\n\n\n== Other facilities ==\nPreviously Spanair (1986 - 2012) had its head office in the Spanair Building on the airport property. Both Futura International Airways and Iberworld had large operational offices on the premises of the airport but these are no longer in use.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Palma de Mallorca Airport:\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n=== Passenger statistics ===\n\n\n=== Route statistics ===\n\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nOn 4 January 1991, Douglas DC-3 EC-EQH of Aeromarket Express overran the runway on a cargo flight to Menorca Airport and was damaged beyond repair.\nOn 8 March 1993, Douglas C-47A EC-FAH of Aeromarket Express crashed on take-off while on a cargo flight to Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport. Both crew were killed.\nOn 12 April 2002 Tadair Flight 306 operated by a Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner EC-GKR a cargo flight from Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport to Palma de Mallorca. Flight 306 crashed on landing on runway 24L, killing both pilots.\n\n\n== See also ==\nENAIRE\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Palma de Mallorca Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nAENA (airport operator) official website\nCurrent weather for LEPA at NOAA/NWS\nPalma de Mallorca Airport Guide in English & German",

        "wiki": "Calvi\u00e0 (locally [k\u0259lvi\u02c8a]) is a municipality on the island of Majorca, part of the Spanish autonomous community of the Balearic Islands.  It is located in the southwestern part of the island of Majorca, between the Serra de Tramuntana and the Serra de Na Burguesa. The municipal seat is the town of Vila Calvia.Calvi\u00e0 has an approximate area of 145 km2 (56 sq mi). It is bordered on the north by the municipalities of Puigpunyent and Estellencs, Palma de Mallorca (Palma), the island's capital to the east, Andratx to the west and to the south by the Mediterranean Sea.\nAccording to the 2008 census, the municipality had a population of 50,777 inhabitants, of whom 18,046 were foreigners. Today, it is the second most populated area of the entire archipelago Balearic after Palma, and also an area that has the largest number of tourists in the islands.  Its population is scattered around the different urban centers created as a result of tourism development and twentieth century urbanization.\nThe historical epic that marked the most important local culture and traditions regarding the rest of Mallorca is the landing in Santa Ponsa on 10 September 1229 of King James I of Aragon, and the subsequent conquering of Muslims who had arrived in the year 903. Since 1248, Calvi\u00e0 has had its own parochial church, Sante Ihoannes Caviano.  Despite the popularity and use of the official shield locally, the municipality has no flag.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe origin of the place name is subject to conjecture but is believed to be from the patronymic Latin calvianum, derived from the personal name of Calvius. According to the philologist Antoni Maria Alcover, it comes from the word Caluus, meaning \"burn\" or \"be hot\", testament to the arid land that contains no vegetation.  The official name is Calvi\u00e0 (with a grave accent), but in Castilian, Calvi\u00e1 (with an acute accent) is used.Officially, the adjective to refer to inhabitants of Calvi\u00e0 is calvienses or calvieros. However, more widespread use in both Catalan and in its Castilian translation is calvianero/a. This is used by agencies such as the Institut Calvianer d'Esports del Ajuntament de Calvi\u00e0 and the Asociaci\u00f3n Calvianera.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\nThe municipality does not have a flag but has a distinctive coat of arms, defined as an azure blue shield with a paschal lamb holding a flag with a St George's Cross, capped by a crown. The coat of arms was approved on 25 June 1976 emblazoned with De azur y el cordero de plata que empu\u00f1a en su mano derecha una bandera de aquel metal, cargada con cruz de gules. Al timbre corona real, cerrada..\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nCalvi\u00e0 first appears in history as a village 2,000 years BCE, although the area was first populated in the Neolithic Era.  Later, sailors coming from the east stopped in the Balearics on their way to the Iberian Peninsula, where they sought metals. They came from Italy, from other Mediterranean islands, and from the Near East, and constructed small settlements along the coast. Historians call this period the \"Cave Culture\", because caves were frequently used as habitations and burial areas. Some vestiges of this area have been catalogued in an archaeological excavation called the Puig de sa Morisca Archaeological Park, which conserves remains of what was a talaiot 9 metres (30 ft) in diameter. It is located on a small mountainous elevation in Calvi\u00e0's Santa Ponsa district.\nThe Roman era lasted from 123 BCE until the 4th century CE, but left no significant vestiges. Among the few archaeological remnants of this era are the remains of a Roman villa in Santa Ponsa known as Sa Mesquida, which has an oven that was used to make ceramics, the horse-shoe shaped Naveta Alemany and the Tur\u00f3 de Ses Abelles.\nIn 425, the area was invaded by the Vandals, who ended up settling. Lack of remains or written record means little is known about this area other than the decline that began with the destruction of Pollen\u00e7a. The Byzantine general Flavius Belisarius ordered the conquest of the archipelago in 534, bringing an end to this era.\nThe first Muslim arrivals were in 707. They quickly ended the Byzantine domination and established their own hegemony. Until 903, the island was part of the Umayyad Caliphate.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 903, the Almoravid general Isam al-Jawlani conquered the island on behalf of Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi, Emir of C\u00f3rdoba. The city of Palma passed from the Almoravids to the Almohads, eventually becoming part of one of the taifas. Calvi\u00e1 was part of the administrative division Juz' d' Ahwaz al-Madina.\nIn 1229, after the Conquest of Mallorca by King James I of Aragon, colonists brought the Catalan language and culture, which survive to the present time. In the division of the conquered territory, Calvi\u00e0 formed part of the medietas magnatum that the king granted to nobles Guillermo II de Montcada, Hugo de Ampurias, Nu\u00f1o S\u00e1nchez and Berenguer de Palou, all of whom had participated in the conquest. Calvi\u00e0 in particular was granted to Berenguer de Palou, Bishop of Barcelona, becoming part of the Barony of the Bishops of Barcelona. There were many tensions among the conquering nobles who were granted various feudal rights; these were resolved through a pariatge or condominium under which feudal rights were shared. Therefore, the surroundings of the municipality are also known as the comarca of the Pariatge. Ultimately, though, the rights accrued to the Bishopric, which held them until 1834 when the Spanish Church lost many of its feudal properties.\n\nThe conquerors came, in various proportions from a variety of places. Thus, and according to the Llibre del Repartiment (\"Book of Distribution\"), the conquered lands were distributed among people from Catalonia (39.71%), Occitania (24.26%), Italy (16.19%), Aragon (7.35%), Navarra (5.88%), France (4.42%), Castile (1.47%) and Flanders (0.73%). Owing to the extermination or expulsion of the greater part of the prior local populace, there were not enough laborers to cultivate the land. In 1230 a set of privileges called the Franquezas de Mallorca were granted in order to attract new settlers to cultivate the countryside. Most of these new settlers of Mallorca came from Catalonia, more specifically the northeast and, within the east, from Ampurd\u00e1n. As a result, the dialect spoken today (Mallorqu\u00ed) is an eastern Catalan dialect.\nSince 1248, Calvi\u00e0 has had its own parish church, Sante Ihoannes Caviano, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. In 1285, during the reign of James II of Aragon, second son of James I, it gained the status of a villa. This meant it would have its own mayor, named by the king or governor. The mayor would execute orders from higher levels of government and would also maintain public order and administer justice. Nonetheless, he did not have the power to administer the villa, which fell within the purview of the jurados de prohombre, (a medieval office that was essentially a district overseer).\n\nIn the Middle Ages, various watchtowers were built to defend against Mediterranean piracy.To sustain the parish and its clerics, the king and the tenured landowners of the jurisdiction ceded one fourth of the diezmos paid to them by those who cultivated the land. This was, in turn, divided into four parts, three of which were granted to the rector of the parish and the fourth to the parish priest or vicar.James II of Majorca reigned over the islands for more than two decades and made great efforts to guarantee the viability of his kingdom. He undertook a broad policy of agrarian colonization, with the creation of rural nuclei; increased the royal revenue; favored the creation of consulates in North Africa and in the kingdom of Granada; created a new monetary system for the kingdom; promoted the creation of textile industries; increased royal power relative to that of the nobility and Church; and promoted the construction of palaces and castles such as the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, the La Seu Cathedral in Palma, and the Bellver Castle. The opening of the trials of the Knights Templar and the later suppression of the order allowed the Crown to take over their revenues in the islands.\nThe health system consisted mainly of physicians of Jewish origins, so-called Xuetas, descendants of Mallorcan Jews who had converted to Christianity, but continued to form a largely endogamous community. The nearest hospital to Calvi\u00e0 was in Sant Elm, founded in 1303 by Jaime II. Fundamentally it was dedicated to merchants and sailors of the ships that were heading from Palma to Barcelona. They also used it  as a refuge in bad weather.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nFrom the 13th century to the mid-20th century, the region was almost entirely agricultural. The first area to be cultivated was along the banks of the Bay of Santa Ponsa; at the time, the area was referred to as the t\u00e9rmino de Santa Ponsa; the expression t\u00e9rmino de Calvi\u00e1 came far later. Despite the long coast, people turned their backs to the sea, deriving their living from the dry and none-too-fertile land.\nAgriculture was based on latifundia\u2014large estates\u2014from the 14th century into the 20th. Most of the land was owned by a small number of nobles. In 1863, continuing a longstanding pattern 66.3% of the land was owned by four proprietors. At a slightly earlier date, Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana owned 2,516 hectares (6,220 acres), including all of Bendinat, Paguera, as well as an additional 990 hectares (2,400 acres) in the municipality of Andraitx. The Marquis of Bellpuig owned 4,376 hectares (10,810 acres) in Santa Ponsa, the largest latifundium in Mallorca at the beginning of the 19th century. On the other hand, there was a small group of peasants known as els roters, to whom the nobility had ceded land near the sea. These roters cultivated cereals, and lived in miserable conditions.\nIn the 16th century, Calvi\u00e0 itself largely escaped the plague that decimated the population elsewhere, although other nearby municipalities such as Andraitx suffered the scourge of the epidemic. Still, the population suffered other epidemics associated with the era and their way of life, particularly malaria which only a few escaped, such as the priest or the few artisans who did not work in Ses Rotes. The daily wage of a farm laborer was between four and six sous (a dozen eggs cost one-and-a-half sous). In that era there were also Arab slaves, although not in the maritime zones, where they were seen as liable to escape or to collaborate with pirates. In the 18th century a severe drought and bad cereal harvest led to a long period of famine. On 28 November 1715, Philip V of Spain abolished the fueros and privileges of the Balearics, as the Nueva Planta decrees extended the administrative organization of the Kingdom of Castile, prohibited the Catalan language, and required the use of Castilian Spanish in the islands. In 1748 the wretchedness of the municipality had become so severe that chronicler Pere Xamena Fiol described it as follows:\n\nWheat became so expensive that one paid 25 Sous per barchilla (unit to measure cereals, approximately 13.75 litres or 14.53 US quarts), and fortunate was he who could find some. Hunger reached the point where each house got no more than two doblers of bread, even if the family was large, and they gave permission to eat meat during Lent, and many people who didn't have the money to buy meat ate herbs, and they told me that some people had gone more than a fortnight eating only boiled herbs, and the poor people and workers were so thin that they couldn't work for lack of food.\nThe economic system rooted in latifundia underlay the Caciquism that made moot the theoretically democratic Spanish constitutions the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century. In Restoration Spain the power of the dominant classes remained intact. Both major political parties of the time, the Conservative Party led by Canovas del Castillo and the Liberal Party led by Sagasta relied on a system where day laborers and smallholders beholden to the caciques and voted accordingly, producing an orderly alternation of the two parties in power, the turno pac\u00edfico. In the late 19th century, hunger and poverty sparked emigration to the Americas, especially to Cuba and Argentina, as well as to France and Algeria.Calvi\u00e1 at that time lacked industrial establishments, except for the manufacturing of cement and plaster. The latifundia system was largely an impoverished agrarian autarky. In 1923 the Federaci\u00f3 Obrera Calvianera (\"Federation of Calvian Workers\") was founded as a member of the socialist Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores, followed by the Uni\u00f3 Agr\u00e0ria de Calvi\u00e0 (Calvian Agrarian Union) and La Fraternal. On 30 September 1923, Spain's socialist party, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, inaugurated a Casa del pueblo (a cultural and service center), which represented an investment of half a million Spanish pesetas. The labor movement and socialism played an important part in politics during the Second Spanish Republic, but were squashed during the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\n=== Contemporary era ===\n\nThe first seed of the modern tourism-based economy came when steamboat service from Barcelona to Palma began in 1838. This made travel to Mallorca easier for travelers from the Iberian peninsula and beyond. Some came to visit the municipality's coves and beaches. At this time Mallorca drew visitors who were motivated by the desire for adventure, an interest in exploring a different world and society than the one they knew, but also those who came to the island for therapeutic reasons. Among this last group was the composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. Works published by travelers, learned people, artists and geographers increasingly promoted Mallorca as a preferred destination.\nIn 1962, Calvi\u00e0 had four butcher shops, three bakeries, a dairy, ten grocery shops, three caf\u00e9s, two haberdashers, five carpenter's shops, two blacksmiths, a bicycle shop, and one bus line. Its scant industry consisted of five master masons, various ventures in shipping and transport, two cement and plaster factories, a trader in nuts and dried fruit, a machine for shucking almonds, a flour mill, a carob crusher, a wood dealer, and an oil press.\nThe first urban nuclei in the municipality began development in 1920, built on failed agricultural land sold well below its potential value. By 1960, changes in ownership had been so fundamental as to facilitate immediate development. Three quarters of the coast was rapidly developed, including all of the most desirable areas. Through their real estate affiliates, some of the last large landowners, such as Miguel Nigorra Oliver, president of the Banco de Cr\u00e9dito Balear, came to control nearly all of the development of Santa Ponsa. By 1986, the municipality had 10,000 of the dwellings locally known as chal\u00e9s (\"chalets\").On 30 July 2009, around two in the afternoon, the Palmanova neighborhood suffered a bombing attack by ETA. Two members of the Civil Guard were killed by a bomb placed under a patrol car outside their barracks; a second similar bomb was discovered and successfully defused.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nCalvi\u00e0 is located in the western part of the island of Majorca, next to the Sierra de Tramontana, the main mountain of the Balearic Islands, and extends to the Sierra de Na Burguesa, a mountain located in Calvia. Calvia has an area of about 145.02 km 2. Of a total of 14,372 hectares, 81% is protected rural land, 18% is developed urban land and 1% are soils with low protection.  It is bordered on the north by the municipality of Puigpunyent and Estellencs, Palma de Mallorca (Palma), the island's capital to the east, Andratx to the west and to the south by the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe highest point of the municipality is the Puig de Galatz\u00f3 at 1,026 m (3,366 ft) above sea level. The second is 926 metres above sea level, the Mola del Esclop, an area which consists of many valleys and ravines, between the hills of Puig Batiat and Penya Blanca.The peninsula on which the municipality is located is marked by the presence of wetlands to the east and west, at Magalluf, Palma Nova and Santa Ponsa, that lead to a narrowing similar to an isthmus to the north.The urban area has expanded around its coastline, converting into several villages on the main beaches. The coast extends from Cape Andritxol, until the area of Cas Catal\u00e0 Ses Illetas. It is 54 km (34 mi) long and very rocky, but still has 34 beaches and coves. There is 35.5 kilometres of rocky shores, 4.5 kilometres of sandy beaches, 10 islets and 7,000 hectares of coast, with a maximum depth of 5 m (16 ft). Islets include El Sec, Sa Porrassa, D'en Sales, Ses Illetes, D'estenedor and Sa Caleta. The most important though, ecologically, are the Malgrats and El Toro, having been designated as marine reserves and a special protection area for birds.\n\n\n=== Localities ===\nThe municipality contains eighteen settlements. The most important are the resorts. Palma Nova was one of the first tourist resorts to be built on the island within the grounds of an old farm called Ses Planes and began as a project intended to build a residential type Garden City, but due to the Spanish Civil War, this idea was discarded. In 2009, it was considered one of the most important tourist areas of Majorca. It is bounded on the west by the busy town of Magaluf which contains the largest hotel and greatest infrastructural services of the municipality to accommodate the many tourists.  Another of the localities, Santa Ponsa, has historical significance as the place that James I of Aragon landed. The town of Portals Nous is also a renowned meeting point for businessmen, celebrities, high society figures and members of the Spanish Royal Family during their summer stays in the Marivent Palace. Another of its main tourist areas is Paguera, where many residents spend their summer holidays, as well as a number of German tourists. Similarly, the urbanized residential areas of El Toro, which has a marina and a small beach, and Son Ferrer, are of note.\n\n\n=== Geology and relief ===\n\nThe topography is marked by the contrast between the mountains in the north and the rest of the municipality, where the features are flatter.\nThe main mountain range is called the Serra de Na Burguesa, situated between Son Falconer and Son Vida in Palma. It is the southernmost range of the Serra de Tramuntana. It was formerly known as Portop\u00ed or d'en Bou. It has an average height of 500 meters and is covered by large formations of Mediterranean pine forest and scrubland. The hills are composed of Triassic and Jurassic materials, mainly limestone and dolomite, with marl and gypsum present as well. The hills have a complex tectonic structure, forming a relief fold with many faults. The karst nature of the Tramuntana has led to the formation of numerous caves and sinkholes.The rest of the municipality is relatively flat, with broad valleys filled by quaternary and tertiary materials and small hills, with Mesozoic materials surfacing occasionally. This area contains a number of cavities divided between the area of Es Coll des Pastors and around the Puig Gros de Bendinat, Son Boronat, Benatiga Nou and Valldurgent. The Puig Gros de Bendinat depression contains abundant late Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments.  Its coastline is composed of calcareous materials.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCalvi\u00e0 has a mild Mediterranean climate with an average annual temperature of 19 \u00b0C and an average annual rainfall of 410 mm (16 in). It is influenced by two types of atmospheric circulation manifested in two distinct seasons: a hot, dry summer with little pressure gradient and occasional rainfall, as opposed to a cool, wet winter. The coldest month is January, with 15.1 / 3.5 \u00b0C and the hottest is August, with 31.0 / 18.2 \u00b0C. Rainfall averages 51 days a year and there are approximately 2,756 hours of sunshine. The average temperature in the summer is 27 \u00b0C, and 14 \u00b0C in winter. The driest month is July, at an average of 7.8 l / m2, while the wettest is December with an average of 81.1 l / m2.  The area is sheltered from the Nordic Tramuntana wind by mountains that are over a thousand feet high.\nThe thermal variation of the water has a range of around 15 \u00b0C. During the winter, it drops down to about 13 \u00b0C. In the late spring, warming occurs, raising the temperature one degree each week. During the summer, a 25 cm deep water layer reaches temperatures above 25 \u00b0C.(something of a thermocline).\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\nAccording to the Instituto Geol\u00f3gico y Minero de Espa\u00f1a (IGME), the area receives 4,900,000 cubic metres (6,400,000 cu yd) of rain per year, plus 100,000 cubic metres (130,000 cu yd) runoff from irrigation and 200,000 cubic metres (260,000 cu yd) infiltration of treated waste-water. 6,700,000 cubic metres (8,800,000 cu yd) is pumped annually for the water supply, but the current Balearic Hydrological Plan intends to reduce this to 4,100,000 cubic metres (5,400,000 cu yd).\n\n\n==== Ravines ====\nBecause of the torrential rains in October and November, Mallorca has many ravines, narrow channels that bring the rainwater to the sea. Among these are the Torrente (ravine) des Gorg, which rises in Es Capdell\u00e0 and enters the sea at Peguera. The Torrente Vial, rises on the outskirts of the village of Vial and runs to the Cala (cove) de Santa Ponsa; it receives the water of hundreds of smaller ravines, among which are the Barranco des Cobaix and the Barranco des Pas de la Mula. Among the longest is the Torrente de Galatz\u00f3, running 23 kilometres (14 mi) and draining a basin of 72 square kilometres (28 sq mi). It begins on the west slope of the Puig de Galatz\u00f3 and reaches the sea at the Bay of Santa Ponsa (Santa Pon\u00e7a).\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n\nMore than 49% of Calvi\u00e0's 14,552 hectares (35,960 acres) consists of woods and garrigues (low, soft-leaved scrubland), with pines as the dominant trees, although there has been some deforestation in recent decades. Cultivable land amounts to about 32% of the municipality; the main crops are almonds, carob (Ceratonia siliqua), olives and, to a lesser extent, figs. There is also still some farming of cereals and grains.\nAlthough the area has a harsh climate with few natural resources it is also densely populated by humans and there are relatively few populations of wild animals. The most notable zones for fauna are the rocky shore and the islands of Cala Figuera (Figuera Cove), such as El Toro, the islet of Refeubetx and the group of islets known as the Malgrats. This area has international recognition by the European Commission as a Special Protection Area for birds. In 2008, a diver in this reserve sighted and photographed a monk seal (Monachus monachus); it is believed that no more than 500 monk seals survive in the entire world. The Balearic government has studied the possibility of reintroducing monk seals to the islands.Local native plant species include holm oak (Quercus ilex) and various pine species. There are over 1,000 animal species; notable among them are the seabirds Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), various cormorants (Phalacrocorax), the common swift (Apus apus), and the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) as well as numerous reptiles, such as the endemic Lilford's wall lizard (Podarcis lilfordi) found on several of the islets of the archipelago. The islets are also home to one of Spain's few colonies of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni; other colonies are in Murcia and Almer\u00eda).Although the vegetation on the cliffs is sparse, it merits special interest as a habitat for endemic plant species such as the perennial herb Hippocrepis balearica, and Dianthus alpinus, whose Spanish-language names variously designate it as the \"cliff carnation\", \"forest carnation\" or \"Mediterranean carnation\". The cliff also provides a habitat for birds, especially raptors such as Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae) and osprey (Pandion haliaetus) as well as the world's only remaining insular cinereous vultures (black vulture, Aegypius monachus). Also worthy of mention, if only for gastronomical reasons, are two species of snail, Cornu aspersum and Helix pomatia.\nAmong the fungi, the autumn rains bring out the reproductive structures of the mushrooms. Of particular note is  Lactarius sangifluus, known locally as esclata-sang. This Lactarius is much appreciated for its singular flavor, and figures prominently in the local cuisine.The forest plants of the region can be divided into four groups:\n\nHerbaceous plants: the most common of these are nettles, fiddle dock (Rumex pulcher), and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare); heather(Calluna vulgaris) can also be found. Five endemic species of Limonium have evolved in the salty soils of Magalluf. In the garrigue of Santa Ponsa are several varieties of orchid (Orchis collina).\nShrubs: the most common shrub is the Mediterranean buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus), but there are also rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis),  thyme, a species of rock rose (Cistus albidus) several species of asparagus (Asparagus acutifolius, Asparagus albus, Asparagus officinalis), and common ivy (Hedera helix). Protected species include Mediterranean fan palm (Chamaerops humilis), myrtles, and Phoenicean juniper (Juniperus phoenicea).\nFerns: ferns of the Polypodium genus can be found in cooler or more shaded areas.\nTrees: the most common tree in the region's forests is Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis). These are plagued by a moth known as the pine processionary (Thaumetopoea pityocampa). A special brigade targets this moth, setting traps and destroying their nests. In the northern part of the province, although in lesser measure, there is holm oak (Quercus ilex), white poplar (Populus alba), narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), and strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMost of the people are either Spaniards from the mainland\u2014mainly from Andalusia\u2014or their descendants, who reached the island in the early 1960s, or they are foreign immigrants. According to the 2008 census, the municipality has a population of 50,777 inhabitants, of whom 25,548 were males and 25,229 were women ( 50.31% versus 49.69%).  The municipality has the second highest population in the Balearic Islands, second only to the capital, Palma de Mallorca.In 2017 the population was 49,063, including 14,822 foreigners (non-Spanish) registered with the town hall. The total population reached above 50,000 in 2008 but in 2015 began decreasing; in 2016 it had 49,580 people, including 15,623 registered foreigners.\n\n\n=== Population pyramid ===\nAnalysis of the population pyramid shows that:\n\n21% of the population is under the age of 20.\n32% of the population is aged 20\u201339 years.\n32% of the population is aged 40\u201359 years.\n15% of the population is 60 or older.This structure is typical of the modern demographic regime seen in much of Western Europe, with a population slowly aging as the birth rate diminishes.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe area contains many of Majorca's major tourism hotspots, with the localities of Magaluf (3,865), Santa Ponsa (8,188), El Toro (2,002), Paguera (3,400), Illetas (3,286), Portals Nous (2,395) and Palma Nova (5,975). It embraces six tourist zones with 60 kilometres of coastline, 27 beaches, 4 sport ports and 120.000 tourist units. The proximity of Palma with major road connections means that it can take as little as 15 minutes to reach the city centre. With massive tourism, estimated at 1.6 million visits per year and with a resident population that itself includes many expatriates, it is impossible to evaluate municipal income or expenditure as it relates only to the residents. What one can say is that Calvi\u00e0 appears to be one of the wealthiest municipalities in Europe, based on per capita public investment. In the early 1960s, Calvi\u00e0 began building a complete infrastructure for massive tourism, such as rapid construction of hotels. Later, more touristic features were added which included four professional golf courses (Club de Golf Poniente, Golf Sta Pon\u00e7a I, Golf Sta Pon\u00e7a II, Golf Sta Pon\u00e7a III and Golf Bendinat), water parks, a modern promenade called Paseig Calvi\u00e0. The 2004 World Chess Olympiad was held in Calvi\u00e0.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBisson, T. N. (1988). Hist\u00f2ria de la Corona d'Arag\u00f3 a l'Edat Mitjana (in Catalan).

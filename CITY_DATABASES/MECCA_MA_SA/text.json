'House of God') and is the qibla (Arabic: \u0642\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0629\u200e, direction of prayer) for Muslims around the world when performing salah.\nThe Kaaba is believed by Muslims to have been rebuilt several times throughout history, most famously by Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Ismail (Ishmael), when he returned to the valley of Mecca several years after leaving his wife Hajar (Hagar) and Ismail there upon Allah's command. Circling the Kaaba seven times counterclockwise, known as Tawaf (Arabic: \u0637\u0648\u0627\u0641\u200e, romanized: tawaaf), is an obligatory rite for the completion of the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. The area around the Kaaba on which pilgrims circumambulate is called the Mataaf. \nThe Kaaba and the Mataaf are surrounded by pilgrims every day of the Islamic year, except the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah, known as the Day of Arafah, on which the cloth covering the structure, known as the Kiswah (Arabic: \u0643\u0633\u0648\u0629\u200e, romanized: Kiswah, lit. 'Cloth') is changed. However, the most significant increase in their numbers is during Ramadan and the hajj, when millions of pilgrims gather for tawaf. According to the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, 6,791,100 pilgrims arrived for the Umrah pilgrimage in the Islamic year 1439 AH, a 3.6% increase from the previous year, with 2,489,406 others arriving for the 1440 AH Hajj.\n\n\n== Lexicology ==\nThe literal meaning of the word Ka'bah (Arabic: \u0643\u0639\u0628\u0629\u200e) is cube.In the Qur'an, the Ka'bah is also mentioned by the following names:\n\nal-Bayt (Arabic: \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u200e, lit.

Once every lunar year, the Bedouin tribes would make a pilgrimage to Mecca. Setting aside any tribal feuds, they would worship their gods in the Kaaba and trade with each other in the city. Various sculptures and paintings were held inside the Kaaba. A statue of Hubal, the principal idol of Mecca, among other pagan deities, are known to be placed in or around the Kaaba. There were paintings of idols decorating the walls. A picture of 'Isa and his mother Maryam was situated inside the Kaaba and later found by Muhammad after his conquest of Mecca. The iconography portrayed a seated Maryam with her child on her lap. The iconography in the Kaaba also included paintings of other prophets and angels.  Undefined decorations, money and a pair of ram's horns were recorded to be inside the Kaaba,. The pair of ram's horns were said to have belonged to the ram sacrificed by Ibrahim in place of his son Ishmael as held by Islamic tradition.\nal-Azraqi provides the following narrative on the authority of his grandfather:I have heard that there was set up in al-Bayt (referring to the Kaaba) a picture (Arabic: \u062a\u0645\u062b\u0627\u0644\u200e, romanized: Timthal, lit. 'Depiction') of Maryam and 'Isa. ['Ata'] said: \"Yes, there was set in it a picture of Maryam adorned (muzawwaqan); in her lap, her son Isa sat adorned.\"\n-al-Azraqi, Akhbar Mecca: History of MeccaIn her book Islam: A Short History, Karen Armstrong asserts that the Kaaba was officially dedicated to Hubal, a Nabatean deity, and contained 360 idols which probably represented the days of the year. However, by the time of Muhammad's era, it seems that the Kaaba was venerated as the shrine of Allah, the High God. Once a year, tribes from all around the Arabian Peninsula, whether Christian or pagan, would converge on Mecca to perform the Hajj pilgrimage, marking the widespread conviction that Allah was the same deity worshipped by monotheists. Alfred Guillaume, in his translation of the Ibn Ishaq's seerah, says that the Kaaba itself might be referred to in the feminine form. Circumambulation was often performed naked by men and almost naked by women. It is disputed whether Allah and Hubal were the same deity or different. Per a hypothesis by Uri Rubin and Christian Robin, Hubal was only venerated by Quraysh and the Kaaba was first dedicated to Allah, a supreme god of individuals belonging to different tribes, while the pantheon of the gods of Quraysh was installed in Kaaba after they conquered Mecca a century before Muhammad's time.Imoti contends that there were numerous such Kaaba sanctuaries in Arabia at one time, but this was the only one built of stone. The others also allegedly had counterparts of the Black Stone. There was a \"Red Stone\", in the Kaaba of the South Arabian city of Ghaiman; and the \"White Stone\" in the Kaaba of al-Abalat (near modern-day Tabala.). Grunebaum in Classical Islam points out that the experience of divinity of that period was often associated with the fetishism of stones, mountains, special rock formations, or \"trees of strange growth.\" Armstrong further says that the Kaaba was thought to be at the center of the world, with the Gate of Heaven directly above it. The Kaaba marked the location where the sacred world intersected with the profane; the embedded Black Stone was a further symbol of this as a meteorite that had fallen from the sky and linked heaven and earth.According to Sarwar, about 400 years before the birth of Muhammad, a man named 'Amr bin Luhayy, who descended from Qahtan and was the king of Hijaz placed an idol of Hubal on the roof of the Kaaba. This idol was one of the chief deities of the ruling Quraysh tribe. The idol was made of red agate and shaped like a human, but with the right hand broken off and replaced with a golden hand. When the idol was moved inside the Kaaba, it had seven arrows in front of it, which were used for divination. To maintain peace among the perpetually warring tribes, Mecca was declared a sanctuary where no violence was allowed within 30 kilometres (20 mi) of the Kaaba. This combat-free zone allowed Mecca to thrive not only as a place of pilgrimage, but also as a trading center.Many Muslim and academic historians stress the power and importance of the pre-Islamic Mecca. They depict it as a city grown rich on the proceeds of the spice trade. Crone believes that this is an exaggeration and that Mecca may only have been an outpost for trading with nomads for leather, cloth, and camel butter. Crone argues that if Mecca had been a well-known center of trade, it would have been mentioned by later authors such as Procopius, Nonnosus, or the Syrian church chroniclers writing in Syriac. The town is absent, however, from any known geographies or histories written in the three centuries before the rise of Islam. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, \"before the rise of Islam, it was revered as a sacred sanctuary and was a site of pilgrimage.\" According to historian Eduard Glaser, the name \"Kaaba\" may have been related to the southern Arabian or Ethiopian word \"mikrab\", signifying a temple. Again, Crone disputes this etymology.\nIn Samaritan literature, the Samaritan Book of the Secrets of Moses (Asatir) claims that Ishmael and his eldest son Nebaioth built the Kaaba as well as the city of Mecca.\" The Asatir book was suggested by some opinion to have been compiled in the 10th century BCE, while another opinion in 1927 suggested that it was written no later than the second half of the 3rd century BCE.\n\n\n==== According to Islamic opinion ====\nThe Qur'an contains several verses regarding the origin of the Kaaba. It states that the Kaaba was the first House of Worship for mankind, and that it was built by Ibrahim and Ismail on Allah's instructions.\nVerily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for mankind.\nBehold! We gave the site, to Ibrahim, of the (Sacred) House, (saying): \"Associate not anything (in worship) with Me; and sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or stand up, or bow, or prostrate themselves (therein in prayer).\nAnd remember Ibrahim and Ismail raised the foundations of the House (With this prayer): \"Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us: For Thou art the All-Hearing, the All-knowing.\"\nIbn Kathir, in his famous exegesis (tafsir) of the Quran, mentions two interpretations among the Muslims on the origin of the Kaaba. One is that the shrine was a place of worship for angels (mala'ikah) before the creation of man. Later, a house of worship was built on the location and was lost during the flood in Noah's time and was finally rebuilt by Abraham and Ishmael as mentioned later in the Quran. Ibn Kathir regarded this tradition as weak and preferred instead the narration by Ali ibn Abi Talib that although several other temples might have preceded the Kaaba, it was the first Bayt Allah (\"House of God\"), dedicated solely to Him, built by His instruction, and sanctified and blessed by Him, as stated in Quran 22:26\u201329. A hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari states that the Kaaba was the first masjid on Earth, and the second was the Temple in Jerusalem.While Abraham was building the Kaaba, an angel brought to him the Black Stone which he placed in the eastern corner of the structure. Another stone was the Maqam Ibrahim, the Station of Abraham, where Abraham stood for elevation while building the structure. The Black Stone and the Maqam Ibrahim are believed by Muslims to be the only remnant of the original structure made by Abraham as the remaining structure had to be demolished and rebuilt several times over history for its maintenance. After the construction was complete, God enjoined the descendants of Ishmael to perform an annual pilgrimage: the Hajj and the Korban, sacrifice of cattle. The vicinity of the shrine was also made a sanctuary where bloodshed and war were forbidden.[Quran 22:26\u201333]According to Islamic tradition, over the millennia after Ishmael's death, his progeny and the local tribes who settled around the Zamzam well gradually turned to polytheism and idolatry. Several idols were placed within the Kaaba representing deities of different aspects of nature and different tribes. Several rituals were adopted in the pilgrimage including doing naked circumambulation. A king named Tubba' is considered the first one to have a door be built for the Kaaba according to sayings recorded in Al-Azraqi's Akhbar Makka.\n\n\n==== Ptolemy and Diodorus Siculus ====\nWriting in the Encyclopedia of Islam, Wensinck identifies Mecca with a place called Macoraba mentioned by Ptolemy. G. E. von Grunebaum states: \"Mecca is mentioned by Ptolemy. The name he gives it allows us to identify it as a South Arabian foundation created around a sanctuary. In Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam, Patricia Crone argues that the identification of Macoraba with Mecca is false and that Macoraba was a town in southern Arabia in what was then known as Arabia Felix. A recent study has revisited the arguments for Macoraba and found them unsatisfactory.\nBased on an earlier report by Agatharchides of Cnidus, Diodorus Siculus mentions a temple along the Red Sea coast, \"which is very holy and exceedingly revered by all Arabians\". Edward Gibbon believed that this was the Kaaba. However, Ian D. Morris argues that Gibbon had misread the source: Diodorus puts the temple too far north for it to have been Mecca.\n\n\n=== Muhammad's era ===\n\nDuring Muhammad's lifetime (570\u2013632 CE), the Kaaba was considered a holy site by the local Arabs. Muhammad took part in the reconstruction of the Kaaba after its structure was damaged due to floods around 600 CE. Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Ras\u016bl All\u0101h, one of the biographies of Muhammad (as reconstructed and translated by Guillaume), describes Muhammad settling a quarrel between the Meccan clans as to which clan should set the Black Stone in its place. According to Ishaq's biography, Muhammad's solution was to have all the clan elders raise the cornerstone on a cloak, after which Muhammad set the stone into its final place with his own hands. Ibn Ishaq says that the timber for the reconstruction of the Kaaba came from a Greek ship that had been wrecked on the Red Sea coast at Shu'aybah and that the work was undertaken by a Coptic carpenter called Baqum. Muhammad's Isra' is said to have taken him from the Kaaba to the Masjid al-Aqsa and heavenwards from there.\nMuslims initially considered Jerusalem as their qibla, or prayer direction, and faced toward it while offering prayers; however, pilgrimage to the Kaaba was considered a religious duty though its rites were not yet finalized. During the first half of Muhammad's time as a prophet while he was at Mecca, he and his followers were severely persecuted which eventually led to their migration to Medina in 622 CE. In 624 CE, Muslims believe the direction of the qibla was changed from the Masjid al-Aqsa to the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, with the revelation of Surah 2, verse 144.[Quran 2:144] In 628 CE, Muhammad led a group of Muslims towards Mecca with the intention of performing the Umrah, but was prevented from doing so by the Quraysh. He secured a peace treaty with them, the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, which allowed the Muslims to freely perform pilgrimage at the Kaaba from the following year.At the culmination of his mission, in 630 CE, after the allies of the Quraysh, the Banu Bakr, violated the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, Muhammad conquered Mecca. His first action was to remove statues and images from the Kaaba. According to reports collected by Ibn Ishaq and al-Azraqi, Muhammad spared a painting of Mary and Jesus, and a fresco of Abraham; but according to Ibn Hisham, all pictures were erased.\nNarrated Abdullah: When the Prophet entered Mecca on the day of the conquest, there were 360 idols around the Kaaba. The Prophet started striking them with a stick he had in his hand and was saying, \"Truth has come and Falsehood has vanished...\" (Qur'an 17:81)\"\nal-Azraqi further conveys how Muhammad, after he entered the Kaaba on the day on the conquest, ordered all the pictures erased except that of Maryam\"...Shihab (said) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) entered the Kaaba on the day of the conquest, and in it was a picture of the angels (mala'ika), among others, and he saw a picture of Ibrahim and he said: \"May Allah kill those representing him as a venerable old man casting arrows in divination (shaykhan yastaqsim bil-azlam).\" Then he saw the picture of Maryam, so he put his hands on it and he said: \"Erase what is in it [the Kaaba] in the way of pictures except the picture of Maryam.\"-After the conquest, Muhammad restated the sanctity and holiness of Mecca, including its Masjid al-Haram, in Islam. He performed the Hajj in 632 CE called the Hujjat ul-Wada' (\"Farewell Pilgrimage\") since Muhammad prophesied his impending death on this event.\n\n\n=== After Muhammad ===\n\nThe Kaaba has been repaired and reconstructed many times. The structure was severely damaged by a fire on 3 Rabi' I 64 AH or Sunday, 31 October 683 CE, during the first siege of Mecca in the war between the Umayyads and 'Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr, an early Muslim who ruled Mecca for many years between the death of \u02bfAli and the consolidation of power by the Umayyads. 'Abdullah rebuilt it to include the hat\u012bm. He did so on the basis of a tradition (found in several hadith collections) that the hat\u012bm was a remnant of the foundations of the Abrahamic Kaaba, and that Muhammad himself had wished to rebuild it so as to include it.\nThe Kaaba was bombarded with stones in the second siege of Mecca in 692, in which the Umayyad army was led by al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf. The fall of the city and the death of 'Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr allowed the Umayyads under 'Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan to finally reunite all the Islamic possessions and end the long civil war. In 693 CE, 'Abd al-Malik had the remnants of al-Zubayr's Kaaba razed, and rebuilt it on the foundations set by the Quraysh. The Kaaba returned to the cube shape it had taken during Muhammad's time.\nDuring the Hajj of 930 CE, the Shi'ite Qarmatians attacked Mecca under Abu Tahir al-Jannabi, defiled the Zamzam Well with the bodies of pilgrims and stole the Black Stone, taking it to the oasis in Eastern Arabia known as al-A\u1e25s\u0101\u02be, where it remained until the Abbasids ransomed it in 952 CE. The basic shape and structure of the Kaaba have not changed since then.After heavy rains and flooding in 1626, the walls of the Kaaba collapsed and the Mosque was damaged. The same year, during the reign of Ottoman Emperor Murad IV, the Kaaba was rebuilt with granite stones from Mecca, and the Mosque was renovated. The Kaaba's appearance has not changed since then.\nThe Kaaba is depicted on the reverse of 500 Saudi riyal, and the 2000 Iranian rial banknotes.\n\n\n== Architecture and interior ==\nThe Kaaba is a cuboid-shaped structure made of stones. It is approximately 13.1 m (43 ft 0 in) tall (some claim 12.03 m or 39 ft 5 1\u20442 in), with sides measuring 11.03 m \u00d7 12.86 m (36 ft 2 1\u20442 in \u00d7 42 ft 2 1\u20442 in). Inside the Kaaba, the floor is made of marble and limestone. The interior walls, measuring 13 m \u00d7 9 m (43 ft \u00d7 30 ft), are clad with tiled, white marble halfway to the roof, with darker trimmings along the floor. The floor of the interior stands about 2.2 m (7 ft 3 in) above the ground area where tawaf is performed.\nThe wall directly adjacent to the entrance of the Kaaba has six tablets inlaid with inscriptions, and there are several more tablets along the other walls. Along the top corners of the walls runs a Black cloth embroidered with gold Qur'anic verses. Caretakers anoint the marble cladding with the same scented oil used to anoint the Black Stone outside. Three pillars (some erroneously report two) stand inside the Kaaba, with a small altar or table set between one and the other two. Lamp-like objects (possible lanterns or crucible censers) hang from the ceiling. The ceiling itself is of a darker colour, similar in hue to the lower trimming. The B\u0101b ut-Tawbah\u2014on the right wall (right of the entrance) opens to an enclosed staircase that leads to a hatch, which itself opens to the roof. Both the roof and ceiling (collectively dual-layered) are made of stainless steel-capped teak wood.\n\nEach numbered item in the following list corresponds to features noted in the diagram image.\n\nThe \u1e24ajar al-Aswad (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0648\u062f\u200e, romanized: al-Hajar al-Aswad, lit. 'The Black Stone'), is located on the Kaaba's eastern corner. It is the location where Muslims start their circumambulation of the Kaaba, known as the tawaf.\nThe entrance is a door set 2.13 m (7 ft 0 in) above the ground on the north-eastern wall of the Kaaba, called the Bab ar-Rahmah (Arabic: \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0629\u200e, romanized: Bab ar-Rahmah, lit. 'Door of Mercy'), that also acts as the fa\u00e7ade. In 1979, the 300 kg (660 lb) gold doors made by artist Ahmad bin Ibrahim Badr, replaced the old silver doors made by his father, Ibrahim Badr, in 1942. There is a wooden staircase on wheels, usually stored in the mosque between the arch-shaped gate of Ban\u016b Shaybah and the Zamzam Well. The oldest surviving door dates back to 1045 CE.\nThe M\u012bz\u0101b al-Ra\u1e25mah, commonly shortened to M\u012bz\u0101b or Meezab is a rain spout made of gold. Added when the Kaaba was rebuilt in 1627, after a flood in 1626 caused three of the four walls to collapse.\nThis slant structure, covering three sides of the Kaaba, is known as the Shadherwaan (Arabic: \u0634\u0627\u0630\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646\u200e) and was added in 1627 along with the M\u012bz\u0101b al-Ra\u1e25mah to protect the foundation from rainwater.\nThe Hat\u012bm (also romanized as hateem) and also known as the Hijr Ismail, is a low wall that was part of the original Kaaba. It is a semi-circular wall opposite, but not connected to, the north-west wall of the Kaaba. It is 1.31 m (4 ft 3 1\u20442 in) in height and 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in width, and is composed of white marble. The space between the hat\u012bm and the Kaaba was originally part of the Kaaba, and is thus not entered during the tawaf.\nal-Multazam, the roughly 2 m (6 1\u20442 ft) space along the wall between the Black Stone and the entry door. It is sometimes considered pious or desirable for a pilgrim to touch this area of the Kaaba, or perform dua here.\nThe Station of Ibrahim (Maqam Ibrahim) is a glass and metal enclosure with what is said to be an imprint of Abraham's feet. Ibrahim is said to have stood on this stone during the construction of the upper parts of the Kaaba, raising Ismail on his shoulders for the uppermost parts.\nThe corner of the Black Stone. It faces very slightly southeast from the center of the Kaaba. The four corners of the Kaaba roughly point toward the four cardinal directions of the compass.\nThe Rukn al-Yamani (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0646\u064a\u200e, romanized: ar-Rukn al-Yamani, lit. 'The Yemeni Corner'), also known as Rukn-e-Yamani or Rukn-e-Yemeni, is the corner of the Kaaba facing slightly southwest from the center of the Kaaba.\nThe Rukn ush-Shami (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645\u064a\u200e, romanized: ar-Rukn ash-Shami, lit. 'The Levantine Corner'), also known as Rukn-e-Shami, is the corner of the Kaaba facing very slightly northwest from the center of the Kaaba.\nThe Rukn al-'Iraqi (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642\u064a\u200e, romanized: ar-Rukn al-'Iraqi, lit. 'The Iraqi Corner'), is the corner that faces slightly northeast from the center of the Kaaba.\nKiswah, the embroidered covering. Kiswa is a black silk and gold curtain which is replaced annually during the Hajj pilgrimage. Two-thirds of the way up is a band of gold-embroidered Quranic text, including the Shahada, the Islamic declaration of faith.\nMarble stripe marking the beginning and end of each circumambulation.Note: The major (long) axis of the Kaaba has been observed to align with the rising of the star Canopus toward which its southern wall is directed, while its minor axis (its east-west facades) roughly align with the sunrise of summer solstice and the sunset of winter solstice.\nA panoramic digital reconstruction of the interior can be seen on Google Street View.\nA virtual reality model of the interior and exterior can be seen on Sketchfab Virtual Reality.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Significance in Islam ==\nThe Kaaba is the holiest site in Islam, and is often called by names such as the Bayt Allah (Arabic: \u0628\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u200e, romanized: Bayt Allah, lit. 'House of Allah'). and Bayt Allah al-Haram (Arabic: \u0628\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0645\u200e, romanized: Bayt Allah il-Haram, lit. 'The Sacred House of Allah').\n\n\n=== Tawaf ===\n\nTawaf (Arabic: \u0637\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0641\u200e, lit. 'going about') is one of the Islamic rituals of pilgrimage and is compulsory during both the Hajj and Umrah. Pilgrims go around the Kaaba (the most sacred site in Islam) seven times in a counterclockwise direction; the first three at a hurried pace on the outer part of the Mataaf and the latter four times closer to the Kaaba at a leisurely pace. The circling is believed to demonstrate the unity of the believers in the worship of the One God, as they move in harmony together around the Kaaba, while supplicating to God. To be in a state of Wudu (ablution) is mandatory while performing tawaf as it is considered to be a form of worship ('ibadah).\nTawaf begins from the corner of the Kaaba with the Black Stone. If possible, Muslims are to kiss or touch it, but this is often not possible because of the large crowds. They are also to chant the Basmala and Takbir each time they complete one revolution. Hajj pilgrims are generally advised to \"make \u1e6daw\u0101f\" at least twice \u2013 once as part of the Hajj, and again before leaving Mecca.The five types of \u1e6daw\u0101f are:\n\n\u1e6caw\u0101f al-Qud\u016bm (arrival \u1e6daw\u0101f) is performed by those not residing in Mecca once reaching the Holy City.\n\u1e6caw\u0101f a\u1e6d-\u1e6ca\u1e25\u012byah (greeting \u1e6daw\u0101f) is performed after entering Al-Masjid al-Haram at any other times and is mustahab.\n\u1e6caw\u0101f al-'Umrah (Umrah \u1e6daw\u0101f) refers to the \u1e6daw\u0101f performed specifically for Umrah.\n\u1e6caw\u0101f al-Wad\u0101' (\"farewell \u1e6daw\u0101f\") is performed before leaving Mecca.\n\u1e6caw\u0101f az-Z\u012by\u0101rah (\u1e6daw\u0101f of visiting), \u1e6caw\u0101f al-'If\u0101\u1e0dah (\u1e6daw\u0101f of compensation) or \u1e6caw\u0101f al-\u1e24ajj (Hajj \u1e6daw\u0101f) is performed after completing the Hajj.\n\n\n=== As the Qibla ===\n\nThe Qibla is the direction faced during prayer.[Quran 2:143\u2013144] The direction faced during prayer is the direction of where the Kaaba is, relative to the person praying. Apart from praying, Muslims generally consider facing the Qibla while reciting the Quran to be a part of good etiquette.\n\n\n== Cleaning ==\nThe building is opened biannually for the ceremony of the cleaning of the Kaaba known as \"The Cleaning of the Sacred Kaaba\" (Arabic: \u062a\u0646\u0638\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0631\u0641\u0629\u200e, romanized: Tanzif al-Ka'bat al-Musharrafah, lit. 'Cleaning of the Sacred Cube'). The ceremony takes place on the 1st of Sha'baan, the eighth month of the Islamic calendar, approximately thirty days before the start of the month of Ramadan and on the 15th of Muharram, the first month. The keys to the Kaaba are held by the Ban\u012b Shaybah (Arabic: \u0628\u0646\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0628\u0629\u200e) tribe, an honor bestowed upon them by Muhammad. Members of the tribe greet visitors to the inside of the Kaaba on the occasion of the cleaning ceremony.The Governor of the Makkah Province and accompanying dignitaries clean the interior of the Kaaba using cloths dipped in Zamzam water scented with Oud perfume. Preparations for the washing start a day before the agreed date, with the mixing of Zamzam water with several luxurious perfumes including Tayef rose, 'oud and musk. Zamzam water mixed with rose perfume is splashed on the floor and is wiped with palm leaves. Usually, the entire process is completed in two hours. \n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of largest mosques\nList of mosques in Saudi Arabia\nHoliest sites in Islam\nAl-Aqsa Mosque\nAl-Masjid al-Nabawi\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nArmstrong, Karen (2000,2002).

These towers are a part of the King Abdulaziz Endowment Project that aims to modernize the city in catering to its pilgrims. The central hotel tower, the Makkah Royal Clock Tower, has the world's largest clock face and is the third-tallest building and fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the world. The clock tower contains the Clock Tower Museum that occupies the top four floors of the tower.The building complex is metres away from the world's largest mosque and Islam's most sacred site, the Great Mosque of Mecca. The developer and contractor of the complex is the Saudi Binladin Group, the Kingdom's largest construction company. It is the world's second most expensive building with the total cost of construction totalling US$15 billion. The complex was built after the demolition of the Ajyad Fortress, the 18th-century Ottoman citadel on top of a hill overlooking the Grand Mosque. The destruction of the historically significant site in 2002 by the Saudi government sparked international outcry and a strong response from Turkey.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe tallest tower in the complex is the tallest building in Saudi Arabia, with a height of 601 metres (1,972 feet). Currently it is the fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the world, surpassing the Ping An Finance Centre in Shenzhen, China but shorter than the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE, the Tokyo Skytree in Tokyo, Japan, the Shanghai Tower in Shanghai, China, and the Canton Tower in Guangzhou, China.\nThe site of the complex is located across the piazza to the south from the main entrance (King Abdul-Aziz Gate) to the Masjid al Haram mosque, which houses the Kaaba. To accommodate worshippers visiting the Kaaba, the Abraj Al-Bait Towers has two large prayer rooms (one for men, one for women) capable of holding more than 10,000 people. The tallest tower in the complex also contains a five-star hotel, operated by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, to help provide lodging for the millions of pilgrims that travel to Mecca annually to participate in the Hajj.\n\nIn addition, the Abraj Al-Bait Towers has a five-story shopping mall (the Abraj Al Bait Mall) and a parking garage capable of holding over a thousand vehicles.\nThe building was planned to be 734 m (2,408 ft) tall in 2006. In 2009, it was published that the final height would be 601 m (1,972 ft). The complex was built by the Saudi Binladin Group, Saudi Arabia's largest construction company. The tallest building in the complex (from a height of 450 m (1,480 ft) up until the tip) was designed by the German architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his firm SL Rasch GmbH. The fa\u00e7ade was constructed by Premiere Composite Technologies, the clock by German tower clock manufacturer PERROT GmbH & Co. KG Turmuhren und L\u00e4uteanlagen.\nAccording to the Saudi Ministry of Religious Endowments, the project cost US$15 billion.\n\n\n=== Clock ===\nThe project uses clock faces for each side of the main hotel tower. The highest residential floor stands at 370 m (1,210 ft), just below the media displays under the clock faces. At 43 m \u00d7 43 m (141 ft \u00d7 141 ft), these are the largest in the world. The roof of the clocks is 450 m (1,480 ft) above the ground, making them the world's most elevated architectural clocks. A 151-metre-tall (495 ft) spire has been added on top of the clock giving it a total height of 601 m (1,972 ft). Behind the clock faces there is an astronomy exhibition. In the spire base and the glass-covered floors (The Jewel) there is a scientific center which is used to sight the moon in the beginnings of the Islamic months, and to operate an atomic clock which controls the tower clocks.\n\n\n=== List of component towers ===\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nThe building is topped by a four-faced clock, visible from 25 kilometres (16 miles) away. The clock is the highest in the world at over 400 m (1,300 ft) above the ground. The clock faces are the largest in the world, surpassing the Cevahir Mall clock in Istanbul.\nEach of the clock's four faces measures 43 m (141 ft) in diameter and are illuminated by 2 million LED lights, with four oriented edges, just above the clock alongside huge Arabic script reading: \"God is [the] greatest\" on the north and south faces and on the west and east \"There is no god but Allah. Muhammad is the messenger of God.\". Four golden domes on pillars on all the corners are also present. Another 21,000 white and green coloured lights, the same as the Saudi Flag, fitted at the top of the clock, flash to signal Islam's five-time daily prayers, and are visible as far as 30 km (19 mi) away. On special occasions such as new year, 16 bands of vertical lights shoot 10 km (6.2 mi) up into the sky. The clock's four faces are covered with 98 million pieces of glass mosaics. The Saudi coat of arms is displayed at the centre of each clock behind the dials. The minute hand is 23 m (75 ft) long, while the hour hand is 17 m (56 ft) long.\nA private viewing deck is located 558 m (1,831 ft) above the ground, right under the crescent. There is also a public viewing deck at the base of the clocks at 393 metres' height.\nThere were reports that the clock would be set to local Mecca Time, in an attempt to replace the IERS Reference Meridian as the prime meridian for global time keeping, but the clock is set to Arabia Standard Time (UTC+03:00).\n\n\n=== Spire ===\n\nThe clocks are topped by a 128-metre (420 ft) spire with a 23-metre-high (75 ft) golden crescent at the top. The spire has an eight-story glass-covered base (The Jewel) which belongs to a scientific center having its own small exhibition, another observation deck at 475 m (1,558 ft) and a prayer floor in 480 m (1,570 ft). The highest floor in The Jewel is the Control Tower Floor, which was planned to be used for controlling air traffic in the sky above Mecca (mainly helicopters as airplanes are not allowed near Mecca). However, this was skipped for technical reasons and the future usage is not clear yet. Above from The Jewel the spire has only technical installations for sound, light and other infrastructure and eventually the last viewing deck and the crescent above it. The crescent has two regular floors with living areas and a few service floors and rooms.\nThe crescent was constructed in Dubai by Premier Composite Technologies in April 2011. The crescent is made of fibreglass-backed mosaic gold, and it weighs up to 35 tonnes. Peugeot Joseph, the company official, said a team of five engineers and a hundred workers carried out the project, which cost 90 million United Arab Emirates dirhams and took three months to build.\nThe company has also constructed the Mecca Clock. The crescent was divided into 10 parts to move it to Mecca. The crescent was partly assembled on the base of the clock face to reduce it to 5 parts. Those five parts were then lifted and installed above the spire from 20 June to 6 July 2011.\nThe minaret and its base have loudspeakers which broadcast prayer calls to a distance of 7 km while nearly 21,000 lamps illuminate the surrounding area to a distance of 30 km (19 mi). During occasions like Muslim Eids and new Hijri years, a 16-beam light illuminates an area of a diameter of around 10 km (6 mi) while 21,000 lamps beam white and green lights to a distance of 30 km (19 mi). The light beams are intended to allow the deaf, and Muslims in more distant parts of Mecca and nearby cities, to know prayer timings.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\n\n\n=== Construction fires ===\nThe Abraj-Al-Bait complex had two fire incidents during construction. The first fire accident was at Hajar Tower on 28 October 2008. It took 400 firefighters to put out the fire, which burned for 10 hours, consuming nine floors of the tower. According to eyewitness reports, the blaze erupted shortly after midnight, and spread rapidly because of wood used for construction stored in the premises. Soon, the entire building was engulfed in smoke. Hospitals were put on high alert, but no injuries were reported. A civil defence spokesman said the fire started on the 32nd floor of the Hajar Tower.The second fire struck the Safa Tower on 1 May 2009. No deaths or injuries were reported in the blaze which was quickly contained by Civil Defence. Eyewitnesses said the fire broke out soon after Asr prayer while some workers in the building were welding iron rods on wooden scaffoldings. The fire damaged a large part of the under-construction tower. According to Major General Adel Zamzami, director general of Civil Defence in the Mecca province, the fire broke out at the 14th floor and reached up to the 20th floor.\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\n\nThe construction engendered some controversy as the location chosen for the towers was the historic 18th-century Ottoman Ajyad Fortress, which was demolished to make way for them. The development has been criticised by The Guardian for having \"transformed a type of architecture that evolved from a dense urban grain of low-rise courtyards and narrow streets into ... an endlessly repeatable pattern for the decoration of standardised [concrete] slab(s)\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of buildings with 100 floors or more\nList of tallest buildings in Saudi Arabia\nList of tallest buildings\nList of largest buildings\nList of tallest hotels\nList of largest clock faces\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Abraj Al-Bait Endowment Complex\".

The space between the two mountains in which the pilgrims walk is called al-Mas'aa.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSafa is a small mountain located at the bottom of the Abu Qubais Mountain, about 130 meters (430 ft) southeast of the Ka'bah, which is the beginning of the Sa'ee. As for Marwa, it is also a small mountain of white stone, located 300 meters (980 ft) to the northeast of the Ka'bah and it is connected to Qaiqan Mountain, marking the end of the Sa'ee. Safa, Marwah and the Masa'a (space between the two mountains) were located outside the Masjid al-Haram and were separate until the year 1955/56 (1375 AH), when the project to annex the two sites into the Masjid al-Haram was undertaken for the first time, and they were subsequently annexed. The distance between Safa and Marwa is approximately 450 m (1,480 ft), therefore, seven trips back and forth amount to roughly 3.6 km (2.2 mi).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Geological perspective ===\n\nThe individual geological history of the two mountains is relatively unknown. Marwa has been described as smoother and lighter in color than Safa, with some even calling it white, such as Majd ad-Din Ferozabadi, az-Zubaidi, al-Fayoumi. al-Alusi further went on to say that Safa's color was comparable to a tint of red. Safa and Marwa are a part of the Hejaz mountain range, which run parallel to most of the Saudi coast on the Red Sea. The Hejaz themselves are part of the larger Sarawat range, which is characterized by young and jagged mountains.\n\n\n=== Islamic narrative ===\n\nIn Islamic tradition, the civilization of Mecca started after Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (Abraham) left his son Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl (Ishmael) and wife H\u0101jar (Hagar) in the valley, which Muslims believe was a command by God. When their provisions were exhausted, Hajar eventually ran out of food and water and could no longer breastfeed Ismail. She thus ran back and forth seven times between Safa and Marwa hoping to find water. To make her search easier and faster, she went alone, leaving the infant on the ground. She first climbed the nearest hill, Safa, to look over the surrounding area. When she saw nothing, she then went to the other hill, Marwah, to look around. While Hagar was on either hillside, she was able to see Ishmael and know he was safe. However, when she was in the valley between the hills she was unable to see her son, and would thus run whilst in the valley and walk at a normal pace when on the hillsides. Hagar traveled back and forth between the hills seven times in the scorching heat before returning to her son. Allah then sent Angel Jibril (Gabriel) to their aid and a spring of water appeared from the ground. The well was named Zamzam and the journey back and forth Safa and Marwa was made a ritual during Hajj and Umrah. The two mountains are mentioned by name in the Qur'an, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2), verse 158.\n\n\n=== Before Muhammad ===\n\nThe early Ansari Muslims gave up the custom of Sa'ee seeing it as idol worship and shirk and a sign of the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (jahiliyyah). It is in this context that Verse 158 of Surah 2 was revealed (Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 6, Book 60, Hadith 22/23). In another narration by Abdullah Yusuf Ali in his commentary on Verse 2:158, he argues that the verse had been revealed because the pagans of Quraysh had placed two idols atop the two hills and the Muslims felt hesitated to walk between the hills seeing it as idol worship or as an act of shirk. Anas ibn Malik also said that he felt hatred in walking between the two hills as he saw it as a pre-Islamic custom from the jahiliyyah until Allah had revealed Verse 2:158 (Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 2). Aisha confirmed the verse had been revealed with regards to the Ansar. who was it sinful to walk between the hills as they used to visit the idol Manat at Qudaid (near Mecca) in the state of Ihram before going about with the rituals of their pilgrimage in pre-Islamic times. Several similar reasons have been given by multiple scholars of Islam, including al-Suyuti in his Asbab an-Nuzul and George Sale in his Preliminary Discourse to the Quran.\n\n\n== Significance in the Hajj and Umrah ==\nPerforming the Sa'ee serves to commemorate Hajar's search for water for her son and God's mercy in answering prayers. Two walkways guide pilgrimes from Safa to Marwa, and from Marwa to Safa, with two narrower walkways in the center to serve elderly and disabled pilgrims. The walkways between the two mountains are collectively called the Mas'aa (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0639\u0649\u200e, romanized: al-Mas'aa, lit. 'way, place of walking') and are air-conditioned. Water pumped from the Zamzam Well is also available on the way. Sa'ee is an integral part and rukn of Hajj and Umrah. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nSarawat Mountains\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSafa Marwa Sai | \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u064a \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0629 (YouTube)\nHow to make Umrah- Part 3 Safa and Marwa\nSafa-Marwa Umrah 2012 HD",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Jabal an-Nour (Arabic: \u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0644 \u0671\u0644\u0646\u064f\u0651\u0648\u0652\u0631\u200e, romanized: Jabal an-N\u016br, lit. 'Mountain of the Light' or 'Hill of the Illumination') is a mountain near Mecca in the Hejazi region of Saudi Arabia. The mountain houses the grotto or cave of Hira' (\u063a\u064e\u0627\u0631 \u062d\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621), which holds tremendous significance for Muslims throughout the world, as the Islamic Nab\u012b (Prophet) Muhammad is said to have spent a great deal of time in this cave meditating, and it is widely believed that it was here that he received his first revelation, which consisted of the first five ayats of Surah Al-Alaq from the angel Jibra'il (as is pronounced in certain Quran recitation schools and some Arab tribes; also known as Gabriel). It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Makkah. The mountain itself is barely 640 m (2,100 ft) tall; nonetheless one to two hours are needed to make the strenuous hike to the cave. There are 1750 steps to the top which, even for a fit individual, can take anywhere between half an hour and one-and-a-half hours.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSince this is where Muhammad is said to have had his first revelation and received the first verses of the Quran, the mountain was given the title Jabal an-N\u016br (\"Mountain of the Light\" or \"Mountain of the Enlightenment\"). This experience is sometimes identified with the beginning of revelation; hence the present name. The date of the first revelation is said to be during the night on August 10, 610 A.D. Or, monday the 21st of Ramadan, making Muhammad 40 lunar years, 6 months and 12 days of age, i.e. 39 Gregorian years, 3 months and 22 days.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nOne physical feature that differentiates Jabal al-Nour from other mountains and hills is its unusual summit, which makes it look as if two mountains are on top of each other. The top of this mountain in the mountainous desert is one of the loneliest of places. However, the cave within, which faces the direction of the Kaaba, is even more isolated. While standing in the courtyard back then, people could only look over the surrounding rocks. Nowadays, people can see the surrounding rocks as well as buildings that are hundreds of meters below and hundreds of meters to many kilometers away. Hira is both without water or vegetation other than a few thorns. Hira is higher than Thab\u012br (\u062b\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0631), and is crowned by a steep and slippery peak, which Muhammad with some companions once climbed.\n\n\n== Cave of Hira ==\n\nTaking 1750 walking steps to reach, the cave itself is about 3.7 m (12 ft) in length and 1.60 m (5 ft 3 in) in width. The cave is situated at a height of 270 m (890 ft). During the season of \u1e24ajj ('Pilgrimage'), an estimated five thousand visitors climb to the cave daily to see the place where Muhammad is believed to have received the first revelation of the Quran on the Night of Power by the angel Jibreel. The majority of Muslims do not consider visiting the cave as an integral part of the Hajj. Nonetheless many visit it for reasons of personal pleasure and spirituality, and though some consider it a place of worship, this view conflicts with Salafist interpretations of Islamic ritual. While the cave plays an important role in As-S\u012brah an-Nabawiyyah (The Prophetic Biography), it is not considered as holy as other sites in Mecca, such as Al-Haram Mosque, and so under most interpretations of Islam, the same reward is received for praying here as any other place in Mecca.Before Muhammad's first revelation, he was said to have pleasant dreams. Among these dreams were signs that his Prophethood was starting to appear, and signs that the stones in Mecca would greet him with the Salaam. These dreams lasted for six months.An increasing need for solitude led Mohammed to seek seclusion and meditation in the rocky hills which surrounded Mecca. There he would retreat to the cave for one month, each year, engaging in ta\u1e25annuth (\u062a\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0646\u064f\u0651\u062b). He would take provisions along with him during this retreat, and would feed the poor that would come to him. Then before returning home to his family for more provisions he would circumambulate the Kaaba seven times, or however many times Allah willed; then he would go home.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBiblical Mount Sinai\nCumorah\nHoliest sites in Islam\nSacred mountains\nSarat Mountains\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n3D Tour of Hira Cave\n360\u00b0 Virtual Tour of Hira Cave\nIn pictures: Hajj preparations (Pictures #4 and #5 are of Jabal an-N\u016br and the Hira cave)",

These towers are a part of the King Abdulaziz Endowment Project that aims to modernize the city in catering to its pilgrims. The central hotel tower, the Makkah Royal Clock Tower, has the world's largest clock face and is the third-tallest building and fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the world. The clock tower contains the Clock Tower Museum that occupies the top four floors of the tower.The building complex is metres away from the world's largest mosque and Islam's most sacred site, the Great Mosque of Mecca. The developer and contractor of the complex is the Saudi Binladin Group, the Kingdom's largest construction company. It is the world's second most expensive building with the total cost of construction totalling US$15 billion. The complex was built after the demolition of the Ajyad Fortress, the 18th-century Ottoman citadel on top of a hill overlooking the Grand Mosque. The destruction of the historically significant site in 2002 by the Saudi government sparked international outcry and a strong response from Turkey.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe tallest tower in the complex is the tallest building in Saudi Arabia, with a height of 601 metres (1,972 feet). Currently it is the fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the world, surpassing the Ping An Finance Centre in Shenzhen, China but shorter than the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE, the Tokyo Skytree in Tokyo, Japan, the Shanghai Tower in Shanghai, China, and the Canton Tower in Guangzhou, China.\nThe site of the complex is located across the piazza to the south from the main entrance (King Abdul-Aziz Gate) to the Masjid al Haram mosque, which houses the Kaaba. To accommodate worshippers visiting the Kaaba, the Abraj Al-Bait Towers has two large prayer rooms (one for men, one for women) capable of holding more than 10,000 people. The tallest tower in the complex also contains a five-star hotel, operated by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, to help provide lodging for the millions of pilgrims that travel to Mecca annually to participate in the Hajj.\n\nIn addition, the Abraj Al-Bait Towers has a five-story shopping mall (the Abraj Al Bait Mall) and a parking garage capable of holding over a thousand vehicles.\nThe building was planned to be 734 m (2,408 ft) tall in 2006. In 2009, it was published that the final height would be 601 m (1,972 ft). The complex was built by the Saudi Binladin Group, Saudi Arabia's largest construction company. The tallest building in the complex (from a height of 450 m (1,480 ft) up until the tip) was designed by the German architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his firm SL Rasch GmbH. The fa\u00e7ade was constructed by Premiere Composite Technologies, the clock by German tower clock manufacturer PERROT GmbH & Co. KG Turmuhren und L\u00e4uteanlagen.\nAccording to the Saudi Ministry of Religious Endowments, the project cost US$15 billion.\n\n\n=== Clock ===\nThe project uses clock faces for each side of the main hotel tower. The highest residential floor stands at 370 m (1,210 ft), just below the media displays under the clock faces. At 43 m \u00d7 43 m (141 ft \u00d7 141 ft), these are the largest in the world. The roof of the clocks is 450 m (1,480 ft) above the ground, making them the world's most elevated architectural clocks. A 151-metre-tall (495 ft) spire has been added on top of the clock giving it a total height of 601 m (1,972 ft). Behind the clock faces there is an astronomy exhibition. In the spire base and the glass-covered floors (The Jewel) there is a scientific center which is used to sight the moon in the beginnings of the Islamic months, and to operate an atomic clock which controls the tower clocks.\n\n\n=== List of component towers ===\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nThe building is topped by a four-faced clock, visible from 25 kilometres (16 miles) away. The clock is the highest in the world at over 400 m (1,300 ft) above the ground. The clock faces are the largest in the world, surpassing the Cevahir Mall clock in Istanbul.\nEach of the clock's four faces measures 43 m (141 ft) in diameter and are illuminated by 2 million LED lights, with four oriented edges, just above the clock alongside huge Arabic script reading: \"God is [the] greatest\" on the north and south faces and on the west and east \"There is no god but Allah. Muhammad is the messenger of God.\". Four golden domes on pillars on all the corners are also present. Another 21,000 white and green coloured lights, the same as the Saudi Flag, fitted at the top of the clock, flash to signal Islam's five-time daily prayers, and are visible as far as 30 km (19 mi) away. On special occasions such as new year, 16 bands of vertical lights shoot 10 km (6.2 mi) up into the sky. The clock's four faces are covered with 98 million pieces of glass mosaics. The Saudi coat of arms is displayed at the centre of each clock behind the dials. The minute hand is 23 m (75 ft) long, while the hour hand is 17 m (56 ft) long.\nA private viewing deck is located 558 m (1,831 ft) above the ground, right under the crescent. There is also a public viewing deck at the base of the clocks at 393 metres' height.\nThere were reports that the clock would be set to local Mecca Time, in an attempt to replace the IERS Reference Meridian as the prime meridian for global time keeping, but the clock is set to Arabia Standard Time (UTC+03:00).\n\n\n=== Spire ===\n\nThe clocks are topped by a 128-metre (420 ft) spire with a 23-metre-high (75 ft) golden crescent at the top. The spire has an eight-story glass-covered base (The Jewel) which belongs to a scientific center having its own small exhibition, another observation deck at 475 m (1,558 ft) and a prayer floor in 480 m (1,570 ft). The highest floor in The Jewel is the Control Tower Floor, which was planned to be used for controlling air traffic in the sky above Mecca (mainly helicopters as airplanes are not allowed near Mecca). However, this was skipped for technical reasons and the future usage is not clear yet. Above from The Jewel the spire has only technical installations for sound, light and other infrastructure and eventually the last viewing deck and the crescent above it. The crescent has two regular floors with living areas and a few service floors and rooms.\nThe crescent was constructed in Dubai by Premier Composite Technologies in April 2011. The crescent is made of fibreglass-backed mosaic gold, and it weighs up to 35 tonnes. Peugeot Joseph, the company official, said a team of five engineers and a hundred workers carried out the project, which cost 90 million United Arab Emirates dirhams and took three months to build.\nThe company has also constructed the Mecca Clock. The crescent was divided into 10 parts to move it to Mecca. The crescent was partly assembled on the base of the clock face to reduce it to 5 parts. Those five parts were then lifted and installed above the spire from 20 June to 6 July 2011.\nThe minaret and its base have loudspeakers which broadcast prayer calls to a distance of 7 km while nearly 21,000 lamps illuminate the surrounding area to a distance of 30 km (19 mi). During occasions like Muslim Eids and new Hijri years, a 16-beam light illuminates an area of a diameter of around 10 km (6 mi) while 21,000 lamps beam white and green lights to a distance of 30 km (19 mi). The light beams are intended to allow the deaf, and Muslims in more distant parts of Mecca and nearby cities, to know prayer timings.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\n\n\n=== Construction fires ===\nThe Abraj-Al-Bait complex had two fire incidents during construction. The first fire accident was at Hajar Tower on 28 October 2008. It took 400 firefighters to put out the fire, which burned for 10 hours, consuming nine floors of the tower. According to eyewitness reports, the blaze erupted shortly after midnight, and spread rapidly because of wood used for construction stored in the premises. Soon, the entire building was engulfed in smoke. Hospitals were put on high alert, but no injuries were reported. A civil defence spokesman said the fire started on the 32nd floor of the Hajar Tower.The second fire struck the Safa Tower on 1 May 2009. No deaths or injuries were reported in the blaze which was quickly contained by Civil Defence. Eyewitnesses said the fire broke out soon after Asr prayer while some workers in the building were welding iron rods on wooden scaffoldings. The fire damaged a large part of the under-construction tower. According to Major General Adel Zamzami, director general of Civil Defence in the Mecca province, the fire broke out at the 14th floor and reached up to the 20th floor.\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\n\nThe construction engendered some controversy as the location chosen for the towers was the historic 18th-century Ottoman Ajyad Fortress, which was demolished to make way for them. The development has been criticised by The Guardian for having \"transformed a type of architecture that evolved from a dense urban grain of low-rise courtyards and narrow streets into ... an endlessly repeatable pattern for the decoration of standardised [concrete] slab(s)\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of buildings with 100 floors or more\nList of tallest buildings in Saudi Arabia\nList of tallest buildings\nList of largest buildings\nList of tallest hotels\nList of largest clock faces\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Abraj Al-Bait Endowment Complex\".

        "wiki": "Mecca, officially Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: \u0645\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0631\u0645\u0629\u200e, romanized: Makkat al-Mukarramah, lit. 'Makkah the Noble') and commonly shortened to Makkah, is the holiest city in Islam and the capital of the Makkah Province of Saudi Arabia. The city is located 70 km (43 mi) inland from Jeddah on the Red Sea, in a narrow valley 277 m (909 ft) above sea level. Its last recorded population was 1,578,722 in 2015. estimated metro population in 2020 is 2.042 million, making it the third-most populated city in the kingdom. Pilgrims more than triple this number every year during the \u1e24ajj pilgrimage, observed in the twelfth Hijri month of Dh\u016bl-\u1e24ijjah.\nMecca is the birthplace of Muhammad. The Hira cave located atop the Jabal al-Nur (\"Mountain of Light\") is located just outside the city and is the location where Muslims believe the Qur'an was first revealed to Muhammad. Visiting Mecca for the Hajj is an obligation upon all able Muslims. The Great Mosque of Mecca, known as the Masjid al-Haram is home to the Ka'bah, believed by Muslims to have been built by Abraham and Ishmael, is one of Islam's holiest sites and the direction of prayer for all Muslims (qibla), cementing Mecca's significance in Islam.Muslim rulers from in and around the region long tried to take the city and keep it in their control, and thus, much like most of the Hejaz region, the city has seen several regime changes, which owes to its rich history. The city was finally conquered in the Saudi conquest of Hejaz by Ibn Saud and his allies in 1925. Since then, Mecca has seen a tremendous expansion in size and infrastructure, with newer, modern buildings such as the Abraj Al Bait, the world's fourth-tallest building and third-largest by floor area, towering over the Great Mosque. The Saudi government has also carried out a destruction of several historical structures and archaeological sites, such as the Ajyad Fortress. Non-Muslims (Kuffar) are strictly prohibited from entering the city.Muslims from around the world visit the city, not only for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, but also as tourists to visit regional landmarks such as the 'Aisha Mosque (Masjid 'Aisha) and the sites visited by pilgrims in the Hajj and 'Umrah. Mecca is now home to two of the most expensive buildings in the world, the Masjid al-Haram, valued at 100 billion US dollars, and the Abraj al-Bait complex, valued at 15 billion US dollars.\nUnder the Saudi government, Mecca is governed by the Makkah Regional Municipality, a municipal council of 14 locally elected members headed by the mayor (called Amin in Arabic) appointed by the Saudi government. As of May 2015, the mayor of the city is Dr. Osama bin Fadhel Al-Barr. The City of Mecca amanah, which constitutes Mecca and the surrounding region, is the capital of the Makkah Province, which includes the neighboring cities of Jeddah and Ta'if, even though Jeddah is considerably larger in population compared to Mecca. The Provincial Governor of the province from 16 May 2007 is Prince Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud was appointed as the new governor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nMecca has been referred to by many names. As with many Arabic words, the etymology of Makkah is obscure. Widely believed to be a synonym for Mecca, it is said to be more specifically the early name for the valley located therein, while Muslim scholars generally use it to refer to the sacred area of the city that immediately surrounds and includes the Ka'bah.Bakkah\n\nThe Qur'an refers to the city as Bakkah in Surah Al Imran (3), verse 96, \"Indeed the first House [of worship], established for mankind was that at Bakkah...\"\n\u2013 Qur'an 3:96 This is presumed to have been the name of the city at the time of Abraham (Ibrahim in Islamic tradition) and it is also transliterated as Baca, Baka, Bakah, Bakka, Becca, Bekka, among others.Makkah, Makkah al-Mukarramah and Mecca\nIn South Arabic, the language in use in the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula at the time of Muhammad, the b and m were interchangeable. This is presumed to have been the origin of the current form of the name. \"Makkah\" is the official transliteration used by the Saudi government and is closer to the Arabic pronunciation. The government adopted Makkah as the official spelling in the 1980s, but is not universally known or used worldwide. The full official name is Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: \u0645\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0631\u0645\u0629\u200e, romanized: Makkat al-Mukarramah, lit. 'Makkah the Honored'). \"Makkah\" is used to refer to the city in the Qur'an in Surah Al-Fath (48), verse 24.The word \"Mecca\" in English has come to be used to refer to any place that draws large numbers of people, and because of this some English-speaking Muslims have come to regard the use of this spelling for the city as offensive.  Mecca is the familiar form of the English transliteration for the Arabic name of the city,\nThe consensus in academic scholarship is that \"Macoraba\", the place mentioned in Arabia Felix by Claudius Ptolemy, is Mecca. Many etymologies have been proposed but the most suitable one is that it is derived from the Old South Arabian root \"M-K-R-B\" which means temple.Other names\nAnother name used for Mecca in the Qur'an is at 6:92 where it is called Umm al-Qur\u0101 (\u0623\u064f\u0645\u0651 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0649, meaning \"Mother of all Settlements\". The city has been called several other names in both the Qur'an and ahadith. Another name used historically for Mecca is Tih\u0101mah. According to Arab and Islamic tradition, another name for Mecca, F\u0101r\u0101n, is synonymous with the Desert of Paran mentioned in the Old Testament at Genesis 21:21. Arab and Islamic tradition holds that the wilderness of Paran, broadly speaking, is the Tihamah coastal plain and the site where Ishmael settled was Mecca. Yaqut al-Hamawi, the 12th century Syrian geographer, wrote that F\u0101r\u0101n was \"an arabized Hebrew word, one of the names of Mecca mentioned in the Torah.\"\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nIn 2010, Mecca and the surrounding area became an important site for paleontology with respect to primate evolution, with the discovery of a Saadanius fossil. Saadanius is considered to be a primate closely related to the common ancestor of the Old World monkeys and apes. The fossil habitat, near what is now the Red Sea in western Saudi Arabia, was a damp forest area between 28 million and 29 million years ago. Paleontologists involved in the research hope to find further fossils in the area.\n\n\n=== Early history (upto 5th century CE) ===\n\nThe early history of Mecca is still largely disputed, as there are no unambiguous reference to it in ancient literature prior to the rise of Islam and no architecture from the time of Muhammad. The Roman Empire took control of part of the Hejaz in 106 CE, ruling cities such as Hegra (now known as Mada'in Saleh), located around 800 km (500 mi) north of Mecca. Even though detailed descriptions of Western Arabia were established by the Romans, such as by Procopius, there are no references of a pilgrimage and trading outpost such as Mecca.Potential ancient references\nThe Greek historian Diodorus Siculus writes about Arabia in his work Bibliotheca historica, describing a holy shrine: \"And a temple has been set up there, which is very holy and exceedingly revered by all Arabians\". Claims have been made this could be a reference to the Ka'bah in Mecca. However, the geographic location Diodorus describes is located in northwest Arabia, around the area of Leuke Kome, closer to Petra and within the former Nabataean Kingdom and Roman province of Arabia Petraea.Ptolemy lists the names of 50 cities in Arabia, one going by the name of \"Macoraba\". There has been speculation since 1646 that this could be a reference to Mecca, but many scholars see no compelling explanation to link the two names. Bowersock favors the identity of the former, with his theory being that \"Macoraba\" is the word \"Makkah\" followed by the aggrandizing Aramaic adjective rabb (great). The Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus also enumerated many cities of Western Arabia, most of whom can be identified. According to Bowersock, he did mention Mecca as \"Geapolis\" or \"Hierapolis\", the latter one meaning \"holy city\", referring to the sanctuary of the Ka'bah, well known already in pagan times. Patricia Crone, from the Revisionist school of Islamic studies on the other hand, writes that \"the plain truth is that the name Macoraba has nothing to do with that of Mecca [...] if Ptolemy mentions Mecca at all, he calls it Moka, a town in Arabia Petraea\" (in northwest Arabia near present-day Petra).\nThe first direct reference to Mecca in external literature occurs in 741 CE, in the Byzantine-Arab Chronicle, though here the author places it in Mesopotamia rather than the Hejaz. Given the inhospitable environment, and lack of historical references in Roman, Persian and Indian sources, historians including Patricia Crone and Tom Holland have cast doubt on the claim that Mecca was a major historical trading outpost. However, other scholars such as Glen W. Bowersock disagree and assert that Mecca was a major trading outpost.Mecca is mentioned in the following early Qur'anic manuscripts:\n\nCodex Is. 1615 I, folio 47v, radiocarbon dated to 591-643 CE.\nCodex \u1e62an\u02bf\u0101\u02be DAM 01\u201329.1, folio 29a, radiocarbon dated between 633-665 CE.\nCodex Arabe 331, folio 40 v, radiocarbon dated between 652-765 CE.Islamic narrative\nIn the Islamic view, the beginnings of Mecca are attributed to the Biblical figures, Abraham, Hagar and Ishmael. The civilization of Mecca is believed to have started after Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (Abraham) left his son Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl (Ishmael) and wife H\u0101jar (Hagar) in the valley at Allah's command. Some people from the Yemeni tribe of Jurhum settled with them, and Isma'il reportedly married two women, one after divorcing the first, on Ibrahim's advice. At least one man of the Jurhum helped Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl and his father to construct or according to Islamic narratives, reconstruct, the Ka'bah ('Cube'), which would have social, religious, political and historical implications for the site and region.Muslims see the mention of a pilgrimage at the Valley of Baca in the Old Testament chapter Psalm 84:3\u20136 as a reference to Mecca, similar to the Qur'an at Surah 3:96. In the Shar\u1e25 al-As\u0101\u1e6d\u012br, a commentary on the Samaritan midrashic chronology of the Patriarchs, of unknown date but probably composed in the 10th century CE, it is claimed that Mecca was built by the sons of Nebaioth, the eldest son of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl or Ishmael.Thamudic inscriptions\nSome Thamudic inscriptions which were discovered in the south Jordan contained names of some individuals such as \u02bfAbd Mekkat (\u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0645\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0651\u0629, \"Servant of Mecca\").There were also some other inscriptions which contained personal names such as Makki (\u0645\u064e\u0643\u0650\u0651\u064a, \"Meccan\"), but Jawwad Ali from the University of Baghdad suggested that there's also a probability of a tribe named \"Makkah\".\n\n\n=== Under the Quraish ===\nSome time in the 5th century, the Ka'bah was a place of worship for the deities of Arabia's pagan tribes. Mecca's most important pagan deity was Hubal, which had been placed there by the ruling Quraish tribe. and remained until the Conquest of Mecca by Muhammad. In the 5th century, the Quraish took control of Mecca, and became skilled merchants and traders. In the 6th century, they joined the lucrative spice trade, since battles elsewhere were diverting trade routes from dangerous sea routes to more secure overland routes. The Byzantine Empire had previously controlled the Red Sea, but piracy had been increasing. Another previous route that ran through the Persian Gulf via the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was also being threatened by exploitations from the Sassanid Empire, and was being disrupted by the Lakhmids, the Ghassanids, and the Roman\u2013Persian Wars. Mecca's prominence as a trading center also surpassed the cities of Petra and Palmyra. The Sassanids however did not always pose a threat to Mecca, as in 575 CE they protected it from a Yemeni invasion, led by its Christian leader Abraha. The tribes of southern Arabia asked the Persian king Khosrau I for aid, in response to which he came south to Arabia with foot-soldiers and a fleet of ships near Mecca.By the middle of the 6th century, there were three major settlements in northern Arabia, all along the south-western coast that borders the Red Sea, in a habitable region between the sea and the Hejaz mountains to the east. Although the area around Mecca was completely barren, it was the wealthiest of the three settlements with abundant water from the renowned Zamzam Well and a position at the crossroads of major caravan routes.The harsh conditions and terrain of the Arabian peninsula meant a near-constant state of conflict between the local tribes, but once a year they would declare a truce and converge upon Mecca in an annual pilgrimage. Up to the 7th century, this journey was intended for religious reasons by the pagan Arabs to pay homage to their shrine, and to drink Zamzam. However, it was also the time each year that disputes would be arbitrated, debts would be resolved, and trading would occur at Meccan fairs. These annual events gave the tribes a sense of common identity and made Mecca an important focus for the peninsula.The Year of the Elephant (570 CE)\nThe \"Year of the Elephant\" is the name in Islamic history for the year approximately equating to 550-552 CE, when, according to Islamic sources such as Ibn Ishaq, Abraha descended upon Mecca, riding an elephant, with a large army after building a cathedral at San'aa, named al-Qullays in honor of the Negus of Axum. It gained widespread fame, even gaining attention from the Byzantine Empire. Abraha attempted to divert the pilgrimage of the Arabs from the Ka'bah to al-Qullays, effectively converting them to Christianity. According to Islamic tradition, this was the year of Muhammad's birth. Abraha allegedly sent a messenger named Muhammad ibn Khuza'i to Mecca and Tihamah with a message that al-Qullays was both much better than other houses of worship and purer, having not been defiled by the housing of idols. When Muhammad ibn Khuza'i got as far as the land of Kinana, the people of the lowland, knowing what he had come for, sent a man of Hudhayl called \u02bfUrwa bin Hayyad al-Milasi, who shot him with an arrow, killing him. His brother Qays who was with him, fled to Abraha and told him the news, which increased his rage and fury and he swore to raid the Kinana tribe and destroy the Ka'bah. Ibn Ishaq further states that one of the men of the Quraysh tribe was angered by this, and going to Sana'a, entering the church at night and defiling it; widely assumed to have done so by defecating in it.\nAbraha marched upon the Ka'bah with a large army, which included one or more war elephants, intending to demolish it. When news of the advance of his army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kinanah, Khuza'a and Hudhayl united in the defense of the Ka'bah and the city. A man from the Himyarite Kingdom was sent by Abraha to advise them that Abraha only wished to demolish the Ka'bah and if they resisted, they would be crushed. Abdul Muttalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the hills while he and some members of the Quraysh remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abraha sent a dispatch inviting Abdul-Muttalib to meet with Abraha and discuss matters. When Abdul-Muttalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure he will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.\" Abraha eventually attacked Mecca. However, the lead elephant, known as Mahmud, is said to have stopped at the boundary around Mecca and refused to enter. It has been theorized that an epidemic such as by smallpox could have caused such a failed invasion of Mecca. The reference to the story in Quran is rather short. According to the 115th Surah of the Qur'an, Al-Fil, the next day, a dark cloud of small birds sent by Allah appeared. The birds carried small rocks in their beaks, and bombarded the Ethiopian forces and smashed them to a state like that of eaten straw.Economy\nCamel caravans, said to have first been used by Muhammad's great-grandfather, were a major part of Mecca's bustling economy. Alliances were struck between the merchants in Mecca and the local nomadic tribes, who would bring goods \u2013 leather, livestock, and metals mined in the local mountains \u2013 to Mecca to be loaded on the caravans and carried to cities in Shaam and Iraq. Historical accounts also provide some indication that goods from other continents may also have flowed through Mecca. Goods from Africa and the Far East passed through en route to Syria including spices, leather, medicine, cloth, and slaves; in return Mecca received money, weapons, cereals and wine, which in turn were distributed throughout Arabia. The Meccans signed treaties with both the Byzantines and the Bedouins, and negotiated safe passages for caravans, giving them water and pasture rights. Mecca became the center of a loose confederation of client tribes, which included those of the Banu Tamim. Other regional powers such as the Abyssinians, Ghassanids, and Lakhmids were in decline leaving Meccan trade to be the primary binding force in Arabia in the late 6th century.\n\n\n=== Muhammad and the conquest of Mecca ===\nMuhammad was born in Mecca in 570, and thus Islam has been inextricably linked with it ever since. He was born in a minor faction, the Banu Hashim, of the ruling Quraysh tribe. It was in Mecca, in the nearby mountain cave of Hira on Jabal al-Nour, that, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad began receiving divine revelations from God through the archangel Jibreel in 610 AD. Advocating his form of Abrahamic monotheism against Meccan paganism, and after enduring persecution from the pagan tribes for 13 years, Muhammad emigrated to Medina (hijrah) in 622 with his companions, the Muhajirun, to Yathrib (later renamed Madinah). The conflict between the Quraysh and the Muslims is accepted to have begun at this point. Overall, Meccan efforts to annihilate Islam failed and proved to be costly and unsuccessful. During the Battle of the Trench in 627, the combined armies of Arabia were unable to defeat Muhammad's forces.\nIn 628, Muhammad and his followers wanted to enter Mecca for pilgrimage, but were blocked by the Quraysh. Subsequently, Muslims and Meccans entered into the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, whereby the Quraysh and their allies promised to cease fighting Muslims and their allies and promised that Muslims would be allowed into the city to perform the pilgrimage the following year. It was meant to be a ceasefire for 10 years; however, just two years later, the Banu Bakr, allies of the Quraish, violated the truce by slaughtering a group of the Banu Khuza'ah, allies of the Muslims. Muhammad and his companions, now 10,000 strong, marched into Mecca and conquered the city. The pagan imagery was destroyed by Muhammad's followers and the location Islamized and rededicated to the worship of Allah alone. Mecca was declared the holiest site in Islam ordaining it as the center of Muslim pilgrimage (Hajj), one of the faith's Five Pillars. Muhammad then returned to Medina, after assigning 'Akib ibn Usaid as governor of the city. His other activities in Arabia led to the unification of the peninsula under the banner of Islam. Muhammad died in 632. Within the next few hundred years, stretched from North Africa into Asia and parts of Europe. As the Islamic realm grew, Mecca continued to attract pilgrims from all across the Muslim world and beyond, as Muslims came to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Mecca also attracted a year-round population of scholars, pious Muslims who wished to live close to the Kaaba, and local inhabitants who served the pilgrims. Due to the difficulty and expense of the Hajj, pilgrims arrived by boat at Jeddah, and came overland, or joined the annual caravans from Syria or Iraq.\n\n\n=== Medieval and pre-modern times ===\nMecca was never the capital of any of the Islamic states. Muslim rulers did contribute to its upkeep, such as during the reigns of 'Umar (r. 634\u2013644 CE) and 'Uthman ibn Affan (r. 644\u2013656 CE) when concerns of flooding caused the caliphs to bring in Christian engineers to build barrages in the low-lying quarters and construct dykes and embankments to protect the area round the Kaaba.Muhammad's return to Medina shifted the focus away from Mecca and later even further away when 'Ali, the fourth caliph, took power chose Kufa as his capital. The Umayyad Caliphate moved the capital to Damascus in Syria and the Abbasid Caliphate to Baghdad, in modern-day Iraq, which remained the center of the Islamic Empire for nearly 500 years. Mecca re-entered Islamic political history during the Second Fitna, when it was held by Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr and the Zubayrids. The city was twice besieged by the Umayyads, in 683 and 692 and for some time thereafter, the city figured little in politics, remaining a city of devotion and scholarship governed by various other factions. In 930, Mecca was attacked and sacked by Qarmatians, a millenarian Shi'a Isma'ili Muslim sect led by Ab\u016b-T\u0101hir Al-Jann\u0101b\u012b and centered in eastern Arabia. The Black Death pandemic hit Mecca in 1349.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Ibn Battuta's description of Mecca ====\nOne of the most famous travelers to Mecca in the 14th century was Moroccan scholar and traveler, Ibn Battuta. In his rihla (account), he provides a vast description of the city. Around the year 1327 CE or 729 AH, Ibn Battuta arrived at the holy city. Immediately, he says, it felt like a holy sanctuary and thus. he started the rites of the pilgrimage. He remained in Mecca for three years and left in 1330 CE. During his second year in the holy city, he says his caravan arrived \"with a great quantity of alms for the support of those who were staying in Mecca and Medina\". While in Mecca, prayers were made for (not to) the King of Iraq and also for Salaheddin al-Ayyubi, Sultan of Egypt and Syria at the Ka'bah. Battuta says the Ka'bah was large, but was destroyed and rebuilt smaller than the original and that it contained images of angels and prophets including Jesus, his mother Mary and many others. Battuta describes the Ka'bah as an important part of Mecca due to the fact that many people make the pilgrimage to it. Battuta describes the people of the city as being humble and kind, and also willing to give a part of everything they had to someone who had nothing. The inhabitants of Mecca and the village itself, he says, were very clean. There was also a sense of elegance to the village.Under the Ottomans\nIn 1517, the then Sharif of Mecca, Barakat bin Muhammad, acknowledged the supremacy of the Ottoman Caliph but retained a great degree of local autonomy. In 1803 the city was captured by the First Saudi State, which held Mecca until 1813. destroying some of the historic tombs and domes in and around the city. The Ottomans assigned the task of bringing Mecca back under Ottoman control to their powerful Khedive (viceroy) and Wali of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha. Muhammad Ali Pasha successfully returned Mecca to Ottoman control in 1813. In 1818, the Saud were defeated again but survived and founded the Second Saudi State that lasted until 1891 and led on to the present country of Saudi Arabia. In 1853, Sir Richard Francis Burton undertook the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina disguised as a Muslim. Although Burton was certainly not the first non-Muslim European to make the Hajj (Ludovico di Varthema did this in 1503), his pilgrimage remains one of the most famous and documented of modern times. Mecca was regularly hit by cholera outbreaks. Between 1830 and 1930, cholera broke out among pilgrims at Mecca 27 times.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nHashemite Revolt and subsequent control by the Sharifate of Mecca\nIn World War I, the Ottoman Empire was at war with Britain and its allies. It had successfully repulsed an attack on Istanbul in the Gallipoli Campaign and on Baghdad in the Siege of Kut. The British agent T.E. Lawrence conspired with the Ottoman governor, Hussain bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and it was the first city captured by his forces in the 1916 Battle of Mecca. Sharif's revolt proved a turning point of the war on the eastern front. Hussein declared a new state, the Kingdom of Hejaz, declaring himself the Sharif of the state and Mecca his capital. News reports in November 1916 via contact in Cairo with returning Hajj pilgrims, stated that with the Ottoman Turkish authorities gone, the Hajj of 1916 was free of the previous massive extortion and monetary demands made by the Turks who were agents of the Ottoman government.Saudi Arabian conquest and modern history\nFollowing the 1924 Battle of Mecca, the Sharif of Mecca was overthrown by the Saud family, and Mecca was incorporated into Saudi Arabia. Under Saudi rule, much of the historic city has been demolished as a result of the Saudi government fearing these sites might become sites of association in worship beside Allah (shirk). The city has been expanded to include several towns previously considered to be separate from the holy city and now is just a few kilometers outside the main sites of the Hajj, Mina, Muzdalifah and Arafat. Mecca is not served by any airport, due to concerns about the city's safety. It is instead served by the King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah (approx. 70 km away) internationally and the Ta'if Regional Airport (approx. 120 km away) for domestic flights.The city today is at the junction of the two most important highways in all of the Saudi Arabian highway system, Highway 40, which connects the city to Jeddah in the west and the capital, Riyadh and Dammam in the east and Highway 15, which connects it to Medina, Tabuk and onward to Jordan in the north and Abha and Jizan in the south. The Ottomans had planned to extend their railway network to the holy city, but were forced to abandon this plan due to their partaking in the First World War. This plan was later carried out by the Saudi government, which connected the two holy cities of Medina and Mecca with the modern Haramain high-speed railway system which runs at 300 km/h (190 mph) and connects the two cities via Jeddah, King Abdulaziz International Airport and King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh within two hours.The haram area of Mecca, in which the entry of non-Muslims is forbidden, is much larger than that of Medina.\n\n1979 Grand Mosque seizure\nOn 20 November 1979, two hundred armed dissidents led by Juhayman al-Otaibi, seized the Grand Mosque, claiming the Saudi royal family no longer represented pure Islam and that the Masjid al-Haram and the Ka'bah, must be held by those of true faith. The rebels seized tens of thousands of pilgrims as hostages and barricaded themselves in the mosque. The siege lasted two weeks, and resulted in several hundred deaths and significant damage to the shrine, especially the Safa-Marwah gallery. A multinational force was finally able to retake the mosque from the dissidents. Since then, the Grand Mosque has been expanded several times, with many other expansions being undertaken in the present-day.\n\nDestruction of Islamic heritage sites\nUnder Saudi rule, it has been estimated that since 1985, about 95% of Mecca's historic buildings, most over a thousand years old, have been demolished. It has been reported that there are now fewer than 20 structures remaining in Mecca that date back to the time of Muhammad. Some important buildings that have been destroyed include the house of Khadijah, the wife of Muhammad, the house of Abu Bakr, Muhammad's birthplace and the Ottoman-era Ajyad Fortress. The reason for much of the destruction of historic buildings has been for the construction of hotels, apartments, parking lots, and other infrastructure facilities for Hajj pilgrims.\nIncidents during pilgrimage\nMecca has been the site of several incidents and failures of crowd control because of the large numbers of people who come to make the Hajj. For example, on 2 July 1990, a pilgrimage to Mecca ended in tragedy when the ventilation system failed in a crowded pedestrian tunnel and 1,426 people were either suffocated or trampled to death in a stampede. On 24 September 2015, 700 pilgrims were killed in a stampede at Mina during the stoning-the-Devil ritual at Jamarat.\n\n\n== Significance in Islam ==\n\nMecca holds an important place in Islam and is the holiest city in all branches of the religion. The city derives its importance from the role it plays in the Hajj and 'Umrah.\n\n\n=== Masjid al-Haram ===\nThe Masjid al-Haram is the largest mosque in the world and the most expensive single building in the entire world, valued at 100 billion US dollars, as of 2020. It is the site of two of the most important rites of both the Hajj and of the Umrah, the circumambulation around the Ka'bah (tawaf) and the walking between the two mounts of Safa and Marwa (sa'ee). The masjid is also the site of the Zamzam Well. According to Islamic tradition, a prayer in the masjid is equal to 100,000 prayers in any other masjid around the world.\nKaaba\nThere is a difference of opinion between Islamic scholars upon who first built the Ka'bah, some believe it was built by the angels while others believe it was built by Adam. Regardless, it was built several times before reaching its current state, the most famous of these renovations being the one by Abraham (Ibrahim in Islamic tradition). The Ka'bah is also the common direction of prayer (qibla) for all Muslims. The surface surrounding the Ka'bah on which Muslims circumambulate it is known as the Mataf.\nHijr al-Aswad (The Black Stone)\nThe Black Stone is a stone, considered by scientists to be a meteorite or of similar origin and believed by Muslims to be of divine origin. It is set in a corner of the Ka'bah and it is Sunnah to touch and kiss the stone. The area around the stone is generally always crowded and guarded by policemen to ensure the pilgrims' safety.\nMaqam Ibrahim\nThis is a stone which Muslims believe Abraham stood on to build the higher parts of the Ka'bah. It contains two footprints that are comparatively larger than average modern-day human feet. The stone is raised and housed in a golden hexagonal chamber beside the Ka'bah on the Mataf plate.\nSafa and Marwa\n\nMuslims believe that in the divine revelation to Muhammad, the Qur'an, Allah describes the mountains of Safa and Marwah as symbols of his divinity. Walking between the two mountains seven times, 4 times from Safa to Marwah and 3 times from Marwah interchangeably, is considered a mandatory pillar (rukn) of 'Umrah.\n\n\n=== Hajj and 'Umrah ===\nThe Hajj pilgrimage, also called the greater pilgrimage, attracts millions of Muslims from all over the world and almost triples Mecca's population for one week in the twelfth and final Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah. In 2019, the Hajj attracted 2,489,406 pilgrims to the holy city. The 'Umrah, or the lesser pilgrimage, can be done at anytime during the year.  Every adult, healthy Muslim who has the financial and physical capacity to travel to Mecca must perform the Hajj at least once in a lifetime. Umrah, the lesser pilgrimage, is not obligatory, but is recommended in the Quran. In addition to the Masjid al-Haram, pilgrims also must visit the nearby towns of Mina/Muna, Muzdalifah and Mount Arafat for various rituals that are part of the Hajj.\n\n\n=== Jabal an-Nur ===\nThis is a mountain believed by Muslims to have been the place where Muhammad spent his time away from the bustling city of Mecca in seclusion. The mountain is located on the eastern entrance of the city and is the highest point in the city at 642 meters (2,106 feet).\n\n\n==== Hira'a Cave ====\nSituated atop Jabal an-Nur, this is the place where Muslims believe Muhammad received the first revelation from Allah through the archangel Gabriel (Jibril in Islamic tradition) at the age of 40.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMecca is located in the Hejaz region, a 200 km (124 mi) wide strip of mountains separating the Nafud desert from the Red Sea. The city is situated in a valley with the same name around 70 km (44 mi) west of the port city of Jeddah. Mecca is one of the lowest cities in elevation in the Hejaz region, located at an elevation of 277 m (909 ft) above sea level at 21\u00ba23' north latitude and 39\u00ba51' east longitude. Mecca is divided into 34 districts.\nThe city centers on the al-Haram area, which contains the Masjid al-Haram. The area around the mosque is the old city and contains the most famous district of Mecca, Ajyad. The main street that runs to al-Haram is the Ibrahim al-Khalil Street, named after Ibrahim. Traditional, historical homes built of local rock, two to three stories long are still present within the city's central area, within view of modern hotels and shopping complexes. The total area of modern Mecca today is over 1,200 km2 (460 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Elevation ===\nMecca is at an elevation of 277 m (909 ft) above sea level, and approximately 70 km (44 mi) inland from the Red Sea. It is one of the lowest in the Hejaz region.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe city center lies in a corridor between mountains, which is often called the \"Hollow of Mecca\". The area contains the valley of al-Taneem, the valley of Bakkah and the valley of Abqar. This mountainous location has defined the contemporary expansion of the city.\n\n\n=== Sources of water ===\nIn pre-modern Mecca, the city used a few chief sources of water. The first were local wells, such as the Zamzam Well, that produced generally brackish water. The second source was the spring of 'Ayn Zubaydah (Spring of Zubaydah). The sources of this spring are the mountains of Jabal Sa'd and Jabal Kabk\u0101b, which are a few kilometers east of 'Arafah/'Arafat or about 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Mecca. Water was transported from it using underground channels. A very sporadic third source was rainfall which was stored by the people in small reservoirs or cisterns. The rainfall, scant as it is, also presents the threat of flooding and has been a danger since earliest times. According to al-Kurd\u012b, there have been 89 floods by 1965. In the last century, the most severe flood was that of 1942. Since then, dams have been built to ameliorate this problem.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMecca features a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen: BWh), in three different plant hardiness zones: 10, 11 and 12. Like most Saudi Arabian cities, Mecca retains warm to hot temperatures even in winter, which can range from 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) at night to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in the afternoon, but also, very rarely, fall to zero and subzero temperatures. Summer temperatures are extremely hot and consistently break the 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) mark in the afternoon, dropping to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in the evening, but humidity remains relatively low, at 30\u201340%. Rain usually falls in Mecca in small amounts scattered between November and January, with heavy thunderstorms also common during the winter.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Meccan economy has been heavily dependent on the annual pilgrimage. Income generated from the Hajj, in fact, not only powers the Meccan economy but has historically had far-reaching effects on the economy of the entire Arabian Peninsula. The income was generated in a number of ways. One method was taxing the pilgrims. Taxes were especially increased during the Great Depression, and many of these taxes existed to as late as 1972. Another way the Hajj generates income is through services to pilgrims. For example, the Saudi flag carrier, Saudia, generates 12% of its income from the pilgrimage. Fares paid by pilgrims to reach Mecca by land also generate income; as do the hotels and lodging companies that house them. The city takes in more than $100 million, while the Saudi government spends about $50 million on services for the Hajj. There are some industries and factories in the city, but Mecca no longer plays a major role in Saudi Arabia's economy, which is mainly based on oil exports. The few industries operating in Mecca include textiles, furniture, and utensils. The majority of the economy is service-oriented.\n\nNevertheless, many industries have been set up in Mecca. Various types of enterprises that have existed since 1970 in the city include corrugated iron manufacturing, copper extraction, carpentry, upholstery, bakeries, farming and banking. The city has grown substantially in the 20th and 21st centuries, as the convenience and affordability of jet travel has increased the number of pilgrims participating in the Hajj. Thousands of Saudis are employed year-round to oversee the Hajj and staff the hotels and shops that cater to pilgrims; these workers in turn have increased the demand for housing and services. The city is now ringed by freeways, and contains shopping malls and skyscrapers.\n\n\n== Human resources ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\nFormal education started to be developed in the late Ottoman period continuing slowly into Hashemite times. The first major attempt to improve the situation was made by a Jeddah merchant, Muhammad \u02bfAl\u012b Zaynal Ri\u1e0d\u0101, who founded the Madrasat al-Fal\u0101\u1e25 in Mecca in 1911\u201312 that cost \u00a3400,000. The school system in Mecca has many public and private schools for both males and females. As of 2005, there were 532 public and private schools for males and another 681 public and private schools for female students. The medium of instruction in both public and private schools is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language, but some private schools founded by foreign entities such as International schools use the English language for medium of instruction. Some of these are coeducational while other schools are not. For higher education, the city has only one university, Umm Al-Qura University, which was established in 1949 as a college and became a public university in 1979.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nHealthcare is provided by the Saudi government free-of-charge to all pilgrims. There are ten main hospitals in Mecca:\nAjyad Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0623\u064e\u062c\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0627\u062f)\nKing Faisal Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643 \u0641\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0635\u064e\u0644 \u0628\u0650\u062d\u064e\u064a \u0671\u0644\u0634\u0651\u0634\u0647)\nKing Abdulaziz Hospital (Arabic: \u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643 \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0632 \u0628\u0650\u062d\u064e\u064a \u0671\u0644\u0640\u0632\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0647\u0650\u0631\u200e)\nAl Noor Specialist Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0646\u064f\u0651\u0648\u0652\u0631 \u0671\u0644\u062a\u064e\u0651\u062e\u064e\u0635\u064f\u0651\u0635\u0650\u064a)\nHira'a Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u062d\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621)\nMaternity and Children's Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0648\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0629 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0637\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0644)\nKing Abdullah Medical City (\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643 \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0671\u0644\u0637\u0650\u0651\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629)\nKhulais General Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u062e\u064f\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0635 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0645)\nAl Kamel General Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0650\u0644 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0645)\nIbn Sina Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0633\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u0650\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0621 / \u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0647)There are also many walk-in clinics available for both residents and pilgrims. Several temporary clinics are set up during the Hajj to tend to wounded pilgrims.\n\n\n==== Effect of the CoVID-19 pandemic ====\nIn February 2020, Saudi Arabia temporarily banned foreigners from entering Mecca and Medina to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in the Kingdom.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nMecca's culture has been affected by the large number of pilgrims that arrive annually, and thus boasts a rich cultural heritage. As a result of the vast numbers of pilgrims coming to the city each year, Mecca has become by far the most diverse city in the Muslim world. In contrast to the rest of Saudi Arabia, and particularly Najd, Mecca has, according to The New York Times, become \"a striking oasis of free thought and discussion and, also, of unlikely liberalism as Meccans see themselves as a bulwark against the creeping extremism that has overtaken much Islamic debate\".Al Baik, a local fast-food chain, is very popular among pilgrims and locals alike. Until 2018, it was available only in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah, and traveling to Jeddah just to get a taste of the fried chicken was common.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nIn pre-modern Mecca, the most common sports were impromptu wrestling and foot races. Football is now the most popular sport in Mecca and the kingdom, and the city hosts some of the oldest sport clubs in Saudi Arabia such as Al Wahda FC (established in 1945). King Abdulaziz Stadium is the largest stadium in Mecca with a capacity of 38,000.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nMecca is very densely populated. Most long-term residents of Mecca live in the Old City, the area around the Great Mosque and many work to support pilgrims, known locally as the Hajj industry. 'Iyad Madani, the Saudi Arabian Minister for Hajj, was quoted saying, \"We never stop preparing for the Hajj.\"Year-round, pilgrims stream into the city to perform the rites of 'Umrah, and during the last weeks of eleventh Islamic month, Dhu al-Qi'dah, on average 2-4 million Muslims arrive in the city to take part in the rites known as Hajj. Pilgrims are from varying ethnicities and backgrounds, mainly South and Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa. Many of these pilgrims have remained and become residents of the city. The Burmese are an older, more established community who number roughly 250,000. Adding to this, the discovery of oil in the past 50 years has brought hundreds of thousands of working immigrants.\nNon-Muslims are not permitted to enter Mecca under Saudi law, and using fraudulent documents to do so may result in arrest and prosecution. The prohibition extends to Ahmadis, as they are considered non-Muslims. Nevertheless, many non-Muslims and Ahmadis have visited the city as these restrictions are loosely enforced. The first such recorded example of a non-Muslim entering the city is that of Ludovico di Varthema of Bologna in 1503. Guru Nanak Sahib, the founder of Sikhism, visited Mecca in December 1518. One of the most famous was Richard Francis Burton, who traveled as a Qadiriyya Sufi from Afghanistan in 1853.\nMecca Province is the only province where expatriates outnumber Saudis.\n\n\n=== Architectural landmarks ===\nAdorning the southern facade of the Masjid al-Haram, the Abraj al-Bait Complex, which towers over the Great Mosque, is a seven-building complex with the central clock tower having a length of 601 m (1,972 feet), making it the world's fourth-tallest building. All seven buildings in the complex also form the third-largest building by floor area. \nThe Mecca Gate, known popularly as the Qur'an Gate, on the western entrance of the city of Mecca, or from Jeddah. Located on Highway 40, it marks the boundary of the Haram area where non-Muslims are prohibited from entering. The gate was designed in 1979 by an Egyptian architect, Samir Elabd, for the architectural firm IDEA Center. The structure is that of a book, representing the Quran, sitting on a rehal, or bookrest.\n\n\n== Communications ==\n\n\n=== Press and newspapers ===\nThe first press was brought to Mecca in 1885 by Osman Nuri Pasha, an Ottoman W\u0101li. During the Hashemite period, it was used to print the city's official gazette, Al Qibla. The Saudi regime expanded this press into a larger operation, introducing the new Saudi official gazette of Mecca, Umm al-Qur\u0101. Mecca also has its own paper owned by the city, Al Nadwa. However, other Saudi newspapers are also provided in Mecca such as the Saudi Gazette, Al Madinah, Okaz and Al Bilad, in addition to other international newspapers.\n\n\n=== TV ===\nTelecommunications in the city were emphasized early under the Saudi reign. King Abdulaziz pressed them forward as he saw them as a means of convenience and better governance. While under Hussein bin Ali, there were about 20 public telephones in the entire city; in 1936, the number jumped to 450, totaling about half the telephones in the country. During that time, telephone lines were extended to Jeddah and Ta\u2019if, but not to the capital, Riyadh. By 1985, Mecca, like other Saudi cities, possessed modern telephone, telex, radio and television communications. Many television stations serving the city area include Saudi TV1, Saudi TV2, Saudi TV Sports, Al-Ekhbariya, Arab Radio and Television Network and various cable, satellite and other specialty television providers.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nLimited radio communication was established within the Kingdom under the Hashemites. In 1929, wireless stations were set up in various towns in the region, creating a network that would become fully functional by 1932. Soon after World War II, the existing network was greatly expanded and improved. Since then, radio communication has been used extensively in directing the pilgrimage and addressing the pilgrims. This practice started in 1950, with the initiation of broadcasts on the Day of 'Arafah (9 Dhu al-Hijjah), and increased until 1957, at which time Radio Makkah became the most powerful station in the Middle East at 50 kW. Later, power was increased 9-fold to 450 kW. Music was not immediately broadcast, but gradually folk music was introduced.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe only airport even close to Mecca is the Mecca East airport, which is not active. Mecca is primarily served by King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah for international and regional connections and Ta'if Regional Airport for regional connections. To cater the large number of Hajj pilgrims, this airport has Hajj Terminal, specifically for use in the Hajj season, which can accommodate 47 planes simultaneously and can receive 3,800 pilgrims per hour during the Hajj season.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMecca, similar to Medina, lies at the junction of two of the most important highways in Saudi Arabia, Highway 40, connecting it to the important port city of Jeddah in the west and the capital of Riyadh and the other major port city, Dammam, in the east. The other, Highway 15, connects Mecca to the other holy Islamic city of Medina approximately 400 km (250 mi) in the north and onward to Tabuk and Jordan. While in the south, it connects Mecca to Abha and Jizan. Mecca is served by four ring roads, and these are very crowded compared to the three ring roads of Medina.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\nAl Masha'er Al Muqaddassah Metro\nThe Al Masha'er Al Muqaddassah Metro is a metro line in Mecca opened on 13 November 2010. The 18.1-kilometer (11.2-mile) elevated metro transports pilgrims to the holy sites of 'Arafat, Muzdalifah and Mina in the city to reduce congestion on the road and is only operational during the Hajj season. It consists of nine stations, three in each of the aforementioned towns.\n\nMecca Metro\nThe Mecca Metro, officially known as Mecca Mass Rail Transit, is a planned four-line metro system for the city. This will be in addition to the Al Masha'er Al Muqaddassah Metro which carries pilgrims.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n\n==== Intercity ====\nIn 2018, a high speed intercity rail line, part of the Haramain High Speed Rail Project, named the Haramain high-speed railway line entered operation, connecting the holy cities cities of Mecca and Medina together via Jeddah, King Abdulaziz International Airport and King Abdullah Economic City in Rabigh. The railway consists of 35 electric trains and is capable of transporting 60 million passengers annually. Each train can achieve speeds of up to 300 kmh (190 mph), traveling a total distance of 450 km (280 mi), reducing the travel time between the two cities to less than two hours. It was built by a business consortium from Spain.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMedina\nMuhammad\nJabal al-Nour\nSharifate of Mecca\nSaudi conquest of Hejaz\nAbraj al-Bait\nHajj and 'Umrah\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nthe editors of Time-Life Books.

          "While my visit was an adequate experience and I do support having an aquarium in Jeddah, I think the facilities could be less about buying gifts in the gift shop and more about how Saudi Arabia plans on saving it's reef and the eco system of the Red Sea. The fish displays were",
          "Extremely well done. Very cold with the AC on so bring a jacket. Parking is convenient. The walk through tank is incredible. Definitely worth the price. On.y open in the afternoon and evening on the weekends",
          "I expected the place to be a bit bigger to be honest. The views of fishes and the sharks were pretty cool. One recomendation would be to go when kids are in school, I had a huge headache when I leftfrom all of the screaming children everywhere!",
          "I\u2019m so glad that we have a planetarium in Jeddah. This place is amazing. They have 3 different movies that lasts for 30 minutes I think. One of them is a cartoon, for kids to enjoy. All the movies talk about space, either the planets, or the starts and so on... The issue is",

          "I'm not sure if it's still open or closed! This review is based on personal comparison with other Aquariums I have seen. This Aquarium is waste of time, occupying a strategic location of Jeddah Cornish to show limited variety of sea animals, add to that you have to pay extra",

          "It is one of the fun places to visit in jeddah for both kids and adults, it's a recommended place to visit while in Jeddah. Once you finish the inside tour of the aquarium, you will have a small tour outside with an amazing view of the Red Sea.",

          "I have visited this place for the first time with my mom and we enjoyed it, even though the tour was short and pricy compared to other aquariums outside Saudi. What I didn't like about this place is the fact that it doesn't offer any discount to teachers nor students nor elderly",

          "The most disappointing aquarium I've visited with my family, considering how expensive it is. Not surprising there were hardly any other visitors. Security staff are impolite and cleaners just stand in the middle of the walking area watching you. One to avoid.",

          "The aquarium is a must see in Jeddah as there are so few fun family activities to do. My recommendation is to make sure you check the web before visiting, you want to make sure you visit when they are having one of their dolphin shows or the entry free is not worth the price.",

        "wiki": "Ta'if (Arabic: \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0637\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0641\u064f\u200e, romanized: a\u1e6d-\u1e6c\u0101\u02beif, lit. 'The Pilgrim') is a city and governorate in the Makkah Province of Saudi Arabia. Located at an elevation of 1,879 m (6,165 ft) in the slopes of the Hejaz Mountains, which themselves are part of the Sarawat Mountains, the city has a 2020 estimated population of 688,693 people, making it the 6th most populous city in the kingdom.The origins of the name Ta'if are unclear, however, it is known that in the pre-Islamic Arabian age, Ta'if housed an idol of the goddess Lat, and was frequented by pilgrims, which could explain the name. Ta'if has been indirectly referred to in the Qur'an in verse 31 of Surah 43.[Quran 43:31] The city was visited by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, sometime in the early 7th century and was inhabited by the tribe of Banu Thaqif and is still inhabited to this day by their descendants. As a part of the Hejaz, the city has seen many transfers-of-power throughout its history, with the last being during the Saudi conquest of Hejaz in 1925.\nThe city has been called the unofficial summer capital of Saudi Arabia and has also been called the best summer destination in Saudi Arabia as it enjoys a moderate weather during summer, unlike most of the Arabian Peninsula. The city owes its popularity among tourists to its many mountain resorts and moderate climate, even during the harsh summers of Arabia. The city is connected to the nearby resort town of al-Hada via the iconic Highway 15 (Ta'if\u2013al-Hada Road). It stands out from the rest of the Hejaz region as it is a city that plays an active role in the agricultural output of Saudi Arabia and is the center of an agricultural area known for its cultivation of grapes, pomegranate, figs, roses and honey. Ta'if is also very active in the manufacturing of traditional 'Ittar, and is known locally as the City of Roses (Arabic: \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0631\u0648\u062f\u200e, romanized: Madinat al-Wurud). Ta'if also hosts the historic Souq 'Okaz\nThe Ta'if governorate is divided into 15 smaller municipalities, with Ta'if as the capital. The administration of the city itself is carried out by 5 municipalities, named North Ta'if, West Ta'if, East Ta'if, South Ta'if and New Ta'if. Ta'if is served by the Ta'if Regional Airport, with a new international airport planned to open sometime in 2020.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 6th century CE, the city of T\u0101'if was dominated by the Thaqif tribe, which still lives in and around the city of Ta'if today. It has been suggested that Jewish tribes who were displaced by Ethiopian Christians in the Himyarite Kingdom wars settled near Ta'if. The walled city was a religious centre as it housed the idol of the goddess L\u0101t, who was then known as \"the lady of T\u0101'if.\" Its climate marked the city out from its dry and barren neighbours closer to the Red Sea. Wheat, vines, and fruit were grown around T\u0101'if, and this is how the city earned its title \"the Garden of the Hejaz\". Both Ta'if and Mecca were resorts of pilgrimage. Ta'if was more pleasantly situated than Mecca itself and the people of Ta'if had close trade relations with the people of Mecca. The people of Ta'if carried on agriculture and fruit\u2011growing in addition to their trade activities.In the early 7th century, Muhammad, who was born in Makkah, preached Islam to the inhabitants of Mecca and the Hijaz, and encountered resistance from many of the people there and even at Ta'if. In 630, the Battle of Hunayn took place at Hunayn, close to the city. Shortly after that, the unsuccessful Siege of Ta'if took place. The city was assaulted by catapults from Banu Daus, but it repelled the attacks. The Battle of Tabuk in 631 left T\u0101'if completely isolated, so members of Thaq\u012bf arrived in Makkah to negotiate the conversion of the city to Islam. The idol of L\u0101t was destroyed along with all other signs of the city's pagan past.The city then went through many exchanges-of-power, but most of the action within these conflicts took place between Makkah and Medina, and Ta'if dwindled in importance in contrast to the two holy cities.\n\n\n=== Under Ottoman rule ===\nOn 17 July 1517, the Sharif of Mecca capitulated to the Ottoman Sultan Selim I. As a sign of this, he surrendered to him the keys of the Islamic cities of Mecca and Medina. As part of the Hejaz, Ta'if was also given over to Ottoman control and the city remained Ottoman for a further three centuries, until in 1802, when it was retaken by rebels allied with the House of Saud. These forces then proceeded to take Mecca and Medina. The loss was keenly felt by the Ottoman Empire, which viewed itself as the protector of the Holy Cities. The Ottoman sultan, Mahmud II, called upon the Wali of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, who launched an attack on the Hejaz and reconquered Ta'if in 1813.\nIn 1813, the Swiss traveler and orientalist Johann Ludwig Burckhardt visited Ta'if and left an eyewitness account of the city just after its recapture by the Muhammad Ali, with whom he obtained several interviews while he was there. Burckhardt reported that the wall and ditch around the city had been built by Othman el-Medhayfe. There were three gates and several towers on the city walls, which, however, were weak, being in some places only 45 cm (18 in) thick. Burckhardt stated that the castle had been built by Sharif Ghalib ibn Musa'id. He noted the destruction of the city caused by the conquest of 1802. Most of the buildings were still in ruin while he was there, and the tomb of 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas \u2013 cousin of Muhammad and ancestor of the Abbasids \u2013 had been severely damaged. He also recorded that the population of the city was still mostly Thaq\u012bfi. In terms of trade, the city was an entrep\u00f4t for coffee.\nThe castle and military barracks in Ta'if were repaired by the Ottomans in 1843, a h\u00fck\u00fbmet kona\u011f\u0131 \u2013 mansion for government business \u2013 was built in 1869, and a post office was established sometime later.\n\n\n=== Arab Revolt ===\n\nPrior to the Arab Revolt, Ahmed Bey had been made the commander of Ottoman forces in T\u0101'if. He had under him a force of 3,000 soldiers and 10 pieces of mountain artillery. Ghalib Pasha, the governor of the Hejaz was also present in the city. In 1916, the Hashemites launched their revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Mecca in June. That city had fallen and then in July, Abdullah, the eldest son of the Hashemite leader and Sharif of Mecca Husayn ibn Ali, came with seventy men to T\u0101'if. Whilst his activities in the area aroused the suspicion of Ahmed Bey, Ghalib Pasha was unconcerned by so small a force. Abdullah secretly built up his army to 5,000 men. He then cut the telegraph wires to the city and took the offensive. All Hashemite assaults on the city were repelled by the mountain guns, and both sides settled down to an uneasy siege. However, Hashemite guns were slowly brought up to T\u0101'if, and then the city held out a little longer; before finally surrendering on 22 September. The city thus later became a part of the self-proclaimed Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz.\n\n\n=== Saudi conquest and modern history ===\nTa'if did not remain in Hashemite hands for very long. Tensions between the King of the Hejaz, Husayn ibn Ali, and Abdulaziz al-Saud, the Emir of Nejd and Hasa, soon broke out into violence. Although hostilities subsided in 1919, by September 1924, the then Saudi-sponsored Ikhwan militia, under the leadership of Sultan bin Bajad and Khaled bin Luwai', was ready to attack Ta'if. The city was supposed to have been defended by the king's son, 'Ali, but he fled in panic with his troops. Three hundred of 'Ali's men were slain by the Ikhwan in what became known as the Ta'if massacre. In 1926, Abdulaziz al-Saud was officially recognized as the new King of Hejaz. Ta'if remained a part of the Kingdom of Hejaz until Abdulaziz al-Saud unified his two kingdoms and consolidated them into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1934 the treaty was signed here that established the boundary lines between Yemen and the kingdom. The king himself was later to die in the city on 9 November 1953, as did King Khalid on 13 June 1982.\nTa'if was still little more than a medieval city when the Saudis took control of it. However, they later embarked on a project of modernizing the city. Saudi Arabia's first public power generator was set up in Ta'if in the late 1940s. In terms of building roads to the isolated city, in 1965 the then King Faisal inaugurated the 54 mi (87 km) mountain highway between Mecca and Ta'if, now part of Highway 15 and known as the Taif\u2013al-Hada Road. In 1974, the approximately-650-kilometer Ta'if-Abha\u2013Jizan highway was commissioned part of the Highway 15. By the 1991 Gulf War, Ta'if was such a modern city in terms of communications that it was chosen as the site of the Rendon Group's television and radio network, which was used for communication with Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe entirety of the Ta'if governorate is situated on a raised valley surrounded by the Hejaz mountains (part of the Sarawat mountains) to the west and south. The city is situated at an elevation of 1,879 m (6,165 ft) above mean sea level. For comparison, the surrounding mountains which separate Ta'if from nearby villages such as al-Hada and ash-Shafa, range in height anywhere from 2,000-3,500 m (6,560-11,485 ft). Ta'if is known to have had many wadis with running water before, suggested by the presence of dams along many of these.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTa'if has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BWh), with hot summers and mild winters. Temperatures are not as extreme in summer as for lower-lying regions of Saudi Arabia. It is much cooler in Ta'if during the summertime than it is other parts of Saudi Arabia, particularly Riyadh. Precipitation is low, but all months see some rain, with more rain in spring and late autumn than in other months.\n\n\n== Economy & development ==\n\nHistorically, Ta'if's economy depended on agriculture and the cultivation of roses, which were traded throughout Central Asia and Transoxiana.Ta'if's modern economy is still mostly dependent on agriculture and perfumes, but an increasing diversification project has been taking place in order to combat the city's heavy dependence on these two industries. Due to the cultivation of grains such as wheat and the fruitorchards in the city, it has been called the \"garden of the Hejaz.\" The distilled rose oil from the Rosa \u00d7 damascena plant has been traditionally used as an 'ittar in the Middle East, usually as a masculine fragrance, and due to its cultivation in Ta'if, it has gained the name \"Ta'if rose.\"\n\nOn October 1, 2017, King Salman of Saudi Arabia inaugurated the \"New Ta'if\" project, a $3.9 billion project aiming at establishing a new, international airport in the city, dubbed the Ta'if International Airport, renovation and modernization of the historic Souk 'Okaz, establishment of the Oasis of Technology, which is expected to include an Antonov aircraft manufacturing and assembly plant, an industrial airport with a 3.5-km runway, a solar farm covering 25,000 square meters (269,100 sq ft) expected to produce 9.5 mW of electricity, the Residential Suburb, which is expected to include 10,000 residential units, the Industrial City, an 11 square kilometer (4.25 sq mi) industrial city with a complex for heavy, medium and light industries along with a vocational training center, and the University City, 16 square kilometer (6.2 sq mi) university projected to be built in the Saiysad National Park.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Natural landmarks ===\nAl Rudaf Park is a large natural park in South Ta'if, where trees stand amidst weathered granite rocks. The site also has a small zoo. Additionally, the park has a large lake with fountains and cannons. The Ta'if rose plantation is a complex of rose fields filled with small fragrant pink roses that are distilled into expensive Ta'if rose oil. The famous grown here is the 30-petal Damask rose (Rosa damascena trigintipetala), whose scent has been described as a robust, spicy, and dizzyingly complex scent which has been used by several luxury perfume brands, including Ormonde Jayne, Chanel, Guerlain and Herm\u00e8s. The Nuqbat al-Hamra' park near al-Hada is a large nature preserve at an elevation of 2,100 metres (6,900 feet) above sea level. ash-Shaf\u0101 is a small village situated high up in the mountains at an elevation of 2,200 to 2,500 metres (7,200 to 8,200 feet) above sea level, rich in agricultural products. The fruit gardens of Ta'if are located here. A camel ride is available, and Jabal Dakka is within view of the village. The Saiysad National Park is located in New Ta'if.\n\n\n=== Museums and historic landmarks ===\nLocated 40 km (25 mi) north of Ta'if is the site of the Souk 'Okaz, the largest and best known of the pre-Islamic souks. The souq was a scene of annual social, political and commercial gatherings. It was also the location of competitive recitation of poetry and prose. The buildings remain, including prominent outlines of walls of basaltic stone. Wadi Mitna is a wadi believed to be the location where Muhammad sought refuge from the tribes of Hawazin and Thaqif in 619 AD, after he was stoned by the tribes. He was later given sanctuary by his fellows in a small house, which has now been converted into a mosque. Shubra Palace is the regional museum of Ta'if, housed in a building built around 1900, which served as Ibn Saud's lodging in the 1930s, and was also used as the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia during King Faisal's reign. The Turkish Fort was a fort located near the Souk 'Okaz, many battles have been fought here and many prominent graves can be found, though only a small part of the original fort remains. Legend has it that Lawrence of Arabia also fought here. The Badawi Fortress is located in the southern reaches of East Ta'if.\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Souk 'Okaz, one of the best known pre-Islamic souks, was not only a market, but in many ways, a historic theater, where sociopolitical and commercial exchanges took place between the tribes of pre-Islamic Arabia. People from around the peninsula would come to visit the idol of the goddess Lat. This is proof that Ta'if has long been a historic center for trade and the arts in the Arabian Peninsula; contemporary theaters in the area include the 'Okaz Market Theater and the recently opened King 'Abdullah Park Theater. A performing arts theater is also located in the nearby town of Qia and is known as the Folk Theater of Qia.\nIn the framework of Saudi Seasons initiative, the first Ta'if Season took place on August 1, 2019. Artists from 7 countries participated in the event and a wide range of activities were overseen. Three main events have taken place during the season including the Souk 'Okaz festival and a camel race. As a sideline to the event, a rose festival in the city as well as a number of concerts and plays were held.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nLike most of Saudi Arabia, the most popular sport among Saudis in Ta'if is football. The Wej SC (Saudi Arabian Football Federation) plays at the King Fahd Sports City in North Ta'if near as-Sayl as-Saghir and is the football team representing the city. The expatriate minority in the city has brought several other games with them to Ta'if, including cricket, badminton and volleyball.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nDue to Ta'if's unique location in the mountains, most major highways bend around the city or either avoid the region completely. The only major highway in the Saudi Arabian network to pass through Ta'if is Highway 15 (known to locals as the Taif\u2013al-Hada Road) which arrives from Mecca in the west, bends around the mountains through al-Hada, passes through the center of Ta'if, and travels to Abha and Khamis Mushait via Baha and Baljurashi. Ta'if is connected to Highway 40 via Highway 267 and Highway 287. Highway 267 forms the western part of the Ta'if beltway, but then continues southward toward ash-Shafa, bypassing Mecca by using a longer route and gives access to Highway 304, Highway 301, Highway 40 and Highway 290 via Highway 298.\nTa'if is served by the Ta'if Regional Airport, and a new airport, dubbed the Ta'if International Airport, was scheduled to open in 2020, but this has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The new airport is mainly designed to cater to 'Umrah and Hajj pilgrims and to relieve pressure off the King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah.\n\n\n== Famous people ==\n\n\n=== Tribes ===\n\nThe historically well known tribe of Thaqif still lives in and around the city of Ta'if. \u2018Utaibah is another Adnani tribe which still lives in Ta'if. Banu Harith is one of the Qahtani Arabs tribes living around Ta'if in Saudi Arabia. The tribe claims a very large area around the city in the area between Ta'if and Qunfudhah in Saudi Arabia. Thu al-Isba' al-'Adwani was an Arabic poet and a man of wisdom from the Banu 'Adwan tribe that historically lived in the northern parts of Ta'if. Furthermore, Banu Thabit are people descended from Thabit and the tribe is originally part of Hawazin clan.\n\n\n=== Births in the pre-modern era ===\nPre-Islamic leaders of Banu Thaqif\nDuring the pre-Islamic era, the city was populated by the tribe of Thaqif. The city had then the following chieftains:\n\n'Urwah ibn Mas'ud\n'Abd-ya-Layl ibn 'Amr\nUthman ibn Abu al-'AasOther important Islamic figures\n\n'Uthman bin 'Affan (579\u2013656) \u2014 3rd Rashidun Caliph and son-in-law of Muhammad\nal-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf (661\u2013714) \u2014 Umayyad-era Governor of Iraq and general\nMuhammad bin Qasim (695\u2013715) \u2014 Umayyad general who conquered the Sindh and Punjab regions along the Indus River.\n\n\n=== Births in the modern era ===\nMonarchs and royals\n\nKing Faisal I of Iraq (1885-1933) \u2014 20th-century King of Syria and Iraq\nPrince Nayef bin 'Abdulaziz Al Saud (1934\u20132012) \u2014 former Crown Prince and Minister of Interior of Saudi Arabia.Others\n\nHadi Soua'an Al-Somaily (1976\u2013present) \u2014 First Saudi Olympic medal winner.\nMutlaq Hamid Al-Otaibi (1937\u201395) \u2014 poet and writer; member of the Faculty of Sharia' at the Umm al-Qura' University\nHani Hanjour (1972\u20132001) \u2014 9/11 hijacker pilot who crashed American Airlines flight 77 into The Pentagon.\n\n\n=== Deaths ===\n'Abdullah ibn Abbas (619\u2013687) \u2014 cousin of Muhammad; buried in Jannat al-Baqi', Medina\nMidhat Pasha (1822\u201383) \u2014 Ottoman grand vizier; assassinated by strangulation in prison\nIbn Saud (1875\u20131953) \u2014 founder and 1st king of the Third Saudi State, the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nKhalid of Saudi Arabia (1913\u20131982) \u2014 4th king of Saudi Arabia and son of Ibn Saud\n\n\n== See also ==\nAl-Kateb House\nBanu Jadhimah\nTa'if Agreement\n'Utaybah\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ta\u2019if at Wikimedia Commons\n Ta'if travel guide from Wikivoyage",

        "wiki": "The Great Mosque of Mecca, also known as al-Masjid al-\u1e24ar\u0101m (Arabic: \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062c\u0650\u062f\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064f\u200e, romanized: al-Masjid al-\u1e24ar\u0101m, lit. 'The Sacred Mosque'), is a mosque that surrounds the Kaaba in Mecca, in the Makkah Province of Saudi Arabia. It is a site of pilgrimage in the Hajj, which every Muslim must do at least once in their lives if able, and is also the main phase for the \u02bfUmrah, the lesser pilgrimage that can be undertaken any time of the year. The rites of both pilgrimages include circumambulating the Kaaba within the mosque. The Great Mosque includes other important significant sites, including the Black Stone, the Zamzam Well, Maqam Ibrahim, and the hills of Safa and Marwa.As of August 2020, the Great Mosque is the largest mosque and the eighth largest building in the world. The Great Mosque has undergone major renovations and expansions through the years. It has passed through the control of various caliphs, sultans and kings, and is now under the control of the King of Saudi Arabia who is titled the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Great Mosque contends with the Mosque of the Companions in the Eritrean city of Massawa and Quba Mosque in Medina as the oldest mosque. According to one set of views, Islam as a religion preceded Prophet Muhammad, representing previous prophets such as Abraham. Abraham is credited with having built the Kaaba in Mecca, and consequently its sanctuary, which according to this view is seen as the first mosque that ever existed. According to another set of views, Islam started during the lifetime of Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century CE, and so did architectural components such as the mosque. In that case, either the Mosque of the Companions or Quba Mosque would be the first mosque that was built in the history of Islam.\n\n\n=== Era of Abraham and Ishmael ===\nAccording to the Quran, Abraham together with his son Ishmael raised the foundations of a house, which has been identified by commentators as the Kaaba. God showed Abraham the exact site, very near to what is now the Well of Zamzam, where Abraham and Ishmael began work on the construction of the Kaaba. After Abraham had built the Kaaba, an angel brought to him the Black Stone, a celestial stone that, according to tradition, had fallen from Heaven on the nearby hill Abu Qubays. The Black Stone is believed to be the only remnant of the original structure made by Abraham.\nAfter placing the Black Stone in the Eastern corner of the Kaaba, Abraham received a revelation, in which God told the aged prophet that he should now go and proclaim the pilgrimage to mankind, so that men may come both from Arabia and from lands far away, on camel and on foot.\n\n\n=== Era of Muhammad ===\nUpon Muhammad's victorious return to Mecca in 630 CE, he and his cousin, Ali Ibn Abi Talib, broke the idols in and around the Kaaba, similar to what, according to the Quran, Abraham did in his homeland. Thus ended polytheistic use of the Kaaba, and began monotheistic rule over it and its sanctuary.\n\n\n=== Umayyad era ===\nThe first major renovation to the mosque took place in 692 on the orders of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. Before this renovation, which included the mosque's outer walls being raised and decoration added to the ceiling, the mosque was a small open area with the Kaaba at the center. By the end of the 8th century, the mosque's old wooden columns had been replaced with marble columns and the wings of the prayer hall had been extended on both sides along with the addition of a minaret on the orders of Al-Walid I. The spread of Islam in the Middle East and the influx of pilgrims required an almost complete rebuilding of the site which included adding more marble and three more minarets.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\nIn 1570, Sultan Selim II commissioned the chief architect Mimar Sinan to renovate the mosque. This renovation resulted in the replacement of the flat roof with domes decorated with calligraphy internally, and the placement of new support columns which are acknowledged as the earliest architectural features of the present mosque. These features are the oldest surviving parts of the building.\nDuring heavy rains and flash floods in 1621 and 1629, the walls of the Kaaba and the mosque suffered extensive damage. In 1629, during the reign of Sultan Murad IV, the mosque was renovated. In the renovation of the mosque, a new stone arcade was added, three more minarets (bringing the total to seven) were built, and the marble flooring was retiled. This was the unaltered state of the mosque for nearly three centuries.\n\n\n=== Saudi era ===\n\n\n==== First Saudi expansion ====\nThe first major renovation under the Saudi kings was done between 1955 and 1973. In this renovation, four more minarets were added, the ceiling was refurnished, and the floor was replaced with artificial stone and marble. The Mas'a gallery (As-Safa and Al-Marwah) is included in the Mosque, via roofing and enclosures. During this renovation many of the historical features built by the Ottomans, particularly the support columns, were demolished.\nOn 20 November 1979, the Great Mosque was seized by extremist insurgents who called for the overthrow of the Saudi dynasty. They took hostages and in the ensuing siege hundreds were killed. These events came as a shock to the Islamic world, as violence is strictly forbidden within the mosque.\n\n\n==== Second Saudi expansion ====\nThe second Saudi renovations under King Fahd, added a new wing and an outdoor prayer area to the mosque. The new wing, which is also for prayers, is reached through the King Fahd Gate. This extension was performed between 1982 and 1988.1988 to 2005 saw the building of more minarets, the erecting of a King's residence overlooking the mosque and more prayer area in and around the mosque itself. These developments took place simultaneously with those in Arafat, Mina and Muzdalifah. This extension also added 18 more gates, three domes corresponding in position to each gate and the installation of nearly 500 marble columns. Other modern developments added heated floors, air conditioning, escalators and a drainage system.\n\n\n==== Third Saudi expansion ====\nIn 2008, the Saudi government under King Abdullah Ibn Abdulaziz announced an expansion of the mosque, involving the expropriation of land to the north and northwest of the mosque covering 300,000 square metres (3,200,000 sq ft). At that time, the mosque covered an area of 356,800 square metres (3,841,000 sq ft) including indoor and outdoor praying spaces. 40 billion riyals (US$10.6 billion) was allocated for the expansion project.In August 2011, the government under King Abdullah announced further details of the expansion. It would cover an area of 400,000 m2 (4,300,000 sq ft) and accommodate 1.2 million worshippers, including a multi-level extension on the north side of the complex, new stairways and tunnels, a gate named after King Abdullah, and two minarets, bringing the total number of minarets to eleven. The circumambulation areas (Mataf) around the Kaaba would be expanded and all closed spaces receive air conditioning. After completion, it would raise the mosque's capacity from 770,000 to over 2.5 million worshippers. his successor King Salman launched five megaprojects as part of the overall King Abdullah Expansion Project in July 2015, covering an area of 456,000 square metres (4,910,000 sq ft). The project was carried out by the Saudi Binladin Group.On 11 September 2015, at least 111 people died and 394 were injured when a crane collapsed onto the mosque. Construction work was suspended after the incident, and remained on hold due to financial issues during the 2010s oil glut. Development was eventually restarted two years later in September 2017.On 5 March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the mosque was closed at night and the Umrah pilgrimage was suspended to limit attendance at the mosque.\n\n\n== List of former Imams and Mu'adhins ==\nImams:\n\nMu'adhins:",

        "wiki": "Al-Balad (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f\u200e) is the historical area of Jeddah, the second largest city of Saudi Arabia. Balad can literally be translated as \"The Town.\" Balad is the historic center of the City of Jeddah.Al-Balad was founded in the 7th century and historically served as the centre of Jeddah. Al-Balad's defensive walls were torn down in the 1940s. In the 1970s and 1980s, when Jeddah began to become wealthier due to the oil boom, many Jeddawis moved north, away from Al-Balad, as it reminded them of less prosperous times. Al-Balad had insufficient parking space for large cars. Its stores did not sell expensive designer clothing. Poor immigrants moved in place of the Saudi population. The municipality of Jeddah began historical preservation efforts in the 1970s. In 1991 the Municipality of Jeddah founded the Jeddah Historical Preservation Society to preserve the historical architecture and culture of Al-Balad. In 2002, US$4 million were earmarked for the preservation society. In 2009, Al-Balad was nominated by Saudi Commission for Tourism and Antiquities to be added to UNESCO's World Heritage list, and it was accepted in 2014.In order to preserve the old structures within Al-Balad, the Historical Area Preservation Department was established in 1990, hoping also to help promoting cultural tourism in the country. The Saudi Crown Prince, Muhammad bin Salman, pledged $13.33 million to restore the old city in Jeddah as there were 56 buildings in urgent need of repair.Many Jeddawis had moved away from Al-Balad by 2007; the streets of Balad were still packed with people during the month of Ramadan. Around that year the Jeddah Urban Development Company was formed to restore Al-Balad.\n\n\n== Historical neighborhoods ==\nAl-Balad is mainly divided into number of different districts:\nAl-Mazloum neighborhood: This neighborhood was named after Abdulkarim al-Barzanji, who was killed by the Ottoman government and located in the north-eastern part of area  north of Al-Alawi Street, with Dar Al-Qabal, Al-Shafi'i Mosque and Souk Al-Jamaa.\nAl-Sham neighborhood: Located in the northern part of Al-Balad which includes this neighborhood Dar al-Sarti and Dar al-Zahid.\nAl-Yemen neighborhood: Located in the southern part of Al-Balad south of Al-Alawi Street and gained its name towards the country of Yemen , it includes Dar Al-Nassif, Dar Al-Jumjum, Dar Al-Shaarawi and Dar Al-Abdul-Samad.\nAl-Bahr neighborhood: Located in the south-western part of Jeddah, overlooking the sea and the Dar Al-Radwan House, known at the time as the Radwan of Sea.\n\n\n== Historical houses ==\nAmong the most famous and oldest buildings to date are the Al Nassif House and Al Jamjoom House in Yemen neighborhood, Al Baqshan House, Al Qabal Mosque, Al Shafi'i Mosque in Al Mazloum, Dar Al Banaja and Al Zahed Houses in the Al Sham neighborhood. Some of these buildings have risen to more than 30 meters. Their construction is still in good condition after decades.Jeddah Old City is a home for 500-year-old buildings that are now subject to restoration as the Saudi crown prince Muhammad bin Salman pledged an amount of $13.3 million to restore 56 buildings. The restoration project will be implemented by the Ministry of Culture. The aim of the project is to boost the artistic culture in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n== Non\u2013Muslim Cemetery ==\nThe Non\u2013Muslim Cemetery (formerly known as the Christian Cemetery) is located on the King Fahd Branch Road in Al-Balad. The cemetery is hidden from sight by a wall and high trees. The supervision of the site is the responsibility of Western consulates in Jeddah.The cemetery contains more than 400 graves, including a sarcophagus dedicated to the French explorer Charles Huber and a single Commonwealth War Graves Commission gravestone for a British soldier of the Second World War. Cyril Ousman, the British Vice-consul of Jeddah who was shot and killed by Prince Mishari bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is also buried here. Recent burials have been rare and infrequent, and are mostly of Indian and Filipino children.The cemetery has exsistened since the 16th century when it was used to bury Portuguese casualties resulting from the Ottoman\u2013Portuguese wars. The walls of the cemetery may have been built by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in the aftermath of the Ottoman-Saudi wars of the 1810s. The cemetery was vandalised following the Battle of Jeddah in 1925.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== \u201cMisk Historic Jeddah\u201d Initiative ==\n\nIt is an annual event that takes place at Jeddah\u2019s historical area. The main aim of the event is to highlight the historical and cultural significance of AL-Balad. During the event, visitors walk through the old streets and alleys. Moreover, the initiative organizes a number of traditional entertainment activities for kids and adults. Being part of the Jeddah Season touristic festival 2019, AL-Balad hosted a number of events, all of which are organized under the title \" Kanz Al-Balad\". Kanz AL-Balad is a scavenger hunt in which participants are asked to find particular places or objects. Along the game, participants can enjoy attending more than 41 shows and plays in the area.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBradley, John R. Saudi Arabia Exposed: Inside a Kingdom in Crisis.

        "wiki": "Jeddah (English:  JED-\u0259), also spelled Jedda, Jiddah or Jidda ( JID-\u0259; Arabic: \u062c\u062f\u0629\u200e, romanized: Jidda, Hejazi pronunciation: [\u02c8d\u0292\u026ad.da]), is a city in the Hejaz region of Saudi Arabia and the country's commercial center. With a population of about 3 million and half people (as of 2020), Jeddah is the largest city in Makkah Province, the second-largest in Saudi Arabia (after the capital Riyadh), and the tenth-largest in the Arab world. Jeddah Islamic Port, located on the Red Sea, is the second-largest and second-busiest seaport in the Arab world (after Dubai's Port of Jebel Ali).\nJeddah is the principal gateway to Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, located just 65 kilometres (40 mi) to the east, while Medina, the second-holiest city, is located 360 kilometres (220 mi) to the north.\nEconomically, Jeddah is focusing on further developing capital investment in scientific and engineering leadership within Saudi Arabia, and the Middle East. Jeddah was independently ranked fourth in the Africa \u2013 Mid-East region in terms of innovation in 2009 in the Innovation Cities Index.Jeddah is of Saudi Arabia's primary resort cities and was named a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC). Given the city's close proximity to the Red Sea, fishing and seafood dominates the food culture unlike other parts of the country. In Arabic, the city's motto is \"Jeddah Ghair\", which translates to \"Jeddah is different\". The motto has been widely used among both locals as well as foreign visitors. The city had been previously perceived as the \"most open\" city in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n== Etymology and spelling ==\nThere are at least two explanations for the etymology of the name Jeddah, according to Jeddah Ibn Al-Qudaa'iy, the chief of the Quda'a clan. The more common account has it that the name is derived from \u062c\u062f\u0629 Jaddah, the Arabic word for \"grandmother\". According to eastern folk belief, the tomb of Eve, considered the grandmother of humanity, is located in Jeddah. The tomb was sealed with concrete by religious authorities in 1975 due to some Muslims praying at the site.\nThe Berber traveler Ibn Battuta visited Jeddah during his world trip in around 1330. He wrote the name of the city into his diary as \"Jiddah\".The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and other branches of the British government formerly used the older spelling of \"Jedda\", contrary to other English-speaking usage, but in 2007, it changed to the spelling \"Jeddah\".T. E. Lawrence felt that any transcription of Arabic names into English was arbitrary. In his book, Revolt in the Desert, Jeddah is spelled three different ways on the first page alone.On official Saudi maps and documents, the city name is transcribed \"Jeddah\", which is now the prevailing usage.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSome archaeologists' studies suggest the existence of inhabitants in the region now known as Jeddah since the Stone Age seeing as they found some artifacts and 'Thamoudian' writings in Wadi (valley) Breiman east of Jeddah and Wadi Boib northeast of Jeddah. Some historians trace its founding to the tribe of Bani Quda'ah, who inhabited it after the collapse of Sad (dam) Ma'rib in 115 BC. Some believe that Jeddah had been inhabited before the tribe of Bani Quda'ah by fishermen in the Red Sea, who considered it a center from which they sailed out into the sea as well as a place for relaxation and well-being. According to some accounts, the history of Jeddah dates back to early times before Alexander the Great, who visited the city between 323 and 356 BC.\n\n\n=== Pre-Islam ===\nExcavations in the old city suggest that Jeddah was founded as a fishing hamlet in 522 BC by the Yemeni Quda'a tribe (\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0642\u0636\u0627\u0639\u0629), who left central Yemen to settle in Makkah after the destruction of the Marib Dam in Yemen.Other archaeological studies have shown that the area was settled earlier by people in the Stone Age, as some Thamudi scripts were excavated in Wadi Briman (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646), east of the city, and Wadi Boweb (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0648\u064a\u0628), northwest of the city. The city of Jeddah was an important port in the Nabataean frankincense trade. The oldest Mashrabiya found in Jeddah dates back to the pre-Islamic era.\n\n\n=== Rashidun Caliphate ===\nJeddah first achieved prominence around AD 647, when the third Muslim Caliph, Uthman Ibn Affan, turned it into a port making it the port of Makkah instead of Al Shoaiba port south west of Mecca.\nIn AD 703 Jeddah was briefly occupied by pirates from the Kingdom of Axum. Jeddah has been established as the main city of the historic Hijaz province and a historic port for pilgrims arriving by sea to perform their Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca.\n\n\n=== Umayyad Caliphate ===\nUmayyads inherited the entire Rashidun Caliphate including Hejaz and ruled from 661AD to 750AD. No historic records mention important events taking place in Jeddah during this period of history.\nHowever, Jeddah has remained as key civilian harbor, serving fishermen and sea travelling pilgrims to Hajj. it is also believed that Sharifdom of Mecca; an honorary Viceroy to the holyland. was first appointed in this period of the Islamic Caliphate.\n\n\n=== Abbasid Caliphate ===\nAbbassids, the new superpower, became the new successor to the Umayyad. In 750 the Abbasid Revolution successfully took control of almost the whole Umayyad Empire, excluding Morocco (Maghrib) and Spain (Al-Andalus). The Caliphate of Baghdad kept expanding and ruled until 1258, while Hejaz only remained under the Abbasid throne until 876, when the Tulunids of Egypt gained control of the Emirate of Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Hejaz.\n\n\n=== Tulunid Wilayah and Ikhshidid Wilayah ===\nThe power struggle between Tulunid Governors and Abbasid over Hejaz lasted for 30 years when the Tulunids finally withdrew from Arabia in 900 AD.\nIn 930 AD, main Hejazi cities Medina, Mecca and Taif were heavily sacked by Qarmatians. However, it is not historically confirmed that Jeddah itself was attacked by Qarmatians.\nHowever, Ikhshidids Governors of Abbasids, the new power in Egypt took control of Hejaz in early 935. No historic records details the even during Ikhshidids rule of Hejaz.\nJeddah was still unfortified and without walls at this point of time.\n\n\n=== Fatimid Caliphate ===\nIn the 969 AD, the Fatimids from Algeria took control in Egypt from the Ikhshidid Governors of Abbasids and expanded their empire to the surrounding regions, including The Hijaz and Jeddah. The Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean through the Red Sea. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to China and its Song Dynasty, which eventually determined the economic course of Tihamah during the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Ayyubid Empire ===\nAfter Saladin's conquest of Jerusalem, in 1171 he proclaimed himself sultan of Egypt, after dissolving the Fatimid Caliphate upon the death of al-Adid, thus establishing the Ayyubid dynasty. Ayyubid conquests in Hejaz included Jeddah, which joined the Ayyubid Empire in 1177 during the leadership of Sharif Ibn Abul-Hashim Al-Thalab (1094\u20131201). During their relatively short-lived tenure, the Ayyubids ushered in an era of economic prosperity in the lands they ruled and the facilities and patronage provided by the Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in the Islamic world. This period was also marked by an Ayyubid process of vigorously strengthening Sunni Muslim dominance in the region by constructing numerous madrasas (Islamic schools) in their major cities. Jeddah attracted Muslim sailors and merchants from Sindh, Southeast Asia and East Africa, and other distant regions.\n\n\n=== Mamluk Sultanate ===\nIn 1254, following events in Cairo and the dissolution of the Ayyubid Empire, Hijaz became a part of the Mamluk Sultanate. The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, having found his way around the Cape and obtained pilots from the coast of Zanzibar in AD 1497, pushed his way across the Indian Ocean to the shores of Malabar and Calicut, attacked fleets that carried freight and Muslim pilgrims from India to the Red Sea, and struck terror into the surrounding potentates. The Princes of Gujarat and Yemen turned for help to Egypt. Sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri accordingly fitted out a fleet of 50 vessels under his Admiral, Hussein the Kurd. Jeddah was soon fortified with a stone wall, using forced labor, as a harbor of refuge from the Portuguese, allowing Arabia and the Red Sea to be protected. Parts of the city wall still survive today in the old city. Even though the Portuguese were successfully repelled from the city, fleets in the Indian Ocean were at their mercy. This was evidenced by the Battle of Diu between the Portuguese and the Arab Mamluks. The Portuguese soldiers' cemetery can still be found within the old city today and is referred to as the site of the Christian Graves.\n\n\n=== Ottoman Empire ===\n\nIn 1517, the Ottoman Turks conquered the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, during the reign of Selim I. As territories of the Mamluk Sultanate, the Hijaz, including Jeddah and the holy city of Mecca, passed into Ottoman possession. The Ottomans rebuilt the weak walls of Jeddah in 1525 following the defense of the city against the Lopo Soares de Albergaria's Armada arriving from the Red Sea. The new Turkish wall included six watchtowers and six city gates. They were constructed to defend against the Portuguese attack. Of the six gates, the Gate of Mecca was the eastern gate and the Gate of Al-Magharibah, facing the port, was the western gate. The Gate of Sharif faced south. The other gates were the Gate of Al-Bunt, Gate of Al-Sham (also called Gate of Al-Sharaf) and Gate of Medina, facing north. The Turks also built The Qishla of Jeddah, a small castle for the city soldiers. In the 19th century these seven gates were minimized into four giant gates with four towers. These giant gates were the Gate of Sham to the north, the Gate of Mecca to the east, the Gate of Sharif to the south, and the Gate of Al-Magharibah on the sea side.\nAhmed Al-Jazzar, the Ottoman military man mainly known for his role in the Siege of Acre, spent the earlier part of his career at Jeddah. In Jeddah in 1750, he killed some seventy rioting nomads in retaliation for the killing of his commander, Abdullah Beg, earning him the nickname \"Jezzar\" (butcher).\nOn 15 June 1858, rioting in the city, believed to have been instigated by a former police chief in reaction to British policy in the Red Sea, led to the massacre of 25 Christians, including the British and French consuls, members of their families, and wealthy Greek merchants. The British frigate HMS Cyclops, anchored at port, bombarded the city for two days in retaliation.\n\n\n=== First Saudi State and Ottoman\u2013Saudi War ===\n\nIn 1802, Nejdi forces conquered both Mecca and Jeddah from the Ottomans. When Sharif Ghalib Efendi informed Sultan Mahmud II of this, the Sultan ordered his Egyptian viceroy Muhammad Ali Pasha to retake the city. Muhammad Ali successfully regained the city in the Battle of Jeddah in 1813.\n\n\n=== World War I and the Hashemite Kingdom ===\n\nDuring World War I, Sharif Hussein bin Ali declared a revolt against the Ottoman Empire, seeking independence from the Ottoman Turks and the creation of a single unified Arab state spanning from Aleppo in Syria to Aden in Yemen.\nKing Hussein declared the Kingdom of Hejaz. Later, Hussein was involved in war with Ibn Saud, who was the Sultan of Nejd. Hussein abdicated following the fall of Mecca, in December 1924, and his son Ali bin Hussein became the new king.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ===\n\nA few months later, Ibn Saud, whose clan originated in the central Nejd province, conquered Medina and Jeddah via an agreement with Jeddans following the Second Battle of Jeddah. He deposed Ali bin Hussein, who fled to Baghdad, eventually settling in Amman, Jordan, where his descendants became part of its Hashemite royalty.\nAs a result, Jeddah came under the sway of the Al-Saud dynasty in December 1925. In 1926, Ibn Saud added the title King of Hejaz to his position of Sultan of Nejd. Today, Jeddah has lost its historical role in peninsular politics after Jeddah fell within the new province of Makkah, whose provincial capital is the city of Mecca.\nFrom 1928 to 1932, the new Khuzam Palace was built as the new residence of King Abdul Aziz in Jeddah. The palace lies south of the old walled city and was constructed under the supervision of the engineer Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. After 1963, the palace was used as a royal guest house; since 1995, it has housed the Regional Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography.The remaining walls and gates of the old city were demolished in 1947. A fire in 1982 destroyed some ancient buildings in the old town center, called Al-Balad, but much is still preserved despite the commercial interest to tear down old houses (Naseef House, Gabil House) and build modern high-rise buildings. A house-by-house survey of the old districts was made in 1979, showing that some 1000 traditional buildings still existed, though the number of structures with great historic value was far less. In 1990, a Jeddah Historical Area Preservation Department was founded.The modern city has expanded wildly beyond its old boundaries. The built-up area expanded mainly to the north along the Red Sea coastline, reaching the new airport during the 1990s and since edging its way around it toward the Ob'hur Creek, some 27 km (17 mi) from the old city center.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nJeddah is located in Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coastal plain (called Tihamah). Jeddah lies in the Hijazi Tihama (Arabic: \u062a\u0647\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0627\u0632) region which is in the lower Hijaz mountains. Historically, politically and culturally, Jeddah was a major city of Hejaz Vilayet, the Kingdom of Hejaz and other regional political entities according to Hijazi history books.

Even before being designated the port city for Mecca, Jeddah was a trading hub for the region. In the 19th century, goods such as mother-of-pearl, tortoise shells, frankincense, and spices were routinely exported from the city. Apart from this, many imports into the city were destined for further transit to the Suez, Africa, or Europe. Many goods passing through Jeddah could not even be found in the city or even in Arabia.All of the capitals of the Middle East and North Africa are within two hours flying distance of Jeddah, making it the second commercial center of the Middle East after Dubai.Also, Jeddah's industrial district is the fourth largest industrial city in Saudi Arabia after Riyadh, Jubail and Yanbu.\n\n\n=== King Abdullah Street ===\n\nKing Abdullah Street is one of the most important streets in Jeddah and runs from King Fahd Road by the waterfront in the west of Jeddah to the eastern end of the city.

As a result, Jeddah contains a large number of modern open-air sculptures and works of art, typically situated in roundabouts, making the city one of the largest open-air art galleries in the world. Sculptures include works by Jean/Hans Arp, C\u00e9sar Baldaccini, Alexander Calder, Henry Moore, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Victor Vasarely. They often depict traditional Saudi items such as coffee pots, incense burners, palm trees, etc. The fact that Islamic tradition prohibits the depiction of living creatures, notably the human form, has made for some very creative, as well as bizarre, modern art. These include a giant geometry set, a giant bicycle, and a huge block of concrete with several cars protruding from it at odd angles and a monumental sculpture by Aref Rayess called \"Swords of God (Soyuf Allah)\".\n\n\n=== Museums and collections ===\nThere are about a dozen museums or collections in Jeddah, with varied educational aims and professionalism.

The airport has four passenger terminals. One is the Hajj Terminal, a special outdoor terminal covered by large white tents, which was constructed to handle the more than two million pilgrims who pass through the airport during the Hajj season. The Southern Terminal is used by Saudia and Flynas (both based in Saudi Arabia), while the Northern Terminal serves foreign airlines. A plan for the extension of the airport is being developed. The Royal Terminal is a special terminal reserved for VIPs, foreign kings and presidents, and the Saudi royal family.

The group was led by Fayez ibn Awwad Al-Jeheni, a former member of Saudi religious police. Two other assailants were subsequently identified by the Saudi authorities as residents of Jeddah's Al-Jamia suburb and other slums on Saudi Arabia's increasingly urbanised west coast. Buildings were attacked, hostages taken and used as human shields, and the U.S. and non-U.S. staff were under siege, although the chancery/consular section building itself was never penetrated. Closed circuit video feeds documented that the Saudi security personnel assigned to protect the facility fled when the vehicle holding the terrorists pulled up to the front gate and ran past the Delta barrier. Inside the compound, however, an armed Saudi security guard employed by the embassy shot and killed one terrorist before being fatally shot himself.\nThe attackers spread and ignited a flammable liquid on the front of the chancery building, and opened fire on the front doors, both of which actions did not have any penetrating effect. The Consulate's U.S. Marines released tear gas in front of the chancery building, but the terrorists had already left that location. More than an hour later, Saudi special forces made it through traffic and, along with others from their unit who arrived in a helicopter, fought to retake the compound. Two of the terrorists were killed in the final fight, with another dying later in hospital and the final militant being captured alive. Four Saudi special forces and a further 10 hostages were wounded in the crossfire.The five Foreign Service National employees who died during the terrorist attack were Ali Yaslem Bin Talib, Imad e-Deen Musa Ali, Romeo de la Rosa, Mohammed Baheer Uddin and Jaufar Sadik. The casualties came from Yemen, Sudan, Philippines, India and Sri Lanka.The attack underscores the ongoing vulnerabilities of Westerners to threats and terrorist actions in Jeddah and environs. In a communiqu\u00e9 posted in online publications such as Sawt al-Jihad (Voice of Jihad) and Mu'askar al-Battar (Al-Battar Training Camp), Al-Qaeda hinted at the symbolic nature of the U.S. Consulate attack, stating: \"Know that the Mujahideen are determined to continue on their path, and they will not be weakened by what has happened to them.\"Terrorist activities have persisted from 2004 to the present day. In 2004 there was an unsuccessful shooting attack on a U.S. Marine visiting the Saudi American Bank and an attempt to simultaneously explode car bombs at Saudi American Bank and Saudi British Bank branches in Jeddah on the anniversary of the 2001 \"9-11\" terrorist attacks on the U.S. On 26 August 2012, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry announced that terrorists were arrested in Jeddah who had been preparing explosives for attacks within the kingdom.\n\n\n=== Traffic ===\nRoads and highways within and exiting the city are frequently clogged with traffic. Mass transit is rare and planning is nascent; most Jeddawi adults have at least one car. Motorcycles are rare on the roads, further impacting the traffic patterns. Days immediately preceding and following the holy days are particularly noisome and cost hundreds of thousands many hours because of traffic jams. The Saudi Gazette reports that there is a plan in the works to tackle the traffic issue. A reported 3 billion Saudi Riyals will be put into constructing flyovers and underpasses in an effort to expedite traffic. The plan is scheduled to take about five years from its start to finish.\n\n\n=== Sewage ===\nPrior to the construction of a waste treatment plant, Jeddah's waste water was disposed of by either discharge into the sea or via absorption into deep underground pits. As the city grew, a proper waste management plant was created and the built up part of the city was connected with a sewer system by the 1970s. However, even with the ever-increasing population, the original sewer system has hardly been expanded. The original plant cannot cope with the amount of waste inundating it daily. As a result, some untreated sewage is discharged directly into the sea and the entire northern part of the city remains completely unconnected to the sewage system, instead relying on septic tanks. This has been responsible for the large number of sewage tankers.\nIn late 2011, a storm drainage system was built in the south Jeddah area (similar to that of the Los Angeles storm drain) to reduce the risk of floods.\n\n\n=== Floods ===\n\nOn 25 November 2009, heavy floods affected the city and other areas of Makkah Province. The floods were described by civil defence officials as the worst in 27 years. As of 26 November 2009, 77 people were reported to have been killed, and more than 350 were missing. Some roads were under a metre (three feet) of water on 26 November, and many of the victims were believed to have drowned in their cars. At least 3,000 vehicles were swept away or damaged. The death toll was expected to rise as flood waters receded, allowing rescuers to reach stranded vehicles.\n\nOn 26 January 2011, again, heavy floods affected the city and other areas of Makkah Province. The cumulative rainfall exceeded the 90 mm (3.5 in) recorded in four hours during the 25 November 2009 flash floods. Streets including Palestine Street, Madinah Road and Wali Al-Ahad Street were either flooded or jammed with traffic. Cars were seen floating in some places. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses told local newspaper Arab News that East Jeddah was swamped and floodwater was rushing west towards the Red Sea, turning streets into rivers once again.\nOn 17 November 2015, heavy floods affected the city. Streets affected by the flood include Palestine Street, Madinah Road and many others. Cars were seen burning, and many trees fell as a result of the violent flood. 3 deaths were also reported. 2 of the fatalities (including a child) were hit by lightning while crossing a street.\nOn 21 November 2017, heavy floods affected the city once more and Jeddah Islamic Port stopped operations for about 3 hours. Jeddah police received 11,000 phone calls on 911 from people enquiring about alternative roads and weather conditions. There were 250 reports of electrocution. Five people were electrocuted, two died.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nMetropolitan Jeddah comprises 137 districts:\n(transliterated from Arabic)\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nJeddah has 35 sister cities (or \"twin towns\") which are selected based on economic, cultural and political criteria.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBibliography of the history of Jeddah\nList of cities and towns in Saudi Arabia\nKhobar\nAbha\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of Jeddah Official municipality website (in Arabic)\nPrincipality of Jeddah Official Jeddah principality website (in Arabic)\nCity of Jeddah Official website (in English)\nAbout Jeddah Informational website about Jeddah (in English)\nJeddah Jobs Jobs in Jeddah\nJeddah City Guide Jeddah City Guide\nSculptures of Jeddah Website detailing the Sculptures in Jeddah (in English)\n\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a - \u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u062c\u062f\u0629 Jeddah Saudi Arabia",

          "I have visited this place for the first time with my mom and we enjoyed it, even though the tour was short and pricy compared to other aquariums outside Saudi. What I didn't like about this place is the fact that it doesn't offer any discount to teachers nor students nor elderly",

          "One big step in the right direction. It is about time to have something like this in Jeddah. A very well built aquarium, and nice restaurant and with dolphins show too !! It is a must see attraction in Jeddah. I recommend full day tour.",
          "Its really a great place. When compared to the one in Dubai, it lacks something and otherwise in the price point of view, quite worth it if you opt not to watch the dolphin show. :)",

          "The most disappointing aquarium I've visited with my family, considering how expensive it is. Not surprising there were hardly any other visitors. Security staff are impolite and cleaners just stand in the middle of the walking area watching you. One to avoid.",
          "It was a cute adventure inside and very recommendable to children for educational trips. Just take note on Family Days because bachelors (singles) are not allowed to enter.",
          "I have been to Dubai mall and aquarium and to Fakieh aquarium too, size wise Dubai is much bigger, but variety and details are more in Fakieh aquarium in Jeddah. Also they have Dolphin show in the Aquarium.",

          "The aquarium is a must see in Jeddah as there are so few fun family activities to do. My recommendation is to make sure you check the web before visiting, you want to make sure you visit when they are having one of their dolphin shows or the entry free is not worth the price.",
          "singles are not allowed to go in, it is about having a family before going inside. I struggled to return my money back",
          "It was very good and unique. I just wished if it was a little bigger than it is and that there are more creatures.",

          "This place is a must whenever you are in Jeddah. Aside from fewer attractions for the tourist, this is one of the best place to watch the sunset. The Fakieh Aquarium is just like any other Ocean Parks in the world, if course you will be able to see the fishes especially the one",
          "We have watched over the years as the development of this Aquarium stopped & started, with the building standing empty for years. Since it opened, it has contributed something special to family orientated activities. It is located on the shore of the Red Sea on the Jeddah",

          "Jeddah is an historic city with much to offer. Unfortunately, the country is run by ignorant fools who believe in repression as a way of life. Poverty is visible everywhere.",
          "The earth globe is placed in the middle of a roundabout of a busy road. It must be seen in the night time to enjoy and identify the different areas of the world, in the daytime, it shows a round figure.",
          "Sometimes a little feature can change the look of a other wise dull area. The globe on this roundabout certainly does that. A simple roundabout, with a globe feature in the middle that is surrounded by Saudi flags. Looks the part.",
          "It may be very usual to see monuments in roundabouts, but this one is very popular among Jeddah citizens.",
          "The square looks very nice and well organized. You can go to different destinations in Jeddah using the roads beside this square. It is so useful if you want to describe to a friend going to Jeddah and passing by that square.",
          "No need to go there for a photo, You can find dozens of photos via google. Passing this on my way to Abhur from the city center.",
          "Was there in the early evening around sunset time. Not easy to get to, even with the \"crosswalk\" markings. As there are no real crossing phases to get to the roundabout. It is located near Roshan Mall, so parking is free and easy. There is a crecent moon on the roundabout too.",
          "Saudi Arabia apparently likes to build things in the middle of its roundabouts. The topics are quite varied, and this is one of them.",
          "Nice round about very beautiful at night and near to the beach and Rushan mall its on king's road which is one of the best streets of Jeddah",
          "Its a globe in a roundabout. Don\u2019t stare too long or you might crash. On the road to and from Obhur. Near the public beach",
          "I regularly visit Jeddah for many years now and nearly in each visit I pass by this roundabout. Originally when the roundabout was built it was beautiful. However, as time has passed NO maintenance as been done to the roundabout especially in regards to changing the lights",
          "in Jeddah you can easily share location to anyone new to Jeddah by its roundabout. Globe roundabout is one of the famous and iconic roundabout in Jeddah. located in malik road close to roshan mall. very huge.",

          "I discovered this on one of my early drives after moving to Jeddah for work. A very unique piece of art in the center of a typical roundabout. It is surrounded by Saudi Arabian flags and is quite a sight, but keep your eyes on the road if driving.",

          "Excellent view specially during night & it is very close to very big shopping mall (Red Sea mall Cornesh).",
          "Nothing to say about roundabout, they're definitively helpful to keep traffic fluid and people respectful. You could also state that they are saving lives and none will tell you're wrong. What I would not say, though, is that a roundabout is a turistic attraction, not only since",
          "I cannot believe that some of the top tourist sites in Jeddah are roundabouts with a globe, a bicycle, a fist, and other large and unusual items. Even a flagpole and jet of water feature highly. Come on people, it's a roundabout!! But yet people are reviewing this. Are tourist",
          "One of the best roundabouts I've seen. Great views from fudruckers in roshan mall. Makes you reflect on the world and appreciate what you have.",

          "Near the corniche, not a must visit though. It is a roundabout and there is nothing much to do apart from that. Good glimpse if you are travelling through the road.",

          "Living up to it's name as Land of the Roundabouts, one will definitely not miss the Globle roundabout along Andalus/Malik Fahad road in front of Roashan Mall in Jeddah. This is such a beautiful site at night most specially if you are trapped with the traffic. Once the globe",

          "This is one if it is kind. This was built in 1980s but well maintained by jeddah chamber of commerce.. The problem it is very difficult to park and cross the road to enjoy the glass art of the globe roundabout.. Lighting is very nice at night",

          "This is just a roundabout, not an attraction! It looks great during the night, and could be a nice idea to take some pictures, but you can't get closer due to the traffic signs!",
          "Globe Roundabout is an intersection of Alsalam road and King Abdul Aziz road was created med seventies. Base on size of the globe it's the biggest in the world. Viewing the globe would be better at night because of the lights inside and outside the globe",

          "This Big Globe and a moon in the middle of a busy circular intersection with Traffic lights. It is located when Al Malek (King) street {bind south north Jeddah} crosses Al Salam (Peace) Street {east Jeddah or the Airport to the west or the sea Cornish}. As you can not stop and",

          "Globe Roundabout in Jeddah is a major landmark along Prince Sultan rd in close proximity of Red Sea Mall. Nice experience at night when it is illuminated.",
          "As the name says this is just a roundabout on one of the main avenues between Jeddah's city centre and the airport. Though the globe is a distinctive landmark and it looks nice at night when it illuminated this is just something you see from your car as you drive by.",
          "Jeddah seems to have lots of these large roundabout monuments! They're pretty cool, but you really should be concentrating on the road if you're dealing with Jeddah's traffic!",
          "mmm well you may think so what but it is different and quite cool. Only in Jeddah. The people are chilled so is the globe.",
          "I go passing this Roundabout every day. one of the very creative monument. if it has internal lights it could be the best in Jeddah. with out maintenance and cleaning covered with full of dust the value is ruined. City Coluncill should open it eyes on such attractions.and end",
          "It's fun to drive around and spot all the great monuments on the Jeddah roundabouts. This is one of my favorites. It is just a roundabout, but sometimes we drive around it several times before exiting, just to enjoy the monument and get a photo.",
          "I am surprised somebody actually nominated this place on Tripadvisor. It is a medium sized roundabout on a main road of Jeddah which happens to have some funny object in the middle rather than some ornamental plants. You cant get out from your car and take selfies with the globe",
          "A beautiful round about in Kings road and it's near many attractions, rocha not mall is just next to it and if you go west it's will take you to the corniche, east to the airport and madinah road and not far away is the huge Red Sea mall",
          "This giant globe always i noticed, when travel in King road. We can enjoy the beauty of this statue from car.",
          "It is a roundabout and a quick shot can be done as you drive pass it. Nothing fancy or special about this place. Located just outside Roshan Mall.",
          "it is on a roundabout, need to be ready t take a photo due to the traffic, just see on my trip.... that is all",
          "Probably more interesting during the night than during the day. In the daylight it looks dirty. Anyway it is one of the interesting sculpture in Jeddah among the street art.",
          "It is beautiful but it is dim most of the time. It needs to be washed. No place to sit or relax around.",
          "Stain glass with steel glob structure... looks huge from a short distance... has lights from inside... it is famous being one of Jeddah signs...",
          "Jeddah is well known for it's street artwork - this one is really pretty - close to Roshan Mall - at night it is all lit up - and you can see different colors of the continents - awesome!",
          "Not as impressive as some of the other monuments in Jeddah. There are over 400 monuments throughout Jeddah.",
          "One of the trademarks of the city of Jeddah were these landmarks in roundabouts. Many are gone these days replaced by bridges or tunnels to facilitate the growing city. It was an identity that needs to be preserved",
          "Just a globe on the street, nothing special about it. This should not be an attraction on TripAdvisor.",
          "very boring nothing special even its not historical attaching place its newly made not recommended to go the you can see it if you passing by when you go to obhur.",
          "This roundabout is a unique landmark of North Jeddah. \u0130t's located on King Abdulaziz Street; north to Heraa Street. It's very nice to watch the globe lighting in the evening. Rosshan Mall and Red Sea Mall are very close from this location.",
          "It's one of the many unique street architectures of Jeddah. It's pleasing to the eyes especially during the night due to it's colorful lights depicted like the actual Earth.",
          "Sevral briges and tunnels are to be constructed at the white horse roundabout and industrial institute street,in addition to upgrading the road network to facilitate traffic movement across intersections and main roundabout in the jeddah city. Art and architecture lover I am",
          "Boring!!!!! Can not get excited about a huge gawdy Globe that lights up at night. It is at a roundabout en route to Red Sea Mall. I would never make a special trip there!",
          "Times definitely have changed. When I was a kid, going to this roundabout with my dad was fun. And it was basically in the middle of no where. No traffic and not many businesses going on around that area. Today, it's a non stopping traffic surrounded by lots of residential and",
          "Its a big piece of art. located in a middle of a round square here you can see taking a trip around. Good to promote art but nothing else. If you pass around ... you will look ..",
          "its Roundabout on King Abdul Aziz Road. nice to see it on the way but not worth it to make a spacial visit.",
          "It just a round about. It was marvelous when it was first constructed. It is dangourous to cross traffic to go up and take photos. It is good to see if you are driving north on Malek road.",
          "Sitting in the middle of a huge traffic roundabout this is very impressive and quite beautiful as well as being creative.",
          "I like Jeddah in general but the busy roundabouts do not make it easier to travel around the city. try to avoid it as much as possible.",
          "This is a true piece of art mega size! One of the most beautiful works of art in Jeddah's open art museum. Best visit in the early hours to avoid the annoying traffic.",
          "This is not a tourist attraction in the sense you can go and touch it as It is on a roundabout; however, I think it's a nice idea to have impressive landmarks or monuments on the roundabouts, and this one was not bad at all. To me it didn't look that is hasn't got any",
          "It's just a roundabout. There is nothing more to it. It's just a roundabout. During the day it looks normal but at night it looks really nice and that's it.",
          "it is just a big globe on the street round about, which has no proper maintenance and is covered with dust and nothing attractive or unique to see",
          "Er, is this really a tourist attraction? It's a round about with a ball on it that lights up. Not exactly worth a visit is it. Jeddah, I'm sure you can do better than this...",
          "When you are close to it thats north of jeddah Eastern side corniche jeddah From north jeddah greek Have a nice day Enjoy jeddah",
          "i think it is the biggest round about in Jeddah city it made like a peace of art , located in the way of obhur area",
          "Globe roundabout situated on the way to Cornish, fantastic see in the evening very good Lighting arrangements, it is also located in the Kings Road. do not miss it if you visit Jeddah Saudi Arabia.",
          "One who pass through this road will never ever forget this wonderful monument, due to its identity, construction, shape etc. Those who have seen this globe especially people interested in learning astronomy can assess the theme of having such a beautiful monument placed for",
          "Good land mark, its closer to the Airport when you drive on the Kind Street and its almost at the end of it. Nicely constructed long ago. I have seen this way back in 1993.",
          "If you are being driven around Jeddah you will no doubt pass this Globe Roundabout on many occasions. The angle of this globe and size is very similar to the globe roundabout in Pudong Shanghai. You may also notice other sculptures on roads in Jeddah, the saw, the hammer, etc",
          "Globe roundabout is one of Jeddah point of interest it is good to see its light during night time also .",
          "It is just a roundabout with the Globe in the center. It is located near roshan mall so you are better off coming to the mall and try to see it from inside the mall.",
          "Although I do think it is unique and there is no doubt it is much better when lit, it is at the end of the day just a roundabout - passed it on way from airport to hotel - would not really call this a landmark ....",
          "I pass this every morning on the way to work. Looks dull without flags but lights up at night.I am told there will be many world flags placed here soon.",
          "This is located in a roundabout close to Roshan Mall. Makes the roundabout look nice but there is nothing that may require a special visit. Would have been innovative if it was rotating.",
          "A big globe in the middle of busy road! Nice in a daylight but even nicer in the night. We didn't really need to look for this as it was on our way from resort to old town.",
          "This is lit up well in the night.The globe looks pretty in the night.You need not stop just drive around.",
          "another roundabout in Jeddah! there is nothing special to make you give it a visit. but if you're passing by the roundabout you may like to take a pic!!",
          "You know that there isn't a lot to see (or do) in the area when one of the suggested 'things to see' is a roundabout. Its got a globe on it which is a bit similar to the Universal Studios globe. However, I would advise you not to pay too much attention to it as its a roundabout",
          "Land mark but I do not like its scale or colors, not at the best place for it, I thought it will removed in future like bicycle land mark.",
          "The globe as many roundabout in Jeddah famous and old The roundabout is big also and good to see and captured some photo day and night",
          "Another decorated roundabout outside the Rashan Mall. Best viewed at night when it is illuminated from the inside, but you will probably be too busy keeping an eye on the traffic to enjoy the view. Get someone else to drive (preferably in their car) so that you can relax and",
          "I grow up in Jeddah watching this round-about. Indeed it is lovely round about, but in my opinion the municipality did not take care of regarding the lighting system. as many would agree lightning is a big deal in such sculpture. specially if you know it is illuminate at night.",
          "Its a great land mark as are most of the round a bouts in Jeddah, no pubs so round a bouts or circles are used as points of reference for giving directions. The Globe is one of the most famous",
          "Its located in malik road infront roshan mall its big and its the only nice roundabout that is not removed till now and i hope they dont remove it because its good and nice and gives a nice view",
          "Nothing special you not see something new, One of the hundreds of art exhibits that characterize the city of Jeddah.Located on King through one of the most major roads",
          "No special thing to see. It's only a round about and will have new bridge soon as local government is improving traffic in city.",
          "One of the hundreds of art exhibits that characterize the city of Jeddah.Located on King through one of the most major roads",
          "Its just a round about...nothing special about this....U can just go past it for a few pictures to be honest..",
          "As some of you may know, Jeddah has the largest outdoor museum in the world. It is incredible to see that 95% of the roundabouts contain state of the art pieces. Unfortunately due to the terrible driving in Jeddah, people seem to be uncapable of knowing how to use a roundabout",
          "No need to plan a visit but if you happen to cross this round about then do stop for a moment and click few quick shots.",
          "This roundabout is outside the Roshan Mall on King Abdulaziz Road. It does not impress me very much, but if you are keen to see it, It is best viewed at night as it illuminated from the inside and you can see the outlines of countries and oceans of the world. You don't visit",
          "The traffic is usually horrific here at all times of day and night. I used it twice a day on my way to and from work. The traffic crawls around here - it is not a place where you would stop and get out to have a look.",
          "The globe is intriguing after dark. Without lights, it's simply a central point. Wonderful how much art King Abdullah brought to interactive urban locations.",
          "If you are headed north to Abhor, you might pass by this big globe on a roundabout. It is lit up at night and looks quite nice. It certainly is NOT an attraction though....",
          "This was a nice roundabout, however I tought, that the globe may be lightning more in the night - nice idea for a trafic sign, better than leaving it empty",
          "They have for years now, taken very large objects and put them into the round-abouts as names. This is one. It is magnificent to see, there is no doubt",
          "The Globe Roundabout is pretty much atypical of the sometimes weird and wacky sculptures you see around Jeddah, from the Bike, to the Fruitboat to the concrete block with scrap cars sticking out of it, it is thought provoking and distracting, which may be the whole purpose of",
          "Amazingly enough, this is one of the top attractions in Jeddah, which suggests just how boring Jeddah is. If you happen to see it as you whizz (or crawl) past, you can take it off your bucket list.",
          "It makes me laugh that roundabouts are \"attractions\" on this site but it makes sense since Jeddah is meant to be an open-air museum and the roundabouts have works or art or concepts that come to life. I really do love this roundabout, it's always been my favorite (makes sense",
          "When ever i am in Jeddah for business or private with family, i have to pass by this round about to see the big earth which became one of Jeddah must seeing places.",
          "to be honest I don't see anything special in this roundabout to be visited particularly , unless you are going to Obhour area or to Alroshan mall so it will be in your way",
          "Globe resembles planet earth and saiyara (Arabic car, Urdu satellite) takes an orbital path when you are travelling towards it. ;-)",
          "This beautiful landmark is located along Al Amir Sultan Road in Northern Jeddah. It is big enough to be seen from a distance if you are going to, or coming from, the Red Sea Mall. Best to see at night when it is illuminated.",
          "This is a must see while you are visiting Jeddah. It is quite easy to find and it can be the launching site to drive along the Jeddah Cornish. I like it during the day time as well as at night. Don't miss adding the small crescent moon to the side of the globe in your photo's!!"

        "wiki": "The Makkah Province (Arabic: \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0629 \u0645\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0651\u0629\u200e Min\u1e6daqat Makkah), also known as the Makkah Region, is one of the 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia. It is the third-largest province by area at 153,128 km2 (59,123 sq mi) and the most populous with a population of 8,557,766 as of 2017, of which 4,041,189 were foreign nationals and 4,516,577 were Saudis. It is located in the historic Hejaz region, and has an extended coastline on the Red Sea. Its capital is Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, and its largest city is Jeddah, which is Saudi Arabia's main port city. The province accounts for 26.29% of the population of Saudi Arabia and is named after the holy city of Mecca.\nHistorically, the area was inhabited by the Quraysh, the Banu Kinanah and the Thaqif, among other tribes. Part of the Hejaz region, the province has seen several exchanges of power between many Islamic realms within a short period of time. The province gains its significance as it contains the city of Mecca, the birthplace of Muhammad, and several other historic Islamic sites, such as the village of Hudaybiyyah, where the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah is said to have been agreed upon. More recently, the province was modernized under the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia after the oil boom.Most of the population is concentrated in three cities: Jeddah, Mecca and Ta'if. Jeddah is the largest city in the province and the second-largest in Saudi Arabia with an estimated population of 2,867,446 as of 2020. Mecca is the second-largest city in the province and third-largest in the kingdom at 1,323,624. After the city of Ta'if at third place, Rabigh, Shafa, Turbah and Jumum are other populous cities and towns in the region. The region receives Muslim pilgrims of the Umrah and the Hajj around the year and its population increases by up to 2 million during the Hajj. It has approximately 700 kilometres (430 mi) of coastline on the Red Sea and hosts oil refineries in Rabigh, port and oil export facilities in Jeddah, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and the King Abdullah Economic City. The province also hosts part of the Haramain high-speed railway line, which is Saudi Arabia's first and only high-speed railway line.The province is divided into 11 governorates, of which 5 have been classified Category A and the rest, Category B, with Mecca serving as the administrative headquarters and capital of the province. It is governed by an Emir, translated as Governor from Arabic, who is assisted by the Deputy Governor, both appointed by the King of Saudi Arabia. The current Emir is Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud, who has held the position for a second term since 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\nAncient Mecca was an oasis on the old caravan trade route that linked the Mediterranean world with South Arabia, East Africa, and South Asia. The town was located about midway between Ma\u02berib in the south and Petra in the north, and it gradually developed by Roman and Byzantine times into an important trade and religious centre. Ptolemy\u2019s inclusion of Macoraba, a city of the Arabian interior, in his Guide to Geography was long held to show that Mecca was known to the Hellenistic world. Since the late 20th century, however, some scholarship has called the identification of Macoraba with Mecca into question.According to Islamic tradition, Abraham and Ishmael, his son by Hagar, built the Ka\u02bfbah as the house of God. The central point of pilgrimage in Mecca before the advent of Islam in the 7th century, the cube-shaped stone building has been destroyed and rebuilt several times. During pre-Islamic times the region was ruled by a series of Yemeni tribes. Under the Quraysh it became a type of city-state, with strong commercial links to the rest of Arabia, Ethiopia, and Europe. Mecca became a place for trade, for pilgrimage, and for tribal gatherings. The city of Jeddah is believed to have been a fishing hamlet occupied by early Yemeni tribes. The region has held significant religious importance greatly increased with the expeditions of Muhammad in the early 7th century. As the ancient caravan route fell into decline, Mecca lost its commercial significance and has since lived mainly on the proceeds from the annual pilgrimages and the gifts of Muslim rulers.\nThe city of Mecca was sacked by the Umayyad general al-\u1e24ajj\u0101j ibn Y\u016bsuf, and thereafter the city, and at the time, the region, acknowledged the power of the Umayyad caliphate at Damascus and, following the eclipse of that dynasty, of the \u02bfAbb\u0101sid caliphate of Baghdad. The city suffered great indignity at the hands of the Sh\u012b\u02bfite Qarmatians in 930 when that sect\u2019s leader \u1e6c\u0101hir Sulaym\u0101n pillaged Mecca and carried off the Black Stone from the Ka\u02bfbah. Beginning in the mid-10th century, the rulers of the city were chosen from the sharifs, or descendants of Muhammad, who retained a strong hold on the surrounding region while often paying homage to stronger political entities. The ability of the sharifs, originally moderate Sh\u012b\u02bfites, to adapt to the changing political and religious climate ensured their preeminence in local affairs for the next 1,000 years. In 1269, the region came under the control of the Egyptian Maml\u016bk sultans. In 1517, dominion over the area passed to the Ottoman Empire, with its capital in Constantinople (now Istanbul). With the Ottoman collapse after World War I, control of Mecca was contested between the sharifs and the House of Sa\u02bf\u016bd  of central Arabia, adherents to an austere, puritanical form of Islam known as Wahh\u0101bism. King Ibn Sa\u02bf\u016bd conquered the region in 1925, and the region of Mecca became a province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the city became the capital of the province.The region underwent extensive economic development as Saudi Arabia\u2019s petroleum resources were exploited after World War II, and the number of yearly pilgrims to Mecca has increased significantly.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMost of the central and eastern portions of the province are desert, with the Hejaz mountains, which vary in elevation from 600 meters to 2000 meters, separating the relatively flat Nafud desert and coastal plains. Agriculture takes place in the region's many wadis and oases, with the most commonly-grown crops being dates and barley, alongside other vegetables and fruits. The city of Ta'if is famous for its cultivation of the Rosa \u00d7 damascena flower, simplified as Damask rose and locally known as Ta'if rose.\nThe province has an extended coastline that is approximately 700 kilometers (430 mi) long, with many cities spread out across the coastline. Several archipelagos can be found across the coast of the province, along with some coral reefs, such as the Great Coral Reef, located approximately 15 km (9 mi) northwest of Jeddah and the Five Coral Reef, located 25 km (16 mi). The coastline faces Sudan to the west and Eritrea and Ethiopia to the south. The province is bordered by the Madinah Province to the north, the Riyadh Province to the east and the Al Baha and 'Aseer provinces to the south.\nThe Makkah Province hosts two of Saudi Arabia's 15 designated protected areas managed by the Saudi Wildlife Authority: the Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area and the Saja Umm Ar-Rimth Natural Reserve, located on the eastern extremes of the province. Other minor sanctuaries in the province include the Saiysad Natural Reserve in the city of Ta'if,  and the Eastern Forest near Jeddah. The Hejaz mountains run through the center of the province, separating the Nafud desert from the western coastal plains, which run parallel to the coast of the province on the Red Sea.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the Population Characteristics Surveys conducted by the General Authority of Statistics, the Mecca Province had a population of 8,557,766 as of December 2017, of which 4,516,577 were Saudis and 4,041,189 were foreign nationals. Divided by gender, 4,864,584 were males and 3,693,182 were females. The Mecca Province is the most populous province of Saudi Arabia and it has a population even larger than that of the Riyadh Region. With an estimated population of 4,076,000 as of 2019, Jeddah is the most populous city in the province and the second most populous city in the country. The governorate with the largest population is the Jeddah Governorate. The sex ratio was approximately 132 males per 100 females.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nCensuses in Saudi Arabia do not collect or report data concerning religion. Sunni Islam of the Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence is the predominant religion overall in the country, with smaller numbers of Hanafis, Shafi\u2018is and Malikis. A minority of Shia Muslims is estimated to live within the province, with even smaller numbers of Hindus, Christians and other religious groups, most of whom are expatriates from India and the Philippines, who mostly reside in Jeddah.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe official language of Saudi Arabia is Arabic. The main regional dialect of the Mecca Province spoken by Saudis is Hejazi Arabic, with a minority of Najdi Arabic speakers in the eastern parts of the region. Saudi Sign Language is the principal language of the deaf community. The large expatriate communities also speak their own languages, the most numerous of which are some of the Indian languages, Filipino/Tagalog, Bengali and Urdu.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nFrom 1,823,598 Saudi male residents above the age of 10, 87.57%, representing 1,596,946 persons had some form of formal education, while 226,652 were illiterate. As for females, from the 1,765,666 residents above the age of 10, 77.28% or 1,364,529 persons were formally educated, while 401,137 were illiterate.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n1.15% of the province's Saudi residents, who were above the age of 15, reported some form of disability in 2016, with visual impairment being the most common form of disability, followed by reduced mobility. 107,770 persons reported severe or extreme disability.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe position of Governor (Emir) of the Makkah Province has been held by the following individuals since 1925:\n\n\n=== Governorates ===\nMakkah Province has 11 governorates, of which 5, Jeddah, Rabigh, Ta'if, Qunfudhah and Laith, have been classified Category A, while the rest are Category B. The City of Makkah (Arabic: \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0645\u0643\u0629\u200e) constitutes Mecca and the area surrounding the city, and is the administrative center and capital of the province.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSarawat Mountains\nHijaz Mountains\nTihamah\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nEmirate of Mecca Region Official WebsiteA travel through the province of Mecca, Splendid Arabia: A travel site with photos and routes\nUmm Al Qura University in Mecca\nGeneral Authority for Statistics - Kingdom of Saudi Arabia",

        "wiki": "Jeddah (English:  JED-\u0259), also spelled Jedda, Jiddah or Jidda ( JID-\u0259; Arabic: \u062c\u062f\u0629\u200e, romanized: Jidda, Hejazi pronunciation: [\u02c8d\u0292\u026ad.da]), is a city in the Hejaz region of Saudi Arabia and the country's commercial center. With a population of about 3 million and half people (as of 2020), Jeddah is the largest city in Makkah Province, the second-largest in Saudi Arabia (after the capital Riyadh), and the tenth-largest in the Arab world. Jeddah Islamic Port, located on the Red Sea, is the second-largest and second-busiest seaport in the Arab world (after Dubai's Port of Jebel Ali).\nJeddah is the principal gateway to Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, located just 65 kilometres (40 mi) to the east, while Medina, the second-holiest city, is located 360 kilometres (220 mi) to the north.\nEconomically, Jeddah is focusing on further developing capital investment in scientific and engineering leadership within Saudi Arabia, and the Middle East. Jeddah was independently ranked fourth in the Africa \u2013 Mid-East region in terms of innovation in 2009 in the Innovation Cities Index.Jeddah is of Saudi Arabia's primary resort cities and was named a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC). Given the city's close proximity to the Red Sea, fishing and seafood dominates the food culture unlike other parts of the country. In Arabic, the city's motto is \"Jeddah Ghair\", which translates to \"Jeddah is different\". The motto has been widely used among both locals as well as foreign visitors. The city had been previously perceived as the \"most open\" city in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n== Etymology and spelling ==\nThere are at least two explanations for the etymology of the name Jeddah, according to Jeddah Ibn Al-Qudaa'iy, the chief of the Quda'a clan. The more common account has it that the name is derived from \u062c\u062f\u0629 Jaddah, the Arabic word for \"grandmother\". According to eastern folk belief, the tomb of Eve, considered the grandmother of humanity, is located in Jeddah. The tomb was sealed with concrete by religious authorities in 1975 due to some Muslims praying at the site.\nThe Berber traveler Ibn Battuta visited Jeddah during his world trip in around 1330. He wrote the name of the city into his diary as \"Jiddah\".The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and other branches of the British government formerly used the older spelling of \"Jedda\", contrary to other English-speaking usage, but in 2007, it changed to the spelling \"Jeddah\".T. E. Lawrence felt that any transcription of Arabic names into English was arbitrary. In his book, Revolt in the Desert, Jeddah is spelled three different ways on the first page alone.On official Saudi maps and documents, the city name is transcribed \"Jeddah\", which is now the prevailing usage.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSome archaeologists' studies suggest the existence of inhabitants in the region now known as Jeddah since the Stone Age seeing as they found some artifacts and 'Thamoudian' writings in Wadi (valley) Breiman east of Jeddah and Wadi Boib northeast of Jeddah. Some historians trace its founding to the tribe of Bani Quda'ah, who inhabited it after the collapse of Sad (dam) Ma'rib in 115 BC. Some believe that Jeddah had been inhabited before the tribe of Bani Quda'ah by fishermen in the Red Sea, who considered it a center from which they sailed out into the sea as well as a place for relaxation and well-being. According to some accounts, the history of Jeddah dates back to early times before Alexander the Great, who visited the city between 323 and 356 BC.\n\n\n=== Pre-Islam ===\nExcavations in the old city suggest that Jeddah was founded as a fishing hamlet in 522 BC by the Yemeni Quda'a tribe (\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0642\u0636\u0627\u0639\u0629), who left central Yemen to settle in Makkah after the destruction of the Marib Dam in Yemen.Other archaeological studies have shown that the area was settled earlier by people in the Stone Age, as some Thamudi scripts were excavated in Wadi Briman (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646), east of the city, and Wadi Boweb (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0648\u064a\u0628), northwest of the city. The city of Jeddah was an important port in the Nabataean frankincense trade. The oldest Mashrabiya found in Jeddah dates back to the pre-Islamic era.\n\n\n=== Rashidun Caliphate ===\nJeddah first achieved prominence around AD 647, when the third Muslim Caliph, Uthman Ibn Affan, turned it into a port making it the port of Makkah instead of Al Shoaiba port south west of Mecca.\nIn AD 703 Jeddah was briefly occupied by pirates from the Kingdom of Axum. Jeddah has been established as the main city of the historic Hijaz province and a historic port for pilgrims arriving by sea to perform their Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca.\n\n\n=== Umayyad Caliphate ===\nUmayyads inherited the entire Rashidun Caliphate including Hejaz and ruled from 661AD to 750AD. No historic records mention important events taking place in Jeddah during this period of history.\nHowever, Jeddah has remained as key civilian harbor, serving fishermen and sea travelling pilgrims to Hajj. it is also believed that Sharifdom of Mecca; an honorary Viceroy to the holyland. was first appointed in this period of the Islamic Caliphate.\n\n\n=== Abbasid Caliphate ===\nAbbassids, the new superpower, became the new successor to the Umayyad. In 750 the Abbasid Revolution successfully took control of almost the whole Umayyad Empire, excluding Morocco (Maghrib) and Spain (Al-Andalus). The Caliphate of Baghdad kept expanding and ruled until 1258, while Hejaz only remained under the Abbasid throne until 876, when the Tulunids of Egypt gained control of the Emirate of Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Hejaz.\n\n\n=== Tulunid Wilayah and Ikhshidid Wilayah ===\nThe power struggle between Tulunid Governors and Abbasid over Hejaz lasted for 30 years when the Tulunids finally withdrew from Arabia in 900 AD.\nIn 930 AD, main Hejazi cities Medina, Mecca and Taif were heavily sacked by Qarmatians. However, it is not historically confirmed that Jeddah itself was attacked by Qarmatians.\nHowever, Ikhshidids Governors of Abbasids, the new power in Egypt took control of Hejaz in early 935. No historic records details the even during Ikhshidids rule of Hejaz.\nJeddah was still unfortified and without walls at this point of time.\n\n\n=== Fatimid Caliphate ===\nIn the 969 AD, the Fatimids from Algeria took control in Egypt from the Ikhshidid Governors of Abbasids and expanded their empire to the surrounding regions, including The Hijaz and Jeddah. The Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean through the Red Sea. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to China and its Song Dynasty, which eventually determined the economic course of Tihamah during the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Ayyubid Empire ===\nAfter Saladin's conquest of Jerusalem, in 1171 he proclaimed himself sultan of Egypt, after dissolving the Fatimid Caliphate upon the death of al-Adid, thus establishing the Ayyubid dynasty. Ayyubid conquests in Hejaz included Jeddah, which joined the Ayyubid Empire in 1177 during the leadership of Sharif Ibn Abul-Hashim Al-Thalab (1094\u20131201). During their relatively short-lived tenure, the Ayyubids ushered in an era of economic prosperity in the lands they ruled and the facilities and patronage provided by the Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in the Islamic world. This period was also marked by an Ayyubid process of vigorously strengthening Sunni Muslim dominance in the region by constructing numerous madrasas (Islamic schools) in their major cities. Jeddah attracted Muslim sailors and merchants from Sindh, Southeast Asia and East Africa, and other distant regions.\n\n\n=== Mamluk Sultanate ===\nIn 1254, following events in Cairo and the dissolution of the Ayyubid Empire, Hijaz became a part of the Mamluk Sultanate. The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, having found his way around the Cape and obtained pilots from the coast of Zanzibar in AD 1497, pushed his way across the Indian Ocean to the shores of Malabar and Calicut, attacked fleets that carried freight and Muslim pilgrims from India to the Red Sea, and struck terror into the surrounding potentates. The Princes of Gujarat and Yemen turned for help to Egypt. Sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri accordingly fitted out a fleet of 50 vessels under his Admiral, Hussein the Kurd. Jeddah was soon fortified with a stone wall, using forced labor, as a harbor of refuge from the Portuguese, allowing Arabia and the Red Sea to be protected. Parts of the city wall still survive today in the old city. Even though the Portuguese were successfully repelled from the city, fleets in the Indian Ocean were at their mercy. This was evidenced by the Battle of Diu between the Portuguese and the Arab Mamluks. The Portuguese soldiers' cemetery can still be found within the old city today and is referred to as the site of the Christian Graves.\n\n\n=== Ottoman Empire ===\n\nIn 1517, the Ottoman Turks conquered the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, during the reign of Selim I. As territories of the Mamluk Sultanate, the Hijaz, including Jeddah and the holy city of Mecca, passed into Ottoman possession. The Ottomans rebuilt the weak walls of Jeddah in 1525 following the defense of the city against the Lopo Soares de Albergaria's Armada arriving from the Red Sea. The new Turkish wall included six watchtowers and six city gates. They were constructed to defend against the Portuguese attack. Of the six gates, the Gate of Mecca was the eastern gate and the Gate of Al-Magharibah, facing the port, was the western gate. The Gate of Sharif faced south. The other gates were the Gate of Al-Bunt, Gate of Al-Sham (also called Gate of Al-Sharaf) and Gate of Medina, facing north. The Turks also built The Qishla of Jeddah, a small castle for the city soldiers. In the 19th century these seven gates were minimized into four giant gates with four towers. These giant gates were the Gate of Sham to the north, the Gate of Mecca to the east, the Gate of Sharif to the south, and the Gate of Al-Magharibah on the sea side.\nAhmed Al-Jazzar, the Ottoman military man mainly known for his role in the Siege of Acre, spent the earlier part of his career at Jeddah. In Jeddah in 1750, he killed some seventy rioting nomads in retaliation for the killing of his commander, Abdullah Beg, earning him the nickname \"Jezzar\" (butcher).\nOn 15 June 1858, rioting in the city, believed to have been instigated by a former police chief in reaction to British policy in the Red Sea, led to the massacre of 25 Christians, including the British and French consuls, members of their families, and wealthy Greek merchants. The British frigate HMS Cyclops, anchored at port, bombarded the city for two days in retaliation.\n\n\n=== First Saudi State and Ottoman\u2013Saudi War ===\n\nIn 1802, Nejdi forces conquered both Mecca and Jeddah from the Ottomans. When Sharif Ghalib Efendi informed Sultan Mahmud II of this, the Sultan ordered his Egyptian viceroy Muhammad Ali Pasha to retake the city. Muhammad Ali successfully regained the city in the Battle of Jeddah in 1813.\n\n\n=== World War I and the Hashemite Kingdom ===\n\nDuring World War I, Sharif Hussein bin Ali declared a revolt against the Ottoman Empire, seeking independence from the Ottoman Turks and the creation of a single unified Arab state spanning from Aleppo in Syria to Aden in Yemen.\nKing Hussein declared the Kingdom of Hejaz. Later, Hussein was involved in war with Ibn Saud, who was the Sultan of Nejd. Hussein abdicated following the fall of Mecca, in December 1924, and his son Ali bin Hussein became the new king.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ===\n\nA few months later, Ibn Saud, whose clan originated in the central Nejd province, conquered Medina and Jeddah via an agreement with Jeddans following the Second Battle of Jeddah. He deposed Ali bin Hussein, who fled to Baghdad, eventually settling in Amman, Jordan, where his descendants became part of its Hashemite royalty.\nAs a result, Jeddah came under the sway of the Al-Saud dynasty in December 1925. In 1926, Ibn Saud added the title King of Hejaz to his position of Sultan of Nejd. Today, Jeddah has lost its historical role in peninsular politics after Jeddah fell within the new province of Makkah, whose provincial capital is the city of Mecca.\nFrom 1928 to 1932, the new Khuzam Palace was built as the new residence of King Abdul Aziz in Jeddah. The palace lies south of the old walled city and was constructed under the supervision of the engineer Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. After 1963, the palace was used as a royal guest house; since 1995, it has housed the Regional Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography.The remaining walls and gates of the old city were demolished in 1947. A fire in 1982 destroyed some ancient buildings in the old town center, called Al-Balad, but much is still preserved despite the commercial interest to tear down old houses (Naseef House, Gabil House) and build modern high-rise buildings. A house-by-house survey of the old districts was made in 1979, showing that some 1000 traditional buildings still existed, though the number of structures with great historic value was far less. In 1990, a Jeddah Historical Area Preservation Department was founded.The modern city has expanded wildly beyond its old boundaries. The built-up area expanded mainly to the north along the Red Sea coastline, reaching the new airport during the 1990s and since edging its way around it toward the Ob'hur Creek, some 27 km (17 mi) from the old city center.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nJeddah is located in Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coastal plain (called Tihamah). Jeddah lies in the Hijazi Tihama (Arabic: \u062a\u0647\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0627\u0632) region which is in the lower Hijaz mountains. Historically, politically and culturally, Jeddah was a major city of Hejaz Vilayet, the Kingdom of Hejaz and other regional political entities according to Hijazi history books. It is the 100th largest city in the world by land area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nJeddah features an arid climate (BWh) under Koppen's climate classification, with a tropical temperature range. Unlike other Saudi Arabian cities, Jeddah retains its warm temperature in winter, which can range from 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) at dawn to 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in the afternoon. Summer temperatures are extremely hot, often breaking the 48 \u00b0C (118 \u00b0F) mark in the afternoon and dropping to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) in the evening. Summers are also quite steamy, with dew points often exceeding 27 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F), particularly in September. Rainfall in Jeddah is generally sparse, and usually occurs in small amounts in November and December. Heavy thunderstorms are common in winter. The thunderstorm of December 2008 was the largest in recent memory, with rain reaching around 80 mm (3 in). The lowest temperature ever recorded in Jeddah was 9.8 \u00b0C (49.6 \u00b0F) on February 10, 1993. The highest temperature ever recorded in Jeddah was 52.0 \u00b0C (125.6 \u00b0F) on June 22, 2010.Dust storms happen in summer and sometimes in winter, coming from the Arabian Peninsula's deserts or from North Africa.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nJeddah has long been a port city. Even before being designated the port city for Mecca, Jeddah was a trading hub for the region. In the 19th century, goods such as mother-of-pearl, tortoise shells, frankincense, and spices were routinely exported from the city. Apart from this, many imports into the city were destined for further transit to the Suez, Africa, or Europe. Many goods passing through Jeddah could not even be found in the city or even in Arabia.All of the capitals of the Middle East and North Africa are within two hours flying distance of Jeddah, making it the second commercial center of the Middle East after Dubai.Also, Jeddah's industrial district is the fourth largest industrial city in Saudi Arabia after Riyadh, Jubail and Yanbu.\n\n\n=== King Abdullah Street ===\n\nKing Abdullah Street is one of the most important streets in Jeddah and runs from King Fahd Road by the waterfront in the west of Jeddah to the eastern end of the city. It is famous for hosting numerous corporate offices and commercial developments. It will be near the HSR Entrance in Jeddah central train station which connects Jeddah with Makkah, AL-Madinah, and King Adullah Economic City (KAEC). And it also has the tallest flagpole in the world at a height of 170 m (558 ft). This road also faced a catastrophe in 2011 when it was submerged with rainwater.\n\n\n=== Tahliyah Street ===\n\nTahaliyah Street is an important fashion and shopping street in central Jeddah. It contains many upscale department and high fashion brands store as well as boutiques. It has been renamed \"Prince Mohammad bin Abdul Aziz Road\" by the government, but this official name is not widely used. It also has many fine dining options.\n\n\n=== Madinah Road ===\n\nMadinah Road is a historically significant street in Jeddah. It links the Southern districts with the North, and contains the Main offices of several companies and showrooms. The northern end of the road links to the King Abdul Aziz Int'l Airport, which is a contributing factor to heavy traffic on this road at most times during the day.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Religious significance ===\n\nMost citizens are Sunni Muslims. The government, courts and civil and criminal laws enforce a moral code established by Shari'ah. A very small minority of Saudi citizens are Shia Muslims, and there is also a large foreign workforce.The city has over 1,300 mosques. The law does not allow other religions' buildings, books, icons and expressions of faith. However, private religious observance not involving Muslims nor offending public order and morality is tolerated.Since the 7th century, Jeddah has hosted millions of Muslim pilgrims from all over the world on their way to Hajj.

Other Dishes were imported from other cultures through Saudis of different origins, like Mantu \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062a\u0648, Yaghmush \u064a\u064e\u063a\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0634 and Ruz Bukh\u0101ri \u0631\u064f\u0632 \u0628\u064f\u062e\u0627\u0631\u064a from Central Asia, Bur\u0113k \u0628\u064f\u0631\u064a\u0643 and \u0160ur\u0113k \u0634\u064f\u0631\u064a\u0643 and Kabab alm\u012bru \u0643\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0648 from Turkey and the Balkans, Mandi \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062f\u064a from Yemen, Mutabbag \u0645\u064f\u0637\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651\u0642 from Yemen-Malaysia, Biry\u0101ni \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a and K\u0101bli \u0643\u0627\u0628\u0644\u064a rice dishes from South Asia.\n\nGrilled meat dishes such as shawarma, kofta and kebab have a good market in Jeddah. During Ramadan, sambousak and ful are especially popular at the evening iftar meal. These dishes are found in Lebanese, Syrian, and Turkish restaurants.The most popular local fast food chain, begun in 1974, is Al Baik, with branches in Jeddah and the neighbouring cities of Makkah, Madinah and Yanbu. Their main dish is broasted (broiled and roasted) chicken, commonly known by Jeddawis as \"Broast\", and a variety of seafood. Other local fast food restaurants have sprung up, like Al Tazaj, which serves seasoned grilled chicken (called Farooj) and a side of Tahina with onion and spices. Foultameez serves Foul and Tameez as fast food; Kudu and Herfy serve Western fast food; Halawani serves local variants of Shawerma; and Shawermatak has pioneered drive-through sales of Shawerma. Another popular fast-food chain is Hot and Crispy, an Arabic franchise popular for their spiced curly fries.Indian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani and other Asian foods are also popular. Italian, French and American restaurants are also to be found.\n\n\n=== Open-air art ===\n\nDuring the oil boom in the late 1970s and 1980s, there was a focused civic effort led by the then city's mayor Mohamed Said Farsi  to bring art to Jeddah's public areas. As a result, Jeddah contains a large number of modern open-air sculptures and works of art, typically situated in roundabouts, making the city one of the largest open-air art galleries in the world. Sculptures include works by Jean/Hans Arp, C\u00e9sar Baldaccini, Alexander Calder, Henry Moore, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Victor Vasarely. They often depict traditional Saudi items such as coffee pots, incense burners, palm trees, etc. The fact that Islamic tradition prohibits the depiction of living creatures, notably the human form, has made for some very creative, as well as bizarre, modern art. These include a giant geometry set, a giant bicycle, and a huge block of concrete with several cars protruding from it at odd angles and a monumental sculpture by Aref Rayess called \"Swords of God (Soyuf Allah)\".\n\n\n=== Museums and collections ===\nThere are about a dozen museums or collections in Jeddah, with varied educational aims and professionalism.

Most of Jeddah Season's events and activities have been held at King Abdullah Sports City, Jeddah's historical area, Al-Hamra Corniche, and the Jeddah Waterfront.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nJeddah is served by four major Arabic-language newspapers, Asharq Al-Awsat, Al Madina, Okaz, and Al Bilad, as well as two major English-language newspapers, the Saudi Gazette and Arab News. Okaz and Al-Madina are the primary newspapers of Jeddah and some other Saudi cities, with over a million readers; their focus is mainly local.\nInternet blogs specifically informative of locality are abundant in Jeddah, catering mostly to the widespread expatriate population. Of these are constituted websites that have garnered international acclaim for informativeness, such as Jeddah Blog, the recipient of the Bronze Expat Blog Award in 2012 and the Gold Award in 2013 and is among Feedspot's Top 100 Middle East blogs. Other amateur websites catering to specific topics in the region exist as well.\nJeddah represents the largest radio and television market in Saudi Arabia.

Nonetheless, the Old City contributes to Hejazi cultural identity. Since it has been granted UNESCO World Heritage status, in 2014, several traditional buildings have been restored and made open to the public. In 2019, the Saudi crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, has issued a royal decree that orders The Ministry of Culture to restore 50 historical buildings in Jeddah.

The bank officially began its activities on 20 October 1975.\n\n\n=== Jeddah Municipality Tower ===\n\nThis is the headquarters of the metropolitan area of Jeddah. The municipality's new building is going to be not only Jeddah's tallest but is also going to dethrone the Burj Khalifa.\n\nThis proposed tower, formerly known as the Kingdom Tower, is being built in Jeddah by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal and will stand 1-kilometre (0.62 mi) tall. Upon its completion, it will be the tallest skyscraper in the world. The building has been scaled down from its initial 1.6 km (1 mi) proposal, since the ground proved unsuitable for a building that tall, to a height of at least 1,000 metres (3,280.84 ft) (the exact height is being kept private while in development, similar to the Burj Khalifa), which, at about one kilometre (0.62 miles), would still make it by far the tallest building or structure in the world to date, standing at least 173 m (568 ft) taller than the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Construction began in April 2013 and is scheduled for completion in 2019.\n\n\n=== King Road Tower ===\n\nKing Road Tower is a commercial and office building, the external walls of which are used to show commercials. The building also has a helipad on its roof. King Road Tower has the largest LED display in the world on its walls.\n\n\n=== Al Jawharah Tower ===\n\nAl Jawharah Tower is a residential high-rise under construction.

It is 171 metres (561 feet) high and the Saudi flag atop it weighs 570 kilograms (1,260 pounds). On the 84th Saudi Arabia National Day, September 23, 2014, the flagpole hoisted a huge Saudi flag before a crowd of thousands. The flagpole succeeded Dushanbe Flagpole as the tallest flagpole in the world.\n\n\n=== Entrance of Mecca ===\nBab Makkah, also known as Makkah Gate, is a limestone coral gateway that leads into the historic Al-Balad district of Jeddah.\n\nThe Mecca Gate, named the \"Quran Gate\", is located 60 km outside Jeddah on the Makkah Mukkarram road of the Jeddah - Mecca Highway. It is the entrance to Mecca and the birthplace of Muhammad. The gate signifies the boundary of the haram area of the city of Mecca, where non-Muslims are prohibited to enter. The gate was designed in 1979 by an Egyptian architect, Samir Elabd, for the architectural firm IDEA Center. The structure is that of a book, representing the Quran, sitting on a rehal, or book stand.\n\n\n=== Jeddah Waterfront ===\n\nThe new waterfront was inaugurated November 2017, by Makkah Governor, Prince Khaled Al-Faisal.It spans an area of 730,000 kilometres on the Red Sea. It has many facilities including: swimming beaches, huts, floating marina dock, washrooms, restaurants, parks, dancing fountains, playgrounds and access to wifi.This project of developing JW (Jeddah Waterfront)  has been awarded as Jeddah Innovation Award of the year 1439H in the field of government innovation, by the province of Jeddah.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Schools, colleges and universities ===\n\nAs of 2005, Jeddah had 849 public and private schools for male students and another 1,179 public and private schools for female students.

However, some private schools administered by foreign entities conduct classes in English. These include 10+ Indian schools following the CBSE board of education system, several Pakistani and Bangladeshi schools as well. As of 2005, Jeddah also had four Philippine international schools, with two more scheduled to open shortly afterward.Jeddah's universities and colleges include the following:\n\nKing Abdulaziz University\nKing Abdullah University of Science and Technology\nUniversity of Jeddah\nArab Open University\nDar Al-Hekma College\nEffat University\nUniversity of Business and Technology (UBT)\nTeacher's College\nJeddah College of Technology\nJeddah Private College\nCollege of Health Care\nCollege of Telecom & Electronics\nCollege of Community\nPrivate College of Business\nIbn Sina National College for Medical Studies\nBatterjee Medical College\nPrince Sultan College of Tourism\nPrince Sultan Aviation Academy\nIslamic Fiqh Academy\nJeddah Institute for Speech and Hearing\nSaudi German Institute for NursingJeddah is also home to several primary, intermediate and secondary schools such as:\n\nJeddah Knowledge International School\nAmerican International School of JeddahItalian international school\n\nJeddah International School\nZahrat Al-Sahraa International school (ZSIS)\nCedar International School\nBritish International School of Jeddah (Continental, BISJ)\n\u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise Internationale de Djeddah\nGerman International School Jeddah\nAl-Thager Model School\nInternational Indian School Jeddah (IISJ)\nPakistan International School Jeddah (PISJ)\nDPS Jeddah Al-Falah International School\nInternational Philippine School in Jeddah\nJeddah Japanese School\nKorean International School of Jeddah (KISJ; \uc82f\ub2e4\ud55c\uad6d\uad6d\uc81c\ud559\uad50)\nAl-Waha International School\nBeladi International School Jeddah\nYusr International School\nAl-Afaq International School\nManarat Jeddah Schools\nGharnatah International School\nNew Al Wurood International School Jeddah [NAWIS]\nBangladesh International School Jeddah (BISESJ)\nBader International School\nNobles International School (NIS)\nDauha Al Uloom International School (DAUISJ)\nAl-Fath Schools\nAl-Aqsa Private Schools\nDar Al-Fikr Schools (DAF)\nAl-Fanar School Jeddah\nDar Al-Thikr Schools\nHala International School (HIS)\nJeddah International Turkish School (JITS)\nJeddah Prep and Grammar School (JPGS)\nAl Hamraa Girls' School\nBuilding Blocks (private school)\nDar Jana International School (DJIS)\nAl Mawarid International School Jeddah [AMIS]\nPioneer International School\nDuaa International School Jeddah (DISJ)\nJeddah Private School (JPS)\nNhaond School\nNumber 18 High School\nNumber 25 Secondary School\nTuletelah High School\nBangladesh International School And College (Bangla Section) Jeddah (BISCJ)\nAl-Afkar International School\nWaad Academy School\nAl Kon International School\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nThe central library at King Abdulaziz University (main branch) is a five story building that has a large collection of Arabic and English language books, rare books and documents as well as access to several online databases. It is open for public access and allows borrowing of books after requesting a library card. Saturdays are dedicated for female visitors.King Abdul Aziz Public Library is a philanthropic institution which was founded and supported by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz, chairman of its board of directors. Established in 1985, the library was officially opened by the King on 27 February 1987. It emphasises Islamic and Arabic heritage and history of the Kingdom. The library is divided into three branches (men's, women's, and children's).The limited number of libraries is criticized by the public. As a result, King Abdullah, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, has approved the King Abdullah Project for the Development of Public Libraries, and approximately SAR150 million is budgeted to be spent.In April 2014, Prince Mishaal Ibn Abdullah Abdulaziz opened a new public library in Jeddah by Makkah Governor, under the name of King Fahd Public Library.King Fahd Public Library was built over an area of 17,000-square-meter within the main Campus of King Abdulaziz University (KAU) in Jeddah. it includes a diverse collection of books and reference material classified into three sections to meet the needs and wants of a wide range of readership. Spaces have been set apart for youths, children and women.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nJeddah is the home of 2 biggest well-known football clubs teams Al-Ittihad Club (Jeddah) and Al-Ahli Saudi FC. Both teams play their league matches at King Abdullah Stadium which is located northern part of Jeddah nearby King Abdelaziz Airport \nThe city is home to the 2015 Saudi Arabian basketball Champion Al-Ittihad Jeddah, which plays its home games in the Prince Abdullah Al-Faisal Basketball Arena.\n\n\n== Wellness ==\nThe population of Saudi Arabia and especially Riyadh and Jeddah has seen health issues growing due to urbanization. Cancers, diabetes and other diseases are increasing. Disease prevention is a new market and \u00c3LOKA Wellness is helping Jeddah's residents to get back in health and shape. \n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nJeddah is served by King Abdulaziz International Airport. The airport has four passenger terminals. One is the Hajj Terminal, a special outdoor terminal covered by large white tents, which was constructed to handle the more than two million pilgrims who pass through the airport during the Hajj season. The Southern Terminal is used by Saudia and Flynas (both based in Saudi Arabia), while the Northern Terminal serves foreign airlines. A plan for the extension of the airport is being developed. The Royal Terminal is a special terminal reserved for VIPs, foreign kings and presidents, and the Saudi royal family. A portion of the airport, King Abdullah Air Base, was used by Coalition B-52 heavy bombers during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.\n\nBefore King Abdulaziz Airport opened in 1981, Kandara Airport served Jeddah. It was at Kandara, a neighborhood very near the town center. However, the old Jeddah airport experienced heavy congestions, especially during hajj seasons. After the airport became defunct, the area was redeveloped for housing.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nThe Jeddah Seaport is the 32nd busiest seaport in the world as of 2008. It handles the majority of Saudi Arabia's commercial movement.\n\nIn 2017 Jeddah seaport handled 4,309,765 TEUs and in the year 2018 handled 4,215,248 TEUs.\n\n\n=== Road and rail ===\nHighway 40, which begins in Jeddah, connects the city to Mecca, Riyadh and Dammam on the east coast. Jeddah does not have any rapid transit system, but a rail system connecting the city to Riyadh is now under construction. The Haramain High Speed Rail Project will provide a connection to Mecca and Medina. There is a contracted plan to build an extensive light metro system known as the Jeddah Metro, throughout the city by 2020. Jeddah's main highways run parallel to each other.\n\n\n== Issues and challenges ==\nThe city is challenged by pollution, weak sewage systems, a weak storm drain system that led to massive floodings, heavy traffic, epidemics, and water shortages.\n\n\n=== Pollution and environment ===\nAir pollution is a problem for Jeddah, particularly on hot summer days. The city has experienced bush fires, landfill fires, and pollution from the two industrial zones in the north and the south of the metropolitan area. A water treatment factory and the seaport also contribute to water pollution. Much of the seafront, however, is considered to be safe and clean. \nRamboll has acted as Environmental Consultant on the Jeddah Environmental Impact Assessment as well as the Jeddah Environmental Social Masterplan.\n\n\n=== Terrorism ===\nOn 6 December 2004, a group of five men associated with the terrorist group Al-Qaeda (Al-Qaeda Organization in the Arabian Peninsula) conducted a mid-day attack on the U.S. Consulate, which killed five Consulate workers. The group was led by Fayez ibn Awwad Al-Jeheni, a former member of Saudi religious police. Two other assailants were subsequently identified by the Saudi authorities as residents of Jeddah's Al-Jamia suburb and other slums on Saudi Arabia's increasingly urbanised west coast. Buildings were attacked, hostages taken and used as human shields, and the U.S. and non-U.S. staff were under siege, although the chancery/consular section building itself was never penetrated. Closed circuit video feeds documented that the Saudi security personnel assigned to protect the facility fled when the vehicle holding the terrorists pulled up to the front gate and ran past the Delta barrier. Inside the compound, however, an armed Saudi security guard employed by the embassy shot and killed one terrorist before being fatally shot himself.\nThe attackers spread and ignited a flammable liquid on the front of the chancery building, and opened fire on the front doors, both of which actions did not have any penetrating effect. The Consulate's U.S. Marines released tear gas in front of the chancery building, but the terrorists had already left that location. More than an hour later, Saudi special forces made it through traffic and, along with others from their unit who arrived in a helicopter, fought to retake the compound. Two of the terrorists were killed in the final fight, with another dying later in hospital and the final militant being captured alive. Four Saudi special forces and a further 10 hostages were wounded in the crossfire.The five Foreign Service National employees who died during the terrorist attack were Ali Yaslem Bin Talib, Imad e-Deen Musa Ali, Romeo de la Rosa, Mohammed Baheer Uddin and Jaufar Sadik. The casualties came from Yemen, Sudan, Philippines, India and Sri Lanka.The attack underscores the ongoing vulnerabilities of Westerners to threats and terrorist actions in Jeddah and environs. In a communiqu\u00e9 posted in online publications such as Sawt al-Jihad (Voice of Jihad) and Mu'askar al-Battar (Al-Battar Training Camp), Al-Qaeda hinted at the symbolic nature of the U.S. Consulate attack, stating: \"Know that the Mujahideen are determined to continue on their path, and they will not be weakened by what has happened to them.\"Terrorist activities have persisted from 2004 to the present day. In 2004 there was an unsuccessful shooting attack on a U.S. Marine visiting the Saudi American Bank and an attempt to simultaneously explode car bombs at Saudi American Bank and Saudi British Bank branches in Jeddah on the anniversary of the 2001 \"9-11\" terrorist attacks on the U.S. On 26 August 2012, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry announced that terrorists were arrested in Jeddah who had been preparing explosives for attacks within the kingdom.\n\n\n=== Traffic ===\nRoads and highways within and exiting the city are frequently clogged with traffic. Mass transit is rare and planning is nascent; most Jeddawi adults have at least one car. Motorcycles are rare on the roads, further impacting the traffic patterns. Days immediately preceding and following the holy days are particularly noisome and cost hundreds of thousands many hours because of traffic jams. The Saudi Gazette reports that there is a plan in the works to tackle the traffic issue. A reported 3 billion Saudi Riyals will be put into constructing flyovers and underpasses in an effort to expedite traffic. The plan is scheduled to take about five years from its start to finish.\n\n\n=== Sewage ===\nPrior to the construction of a waste treatment plant, Jeddah's waste water was disposed of by either discharge into the sea or via absorption into deep underground pits. As the city grew, a proper waste management plant was created and the built up part of the city was connected with a sewer system by the 1970s. However, even with the ever-increasing population, the original sewer system has hardly been expanded. The original plant cannot cope with the amount of waste inundating it daily. As a result, some untreated sewage is discharged directly into the sea and the entire northern part of the city remains completely unconnected to the sewage system, instead relying on septic tanks. This has been responsible for the large number of sewage tankers.\nIn late 2011, a storm drainage system was built in the south Jeddah area (similar to that of the Los Angeles storm drain) to reduce the risk of floods.\n\n\n=== Floods ===\n\nOn 25 November 2009, heavy floods affected the city and other areas of Makkah Province. The floods were described by civil defence officials as the worst in 27 years. As of 26 November 2009, 77 people were reported to have been killed, and more than 350 were missing. Some roads were under a metre (three feet) of water on 26 November, and many of the victims were believed to have drowned in their cars. At least 3,000 vehicles were swept away or damaged. The death toll was expected to rise as flood waters receded, allowing rescuers to reach stranded vehicles.\n\nOn 26 January 2011, again, heavy floods affected the city and other areas of Makkah Province. The cumulative rainfall exceeded the 90 mm (3.5 in) recorded in four hours during the 25 November 2009 flash floods. Streets including Palestine Street, Madinah Road and Wali Al-Ahad Street were either flooded or jammed with traffic. Cars were seen floating in some places. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses told local newspaper Arab News that East Jeddah was swamped and floodwater was rushing west towards the Red Sea, turning streets into rivers once again.\nOn 17 November 2015, heavy floods affected the city. Streets affected by the flood include Palestine Street, Madinah Road and many others.

        "wiki": "Macau, also spelled Macao ( (listen); \u6fb3\u9580, Cantonese: [\u014du.m\u01d4\u02d0n]; official Portuguese: [m\u0250\u02c8kaw] Macau), and officially the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is a city in the western Pearl River Delta by the South China Sea. It is a special administrative region of China and maintains separate governing and economic systems from those of mainland China. With a population of 649,335 and an area of 32.9 km2 (12.7 sq mi), it is the most densely populated region in the world.\nMacau was a former colony of the Portuguese Empire, after Ming China leased the territory as a trading post in 1557. Portugal paid an annual rent and administered the territory under Chinese sovereignty until 1887 when it gained perpetual colonial rights in the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking. The colony remained under Portuguese rule until 1999, when it was transferred to China.\nOriginally a sparsely populated collection of coastal islands, the territory has become a major resort city and the top destination for gambling tourism. Its gambling industry is seven times larger than that of Las Vegas. Although the city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, it has severe income inequality. Its GDP per capita by purchasing power parity is one of the highest in the world and higher than any country in the world in 2014 according to the World Bank. However, income inequality remains high.Macau has a very high Human Development Index, although it is only calculated by the Macau government instead of the United Nations. Macau has the fourth-highest life expectancy in the world. The territory is highly urbanised and most development is built on reclaimed land; two-thirds of the total land area is reclaimed from the sea.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe first known written record of the name \"Macau\", rendered as \"Ya/A Ma Gang\" (\"\u4e9e/\u963f-\u5abd/\u99ac-\u6e2f\"), is found in a letter dated 20 November 1555. The local inhabitants believed that the sea-goddess Mazu (alternatively called A-Ma) had blessed and protected the harbour and called the waters around A-Ma Temple using her name. When Portuguese explorers first arrived in the area and asked for the place name, the locals thought they were asking about the temple and told them it was \"Ma Kok\" (\u5abd\u95a3). The earliest Portuguese spelling for this was Amaqu\u00e3o. Multiple variations were used until Amac\u00e3o / Amacao and Mac\u00e3o / Macao became common during the 17th century. By the 1911 reform of Portuguese orthography, the spelling Macau became the standardised form, however the use of Macao persisted in English and other European languages.Macau Peninsula had many names in Chinese, including Jing'ao (\u4e95\u6fb3/\u93e1\u6fb3), Haojing (\u6fe0\u93e1), and Haojing'ao (\u6fe0\u93e1\u6fb3). The islands Taipa, Coloane, and Hengqin were collectively called Shizimen (\u5341\u5b57\u9580). These names would later become Aomen (\u6fb3\u9580), Oum\u00fan in Cantonese and translating as \"bay gate\" or \"port gate\", to refer to the whole territory.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDuring the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC), the region was under the jurisdiction of Panyu County, Nanhai Prefecture of the province of Guangdong. The region is first known to have been settled during the Han dynasty. It was administratively part of Dongguan Prefecture in the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420 AD), and alternated under the control of Nanhai and Dongguan in later dynasties. In 1152, during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279 AD), it was under the jurisdiction of the new Xiangshan County. In 1277, approximately 50,000 refugees fleeing the Mongol conquest of China settled in the coastal area.Macau did not develop as a major settlement until the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century. The first European visitor to reach China by sea was the explorer Jorge \u00c1lvares, who arrived in 1513. Merchants first established a trading post in Hong Kong waters at Tam\u00e3o (present-day Tuen Mun), beginning regular trade with nearby settlements in southern China. Military clashes between the Ming and Portuguese navies followed the expulsion of the Tam\u00e3o traders in 1521. Despite the trade ban, Portuguese merchants continued to attempt settling on other parts of the Pearl River estuary, finally settling on Macau. Luso-Chinese trade relations were formally reestablished in 1554 and Portugal soon after acquired a permanent lease for Macau in 1557, agreeing to pay 500 taels of silver as annual land rent.The initially small population of Portuguese merchants rapidly became a growing city. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau was created in 1576, and by 1583, the Senate had been established to handle municipal affairs for the growing settlement. Macau was at the peak of its prosperity as a major entrep\u00f4t during the late 16th century, providing a crucial connection in exporting Chinese silk to Japan during the Nanban trade period. Although the Portuguese were initially prohibited from fortifying Macau or stockpiling weapons, the Fortaleza do Monte was constructed in response to frequent Dutch naval incursions. The Dutch attempted to take the city in the 1622 Battle of Macau, but were repelled successfully by the Portuguese. Macau entered a period of decline in the 1640s following a series of catastrophic events for the burgeoning colony: Portuguese access to trade routes was irreparably severed when Japan halted trade in 1639, Portugal revolted against Spain in 1640, and Malacca fell to the Dutch in 1641.Maritime trade with China was banned in 1644 following the Qing conquest under the Haijin policies and limited only to Macau on a lesser scale while the new dynasty focused on eliminating surviving Ming loyalists. While the Kangxi Emperor lifted the prohibition in 1684, China again restricted trade under the Canton System in 1757. Foreign ships were required to first stop at Macau before further proceeding to Canton. Qing authorities exercised a much greater role in governing the territory during this period; Chinese residents were subject to Qing courts and new construction had to be approved by the resident mandarin beginning in the 1740s. As the opium trade became more lucrative during the eighteenth century, Macau again became an important stopping point en route to China.Following the First Opium War and establishment of Hong Kong, Macau lost its role as a major port. Firecracker and incense production, as well as tea and tobacco processing, were vital industries in the colony during this time. Portugal was able to capitalise on China's post-war weakness and assert its sovereignty; the Governor of Macau began refusing to pay China annual land rent for the colony in the 1840s, and annexed Taipa and Coloane, in 1851 and 1864 respectively. Portugal also occupied nearby Lapa and Montanha, but these would be returned to China by 1887, when perpetual occupation rights over Macau were formalised in the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking. This agreement also prohibited Portugal from ceding Macau without Chinese approval. Despite occasional conflict between Cantonese authorities and the colonial government, Macau's status remained unchanged through the republican revolutions of both Portugal in 1910 and China in 1911. The Kuomintang further affirmed Portuguese jurisdiction in Macau when the Treaty of Peking was renegotiated in 1928.During the Second World War, the Empire of Japan did not occupy the colony and generally respected Portuguese neutrality in Macau. However, after Japanese troops captured a British cargo ship in Macau waters in 1943, Japan installed a group of government \"advisors\" as an alternative to military occupation. The territory largely avoided military action during the war except in 1945, when the United States ordered air raids on Macau after learning that the colonial government was preparing to sell aviation fuel to Japan. Portugal was later given over US$20 million in compensation for the damage in 1950.\n\nRefugees from mainland China swelled the population as they fled from the Chinese Civil War. Access to a large workforce enabled Macau's economy to grow as the colony expanded its clothing and textiles manufacturing industry, developed tourism, and legalised casino gaming. However, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, residents dissatisfied with the colonial administration rioted in the 1966 12-3 incident, in which 8 people were killed and over 200 were injured. Portugal lost full control over the colony afterwards, and agreed to cooperate with the communist authorities in exchange for continued administration of Macau.Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal formally relinquished Macau as an overseas province and acknowledged it as a \"Chinese territory under Portuguese administration\". After China first concluded arrangements on Hong Kong's future with the United Kingdom, it entered negotiations with Portugal over Macau in 1986. They were concluded with the signing of the 1987 Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau, in which Portugal agreed to transfer the colony in 1999 and China would guarantee Macau's political and economic systems for 50 years after the transfer. In the waning years of colonial rule, Macau rapidly urbanised and constructed large-scale infrastructure projects, including Macau International Airport and a new container port. Macau was transferred to China on 20 December 1999, after 442 years of Portuguese rule.Following the transfer, Macau liberalised its casino industry (previously operating under a government-licensed monopoly) to allow foreign investors, starting a new period of economic development. The regional economy grew by a double-digit annual growth rate from 2002 to 2014, making Macau one of the richest economies in the world on a per capita basis. Political debates have centred on the region's jurisdictional independence and the central government's adherence of \"one country, two systems\". While issues such as national security legislation have been controversial, Macanese residents generally have high levels of trust in the government.\n\n\n== Lusophonia ==\nMacau is the last Portuguese colony to gain independence and the only one which is not a member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. Portuguese is one of the official languages of Macau. In 2006, during the II Ministerial meeting between China and Portuguese Speaking Countries, the CPLP Executive Secretary and Deputy ambassador Tadeu Soares invited the Chief Executive of the Government of the Macau Special Administrative Region, Edmund Ho, to request the Associate Observer status for Macau. The Government of Macau has not yet formalized this request. In 2016, Murade Murargy, then executive secretary of CPLP said in an interview that Macau's membership is a complicated question, since like the Galicia region in Spain, it is not an independent country, but only a part of China. But the Instituto Internacional de Macau and the University of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 are Consultative Observers of CPLP.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nMacau is a special administrative region of China, with executive, legislative, and judicial powers devolved from the national government. The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration provided for economic and administrative continuity through the transfer of sovereignty, resulting in an executive-led governing system largely inherited from the territory's history as a Portuguese colony. Under these terms and the \"one country, two systems\" principle, the Basic Law of Macao is the regional constitution. Because negotiations for the Joint Declaration and Basic Law began after transitional arrangements for Hong Kong were made, Macau's structure of government is very similar to Hong Kong's.The regional government is composed of three branches:\n\nExecutive: The Chief Executive is responsible for enforcing regional law, can force reconsideration of legislation, and appoints Executive Council members, a portion of the legislature, and principal officials. Acting with the Executive Council, the Chief Executive can propose new bills, issue subordinate legislation, and has authority to dissolve the legislature.\nLegislature: The unicameral Legislative Assembly enacts regional law, approves budgets, and has the power to impeach a sitting Chief Executive.\nJudiciary: The Court of Final Appeal and lower courts, whose judges are appointed by the Chief Executive on the advice of a recommendation commission, interpret laws and overturn those inconsistent with the Basic Law.The Chief Executive is the head of government, and serves for a maximum of two five-year terms. The State Council (led by the Premier of China) appoints the Chief Executive after nomination by the Election Committee, which is composed of 400 business, community, and government leaders.The Legislative Assembly has 33 members, each serving a four-year term: 14 are directly elected, 12 indirectly elected, and 7 appointed by the Chief Executive. Indirectly elected assemblymen are selected from limited electorates representing sectors of the economy or special interest groups. All directly elected members are chosen with proportional representation.Twelve political parties had representatives elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 2017 election. These parties have aligned themselves into two ideological groups: the pro-establishment (the current government) and pro-democracy camps. Macau is represented in the National People's Congress by 12 deputies chosen through an electoral college, and 29 delegates in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference appointed by the central government.\n\nChinese national law does not generally apply in the region, and Macau is treated as a separate jurisdiction. Its judicial system is based on Portuguese civil law, continuing the legal tradition established during colonial rule. Interpretative and amending power over the Basic Law and jurisdiction over acts of state lie with the central authority, however, making regional courts ultimately subordinate to the mainland's socialist civil law system. Decisions made by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress can also override territorial judicial processes.The territory's jurisdictional independence is most apparent in its immigration and taxation policies. The Identification Department issues passports for permanent residents which differ from those issued by the mainland or Hong Kong, and the region maintains a regulated border with the rest of the country. All travellers between Macau and China and Hong Kong must pass border controls, regardless of nationality. Chinese citizens resident in mainland China do not have the right of abode in Macau and are subject to immigration controls. Public finances are handled separately from the national government, and taxes levied in Macau do not fund the central authority.The Macao Garrison is responsible for the region's defence. Although the Chairman of the Central Military Commission is supreme commander of the armed forces, the regional government may request assistance from the garrison. Macau residents are not required to perform military service and current law also has no provision for local enlistment, so its defence force is composed entirely of nonresidents.The State Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs handle diplomatic matters, but Macau retains the ability to maintain separate economic and cultural relations with foreign nations. The territory negotiates its own trade agreements and actively participates in supranational organisations, including agencies of the World Trade Organization and United Nations. The regional government maintains trade offices in Greater China and other nations.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe territory is divided into seven parishes. Cotai, a major area developed on reclaimed land between Taipa and Coloane, and areas of the Macau New Urban Zone do not have defined parishes. Historically, the parishes belonged to one of two municipalities (the Municipality of Macau or the Municipality of Ilhas) that were responsible for administering municipal services. The municipalities were abolished in 2001 and superseded by the Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau in providing local services.\n\n\n=== Sociopolitical issues and human rights ===\nSex trafficking in Macau is a problem. Macau and foreign women and girls are forced into prostitution in brothels, homes, and businesses in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMacau is on China's southern coast, 60 km (37 mi) west of Hong Kong, on the western side of the Pearl River estuary. It is surrounded by the South China Sea in the east and south, and neighbours the Guangdong city of Zhuhai to the west and north. The territory consists of Macau Peninsula, Taipa, and Coloane. A 1 km2 (0.39 sq mi) parcel of land in neighbouring Hengqin island that hosts the University of Macau also falls under the regional government's jurisdiction. The territory's highest point is Coloane Alto, 170.6 metres (560 ft) above sea level.Urban development is concentrated on peninsular Macau, where most of the population lives. The peninsula was originally a separate island with hilly terrain, which gradually became a tombolo as a connecting sandbar formed over time. Both natural sedimentation and land reclamation expanded the area enough to support urban growth. Macau has tripled its land area in the last century, increasing from 10.28 km2 (3.97 sq mi) in the late 19th century to 32.9 km2 (12.7 sq mi) in 2018.Cotai, the area of reclaimed land connecting Taipa and Coloane, contains many of the newer casinos and resorts established after 1999. The region's jurisdiction over the surrounding sea was greatly expanded in 2015, when it was granted an additional 85 km2 (33 sq mi) of maritime territory by the State Council. Further reclamation is currently underway to develop parts of the Macau New Urban Zone. The territory also has control over part of an artificial island to maintain a border checkpoint for the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMacau has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa), characteristic of southern China. The territory is dual season dominant \u2013 summer (May to September) and winter (November to February) are the longest seasons, while spring (March and April) and autumn (October) are relatively brief periods. The summer monsoon brings warm and humid air from the sea, with the most frequent rainfall occurring during the season. Typhoons also occur most often then, bringing significant spikes in rainfall. During the winter, northern winds from the continent bring dry air and much less rainfall. The highest and lowest temperatures recorded at the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau are 38.9 \u00b0C (102.0 \u00b0F) on both 2 July 1930 and 6 July 1930 and \u22121.8 \u00b0C (28.8 \u00b0F) on 26 January 1948.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe Statistics and Census Service estimated Macau's population at 667,400 at the end of 2018. With a population density of 21,340 people per square kilometre, Macau is the most densely populated region in the world. The overwhelming majority (88.7 per cent) are Chinese, many of whom originate from Guangdong (31.9 per cent) or Fujian (5.9 per cent). The remaining 11.6 per cent are non-ethnic Chinese minorities, primarily Filipinos (4.6 per cent), Vietnamese (2.4 per cent), and Portuguese (1.8 per cent). Several thousand residents are of Macanese heritage, native-born multiracial people with mixed Portuguese ancestry. Of the total population (excluding migrants), 49.4 per cent were born in Macau, followed by 43.1 per cent in Mainland China. A large portion of the population are Portuguese citizens, a legacy of colonial rule; at the time of the transfer of sovereignty in 1999, 107,000 residents held Portuguese passports.The predominant language is Cantonese, a variety of Chinese originating in Guangdong. It is spoken by 87.5 per cent of the population, 80.1 per cent as a first language and 7.5 per cent as a second language. Only 2.3 per cent can speak Portuguese, the other official language; 0.7 per cent are native speakers, and 1.6 per cent use it as a second language. Increased immigration from mainland China in recent years has added to the number of Mandarin speakers, making up about half of the population (50.4 per cent); 5.5 per cent are native speakers and 44.9 per cent are second language speakers. Traditional Chinese characters are used in writing, rather than the simplified characters used on the mainland. English is considered an additional working language and is spoken by over a quarter of the population (27.5 per cent); 2.8 per cent are native speakers, and 24.7 per cent speak English as a second language. Macanese Patois, a local creole generally known as Patu\u00e1, is now spoken only by a few in the older Macanese community.Chinese folk religions have the most adherents (58.9 per cent) and are followed by Buddhism (17.3 per cent) and Christianity (7.2 per cent), while 15.4 per cent of the population profess no religious affiliation at all. Small minorities adhering to other religions (less than 1 per cent), including Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam, are also resident in Macau.Life expectancy in Macau was 81.6 years for males and 87.7 years for females in 2018, the fourth highest in the world. Cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease are the territory's three leading causes of death. Most government-provided healthcare services are free of charge, though alternative treatment is also heavily subsidised.Migrant workers living in Macau account for over 25 per cent of the entire workforce. They largely work in lower wage sectors of the economy, including construction, hotels, and restaurants. As a growing proportion of local residents take up employment in the gaming industry, the disparity in income between local and migrant workers has been increasing. Rising living costs have also pushed a large portion of non-resident workers to live in Zhuhai.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMacau has a capitalist service economy largely based on casino gaming and tourism. It is the world's 83rd-largest economy, with a nominal GDP of approximately MOP433 billion (US$53.9 billion). Although Macau has one of the highest per capita GDPs, the territory also has a high level of wealth disparity. Macau's gaming industry is the largest in the world, generating over MOP195 billion (US$24 billion) in revenue and about seven times larger than that of Las Vegas. Macau's gambling revenue was $37 billion in 2018.The regional economy is heavily reliant on casino gaming. The vast majority of government funding (79.6 per cent of total tax revenue) comes from gaming. Gambling as a share of GDP peaked in 2013 at over 60 per cent, and continues to account for 49.1 per cent of total economic output. The vast majority of casino patrons are tourists from mainland China, making up 68 per cent of all visitors. Casino gaming is illegal in both the mainland and Hong Kong, giving Macau a legal monopoly on the industry in China. Revenue from Chinese high rollers has been falling and was forecast to fall as much as 10% more in 2019. Economic uncertainty may account for some of the drop, but alternate Asian gambling venues do as well. For example, Chinese visitors to the Philippines more than doubled between 2015 and 2018, since the City of Dreams casino opened in Manila.Casino gambling was legalised in 1962 and the gaming industry initially operated under a government-licensed monopoly granted to the Sociedade de Turismo e Divers\u00f5es de Macau. This license was renegotiated and renewed several times before ending in 2002 after 40 years. The government then allowed open bidding for casino licenses to attract foreign investors. Along with an easing of travel restrictions on mainland Chinese visitors, this triggered a period of rapid economic growth; from 1999 to 2016, Macau's gross domestic product multiplied by 7 and the unemployment rate dropped from 6.3 to 1.9 per cent. The Sands Macao, Wynn Macau, MGM Macau, and Venetian Macau were all opened during the first decade after liberalisation of casino concessions. Casinos employ about 24 per cent of the total workforce in the region. \"Increased competition from casinos popping up across Asia to lure away Chinese high rollers and tourists\" in Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam and the Russian Far East led in 2019 to the lowest revenues in three years.Export-oriented manufacturing previously contributed to a much larger share of economic output, peaking at 36.9 per cent of GDP in 1985 and falling to less than 1 per cent in 2017. The bulk of these exports were cotton textiles and apparel, but also included toys and electronics. At the transfer of sovereignty in 1999, manufacturing, financial services, construction and real estate, and gaming were the four largest sectors of the economy. Macau's shift to an economic model entirely dependent on gaming caused concern over its overexposure to a single sector, prompting the regional government to attempt re-diversifying its economy.The government traditionally had a non-interventionist role in the economy and taxes corporations at very low rates. Post-handover administrations have generally been more involved in enhancing social welfare to counter the cyclical nature of the gaming industry. Economic growth has been attributed in large part to the high number of mainlander visits to Macau, and the central government exercises a role in guiding casino business growth through its control of the flow of tourists. The Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement formalised a policy of free trade between Macau and mainland China, with each jurisdiction pledging to remove remaining obstacles to trade and cross-boundary investment.Due to a lack of available land for farming, agriculture is not significant in the economy. Food is exclusively imported to Macau and almost all foreign goods are transshipped through Hong Kong.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nMacau has a highly developed road system, with over 400 km (250 mi) of road constructed in the territory. Automobiles drive on the left (unlike in both mainland China and Portugal), due to historical influence of the Portuguese Empire. Vehicle traffic is extremely congested, especially within the oldest part of the city, where streets are the most narrow. Public bus services operate over 80 routes, supplemented by free hotel shuttle buses that also run routes to popular tourist attractions and downtown locations. About 1,500 black taxicabs are licensed to carry riders in the territory. The Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge, opened in 2018, provides a direct link with the eastern side of the Pearl River estuary. Cross-boundary traffic to mainland China may also pass through border checkpoints at the Portas do Cerco and L\u00f3tus Bridge.Macau International Airport serves over 8 million passengers each year and is the primary hub for local flag carrier Air Macau. The territory's first rail network, the Macau Light Rapid Transit, is currently under construction. Phase 1 of the Taipa line had begun operations in December 2019, the Taipa line will connect 11 metro stations throughout Taipa and Cotai. Ferry services to Hong Kong and mainland China operate out of Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, Inner Harbour Ferry Terminal, and Taipa Ferry Terminal. Daily helicopter service is also available to Hong Kong and Shenzhen.The Macau Light Rapid Transit (MLRT) also known in Portuguese as Metro Ligeiro de Macau (MLM) is a mass transit system in Macau. It serves the Macau Peninsula, Taipa and Cotai, serving major border checkpoints such as the Border Gate, the Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, the Lotus Bridge Border and the Macau International Airport.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n\nMacau is served by one major public hospital, the Hospital Conde S. Janu\u00e1rio, and one major private hospital, the Kiang Wu Hospital, both located in Macau Peninsula, as well as a university associated hospital called Macau University of Science and Technology Hospital in Cotai. In addition to hospitals, Macau also has numerous health centres providing free basic medical care to residents. Consultation in traditional Chinese medicine is also available.None of the Macau hospitals are independently assessed through international healthcare accreditation. There are no western-style medical schools in Macau, and thus all aspiring physicians in Macau have to obtain their education and qualification elsewhere. Local nurses are trained at the Macau Polytechnic Institute and the Kiang Wu Nursing College. Currently there are no training courses in midwifery in Macau. A study by the University of Macau, commissioned by the Macau SAR government, concluded that Macau is too small to have its own medical specialist training centre.The Macau Corps of Firefighters (Portuguese: Corpo de Bombeiros de Macau) is responsible for ambulance service (Ambul\u00e2ncia de Macau). The Macau Red Cross also operates ambulances (Toyota HiAce vans) for emergency and non-emergencies to local hospitals with volunteer staff. The organization has a total of 739 uniformed firefighters and paramedics serving from 7 stations in Macau.The Health Bureau in Macau is mainly responsible for coordinating the activities between the public and private organizations in the area of public health, and assure the health of citizens through specialized and primary health care services, as well as disease prevention and health promotion. The Macau Centre for Disease Control and Prevention was established in 2001, which monitors the operation of hospitals, health centres, and the blood transfusion centre in Macau. It also handles the organization of care and prevention of diseases affecting the population, sets guidelines for hospitals and private healthcare providers, and issues licences.As of 2016 Macau healthcare authorities send patients to Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong in instances where the local Macau hospitals are not equipped to deal with their scenarios, and many Macau residents intentionally seek healthcare in Hong Kong because they place more trust in Hong Kong doctors than in Mainland-trained doctors operating in Macau.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nEducation in Macau does not have a single centralised set of standards or curriculum. Individual schools follow different educational models, including Chinese, Portuguese, Hong Kong, and British systems. Children are required to attend school from the age of five until completion of lower secondary school, or at age 15. Of residents aged 3 and older, 69 per cent completed lower secondary education, 49 per cent graduated from an upper secondary school, 21 per cent earned a bachelor's degree or higher. Mandatory education has contributed to an adult literacy rate of 96.5 per cent. While lower than that of other developed economies, the rate is due to the influx of refugees from mainland China during the post-war colonial era. Much of the elderly population were not formally educated due to war and poverty.Most schools in the territory are private institutions. Out of the 77 non-tertiary schools, 10 are public and the other 67 are privately run. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau maintains an important position in territorial education, managing 27 primary and secondary schools. The government provides 15 years of free education for all residents enrolled in publicly run schools, and subsidises tuition for students in private schools. Students at the secondary school level studying in neighbouring areas of Guangdong are also eligible for tuition subsidies.The vast majority of schools use Cantonese as the medium of instruction, with written education in Chinese and compulsory classes in Mandarin. A minority of private schools use English or Portuguese as the primary teaching language. Luso-Chinese schools mainly use Chinese, but additionally require mandatory Portuguese-language classes as part of their curriculum.Macau has ten universities and tertiary education institutes. The University of Macau, founded in 1981, is the territory's only public comprehensive university. The Kiang Wu Nursing College of Macau is the oldest higher institute, specialising in educating future nursing staff for the college's parent hospital. The University of Saint Joseph, Macau University of Science and Technology, and the City University of Macau were all established in subsequent years. Five other institutes specialise in specific vocations or provide continuing education.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe mixing of the Chinese and Portuguese cultures and religious traditions for more than four centuries has left Macau with an inimitable collection of holidays, festivals and events. The biggest event of the year is the Macau Grand Prix in November, when the main streets in Macau Peninsula are converted to a racetrack bearing similarities with the Monaco Grand Prix. Other annual events include Macau Arts festival in March, the International Fireworks Display Contest in September, the International Music festival in October and/or November, and the Macau International Marathon in December.\nThe Lunar Chinese New Year is the most important traditional festival and celebration normally takes place in late January or early February. The Pou Tai Un Temple in Taipa is the place for the Feast of Tou Tei, the Earth god, in February. The Procession of the Passion of Our Lord is a well-known Roman Catholic rite and journey, which travels from Saint Austin's Church to the Cathedral, also taking place in February.A-Ma Temple, which honours the Goddess Matsu, is in full swing in April with many worshippers celebrating the A-Ma festival. In May it is common to see dancing dragons at the Feast of the Drunken Dragon and twinkling-clean Buddhas at the Feast of the Bathing of Lord Buddha. In Coloane Village, the Taoist god Tam Kong is also honoured on the same day. Dragon Boat Festival is brought into play on Nam Van Lake in June and Hungry Ghosts' festival, in late August and/or early September every year. All events and festivities of the year end with Winter Solstice in December.\nMacau preserves many historical properties in the urban area. The Historic Centre of Macau, which includes some twenty-five historic locations, was officially listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO on 15 July 2005 during the 29th session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Durban, South Africa.\nHowever, the Macao government is criticized for ignoring the conservation of heritage in urban planning. In 2007, local residents of Macao wrote a letter to UNESCO complaining about construction projects around world heritage Guia Lighthouse (Focal height 108 meters), including the headquarter of the Liaison Office (91 meters). UNESCO then issued a warning to the Macau government, which led former Chief Executive Edmund Ho to sign a notice regulating height restrictions on buildings around the site. In 2015, the New Macau Association submitted a report to UNESCO claiming that the government had failed to protect Macao's cultural heritage against threats by urban development projects. One of the main examples of the report is that the headquarter of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, which is located on the Guia foothill and obstructs the view of the Guia Fortress (one of the world heritages symbols of Macao). One year later, Roni Amelan, a spokesman from UNESCO Press service, said that the UNESCO has asked China for information and is still waiting for a reply. In 2016, the Macau government approved an 81-meter construction limit for the residential project, which reportedly goes against the city's regulations on the height of buildings around world heritage site Guia Lighthouse.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nFood in Macau is mainly based on both Cantonese and Portuguese cuisine, drawing influences from Indian and Malay dishes as well, reflecting a unique cultural and culinary blend after centuries of colonial rule. Portuguese recipes were adapted to use local ingredients, such as fresh seafood, turmeric, coconut milk, and adzuki beans. These adaptations produced Macanese variations of traditional Portuguese dishes including caldo verde, minchee, and cozido \u00e0 portuguesa. While many restaurants claim to serve traditional Portuguese or Macanese dishes, most serve a mix of Cantonese-Portuguese fusion cuisine. Galinha \u00e0 portuguesa is an example of a Chinese dish that draws from Macanese influences, but is not part of Macanese cuisine. Cha chaan teng, a type of fast casual diner originating in Hong Kong that serves that region's interpretation of Western food, are also prevalent in Macau. Pastel de nata, pork chop buns, and almond biscuits are popular street food items.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nDespite its small area, Macau is home to a variety of sports and recreational facilities that have hosted a number of major international sporting events, including the 2005 East Asian Games, the 2006 Lusophony Games, and the 2007 Asian Indoor Games.\nThe territory regularly hosts the Macau Grand Prix, one of the most significant annual motorsport competitions that uses city streets as the racetrack. It is the only street circuit that hosts Formula Three, touring car, and motorcycle races in the same event. The Guia Circuit, with narrow corner clearance and a winding path, is considered an extremely challenging course and a serious milestone for prospective Formula One racers.Macau represents itself separately from mainland China with its own sports teams in international competitions. The territory maintains its own National Olympic Committee, but does not compete in the Olympic Games. Current International Olympic Committee rules specify that new NOCs can only be admitted if they represent sovereign states (Hong Kong has participated in the Olympics since before the regulation change in 1996).\n\n\n== Twin towns and sister cities ==\nMacau has six sister cities, listed chronologically by year joined:\n\nAdditionally, Macau has other cultural agreements with the following cities:\n\n Brussels, Belgium (1991)\n San Francisco, United States (2001)\n Da Nang, Vietnam (2006)\n Phuket, Thailand (2018)\n\n\n=== Union of Luso-Afro-Americo-Asiatic Capital Cities ===\nMacau is part of the Union of Luso-Afro-Americo-Asiatic Capital Cities from 28 June 1985, establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHong Kong\nIndex of Macau-related articles\nOutline of Macau\nCuiheng New Area, since 31 March 2013, a co-operation pilot zone with Macau\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n==== Government reports ====\n\n\n==== Academic publications ====\n\n\n==== Legislation ====\n\n\n==== Print ====\n\n\n==== News articles ====\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Macau\".

          "Beautiful European square within Asia. Structure is fantastic, however, so overcrowded it's uncomfortable. The square is so packed it's difficult to truly enjoy the place. It's also extremely loud as everybody sounds like they're screaming at each other. Would recommend you",

          "Going to Senado Square felt like going to Romer in Frankfurt or Marienplatz square in Munich. The photos looks the same. Except, in Macau, everywhere you go, you can see local delights,cosmetics, jewellery shop and pharmacy. Weird but great. You get everything you want in Macau",
          "Really busy area with tourists but it's still quite relaxed, great to take a stroll here after getting some ice cream or egg tarts. There's alot of shopping to do here too, mainly clothing stores",

          "Largo do Senado is one of the most beautiful places in Macau. it is a large square painted with stately Portuguese mansions. Despite of the tourist crowd, visitors can still imagine the former colony's European flair here.",
          "If in Macau you might as well go have a look at Senado Square, one little bit of culture among a sea of glitzy casinos. We were there around 2pm on a Saturday and it was full of Chinese tourists, pretty claustrophobic, there might be a better time to visit.",
          "What I liked about Senado Sq. were the little alleys that branched off the main square. It was here that I found great restaurants and shops. Plus, it was away from the absolute craziness and selfie-takers of the square. I suggest go early (which I did on my second day in Macau)",

          "This is where shopping is taken very seriously by the shop owners. They all have promos of all kinds. The best shops are the food stores. Do not rush and panic buy, just go around and check everything if you are not in a hurry and make comparison list of prices. More or",
          "You can get your souvenir from all the shops here. When to one small eatery, surprisingly, they served very good congnee and dim sum but i just can't remember the shop name. Tried the curry fish Ball in one of the roadside stall [very clean], and it was so yummy. You can try",

          "Where different nationalities meet.Almost everyday in this place too much people too much tourist.Macau is a great place indeed",
          "Nothing really special here, although as part of a walkabout round the old town okay. Macau is basically a huge gambling area for the rich Chinese (and other rich tourists). Not that much to do except wander around.",
          "Beautiful, Mediterranean feel of the main town square. It would be fantastic with every scrap of horrible decoration removed that were suppose to make mainland Chinese tourists feel at home. Why would you spoil such a beautiful place.",
          "What can I say, it is a like a street in Europe, but in Macau.. if you are from Europe you will probably be underwhelmed by the buildings, and a bit overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of Chinese Tourists. My wife wanted to do it,so we did it. I could have taken it or left it.",
          "Old Portuguese style square with a 16th century church, some tiled frescoes, baroque buildings and lots of shops, especially pastellerias. A worth visit when in Macau.",

          "This view is perfect. Bright, sunny and soo beautiful. I'm feelin' like I'm in Europe, with such a beautiful view and ambience. You can see so many shops sell Macau snacks like Portugese egg tart, pudding, and pork sandwiches, it's all delicious. Be sure to buy one at its best",
          "The square and surrounding area especially the route up to the Ruins of St. Paul's and all the many shops along the way is something everyone visiting Macau must see, but be prepared for bustling crowds.",
          "Nothing special but worth having a stroll through since you can't say you've explored Macau until you do. It's a European-style square, with shops. Koi Kei at every corner, and delicious Chinese food abounds. Walk for 10-15 minutes in the right direction and you\"ll find yourself",
          "It seems to be in Europe in one of the most important European capitals in stead of Macau. Nice and interesting city to see once in a life.",
          "It is bigger that you thing. The people will try to let you walk to the ruins of st pauls. But if you take just a little de tour you will find nearrow streat. And cute little houses. There it will give you the feel of the European meditaranion, the style the portuguese used when",

          "Spent 1/2 a day wandering around the older parts of the city. The square was a major part. Loads of shops and cafes. We had a few good snacks in some of the side streets of the square. There's a small fresh market but was of no interest to us as we weren't looking to",
          "Great place to see what there is to see beyond the casinos. Pretty buildings, nice for walking and interesting to look at.",
          "This is a lovely place to visit. Small cobbled streets with lots of outdoor eateries with a wide variety of vendors. Cathedral cafe is just off the square near the cathedral- another great place if your hungry and looking for good food and drink. Large plates.",

          "Two things that jump out from this square, the yellow mustard color building with Portuguese architecture and the black and white tile paving. This wave shape is exactly the same as in Lisbon, a unique continuous wave that is so beautiful to look at, either with lots of people",
          "The square was named after the Leal Senado, a meeting place for the Chinese and Portuguese in the 16th to 18th centuries, located directly in front of the square, where Leal Senado Building stands today which majority of the buildings around the square are European styled and",
          "Worth a visit in Macau to experience Portuguese Architecture. It does get very crowded though, so plan accordingly Visit this along with the Ruins of St. Paul's. They are located within walking distance. The buildings have shops (some from big brands) on the ground floor.",
          "Visited Macau for a day and our first stop was Largo de Senado. It's a nice place to walk around to look at old Portuguese architecture, as well as shop for souvenirs (along the side roads).",
          "This is probably the best spot in Macau to see the Portuguese influence on architecture. At its highpoint, it was the place for the social elite to meet and greet. Now, it is just a tourist area with lots of shops. It is charming, in that the architecture brings you to another",
          "There are many branded shops there. You can reach there by bus from cotai central easily. There is usually rush in this area. But its ok.",
          "good place to go in the evening to take pics and do cheap shopping also. have chinese artefacts shops also.",
          "The Portuguese heritage isn\u2019t more present than at the Largo do Senado. Felt like Lisboa, worth a visit!",
          "The square should be very crowded during day time and early evening. The whole impression there should be more or less like in a European town. Of course, proabbaly 95% of the people there are tourists. It still owrth to be there once at least.",
          "The place where you can feel the Portuguese vibes, it didn\u2019t feel like you are in China, must visit place in Macau, very instagram able, with loads of interesting food",
          "The walk from St Paul's church ruins to St Domenic's church, opens out to Seado Square which contains lots of modern shops in old 3 storey classic Portuguese buildings. I actually preferred walking on the street into the square where the shopping was more unique and interesting",
          "The most important & touristy place among the others, full of shops, restaurants, cafes, & off course historical area such as Holy House of Mercy, Civic & Municipal Affairs Bureau, Se Cathedral Macau, St. Doiminic Church, Na Cha Temples, & of course Ruins of St. Paul & Monte",
          "Very nice place in the historical center of Macau. A great place to hike. From Largo do Senado we have access to several charming streets and tourist spots. In the tour we contemplate Portuguese colonial architecture mixed with small contemporary buildings.",

          "The ground - or floor - is simply fantastic! It is made the way the Portuguese did build walkways, with black and white granite with Portuguese motives (caravels, arrows, waves). It is beautiful! When I visited or passed by several times, at different times of day and week, was",
          "Well worth visiting this square to enjoy the area though very busy. Plenty of shops to see and plenty to do and take photos. It\u2019s s lovely walk and might be nicer very early in the day or later in the afternoon with less people. Still fun though",
          "I visited Senado Square both in the afternoon and the evening. It's a very nice spot where you can find restaurants and shops.",
          "Architecture is definitely European, especially with a very strong Mediterranean influence. Apart from that, everything is hardcore asia. Great place to shop, if you have money left after gambling, that is...",
          "Distinguished by the wavy pavements. Now surrounded by banks and generic retails shops like Watson's, shame!",
          "Other than the beautiful building and architectural. It has lots of shops selling souvenirs and food. It is also my center of location if I got lost to where I want to go. I just go back to Senado Square. I have asked few local how to go to Senado Square they actually don't",
          "It looks really nice.the place the houses architecture is so not chinese and the mixing of chinese culture with portuges one is amazing. Very nice to go around at night with so many lights.",
          "The square is worth a visit albeit too commercialised in recent years due to the entrance of many franchise stores. Still a nice walk through to get to the Ruins of St Paul\u2019s. Can be very crowded. The pastel coloured buildings are photogenic. Great for photo opportunity.",
          "I enjoyed being at Senado-Square actually. Its definitely one of central Macau highlights, and the square is although very old, very well mentained by the council. As every square, this square is also full of stores and shopping streets that is both nice, though it can be",
          "Good idea to spend some time walking around this area if you are keen to try Macau\u2019s recommended eats. Many alleys and sloping walks to explore. Avoid the weekends if possible. The square itself is pretty and quaint. Also a shopping area with foreign brands like Lush and Laniege.",
          "It was so nice to see the tile work on the streets, too many tourists- - shopping! The buildings around it were quite magnificent, all built in the Portuguese style. A must visit in Macau",
          "Nicely maintained surroundings bring back the historic Portuguese influences. All around it is quite amazing to see the combination of Portuguese and Chinese characters, something one does not see too much or too often. However the place was just too busy and crowded to truly",

          "This is a beautiful square. The buildings in this square are bright and colourful - and for a moment i thought I was in Portugal. The black and white cobblestones are very Portuguese in character - so sometimes it is difficult to imagine that you are in Asia. It is a busy",

          "The walk from Senado Square to St. Paul's is beautiful, paved with the beautiful undulating black and white cobblestones used throughout Portugal and its territories. It's quite interesting to be in Asia but be surrounded by Portuguese architecture. Loads of shops, especially",
          "visited at night in december and it was amazing. the christmas decoration give stunning view for tourist",
          "Although it's tempting to head straight to Cotai, it's definitely worth spending an hour or two in the cobbled streets of the square. Surreal mix of Chines and Portugese architecture and food",
          "I always enjoy spending time at Senado Square during Chinese New Year even if the crowds are insane at times. This year, the standard fountain decorations and performance platform where on display and performances were very enjoyable to watch. The 238 metre dragon paraded",
          "Do a quick walk through - if you have been to other Portuguese colonies this will not impress much. It\u2019s a very short stretch of old world architecture and gets pretty crowded. It is also depressing to see how commercial it is ! Shops shops and more people ! Spend less than 30",
          "We had a nice visit walking through this square and seeing some historic district sites. Be aware, it's very crowded with the tourists from Mainland China who have no consideration for anyone else besides themselves.",
          "Nice place to stroll around for a few hours. Nice shops, restaurants and things to see. Lots of people so not too relaxing.",
          "Lovely cheerful streets and Portuguese flavour all across. Visited at the time of new year..so was even more crowded.",
          "We were there on a Sunday so it was super duper crowded. You cankt walk properly since you will be dragged by people walking in different directions. Because of the crowds you cannot appreciate and enjoy the place anymore.",

          "This square reminded me so much of when I was in Italy. The cobblestone, the decor of the building, the architecture, and the colors used made it so lively. Many people were there to take advantage of the time when it wasn't TOO crowded.",
          "It is a famous place in the centre of Macau, however if you come on the peak busy times, such as week ends or big holidays, then this place will really and literally full with tourists, mostly come from China (not offending though) so crowded that every direction you take",
          "On its facade, the place seemed small. But explore further you'll find each small alley leads to even more shops, restaurants and bakeries. You can spend HOURS here!",

          "Had a good walk in and around this location. Follow the signage for the respective nearby monuments. Place becomes very lively at night. The lights and the decor help. Good for shopping too. Make sure to wander into tiny the hidden streets to get a taste of the local flavor.",
          "The place is pretty incredible, but if you look carefully, some of the painting on the ceiling are starting to fall off, and really hope they can clean the man-made river too",
          "It is a nice place but enough to visit one evening and maybe once during daytime. Many shops with specific food and things from macao. In my oppinion 1 day is enough to visit Macao, more is just for who plays in casino because the visiting options are small.",
          "The historic buildings are beautiful, but they clash with the Lunar New Year decor that's currently all over the square. Best to come at night, so it's not too crowded and you can enjoy looking at all the old buildings and dropping by a few shops.",
          "This place is building of stores, every travelers come to Macau must visit this place for its unique building and view concept. This place is surrounded by lot of stores. The stores is open till 9pm or 10pm. The spot pictures at the side of the small street is very beautifull at",

          "My first view of the Senado Square was that I was in a European country based on the architecture that was spread all around. The pavement of cobble stones, the Gothic structures reminds one of the historical background. The place is a must see in Macau and most of the visitors",
          "We visit senado square after \"Ruins of St.Paul\" which is on the night.. and it just amazing for taking picture.. and for you guys that loved to shop, there is a lot of store near this place.. you can visit it here..",
          "We was there before Chinese New Year started but I think that there always a lot of people. Nice square, nice buildings and decorations. We went for lunch to Pizza Hut near the square. It was cost for us 27 usd for 1 pizza. Prices are crazy expensive in this area. Better to go",
          "The European-style buildings that make up this square are quite a departure from the typical mid-20th century Chinese-style apartment and office blocks that surround it. While I found the structures to be well maintained, providing for some nice photo opportunities, it was the",

          "Went there on a late Thursday afternoon hoping it would be less crowded but I was wrong. I was expecting to see old structures but the buildings looked freshly painted. The character of the place somehow got lost in all the restoration. If you wish to bring home some goodies",
          "We enjoyed the architecture, atmosphere and the energy of Largo do Senado. The area has a rhythm to it - like a beating heart. It is a promenade with only foot traffic and lots of interesting stores, restaurants and shops.",

          "I didn\u2019t much enjoy my Macau day trip - I tried to solo navigate, and making the map (and even Google Maps) make sense became too much for me. Interestingly, the locals were generally unwilling to help, and sometimes rude, even when I politely pointed at the picture of what I",

        "wiki": "The Ruins of Saint Paul's (Chinese: \u5927\u4e09\u5df4\u724c\u574a; Portuguese: Ru\u00ednas de S\u00e3o Paulo) are the ruins of a 17th-century Catholic religious complex in Santo Ant\u00f3nio, Macau, China. They include what was originally St. Paul's College and the Church of St. Paul (Igreja de S\u00e3o Paulo) also known as \"Mater Dei\", a 17th-century Portuguese church dedicated to Saint Paul the Apostle. Today, the ruins are one of Macau's best known landmarks and one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World. In 2005, they were officially listed as part of the Historic Centre of Macau, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBuilt from 1602 to 1640  by the Jesuits, the church was one of the largest Catholic churches in Asia at the time. With the decline in importance of Macau, which was overtaken as the main port for the Pearl River Delta by Hong Kong, the building's fortunes similarly ebbed, and it was destroyed by a fire during a typhoon on 26 January 1835. The Fortaleza do Monte overlooks the ruin. This could have been due to Francesco Melzi showing the codex to Carlo Spinola in Milan or by the architect Giacomo della Porta (connected to Leonardo's Codex, formerly Codex Leicester, now owned by Bill Gates) who designed the fa\u00e7ade of the Church of the Ges\u00f9 in Rome.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe ruins now consist of the southern stone fa\u00e7ade\u2014intricately carved between 1620 and 1627 by Japanese Christians in exile from their homeland and local craftsmen under the direction of Italian Jesuit Carlo Spinola\u2014and the crypts of the Jesuits who established and maintained the church. The fa\u00e7ade sits on a small hill, with 68 stone steps leading up to it. The carvings include Jesuit images with Oriental themes, such as The Blessed Virgin Mary stepping on a seven-headed hydra, described in Chinese characters as 'Holy Mother tramples the heads of the dragon'. A few of the other carvings are of the founders of the Jesuit Order, the conquest of Death by Jesus, and at the very top, a dove with wings outstretched.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nResisting calls for the dangerously leaning structure to be demolished, from 1990 to 1995, the ruins were excavated under the auspices of the Instituto Cultural de Macau to study its historic past. The crypt and the foundations were uncovered, revealing the architectural plan of the building. Numerous religious artifacts were also found together with the relics of the Chinese Christian martyrs and the monastic clergy, including the founder of the Jesuit college in Macau, Father Alessandro Valignano.The ruins were restored by the Macanese government into a museum, and the fa\u00e7ade is now buttressed with concrete and steel in a way which preserves the aesthetic integrity of the fa\u00e7ade. A steel stairway allows tourists to climb up to the top of the fa\u00e7ade from the rear.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nReligion in Macau\n\n\n== References ==\n Media related to Ruins of St. Paul's at Wikimedia Commons\n192183185  Ruins of Saint Paul's on OpenStreetMap",

          "I would suggest visiting St Pauls ruins on a weekday. Sunday was very crowded and not at all comfortable. Otherwise it is worth a visit. The view of the ruins from Robuchon au Dome on the 43rd flour of the Hotel Lisbon is quite special.",
          "Visited during the day tour under Macau Discovery Tour, by Cotai Travel. Nothing much, just a left over church that surrounded by a lot Street food and shopping alley. Worth to visit if you are 1st tinder at Macau.",
          "It was nice to see I took an early morning walk getting there just before 8am and would recommend this you won\u2019t get a picture with people around but there are some nice snaps to be had take time to walk to the right side of the ruin and up to the fort for a view across Macau",
          "We visited on what was a hot and sunny day. We were able to walk around freely and explore the area. There were many if other tourists in the area when we were there. The historical fortress is very close and is also with checking out.",
          "This place is still worth visiting even during the night as this city is still very alive at night. I had my concern when I visited Macau from HK and arrived at 3 pm and thinking I wouldn't be able to maximize my stay but everything worked out just fine. Don't be afraid to",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit anytime of the day or night, the walk is perfect in any weather, rain or sun, lots of shops nearby selling fruits and vegetables including ice-cream, staff all friendly and welcoming.",
          "The weather is rather hot at this timing. So do bring along some water. Scenery is beautiful when you look from the fort down at the St. Paul ruins. A small Chinese temple besides the ruin is rather interesting.",
          "Its on the top of the list of things to see, it is a great spot to look at however it is overrun by tour buses. Getting a photo without 100 other people in it is almost impossible - it rained whilst i was there, then the steps are clear so i took a photo. so pray for a 5 minute",
          "One of the places where you only need to go once to check it off your list. Really crowded with Chinese tourists.",
          "Anyine vistung macao must go there There are alot of shops around Check them all but, take care of you are a muslim because the offer alot of non-halal options Try juices, ice creams and so Egg tart is fine as well",
          "We came here for photo stop only. We also have lunch near the church and shopping around the senado square. We bought egg tart and pork chop bun near the church.",
          "Visited the famous St. Paul Ruins In Macau. Stayed here for almost a month and the experience was awesome. Meeting new people, culture and learning new language.",
          "This one of the must visited place in macau, there is a lot of shop sell food or souvernir around this place. But you better take umbrella if you want to go there because no place for shelter from the rain.",
          "This remains of a one-time Church is a must visit for Macau. There is a museum below tells you about our glorified history and mistakes.",
          "This is the fa\u00e7ade that remains from this church burning down many times over the last few hundred years. Finally, they just stopped rebuilding it. You can't miss it during a walk around old Macau and the site is near a place taxis will often drop you off. Great for a variety of",
          "We went there once while being in maco though lot of people come there to see this historical place but we did not enjoy much",
          "This place must be one of the most visited place in Macau. It was packed with tourist even it was a working day. Standing majestically after so many years",
          "We looked at the Ruins of St. Paul as part of our private tour of Macau. It was pretty cool that it is the only thing left standing, and our tour guide pointed out some details on the facade and told us some stories about what they represent and whatnot. But frankly we only",
          "We took a taxi from Venetian to the ruins, it only cost $75hk, and was well worth the trip. We wandered around the area for about 2 hours, venture past the ruins into the city, try the Portuguese egg tarts, they are delicious",
          "The ruins of St. Paul's was a 'must see' while here. Impressive surviving architecture, seen and ticked as such, as usual the experience spoiled by being jostled by, mostly, Chinese.",
          "The place is tourist attraction so there will be people taking photo everywhere. I recommend the place on the hill for photo shooting. And so angle will be better under shadow. It will be useful since the hot sun will makes every photos ruined.",
          "No matter what time it was, this place is filled with tourists. And I do mean swarming with them. The night view is really pretty though. Do visit it at night if you can. I tried going at 8.30am hoping there'll be a lesser crowd, but there were already 3 tour groups there. If",
          "the ruins itself is just good for photospot but it has much different angle to capture. Nothing much to do with the ruins. Macau's land icon. Must visit place when you come to macau. Located near with senado square, you can do shopping or just chillin out there.",
          "At the heart of city ...this the most iconic of macau afterthe old lisbua casino. You should go there early in morning avoid the mainland tourist.",
          "Get some pics clicked and pose differently on the stairs in front of the monument as this is an important and most prominenet landmark of city. There are shops available right at the bottom of stairs where you can have some local egg tarts and street food to enjoy.",
          "The Ruins of St. Paul is the most recognizable landmark in Macau. It\u2019s also next to the Macau museum.",
          "Worth having a look whilst in Macau ,go early 9.30am two reasons beat the heat and lots of busses come in around 10-10;30",
          "History in your face. Fought over by priests. Battled over by invaders and saved by the people of Macau and their slaves who were given their freedom for their loyalty and love of their adopted city Visit this then go up the escalator to the Monte Fortress . History of Macau",
          "Macau is a charming laid back colony with very well preserved architecture and food tradition with a mix of Portuguese and Chinese influence. The most famous is of course, the world renowned Ruins of St Paul Church situated in the heart of the colony amidst the modern casinos",
          "Very historical wall. A lot of tourists are taking picture of this unique wall. Behind this wall, there is a Museum of Sacred Art. It is worth to pay a visit.",
          "You haven't been to Macau if you don't visit the Ruins! A must do. A visit huts the place into some context. There are many other historical sights nearby, excellent area to stroll about. Can get very busy, though.",
          "Full of people but still can get the sense of history and culture around you. Local people are friendly. You can always find a quiet spot to taste Macau of its padt, present, and future.",
          "The ruins of St. Paul\u2019s is a smaller ruin , but definitely a must see in Macau. It\u2019s not strenuous and very nice picture for sure.. Go early to avoid the crowds (and the heat in the summer)",
          "is this beautiful facade with 68 stone steps leading up to it. It's the only part left of a Catholic church built in the 1600's and dedicated to St Paul the Apostle It was destroyed by a fire in a typhoon in 1835. It was dangerously leaning and considered to be demolished, but",
          "I wish I could go back in time and been there when it was built from 1602 to 1640 by the Jesuits. At one time, it was one of the largest Catholic churches in Asia. It was destroyed by a fire during a typhoon in 1835. The ruins are comprised of the southern stone fa\u00e7ade,",
          "one big ancient wall packed with people covering every inch of path. Still need to see for first timer. afterward, walk up to see the fort and old canon gun. some interesting spot for pictures and good place to see almost 360 of macau including the nice sunset view.",
          "Nice for a photo but other than that the ruins of st.pauls is quite boring. The walk there is always super crowded and Macau weather is usually too humid to enjoy this experience. If you want a nicer experience at this location then visit at night.",
          "Impressive structure on top of a hill. I went there early morning to avoid the tour groups so it was not so crowded and I could soak up the atmosphere and have a walk around the neighbourhood.",
          "If you are in Macau then you should not miss going to the Ruins because this is the city s iconic attraction. With plenty of street signs to guide us, it was easy to find Senado square and the ruins. It was crowded but we were expecting this as the Ruins of St Paul=Macau as",
          "Never come to Macau on the weekend. Macau has became the weekend getaway spot for the Chinese in Mainland China. All the streets and attractions are flooded with people. I would enjoy a lot more with less people.",
          "Iconic tourist spot worth a visit. Just too many tourists so our photos came out looking like we belonged to a tour group instead of just the 2 of us!",
          "always love to come here. If you want to take photos...better come early in the morning. so you can enjoy to take it.",
          "Not a lot here to be honest. Not really ruins, just the facade. Very crowded with tourists. Depending from which way you access it, there may be many steps to be climb.",
          "Pretty ruins and good for photos. Free to enter. We must have missed the guide notes because we hadn\u2019t got a clue what we were really looking at downstairs. Not sure if there was a list downstairs so may be restrictive for people who may struggle with stairs. Allow 10mins for",
          "It's one of the historic places of Macau and right in midst of the city markets so can easily be visited on a Macau visit. The ruins are always full of people taking selfies or families having picnic around so I guess it gets difficult to click pics here in silo but you can",
          "This is the place everyone associates with Macau. Only one wall remains ( the rest burnt down 200 years ago) but the in situ archaeology has been well displayed to give you an idea of its former glory. Right in the heart of the old town of is a great place to begin.",
          "Busy, but worth it. Superb bit of history in the centre of Macau! If you walk to the top of the Monte de Forte you can get some great photos of the ruins and the skyline. Also, a lot of great almond biscuits and dry meat shops in the area! They are always handing or free",
          "It is just incredible and amazing how the fa\u00e7ade of this centuries-old Catholic church has withstood the ravages of war and time, and was meticulously and expertly preserved for millions of present-day tourists to see and admire. It is just incredible and amazing how the entire",
          "Mobbed and crowded most of the time but iconic ruins in Macau - cute Temple at the top too - try visiting at night for less crowded experience.",
          "come early morning or late afternoon otherwise u won't get pictures without the crowd of tourists ...",
          "We liked this place very much since we went to this place after 5.30pm they never allowed to t check the museum",
          "A highlight on our day trip to Macau was visiting the ruins of this once magnificent church which sits adjacent to the Mount Fortress in the centre of Macau. A very popular with tourists and locals alike so expect big crowds of people. Do yourself a favour and climb up to the",
          "A beautiful remnant of the good old Portuguese days remains in the heart of the city. You definitely must drop by when doing a visit to Macau, and the area has many good restaurants around to. A lovely European feel in the heart of Asia.",
          "Fantastic old ruins, which make the so called 'old' buildings in Australia look token by comparison. This thing is many hundreds of years old, and the restoration / stabilisation has been done very sensitively. I fear that the steps will get loved to death, much like Angkor Wat.",
          "We went there at night coz we heard it would be very hot in the morning and the crowd is too much. At night, there weren't that many tourists so we made the right choice. Going there you could see lots of street foods. There is also a coffee shop at the beginning of the stairs",
          "Have been to St Paul Ruins during my very recent trip to Macau (May 2019) as part of family vacation. Just to set the expectations right, it is remaining ruins in true sense with just one big wall of church standing tall(with reinforcement structire extending support from",
          "One of the few places in macau to visit apart from casinos. Approach is through alleys with food shops that dont smell great. It was very hot and humid when i went and there is shade next to museum to relax or visit the fort next to it.",
          "An interesting and busy place to visit. You need time to really check this out. Unfortunately we did not but if you have time, take it to learn about this place. The history is incredible and there are some sights that will truly amaze you. There are so many places to see in",
          "The narrow streets leads to this place has many busy shops and you can taste many free food samples, enjoy!",
          "One of the oldest place by the colonial time and still looks amazing, it's good to visit this place and to buy souvenir from Macao, so who ever visit Macao do not miss this Ruins St. Paul's as this one of the iconic place in Macao",
          "Not really ruins as it really just the facade that is left - beautiful none the less. Very, very popular with tourists!",
          "I love the facade structure. Could see some reconstruction support from the back, perhaps an initiative to preserve the architecture. There was a mini museum underneath and no entrance fee. It was very touristy, so many people. I\u2019m not a fan of crowds so I left this place as",
          "We went early to avoid the crowds and the heat and stayed for around 30 minutes then walked to Largo Senado.",
          "It's a must see historical facade. The worst part is maneuvering through the very crowded streets to get there. But we enjoyed the entire area. Not much else to see in Macau since we are not huge gamblers.",
          "Incredible how the facade stands tall and hardly seems affected by the years. Even on a rainy day, this immense structure takes your breath away.",
          "Not the biggest fan of Macau but I liked visiting that area of the city. Many shops and stalls around.",
          "Its nice but so crowded. Best is to go very early and be careful when its raining, it's a bit slippery, we saw a few person slipped.",
          "I really enjoyed going to the ruins, you can go down in to the crypt and see some artifacts from the old cathedral. The ruins are close to the fort, and shopping areas but be careful of the pick pockets, they are about! Otherwise it is safe to walk around and enjoy. It gets very",
          "As our tour guide Clara stated - if you come to Macau and haven't visited the Ruins of St Paul's you haven't been to Macao at all! What great history and I love that we had Clara from WinWin Tours talk us through the story and history - while you could walk around and gather",
          "Enjoyed the view from the top of the steps. The Ruins of St Paul's is right next to the fortress and museum of Macau so you can do them all at the same time. Senado Square is within walking distance, too.",
          "There are many people visiting this tourist spot of Macau. Thou crowded, but I think it is worth visiting and see the Ruins of St Paul church when in Macau. Recommended!",
          "It is officially listed as part of the Historic Centre of Macau by UNESCO. Despite the structure being overcrowded with tourists, it was still an awe-inspiring sight, and remnants of the church can also be seen in the museum and the small rooms behind the structure. You can",
          "First time to visit there with my Lil sister. Many tourists. Lots of shops, variety of food and snacks to try. The St. Paul itself is worried to see. Once in a lifetime, must visit place. See it with ur own eyes.",
          "This is awesome something never seen before but my oh my its busy place. Few steps to top and has displays at back worth a visit",
          "Everything we hear about this place was real. The history is beautifully preserved and well maintained. The Portugese left Macao with lots of impressive architecture that brings back the colonial age. Macau is truly an impressive country and we can't help but falling in love",
          "Perhaps Macau\u2019s most famous landmark, the Ruins of St. Paul\u2019s, located at the top of a small hill. It attracts plentiful visitors, the place was really crowded. It is officially listed as part of the Historic Centre of Macau by UNESCO. However, now one can see only the remains",
          "We went in the evening because of a storm pouring down rain before we checked into the hotel. Do check the local weather after arrival before booking a day tour as rain is possible.",
          "A remain of the Main cathedral that was left from the Portuguese era , not really much to see at that part of the old town . Unless you want to explore the old town with history of the Portuguese missionary era , and to stroll around for a couple of hours between the small",
          "Truly worth a visit in despite of its thousands of visitors that make it one of the most crowded places in sassy Macau. Walking up and down hill and front and back the Ruins as well provide the best views.",
          "I was glad I went there, however never seen so many people in such a small area anywhere like this before and I am 60 years old now. Mainly mainland chinese who know nothing about manners and being polite so be careful or maybe arrive very early in day seems chinese do not like",
          "Visited the route of St. Paul today and had a very pleasant experience. Macau is rich in history lots to do in CB on casinos, get out there and enjoy it",
          "The marble facade of the city's cathedral (the rest of the church has been demolished) on a hill in the city, a UNESCO monument. The surrounding area is beautifully restored with a paved and wide scale, while there are several shops around the base.",
          "So many people there but good many people take photos but night time view not clear but it\u2019s look good my friend so happy I take to them go there say nice place if have chance visit with family",
          "A real piece of Macau's Portuguese historical roots. The view is impressive from the bottom of the stairs.",
          "The day we visited it was raining however there were still a lot of people there. The ruins are worth seeing and the walking trail around various other sites was interesting.There are many food vendors in the streets leading up to the ruins offering many tasty treats.",
          "Its Ruins of St. Paul cathedral. When we visited, it was under renovation. Though a very busy place given the density of tourism in Macau, its one of the few places to visit!! Do try the original Egg Tart on the way back!!",
          "We first visited Macau in 1974 and St. Paul\u2019s and wasn\u2019t as crowded, didn\u2019t have any casinos or commercial development, just a fantastic look of colonial Portugal. Last week the crowds and tour groups were overwhelming. But the ruins were still impressive. The government has",
          "It's definitely worth a visit but don't plan to stay too long because apart from the ruins of the front of the church, there's nothing really there. And if you come from the City as most people do, you'll notice that besides the stairs leading up to the Church ruins, there are",
          "Whent there in the afternoon and went there at night. Both view are nice. At night its less crowded but i cant take good pictures with my phone",
          "Been here a number of times over the last ten years whenever we come to Macau. However, given that our friends were visiting Macau for the first time, we felt compelled to bring them here as it is one of the most recognisable landmark of Macau. We deliberately went on a",
          "We went through on our way back to hotel. Was interesting to see with a nice view from the hill and its castle",
          "We visit on a weekday with no bank holidays and the place was rammed. This is very lovely as it mixes Europe with Asia but spoiled by far too many tourists crammed in a small place. If in the area go visit but we made a special trip to Hong Kong and I don't think it was worth",
          "Finally we made it to the Ruin of St Paul's Roman Cathoric Church which was built in 1602 and destroyed by fire in 1635. The granite facade is all that remains of the Church and is now Macau's most famous landmark. This remains is a World Heritage and a must go attraction in",
          "The facade is very beautiful. It is huge. Pay attention to the detail, there are some statues and carvings. I went there at noon, and I believe there are hundreds of people here taking pictures. Therefore if you want to visit here tourist free, better come early in the morning.",
          "This monument is a place to see when your in Macao. Nice place to see however very crowded so might be difficult to catch a good picture",
          "The place was packed with tourists from every part of the world. The ruins is well preserved. You don\u2019t need to hire a tourist guide as you can hear the history of the ruin in different languages just by standing there as there are many different tourist groups.",
          "The facade of St Paul\u2019s is all that remains of the church that was bombed in the Second World War, it serves as a reminder of resilience against the terrors. Very touching and a must visit.",
          "The ruins of St Paul's are not only well preserved but, exceptionally popular. This place was filled with tourists at all hours of the day.",
          "Gods place for some nice clicks in the evening.The fort at the top is also good,do visit the fort as well.",
          "One of the top sights to see when visiting Macau. Perfect photo opportunity is actually at the bottom of the steps in the little alley opposite.",
          "Going to Macau, head over to Ruins of St Paul is a must. Beautiful place to take romantic pictures. Lot\u2019s of food area too, local delights",
          "Our hotel was close to the ruins so it made finding them easy. Also, Macau does a great job at signing everything and providing directions for tourists to find the ruins. Also, you can just follow the massive crowds. Around the ruins there are signposts with history in several",
          "Next to Monte de Forte. Next to shopping area (no halal tasters/food). Look for merchandise shop near Starbucks, one of their staff is Indonesian. Must visit place when you are in Macau.",
          "Although this is an impressive ruin. Think about timing your visit as both the walk up to it and the site was very busy.",
          "The Ruins of St Paul's is a must see if you are in Macau. While it is quite a popular tourist attraction, the atmosphere is lovely. The architecture is beautiful and don't forget to take a walk behind the Ruins for another view.",
          "Visit the St Paul\u2019s Ruins is just like traveling back in time. We can imagine how magnificent the Seminar was back then. A place not to be missed, even with the millions of visitors from around the world...!",
          "It is highlighted as must see, but other than its so called history its nothing but a wall of an old church on top a crowded hill. Nothing really special",
          "I have been coming to Macau and the Ruins of St. Paul\u2019s every few years or so for the last twenty five years. I\u2019ve noticed that on every visit this site has gotten consistently more crowded and recently had noticed a huge influx of tourists mostly from Mainland China. On this",
          "Many people regards the Ruins of St. Paul's as the equivalent of Macau. Visitors can imagine the grandeur and extravagence of the cathedral simply by seeing its facade. The only down side is the hordes of tourists around the area.",
          "Once you get out from the narrows city center \u2018s street you are in front of it!!! It is amazing. No worth though climbing until the back!!!",
          "this was an excellent place tovisit was worth going there are lots of people as well there and you can get great pictures make sure you visit here !!!",
          "I personally do feel unique even tho is only left one piece of wall but this is should be the way to treasure it, and not to repair it. If repair it, that is not the original history story left over.",
          "It's an interesting place but it is getting run down. None of the placards are legible anymore so you will want to do your research before you go. The facade is still in very good shape but the entire site is packed with tourists. I had read up on it beforehand so found it",
          "The ruins itself are very well looked after, but the information stands are empty and run down. It's packed no matter what time you go, but that's part of the charm.",
          "The place has literally fallen down with just the facade remaining. Needs serious renovation! Only kidding, but it is just the facade left of this beautiful old church. Always busy with plenty of tourists, the multiple steps take you up to the cathedral\u2019s entrance. There\u2019s an",
          "Nothing too exciting but a must see site if you are in Macau. Lots of people milling about but if you go early in the morning it is pretty empty.",
          "This is just the facade of a church that was destroyed by fire in 1835 but it is one of Macau's landmarks and, therefore, worth the visit!",
          "Took a ferry from Lantau Island to Macau. Stopped at the ruins. Very busy. Lots of people here. It was small. Not a lot left to see except for the front. Some crypts. History panels all around to learn of its existence. Would recommend stopping by to have a look.",
          "This is an iconic location in Macau. It is almost customary for tourists to take a photo in front of the famous remains of this ancient church. Do manage your own expectations as other than the facade and a few glass covered tombs (with only pebbles in sight), you will not find",
          "This place is always teeming with people! It\u2019s interesting if you can get close enough. But really, good luck taking a picture without anyone else.",
          "It's a must to visit this wonderful historical place and enjoy the view of the ruins and feel the thrilling atmosphere.",
          "So sad that this is all that is left but it is stunning and historic. I never knew about the Portuguese influence on Macau but it is there and remains there - it is busy here but you can get some nice pics - I find this place quite peaceful even with all of the people - enjoy!",
          "You can never be in Macau and not have a photo of the ruins. So I dragged my 75 years old mother there, and to her exasperation there was nothing there to see except that wall standing where everyone had their photos taken. Why was it popular, Beats me. But go ahead anyway and",
          "Getting to the ruins is half the fun. The cobblestone streets are teaming with shops, little alley ways with touches of their Portugal influences. Give it a go and enjoy the people watching!",
          "Try to go as early as possible as it will be crowded after that. Walk up the stairs, you can find a small little templr on the left side.",
          "Over-rated and very crowded with tourists. It's almost impossible go get a good shot in here. The good thing is there are lots of souvenir shops nearby and amazing food stalls.",
          "If you love History this is the place to be.. u will not be disappointed.. if u are in Macau is the top attraction to visit.. Recommended!!",
          "The ruins are little more than the facade of a church and in the back a few very small exhibits. But it is right next to the Macau museum and fortress so it makes to walk by and enjoy for 15 or 20 minutes as part of a half or full day walk of the sites in the historical section",
          "This seems to be the heart of old Macao. The ruins are striking to see from a distance and the photos of the Cathedral from up on top of the fort are stunning! The whole area is so unique and cultural. You must wonder around the area and soak in the one of a kind Portuguese",
          "Crowded but a must! This iconic structure of a by-gone era proudly stands atop a hill in the old area of Macau. Immaculate gardens and quite clean despite the hordes of tourists",
          "It seemed everyone in Macau was headed here, and the crowd up the street past all the expensive food shops barely moved. It was almost as crowded on the steps to the facade, so wasn't a particularly pleasant experience. I imagine it would be a lot better if you could see it",
          "I was surprised by the amount of historical art you can see under the leftovers of the Ruins of St. Paul's. I like this area and highly recommend this spot to those who like history.",
          "The place is ok for a few pics and a bit of history but nothing much else see. The surrounding area shops were too expensive",
          "Visited on a beautiful day. Interesting facade on the hilltop. Go from the back side. Getting to the ruin from the front is super crowded.",
          "This place is a must visit place no matter how many times you\u2019ve been to Macau. The ruin of st Paul looks so majestic and sad at the same time.

          "Great reminder of Macau\u2019s Portuguese and catholic past. Not much more than a facade but you get to see the past glory of this colony for more than 300 years. This history resonates into food and family. Follow the stairs up and taste the touristy streets around it. Good luck and",

          "The impressive fa\u00e7ade of the remains of Saint Paul's and it's ability to attract huge crowds of visitors would likely surprise the architects from nearly 300 years ago. Close examination of the carved statues and symbols on the ruins reflect a sensibility to Easter and Western",
          "The ruins of the church of Saint Paul are spectacular! There are several reasons why the church is unique in the world. Only its fa\u00e7ade stands up. The fa\u00e7ade is large and very thin and the views of it from the hills close by are impressive! It is surrounded by a Chinese",
          "Once again, if you are from Europe, this is a bit underwhelming. It is the front wall of a church. The rest is missing. Plus a ton of Chinese tourists taking selfies. There are thousands of ruined churches in Europe, with hardly anyone there most of the time. I took a",

In the end, it\u2019s just the front wall of an old cathedral, there\u2019s really nothing else there and I couldn\u2019t really get all that excited about it. It\u2019s heaving with tourists too, so much so that you move",

          "I suggest you go visit this early in the morning, to avoid the crowd. There's too much pushing and shoving, many don't know how to cue or wait for their turn, which is expected for their locals. It gets really hot too if you go there close to noon time.",

          "If you want to stand around in a huge crowd to look at part of an old building then this is for you. Perhaps its due to the fact we are from Europe and had imagined it to be like Portugal with bars and restaurants along the streets where you can sit and watch the world go by",

          "A must for anyone that wants a view over Macau. If you are going on the open top bus tour around Macau, buy your tickets on the bus, they are cheaper than in the tower. One negative is the glass for photos. The shape causes reflections and images and waves, along with the color",
          "Great views and interior design. Excellent view of Macau. What makes it such a special place is the fact you have 360 degree views of the city. Nowhere in the city provides views of it all, in the way the Macau Tower Convention & Entertainment Centre does.",
          "What an incredible view and experience during my adventures in Macau! Tower 60 and having a meal on the deck where you can see people bungie jumping from the top as they fall was an added bonus of enjoyment. If you're visiting Macau, you must check out the Tower!",

          "We did the Sky walk and it was awesome. BUT, we think the price was extremely expensive as we almost give away. The view is very nice, if you spend few days in Macau, try to choose a day with a good visibility.",
          "There is very poor arrangement on the transportation after fireworks. Many people stuck in there and no way to go.",
          "Macau Tower is a great place who loves heights, unfortunately I\u2019m not. me, my friend and her bf went there around 20:00, a little bit late already. It seems we just stayed at the top for 5minutes, so for me I didn\u2019t enjoy the view that much.. next time, we\u2019ll be back and we\u2019ll",
          "The macau tower is one of most attractive place. Sky walk and bungy jumping 233 m is amazing. The shopping and dining area are very good.",
          "We went here for the Revolving Restaurant. The spread is amazing. There are a lot of food choices. And it's overlooking the city. It was lunch time and we could see the city during daytime. Must've been also nice if we tried it at night to enjoy the lights.",
          "The tower has on a normal day an easy access and is not really crowded. We went there to jump from the tower and it was not really special. It was (07.18) 145 MOP for the ticket and the ride with the elevator was fun. On top is the view amazing you are able to see the whole",
          "Not much to say. An observation deck is an observation deck. The Macau tower does have some interesting views from all sides. The glass panels in the floor are always fun to walk on. There is the \"outside\" deck too a few levels up too.",
          "It\u2019s a must go to place in Macau. Apart from being an important landmark in the city it offers wide verities of activities such as highest bungee jumping in the world, Sky walk and tower climb. Most of the tourists are attracted to this; however the tower is not just this. It",
          "A place full of adventure for adventure lovers. Just beside the sea which looks dark yellow here, a contrast from hong kong where it is blue... the tower is a man made marvel standing tall on the reclaimed area of the Macao island. Bungee jumping is the most adventurous part of",
          "A tower packed with activities for adrenaline junkies. The views are good, but I would come here again only without little kids to make use of the activities (sky walk, sky jump, bungee jump). Overall it reminds me of the Skytower in Auckland.",
          "spent 5 days visiting my best friend. While she had a car, I took shuttles and cabs to get around sometimes. It's safe. I went to the Wynn hotel (I took a shuttle from my friends place, but any hotel should have the information you need for the historical walking tour). They",
          "We had a great time at the Macau Tower! Awesome views but the best thing for us was watching people bungy jumping straight past the window we were looking out of! Wow!!! Also, walking along the glass walkway up so high was a highlight for our kids!",
          "Had visited the place in the evening and got to see a fantastic aerial view of the city of Macau with its colourful lighting in a 360 degree perspective.",
          "This is crazy! Every ten minutes someone is jumping off from the bungee spot. You can also: walk around the tower (the Skywalk), do some tower climb from the observation level up on the antenna or do a Sky Jump, basically you step aside from the same platform and your smooth",
          "If you have visited any tall building in the world, this is same. They just have few additions such as bungee jump, walk on edge...etc. nothing special. We visited this place and just walk around for few minutes because we bought tickets.",
          "They offer bungee jumping and Skywalk that both offer as additional frills to the regular deck visit.",
          "One of unforgettable place in macau and dunno best words to describe just awesome and cool place ever",
          "Took a cab here from Grand Lapa near Sands for 38MOP. We arrived at about 10.30am and there were only a few others. We bought the tickets 1 day before from Klook at a discount. It was quite easy to redeem at the counter, no need for printout.",
          "Very high so that you can see whole Macau, food is also good in restaurants. Adventurous rides. good place for photography of city",

          "A very nice place to visit in Macau. The wonderful over view of the city from this place is treat to watch.",
          "Sky walk was a bit scary to watch (more so than the bungee jump) U can't compare it with eiffel tower but watching the jet ferry and the mainland China from above was a nice experience",
          "Love the view excellent even though its raining I can still see good view, it\u2019s not too high but still me and my husband enjoyed. This is one of the attractions you should see in Macau \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
          "The Macau Tower is a good place to have a wonderful look over the city, although it is not very high compare to other towers. The best at the tower are the offered activities like a skywalk or a bungy jump. I recommend in going there, but it is not a must seen. You don't miss",
          "It was good view from top.. really good experience.. it will take almost 45 Mins to finish Macau tower visit.. glass floor is good experience.. Bungee jumping is there but too much expensive.. approx HKD 4000 per person.. Any way good experience.. must visit..",
          "we didn\u2019t dare go up the tower and see the whole city within one minute in full 360 degrees. i wanted very much to explore what\u2019s up there but it was not included in our itinerary that\u2019s already too full. i knew i missed the skywalk and the bungee jump but that\u2019s alright. i\u2019m",
          "The elevator trip was incredibly fast! Recommending everyone to buy the souvenirs made by handicapped people. Bungee jumping is terrifying.",
          "Had dinner in Tromba Rija and its amazing, hope to try the skywalk next visit and bungyjump. The only thing is shuttle buses are not too convenient from other hotels",
          "Worth a visit to The Macau Tower. If your brave enough do the bungee jump or the skywalk not for the faint hearted. I just sat on the glass floor and looked down that was enough. From the viewing deck you can see people doing the skywalk and the bungee jump. Bus stops right",
          "recently had a short HK trip with sidetrip to macau,rhe place was really an eye opener with so many developments happening in the area but macau tower by far to me was the most impressive sight,even if you dont do the extreme stuff you will enjoy spending a few hours on top",
          "An amazing must visit Tower. AJ Hackett organised activities like Skywalk, Tower climb and bungee jumping. Skywalk was as close as I could get to affordability, costing me 5000 rupees. Got to walk around the railless outer walk path and catch a view of China and Macau.",
          "We took their VIP entry and paid premium so as to experience what was there and to also taste the included VIP food. Maybe our expectations are too high as it\u2019s intended for VIPs, but sorry for us it was a disappointment. The view was great though.",
          "Good view. Recommend to go a little before sunset. The picture you take will be better. The staff will Offer the VIP card cost 215mop (normal is 145mop) . The additions are telescope card and d lounge service. The food in lounge are not tasty. No water. The good thing is you",
          "It was such a fantastic experience!! Not scary at all since we have the safety belt and all the wire will cling on to you. Is a must try when you\u2019re in macau. Awesome!!",
          "Macau tower is probably the safest jump I have down thus far. The tower is 233 meter higher. You drop securely in between harness. It\u2019s not a free jump like Victoria falls at 111 meters or Bloukrans Bridge in Cape Town at 216 meters.As it\u2019s a Tower not a bridge jump. If you want",
          "we visited 58 & 61 floor alternately , excellent view of macau & opposite across river china area , lift for going up was too fast , we reach on 61 floor in hardly less than 1 min",
          "Was there on 20th April, an experience of a lifetime, did the skywalk and it blows your mind, the guy from AJ who accompanied us was simply awesome. It was worth it, we did this in the evening, I guess little less scary than morning. Promise to come back here. As a souvenir",
          "The Macau Tower Convention and Entertainment Centre offered some cool activities for those who had hundreds of dollars to burn, such as tower climb and bungy jumps. We just settled for the observation tower which would\u2019ve offered some good views if there was ever a day with",

          "What makes Macau Tower unique is its location on the edge of the Praia Grande, the Skywalk, the AJ Hackett bungy jump and the Tower climb. You have to have a deep pocket or credit card and a big heart to do one of the above activities. Alternatively, you could get your heart",

It is the historical military centre of Macau. The fort forms part of the \"Historic Centre of Macau\" and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The fort was built between 1617 and 1626 on the 52 metres tall Mount Hill, located directly east of the Ruins of St. Paul's. It was constructed to protect the properties of the Jesuits (mainly Portuguese Jesuits) in Macau, especially from pirates. Later, the fort was taken over by the Portuguese colonial governor and the relevant authorities for the defence of Macau.\nThe fort occupies an area of roughly 8,000 square metres. 32 muzzle-loading cannons were placed around the fort's walls and the two corners of the southeastern fort wall have small watchtowers. The fort proved crucial in successfully holding off the attempted Dutch invasion of Macau in 1622.The fort remained a restricted military area until 1965 when the barracks in the fort were converted into a weather observatory and was opened to the public. The observatory ceased its function and was relocated to Taipa in 1996 before it was demolished to make way for the Museum of Macau, which was officially opened on 19 April 1998. The tree-covered park at the top of the fort has a panoramic view of the mainland area of Macau.\nApart from being a fortress, it has served various functions:\n\nThe first residence of the Governors of Macau (in 1623 and in 1740).\nThe base for two companies of the Portuguese Prince Regent Battalion to act as a police force from 1810 to 1841.\nA weather observatory of the Meteorological Department of Portuguese Macau (from 1966 to 1996).\nThe Museum of Macau (1998 to present-day).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nFortaleza do Monte, Macau\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nGuia Fortress, another Portuguese fort in Macau\nList of oldest buildings and structures in Macau\nList of tourist attractions in Macau\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nGarrett, Richard J.

          "Great to climb for views looking over Macau. There is also a museum but we didn\u2019t visit. Conveniently located right next to the Ruins of the Church of St Paul.",
          "after climbing lot of stairs i was expecting a fantastic view; you get a good view but nothing that shocks you though. probably if the sky is clear you can get a good picture of the famous Casino Lisbon",
          "The fort offers stunning views across the city and is a welcome escape of the tourist madness that surrounds the nearby ruins of St Pauls. The fort is free to visit and has 360 panoramic views so you can soak up the history (or the weirdly shaped casino hotels, if you are that",
          "Lovely and quaint streets show the Portuguese and Catholic influence in Macau, as contrasted with most cities I China.",
          "This attraction is next to St Paul's Ruins. I will suggest going to the top for great views of the city that you will not get from the Macau Tower.",
          "It takes some (climbing) effort to get to this castle/fortress in the middle of the old town centre, but its worth the effort. The state of the fortress is pretty good inclusive its many canons. At the top of the fortress you have great views of Macau and you can almost oversee",
          "Decided to get away from the hustle and bustle of Macau and see some sites. Our first stop was Monte Forte. It is definitely a trek to walk up here from Senado Square. The incline is pretty high and if you go during the heat of summer, it is a work out. But when you get up to",
          "This place we just walked by but enjoyed a lot because there you can see the \"real\" Macau. It's possible to walk around and to take some pictures but they close in the evening. Thats a shame! The guards acting a little bit strange, feels like they protecting the white house!",
          "Located next to Ruins of St. Paul is this important piece of history in Macau. Initially build in 16th century to safeguard the church; it\u2019s served as an important defense base for many centuries after that. It is known for it\u2019s 32 huge canons. It became open to public in 1965",
          "It's amazing to see 2 different cultures united (portuguese and chinease) the area where the fort is is great to walk around, you have fantastic views of Macau, plenty of places to see in a near area",
          "After visiting St. Paul's fa\u00e7ade, we just walked up and enjoyed the views from Fortaleza do Monte. You can also visit the small but interesting museum inside.",
          "Up above you can see most part of Macau, I did not know that they have forts like this. You'll see here how they preserved the historical objects of Macau, its like old meets new :D",
          "I found the Forte to be just average. There was not a lot to see other than walking around the top of the fort and checking out the Mcacau city views from every side. The view from the Guia Lighthouse is much better though a bit of a hike. There were a few cannons",
          "No signs directing you to where the museum is. Only 1 easy way to get to the top. I took the stairs. Would wear comfortable shoes. Not much at the top. Besides a good view.",
          "We found we could get to Macau from Taipa using the casino shuttles (from Wynn to Wynn) and then walking around Macau (we were staying in Taipa at Cotai Central). My gps wasn't working all that great and we ended up going up hills that put many San Francisco streets to shame.",
          "Easy access from St. Paul or from the city, but lots of stairs. We came from St. Paul's side. Old fort, well preserved, excellent observation point, stunning views over Macau. Museum of Macau on site. Canons still on position, not sure if they are the original ones from the 17th",
          "Easily accessible from St Paul's Ruin to Macao Museum and escalator up to Monte Forte. We took a hike up from the other side of the town. Monte Forte offers a nice view of St Paul's and view of Macau.",
          "Very much left as how it was, not much activity but its a nice/ shaded walk/ stroll up after all the good street snacks just down the fort.",
          "The fortress and museum is next to St Paul's Ruins, so recommend entering the fortress and museum from this side. There is an escalator up to the museum entrance. After visiting the museum you can exit onto the fortress grounds which offer nice views of the city and St Paul's",
          "A bit of a walk but so much history and culture that can be seen. It's for free but if you wanna see the museum inside you have to pay for it.",
          "This 16th century Vauban style fortress, with old cannons still in place, gives wonderful 360 degree views ov Central Macau, and should not be missed on any visit to Macau.",
          "This is a historic landmark that is very well kept. The view of the city is excellent. You can many spectacular photos there.",
          "Historical place in Macau. It was constructed to protect the properties of the Jesuits residing in Macau, especially from pirates as well as from Dutch Invasion. It reminds me of Intramuros in Manila, Where there is a fortress with canons to protect from invasion too. You can",
          "If you want to know the history Macau, and check out the defense line of the city, this is the fortress to check out. Standing at the top of the mountain, you would have a nice view of the old and new city of Macau, and you could also see some canon guns from the past.",
          "Great way to get to know Portuguese history. The fort is well preserved and at its top was built the Macao Museum of History, another excellent option to visit. You can see the cast iron dr cannons.",
          "A place worth visiting, if nothing more than to see another side of Macau. The ruins of St Paul's are the draw, but surely the castle is the main attraction. It's a bit of a climb, especially if it's a humid day, but the views are well worth the effort.The old town was typically",
          "The trek is quite a gentle trek, meaning not too tough, just a simple trek with cement terrain. View offered at the submit was spectacular. A good place to calm one mind, while enjoying the view of macau",
          "VIsit this place and you will have a nice view over the city. Located in the city next to Ruins of St. Paul's so visit these two places at the same time.",
          "I have visit Macau for quite a few times over the years but many times its just visiting casinos, museums, hotels and food/restaurants but this was the first time I actually visited Monte Forte (Fortaleza do Monte). It was quite a hike uphill from the city center but it isn't",
          "This old fortress built by the Jesuit Catholic order is right opposite the Ruins of St Paul and has very easy access. There are two sets of escalators up and various ramps for ease of entry. There are lovely views from the top and several old canons used for protection which",
          "This place located besides Ruins of St. Paul, so you must visit this place, be careful cause you must climbs some stairs before reachs the top. There was some cannons on the top of the fort & the most special is, you can take a shot for the best Macau view for free.",
          "I didn't find anything particularly exciting about this museum. Although the views from the roof are amazing.",
          "This place is right at the centre of the heritage belt of tourist sites. Its on top of a hill, gives tourist a good exercise to walk up the steps. On the top there is a museum and a number of old cannons. You can have a good 360 degree view of Macau old city.",
          "Although you cannot see the Cotai Strip from Monte Forte, you got some nice 360\u00b0 view around Macao - especially beautiful during sundown.",
          "Historically, Monte Forte or Big Fort built by Portuguese between 1617 -1627 to defends Macau from Chinese and Dutch invasions. The fort was built on Mount Hill overlooking the city and harbour. It mounted 32 cannon, had its own water reservoir, and the capacity for enough",
          "The fortress is impressive. You climb to the top and theres is macau museum. The canons around the wall with the views of the city are amazing. It is nice to see the chinese people exercising in the morning. Nice place to see",
          "My friends were first time visitors to Macau and we walked up the hill to Monte Forte. Nice view from the top.",
          "You can access the Monte Forte through the escalators in the Macao Museum. From the top of the fort you get some nice views of Macau. You should go all the way round the fort to get different aspects of Macau. The cannons look impressive. The Grand Lisboa looks awesome.",
          "We ended up here as we couldn't get a room anywhere else in Macau due to some event that was on..so after trying many hotels, the taxi driver said that was the best chance. We found a very old building, restored and updated to perfection.. the room we had a awesome balcony",
          "The place is very nice itself but the best part of it in my opinion are the great views of the whole city from different angles. The Grand Lisboa and the Macau Tower look really good from up there",
          "Make sure the museum is open the day you visit (I think its closed Mondays) as its much easier to use the Museum escalators to get to the top of the Fort. Walk around and check out the canons and the views. Loads of people taking 'canon photos' but it doesn't take long to get",
          "If you prefer places with less crowds and nice scenery, exercise a bit to get here! Rewarding view is waiting!!",
          "Worth the walk up good views from all sides shows different areas of Macua. Old canons bells and thick stone walls.",
          "You can probably give this free fort a miss. It's a fairly steep climb to a big concrete platform, with some suspiciously modern looking cannons on the way. No sense of history or indeed anything else to be gained from the hike other than the views.",
          "Very historical fort dating back hundreds of years. At the top there's still old canons, along with a lot of greenery like trees and shrubs. Wonderful view of Macau as it's at one of the highest points in the city. It's quite a steep hike to the get to the fort",
          "We stopped here while walking the historic centre of Macau. This fort is well worth a visit. It is adjacent to the Ruins of St Pauls. The fortifications on the hill are quite extensive and there are good views from the top.",
          "Definitely worth making the climb to top of the hill to see the fortress and museum inside, lovely views over the town.",
          "As a Dutch this is a part of history not very much known in our country. but nice to see what really happend there and that it is still standing",
          "If you are visiting Macau's historic capital, don't miss the opportunity to take a birds-eye view of the old city from its historic-highest point. Your camera will work overtime in capturing the city's unique panoramas. Cannons surround the battlements in a clear message to",
          "You can access Fortaleza do Monte free of charge by taking the elevators up from the Macau Museum. From the top you have nice views and photo opportunities of the old town of the ruins of St. Paul just below and of Lisboa Casino and Tower and the Zhuhai skyline on a clear",

          "Nice picture opportunity, and views of the old city. Free admission, just take the escalators up from the Macau Museum. The walls are lined with canons and views of the casinos. You can even see the ruins of St.Paul from there, especially cuz it\u2019s just in front of it.",
          "Built on the hill overlooking the old city between 1617-26 this is a classical fortress of the era to defend against cannon. Anyone who appreciates military architecture will enjoy walking through this fortress with its strategic views over the city and harbour",
          "Right next to the famous Ruins is the entrance to the Fort. Blessedly, a short and well-shaded climb takes you up to the upper level of the Fort where cannons are still protruding from the walls, ready to fend off dangers (very funny that one points directly at the Grand",
          "This fort is located beside the Ruins of St. Paul. So don't miss this place while at St. Paul. Climb to the top of the fort and we will be rewarded with a vintage view of St. Paul.",
          "This site used to be an old fort used by Portuguese to defend Macau. There are still a lot of cannons at this place. From the top we can have a nice 360 degree view of Macau city and bay. Below is the Macau Museum which is a good place to learn about Macau history. Entrance",
          "Very close to the historic centre and right next to the museum so worth a visit whilst you are there. The views are great and you can get a photo with the cannons.",
          "The fort itself was pretty ordinary and I heard it was used to fend off the Dutch invasion of Macau in the 1700s, so there is some history there. But you could get a panoramic view of the entire peninsula including sites like st. Paul which was right underneath, casino lisboa",
          "Before anything else let me just say that THIS FORT HAS AN ESCALATOR. We walked up the hard way and due to the heat and humidity along with the flights of stairs we all arrived at the top dying. Offers nice views of the city and a wonderful breeze.",
          "This place has some amazing views over Macau. It's set in a beautiful \"park\" and is well worth the visit - specially if you're going to St. Pauls ruins. The fort is right next to the ruins.",
          "You just can find some cannon in the larfe rooftop. u can find telescope around there to see macau city. But, it free to enter.",
          "You should not miss the view over Macau. Make sure you take a walk around the Fortress and take some nice impressions (and photos) of Macau with you.",
          "There's a lot to learn from this old fort and museum. The fort itself is reasonably well kept given its age and one can appreciate its historical relevance (and Macau's in general) from reading through the exhibits in the attached museum. The view is also quite good and one can",
          "This fort is right next to st.paul ruins. Very easy to find. The architecture and history here are awesome.",
          "Like St Paul's down the hill this place offers a peek into the Portugese history of Macau, and is a great vantage point to see the old parts of Macau mixed with the new. The cannons, stonework and structure is amazing. The day we were there the Macau orchestra was playing;",
          "The fortress is just near Ruins of St Paul's, and you can take the escalator up to see great views of Macau city from above.",
          "Must visit when in Macau to enjoy the Portuguese architecture. Located close to city center is easily accessible.",
          "Use the elevator if you have weak feet. Viewing the city from top of the fort. Quite challenging if using stairs to top. Lots of tourist here due to proximity to Ruins of St. Paul",
          "A Portuguese era fort that is located on top of a hill offering scenic view of the entire city of Macau. Great for taking pictures. Close by to the Ruins of St Paul and the Museum as well. Enjoyed my time here as the views are breathtaking.",
          "It's well worth the climb because the view from the top is wonderful, whichever way you look. You have to be amazed at the strength of the fortress, and how a small number of Portuguese were able to impose themselves so completely on local labourers in such a relatively short",
          "Beautiful gardens in the middle of Macau, about 5 mn walk from San Francisco church and away from the bustle of the town. You will have a 360 view of Macau and the Chinese towns beyond, as well as of the harbour and the casinos. The historical museum is also located right in",
          "I went up the fort wanting to see more than I saw. Cannons sitting about and nothing else. It wasn't really special in any way. However, it still had good view but still, don't go unless you have plenty of time.",
          "An old Portuguese fort, but held intact by the new authorities. The views form every angle are fantastic: Taipa and Coloane to the south and mainland China to the North. Lovely gardens and even a museum to see for free",
          "After a disastrous visit to the Ruins of St. Paul, we needed to be at a place where there were less crowds and the fortress was just that. It still had crowds but because of the layout and size the crowds are less evident and thus more enjoyable. Come here to escape the crowds",
          "The fortress is just off the Ruins of St Paul's in Macau's historic district. Can be accessed via escalator from inside the adjacent museum if you don't fancy the trek up by foot. Smallish fortress, but provides great views of the city of Macau and the old casino district",
          "Next to the Macau Museum and on its top are the old fortress ruins of the Hill Fortress. While just the peak remains, there are spectacular 360 degree views across the city. Great views and worth seeing as part of the Macau Museum experience.",
          "Made the mistake of reaching from the east side of the hill, a very steep climb through streets and stairs. I didn't know there are mechanical escalators next to St Paul's ruins to reach this place. The fortress itself is nothing special.. walls and cannons. But the 360 views of",
          "Well preserved Portuguese fort. In its hayday provided all round defense of the old city. Now a tourist site cum park. The site is windy and offers a good and clear view of the city on a good day. Well worth the short climb up the steep stairs.",
          "We visited Monte Forte after the Ruins of St Pauls - it's right across the road. There were a few tour groups up here and it's such a big area that it was never crowded. Lots of canons for cool photo opportunities & great views over the city. We went on a really hot day, so were",

          "Climbed up the short but exhausting steps to reach this beautifully preserved fort adjacent to St Paul's ruins. It contains the museum of Macao for those wanting an introduction to the colony's history as well as some stunning views of the city, old and new.",
          "This place just right next to the ruins of st. paul. There is a museum connecting to the spot. The park has a spectacular 360 view of the whole city. And best of all, there is elevator to get there. no sweat. pleasant and refreshing. The museum houses the history of Macau. It is",
          "In hot weather the climb can be deathly and sweaty, but there are escalators that lead up to the Museum that you can take for free without even going into the museum, but go to the museum because it is pretty good. Views from the top are great on a clear day and just a hop up",
          "We visited the fort recently and enjoyed viewing the various cannons and the view over Macau old town. The fort is in good repair and was interesting to see",
          "There are great views of Macau from the fort and interesting history lesson. Conveniently located near the Ruins of St. Paul.",
          "Prepare your knees and legs in going up to this fort. Once up there, you will have a nice view of the area below.",
          "Fort is small and steep. But due to escalator going up easy. Some good photographic point. Otherwise nothing is worth. We took maccau site seen tour and found it ok experience.",
          "This place is next to the Ruins of St. Paul so it wasn't hard to find. The walk to the fortress took us about 10-15 mins. The views at the top were beautiful and \"instagram worthy\". It was very historical and great for pictures.",
          "This place made our visit to the Ruins of St Paul (next door) worthwhile (those ruins in themselves were okay but not worth a trek in their own on a very busy bank holiday in the heat). Great views of some old and new parts of Macau and an interesting fort. Steps may be steep",
          "No wonder he jesuit priests chose this location for their fortress. It sits on a hill-top with commanding views of all of Macau and further (if visibility permits). Lisboa hotel rises in all of its tacky immenseness in the distance as well as the ugly backside of town can be",
          "Well restored and maintained fortress on the hill in Macau with great views across the city. Nice gardens around the base of the fortress walls.",
          "After visiting St Paul's Ruins, the fort is just adjacent and you do a little climb up the stairs to enter the fort. There is a good view of macau from the top of the fort and plenty of photo opportunity with the cannons lining the fort. Worth the climb. There is a better flight",
          "Visited on 07/03/2017,it located next to Ruins of St. Paul. There are 2 flights of staircase,one is the original,which is uneven and 'high',we climbed the uneven one,which make us breathless till we reached the top. But is a good view from top. We came down from the other",
          "From Ruins of St. Paul, you will just turn right, then around the garden, there's an escalator at the side part of the peak.(It's a tip, because you'll ganna see the stairs first) The peak is free, no entrance fee. Then at the top, you have a great view of the vicinity of",
          "Been for a walk around Macau. The Fortaleza do monte offers a great view of Macau and the surrounding.",
          "Yes, for picture taking. You can see the surrounding Macau peninsular from the top. A bit of a hike up the stairs to the top of the fort, however, easily follow the escalator to the bottom of the hill.",
          "I was just strolling around the old city center with no specific itinerary, suddenly I was at the top of it and was a great surprise because you get a 360 degrees perspective of the city! A must!",
          "We went on rather a circuitous route to the Monte Forte and had really been looking for the ruins of Sao Paulo, but the tourist signs in the the city centre are slightly confusing and so we ended up walking up narrow streets to the fort. Once there, you are rewarded with a",
          "The view of the city is one of the best from here. Its also very interesting to see this European fortification in the middle of the city.",
          "This fort is a really nice spot to come and hang out, especially early nightfall. There is a pretty garden with benches to relax on on one side of the Fort and a path that you can walk around the entire fort and check out the cannons and what not. During the day, you can visit",
          "The Monte Forte is located directly adjacent to the Ruins of St. Paul's making it convenient to see both in one outing (both are free to visit) . The 2 historical sites are against a busy pedestrian, shopping, cobblestone street area ~ so together these make a great half-day or",
          "To be fair i have visited higher and bigger forts in india, too small compared to them, people can give it a miss. It does provide a good view from the top of the city. Cleanliness of the place to be appreciated.",
          "The fort is a short but uphill walk from the ruins of St. Paul's and worth the short journey. The walls of the castle seem complete and the series of steps, all steep, take one up to the top. The main plus of the fortress apart from the museum there, is the views over Macau",
          "Was at St Paul and saw escalator leading to the museum. Decided to take a look which remember there wasn't any at all. Almost 5:30pm and went up to the fort instead. Up at the top, there are many canons display around the wall and of course the beautiful view of Macau.",

          "This fort is next to the ruins of St Pauls and is really worth the short walk. There are a few steps so it might not be appropriate for the infirm. The views from the top are great, you see both the old and the new Macau.",
          "Spend about 30 minutes having a look at the fort. There is no cost to enter and you can get a good view of Macau Island, as well as the historic Old Town and St Paul's ruins. There is the Museum of Macau in the middle. The fort is a 5 minute walk to St Paul's and the Old Town.",
          "I've seen cannons in other countries, mainly the Caribbean, but I've haven't seen this many cannons in one spot. There are also some great views of the city, as pointed out by other reviewers. The Macau Museum is located at the top of the Forte as well. There is also a very",

          "I liked trekking up all the hills and old streets of Macau, so naturally I found my way here almost accidentally. It's pretty big and I was mostly thrilled by the fact that I could see China from the top! But you know, it's a fort, so not much else to say. Unless you are a fort",
          "Monte Forte is next to the Ruin's of St Paul and requires some stairs climbing. Do not hesitate to climb to the top and visit the Macau Museum if time is allowed",

          "This place is very close to Ruin of St. Paul and Historic Centre of Macau. They are all walking distances from one another. This place has a great view of Macau. Although it does take some hiking up those stairs and walkways, it's definitely worth it! Lots of picture",
          "Once you are at Ruins of St Paul, it is not much hectic to go up to the fort. From the fort, one can get a spectacular view of Macau. The museum at the top of the fort is open from 10AM to 6PM, but closed on Tuesday and Public Holidays. There is no fee for the entry to both the",
          "We enjoyed our time here although we did have to walk uphill to get here. It offers great views of Macau and we welcomed the breeze on such a humid and hot afternoon. The fortress has a museum with some historical information. To be honest, we did not pay too much attention. We",
          "Great views over the city with Portuguese canon and first rate museum opened in 1998. Excellent walks up to the summit. Good exercise! The Fortress was started in 1617 and helped to hold off a Dutch invasion in 1622.",
          "Bit of a climb up to the top but well worth it. Has wonderful views in every direction. Can also spot the ruins of St. Paul if you look carefully. Great photos to be taken.",

          "This was the second time to visit the fort. I brought my wife this time to look out over the city. The fort it self is nice, but usually crowded. The steps to the top are very steep and slippery. BUT there is an escalator on the north side that takes you to the museum at the",
          "If you have been to Macau Museum, then take an escalator to Mount Fortress on the left. The view itself was truly stunning where you could see Macau Peninsula. Good vibes.",
          "This is right across the road from St Pauls Ruins. Yes it does involve more steps but very interesting. The cobble stone floor the thickness of the walls, the cannons in position. The 360 degree view from the top is very good and shows the cannons all pointing to the ocean where",
          "Go up Monte Forte using the small road next to the Macau Museum instead of using the escalator. You will find another angle looking at Ruins of St. Paul's. When you reach the cannons, you will find that they are now aiming at the buildings. Those buildings were erected many",

          "Good place in Macau you must visit. Historical and mix culture. Great for picture and wonderful view. Nice dating.",
          "I enjoyed a quick walk around this place. There are shops, restaurants,amazing sea views of the bridge and old colloseam replica.",
          "Fisherman's Wharf is failed tourism development project that somehow still clings to life. The project was greatly hampered by the 2009 financial crisis which shut down development work at that time. By the time they got back on their feet, it was too late. The city had moved on",
          "Have meet with my client here and the meeting has set up properly. The space is not big but it is enough. The meeting room is quite and it is a plus. The staff is nice and helpful and able to answer my question, giving that I am a first timer to Macau.",
          "We were staying at Harbourview hotel next to fisherman\u2019s wharf so didn\u2019t take us much effort to get here. But if I were staying elsewhere, I wouldn\u2019t advise people to make a pit stop here. It\u2019s like an abandoned town, failing attraction and I believe the owners are figuring out",
          "In a capsule, FW brought us to the ancient time. It was my nth time to Macau but this was the first time I got to see this awesome structure because I am with friends. We we're like students of history walking and touching every corner that our camera can reach. We love the food",
          "A place with great scenery and enjoy the breeze while walking along Worth trying some meals or drink by sitting near the jetty. It's a great experience Don't forget to capture the beautiful sunset before you leave",
          "Great photo stop, feels like you're walking around in Rome as it's like a small replica. We just walked through here on route to the hotels.",
          "Indeed, a nice place for photo shooting & walk around. We get there with public transport bus (MOP 6 /pax regardless of distance). Also, nice to have a coffee here to enjoy the view.",
          "Not much as a place Good for a couple of photos But the exhibition area is a real treasure to buy gifts of local market I bought fruits, herbs, biscuits And there is many other stuff going there Must visit",

          "They have their own currency which is different from Hong Kong one and they don't take it. It was a nice little city we stayed two nights. Hotel there are just massive. People their much nicer than the grumpy people in Hong Kong. It's a city that worth travel to discover",
          "This is an odd attraction, if it can be called an attraction. The development has an area built with a historic Roman theme, complete with look-alike facade ruins that provide photo opportunities for newlyweds and social outings. Our initial positive impression was short-lived",
          "The place recreates the Colosseum and ancient Rome, the place is not interesting, and there is generally nothing to be done here.",
          "This place is basically a shopping area with some eateries, facing a sea. Great architecture but I found this place not that touristy and nothing much to do. A bit far from the city centre but easily reached by bus. For me, I came here once and that\u2019s it. I might not repeat",

          "As part of City tour, visited the place at late morning. Surprisingly not many people around, an interesting architecture built in the style of ancient Rome Colosseum at the side of sea. Except for taking some photo in the backdrop of iconic Colosseum, nothing much to do. There",
          "My husband and I wondered Macau Fisherman's Wharf and it was a pleasant stroll. Lots of Cafe' and restaurants to dine at but we didn't. What we didn't expect was so many empty stores. The current stores that are open had some fantastic Sales. I purchased quite a few shirts",
          "Took the fast ferry to Macau then hopped onto the Open Tour Bus to see all the highlights. Best way to spend you day trip but make sure you choose your stops catefully. There is a fortyfive minute delay until the next bus. Some stops should be avoided so stay on the bus and",
          "Had a very brief visit here but well worth it. Built in the style of Ancient Rome and the colosseum. Didn\u2019t get to visit the shops and restaurants but maybe next time we will have more time.",
          "Lovely place to spend the evening close to ferry terminal walkable distance... Good seafood restaurants",
          "If you love talking pictures this place is a must visit... We went there in the morning but I'm sure it looks pretty in the evening with lights... Additionally it gives you a feeling that you are in Rome!!! Just go for a stroll there.",
          "Pretty place, reminds me of the Lost City of Atlantis, nice for Instagramming. But i think they could have made it better. We were looking for a nice place to have a drink by the water but all we could find are restaurants. It's a massive space. Could have made more",
          "If you like the feel of greek structures etc, this place is nice. However, other than that, the rest of the place looks almost like ghost town. This place seem to have lost is lusture with the new hotels coming up and fighting for visitors. I still like it here - not too overly",

          "Very beautiful and elegant compound that includes restaurants, hotels and shops with great sea view. They replicate various themes from worldwide, most attractive being roman Amphitheatre with hundreds of seats to accommodate decent size of shows and concerts. Architectural work",

          "Me and my boyfriend went here as one of our friends recommended this place to visit and we were not disappointed. I felt i was in Rome. haha! had so many pictures with this place plus there are so many restaurants to choose from when you get hungry and tired of taking pictures.",
          "The place is conveniently located, it has plenty of restaurants & pubs. There is a nightclub D2 which operates till morning, mostly its busy and the drinks are not very expensive. Good place to have a dinner and then shake legs",
          "We were at the Sands Resort and decided to explore the Fisherman's Wharf just across the road. There is shelter from rain, but it did not help with the sun and heat. We wandered quickly through since there was really not much open. It looks like there is construction going",
          "Go here during late afternoon to avoid the sun as the place has no shade. Very picturesque. I think the place is better in pictures than in person. There are a very few establishments, hardly see any, actually. Go here only if you have ample time.",
          "We went all the way and only to discover what once was I am sure was once a thriving place to visit now very sadly almost does not exist. Most restaurants have closed down and the place is deserted. Very sad to see but we hope that someone will see the potential and get it",

          "A great place to walk in the evening. With a little breeze and some evening sun, numerous photos can be taken over and over again \u2013 at different light settings. The Colosseum and a now-defunct train are examples of 2 great photo spots. The coastal view and the L-O-V-E are other",
          "The sense there is so beautiful, for couples, they can take lots of good photos with the imitation of roman architecture. Also an see the ocean there. After then, the visitor can eat in those near by restaurant. Various choice of the restaurant such as Japanese food, Western",
          "I think this is the best place for visit after get off from Turbojet from Hongkong. The easy way is, after exit from Outer Harbour terminal, dont crossing underground tunnel but walk left around 800 meters & you can find the spot. Actually this place is a big mall, with some",
          "The structures are artificial but it's nicely built. Too bad we went there after a strong storm. Many people there are doing pictorials for wedding. #Youtuber #KrayonTV",
          "This place is mostly still empty with a few overpriced restaurants and bars open as of December 2017. Worthwhile strolling through to see the colosseum, etc.",
          "Beautiful walkway and building but few shops and no people. Not much to do or see hear. We took a lot of selfies but that's about it.",
          "WFW is a nice and calm place, but perhaps fom my EU background, it is not a proper attraction, It is just a great place to walk and envoy water and valves, It is close to casinos =, which may be a plus, or not.",
          "During my Visit on Early Oktober 2017, they have small carnival going on, but open in the Evening. So all place are quite Empty, To get here you can take Casino free Shutter bus to Macau Ferry Terminal, Then ask or look for small mini Bus that going to Fisherman Wharf. Its a",
          "Lovely location for this Disney looking restaurant area. Fake facades, empty shops and no people. Bars empty too and poor service This was next to our hotel so we visited during the day and night and unfortunately had the same experience, shame",
          "The warf was still under construction (maybe). There are a few shops, some over-priced antique stores and eateries. We walked around but there is not much there. Maybe in another year or so...",
          "Macau's Fisherman's Warf is one of the newest themed entertainment complex in Macau. It's just walking distance from the outer harbor ferry terminal and one can also ride the free shuttle bus if walking isn't your thing. Visiting this spot is like getting a feel of Europe with",
          "This was my first stop during my day trip to Macau and it was my favourite. We went in the morning so the stores were not open but it was not crowded. The architecture is gorgeous and the plants and gardens are nice as was the views of the ocean. I highly recommend this stop.",
          "The good thing about this park is it's free so you can explore and take pictures without costing you anything. It has restaurants and mini structures of the Renaissance-era places in Europe or arabian nights. My children were overwhelm and took loads of pictures here. Will",
          "Last visit almost 10 years ago held such great memories of this vibrant Happening place. There were big crowds and great restaurants and shops. The replica Roman coliseum /arena bathed in light etc. Fast forward to June 2017 - the place looks abandoned and neglected. Many",
          "Very picturesque buildings which we took advantage of to get a lot of good photos. A special treat to those who haven't been to Europe to see some European architecture. Truly an intsagram-worthy place and although it's quite off-course from the other tourist sites, my family",
          "A very insta-worthy place with buildings of European design, mixed with shops and higher end restaurants. The place is basically covered from rain and sun, but choices of shops and restaurants are somewhat limited. Place is only mostly for taking pictures.",
          "A nice addition to the many attractions in Macau with many interesting infrastructure but alas suffers from poor human traffic. There were not many tourist around and many shops were closed. Most of the food outlets are open in the evening and there aren't many food choices. I",
          "visited last March 2017 with friends nothing special but good to visit when you are in Macau and near the area. it's also walking distance to/from the Grand Prix Museum. We only had pictures taken by the entrance and in the Colosseum area. there are shops and the wharf is",
          "We read the reviews and didn\u2019t expect much but we still wanted to try and experience the place for ourselves. A lot of what has been said is true. Many shops are closed and it is difficult and out of the way to get here and worse, return to the center but it is manageable. The",
          "Contrary to the belief I had by the name WHARF, I was looking for something good there. However ended up with closed shops, broken pillars and ruined place all around. Checked if this place is shut assuming we reached on wrong day and time but that was the Business as Usual",
          "On a Sunday afternoon when most shops and cafes appeared shut and the only places open were casinos, I wandered around the Fisherman's wharf area in Outer Harbour. It was slightly disconcerting. Most restaurants seemed shut. Most shops appeared shut or empty. One ice cream",
          "Besides having a replica of the ruins of Rome and the Greek amphitheater and also a couple of F&B outlets, this place is very run down, not well-maintained and not worth a visit. Many shops are closed and the number of tourists to this location is dwindling. Sad sad sad.....",
          "Many shops are closed, there's only a few pieces of replicas that fail to give any proper experience. Having been to Italy, I was hoping that there would be something here that would help me reminisce my past trip. Just a colosseum and a statue with some Italian style",
          "I made the mistake of visiting the Wharf during the day when all the restaurants and shops are closed. Besides having shops, it has some historical significance, however, most of which I did not find interesting. Trying to hail a cab after visiting is even more of a challenge",
          "Pictures tell a lot of the place where you travel. Fisherman's wharf is one of the many destinations in Macau where you can challenge yourself of your photo-shoot skills. With a replica of the ruins of Rome and the Greek ampitheater in the backgound. Many locals come here for",
          "Actually a nice place for fresh air and sea view (though Macau seems to be also facing air pollution like many other parts of China as sky is never a nice blue even on a clear day). Place is quite big but business is poor so not all shops opened. Quite a variety of restaurants.",
          "This was very famous theme park before but since now already have fabulous casinos and hotels this place almost forgotten. Although it's still open to public it is not as lively as before, nowadays only few restuarant and branded shoppes is here. But for me this place is nice",
          "Just another simple theme park attraction filled with shops, cafes, plenty of eateries, Chinese restaurants, hotels, a mini-style casino, convention and exhibition facilities as well as replica of Colosseum in Rome. What's more interesting I like the place as there are many",
          "Short walk form the Ferry Terminal, The semi colossium hosts performances when? not so sure, but definately in the evenings, Restaurants around are quiet pricey nost are (chinese asian cuisine) have a snack trolley around in the day with waffes ice cream etc. Recommend Africanas",
          "A lovely place to visit and eat. The surroundings are beautiful, you feel like your in Italy, very man made feel but lovely never the less.",
          "nice place to spend some leisure time. beautiful roman architecture..makes you feel you are in Rome... great place to take pictures, eat food besides the beautiful se, open air restaurants... definitely click pictures at the amphitheatre...",
          "A white elephant project gone wrong from the pre-Financial crisis period of 2007-2008, Fisherman's Wharf (FW) never lived up to its billing as Macau grew and developed elsewhere, mostly around the Cotai Strip on other areas of the city. In the past couple of years, a",
          "a place that might not everybody know and aware. But, the place that makes me feel interested in the beauty of its architecture. The architecture is similar to the Colosseum in Rome. Macau Fisherman's Wharf are not far from Outter Harbour Ferry. Quite walk about 5-10 minutes.",
          "Nice place to spend time in leisure. Buildings in this small waterside are in old Portuguese style. There are number of restaurants offering multiple cuisines dot this area. Best time to visit is dusk time as one can enjoy kerbside drinking with snacks. There are few Tourist",
          "It seems brand new with expensive shops and empty restaurants. There were only a few people walking around ... Only good thing: you can take nice photos of the Pier from there. Otherwise, there is nothing to do or to see there, it's not worth losing time going there.",
          "Beautiful Ruins for photo taking, especially the coliseum. The tour driver told us that all those buildings are artificially built, there are not historical remains",
          "Most of the part of Macau Fisherman\u2019s wharf is under renovation and those which are open are worth to see it. Good things which I can count \u2013 the view of the Roman style Colosseum, the Babylon Casino, the view of the ferries and bridges from the promenade. Please avoid visiting",
          "The last time I went to Fisherman's Wharf is in the New Year, the usual Fisherman's Wharf did not a lot of people, but the New Year is very lively, crowded, the atmosphere is very good. And I like the Fisherman's Wharf architectural design, you can see the combination of Chinese",
          "not much to see when i went there because they are still renovating... you could snap some pictures outside, and on its facade... the amphitheater is just full with huge blocks... just go to other places if you have limited time in macau...",
          "Although you can snap some nice photos of monuments like the Roman amphitheatre, there's really little point in coming here until the place is built. Cranes and construction workers everywhere, this place is far from finished. It may be great in some years, but what you'll find",
          "During my holiday around china. Macau is like a small Vegas in asia. Macau is very good for people who can't afford to go Las Vegas just to enjoy casinos and fine dining's. Macau has everything you look for what Vegas have. If your planning to see Macau fishermen's wharf is good",
          "I won't say that Fisherman's Wharf is a definite go to place at this moment, but in next few years it will be. There is a lot of construction going on in the area. Among the the things that are ready: I really liked the mini colosseum.",
          "What you see in pictures is what you truly get. Second time to be around and it's still beautiful. Though during this time of visit, they were doing renovations. Nevertheless, they were still open to public and we had the time of our lives taking lots of pictures. Would love to",
          "How to ruin a lovely picture perfect place. Construct a massive shelter over the top with high columns everywhere. Fortunately I have the pictures of this once beautiful place before the wreckers came in with a very unnecessary heavy piece of construction in the guise of a rain",
          "Macau is popular for casinos, old churches, etc. But the exterior of the hotels are one to look forward to. Of all the places I have visited in Macau, this is the most wonderful. There's peace, tranquility and serenity. The place seems somewhat secluded which makes it ideal for",
          "I came here in the morning, so it was so quiet. The replica of some world landmarks were interesting and good for taking photo haha.",
          "Definitely recommended for tourist, this is surely a must visit where you're in Macau.. This is great for photos too.. It seems that you went in several places like Rome Amsterdam and Portugal.. What I love here most is the Ruins of the Coliseum it felt like I'm in the Roman",
          "It's a beautiful place with mini replicas of wonders of the world's and other famous places. There is a mini Colosseum, pyramids of Giza, Tibetan monastery and a lot of other places. This is surely a must visit when you're in Macau.",
          "convention center: great place for holding events (upto ca. 2,500 people) and/or exhibitions. food catering is good too. very helpful staff. moderate prices. and the delegates can wonder about in the wharf for picture taking, eating out, nightlife and some shopping.",
          "My daughter was dancing at the Sands so we had some time to kill between sessions. We walked across to Fishermans Wharf and were greeted with fenced in areas, little to no real signage and dead ends everywhere. Very few people around and those who were there looked as lost and",
          "The place is great for photos. Definitely recommended for tourists. It would seem like you went to Rome, Amsterdam, Africa and Portugal. Went there in the afternoon til sunset so it was almost empty which was great! We almost had it all to ourselves.",
          "A great plac to wander around in the day or evening. Still under construction in some areas but still worth a visit. The old style buildings really look authentic and plenty of space and restaurants to choose from",
          "It was my first time to come to Fisherman's wharf with colleagues for barbeque. Honestly the barbecue place was not easy to find but its worth it! Its clean, huge, well organized with good grill equipment. Its surrounded by different kind of medium upper scale restaurants and",

          "Very beautiful place. All fake but still a good place to take some more artistic pics",
          "Nice place for a walk in the evening.",
          "A very well made replica of the famous Colosseum! Great tourist spot!",
          "Fisherman's wharf Macau must visit and enjoy this beautiful view. The construction of the theme park took 5 years, before an opening ceremony by the Chief Executive of Macau and trial operation began on December 31, 2005. After one year of \u2026",
          "Fancy place for lunch and dinner.  Not overpriced as many in Macau. Highly recommend for selfies lovers...",
          "Not a lot people when we visited. I think it's also a good idea to visit this place before sunset since the lighting at night is beautiful too. A replica of Rome's coliseum - a good place to visit especially for those dreaming of travelling to Europe someday.",
          "I think this place is more alive at night or if there are big events. A lot of shops, food stalls, and restaurants are seen here. There's a great view of the harbour overlooking one of the bridges of Macau.",
          "A Good place to stroll and unwind especially at night, where for a time, from a distance, you can be an audience to the cityscape of Macau.",
          "Cool 'mini rome' for picture taking. Don't expect to be able to dine in the area though. The shopping strip adjacent to the place seems like a deserted place",
          "I loved this place. Its extremely beautiful and we had visited on a Saturday of December month. Though it was all decked up for Christmas there were hardly any people. They have good restaurants reasonably priced however without crowd, it kind of made no sense at this place especially during weekend.",
          "the chinese restaurant in legend hotel is super, in terms of value of price and very good seaviews, good place to go",
          "The first attraction in Macau coming straight from the ferry terminal.  Nicely maintained place and good place for photography.",
          "The complex includes over 70 stores and restaurants in buildings built in the style of different world seaports such as Cape Town, and Amsterdam, a convention and exhibition centre, a marina, two hotels and a casino spanning over 133,000 m2 of area. The theme park gets 40% of its area from reclamation from the sea.[1]",
          "My husband and I loved this place, SO MUCH!! And we accidentally found it as it\u2019s close to our hotel. Really surprised that not many people talk about this place in blog or websites. It\u2019s good because it has many spots for picture, also, \u2026",
          "Wonderful piece of Tourist attraction in Macau ! Beautiful landscape views and great restaurants ! \nA must visit when you are in Macau... Open, airy and wheelchair accessible throught the area of the location... They have special events, so do your research before making it here... And evening visits are even better !",
          "Pretty much a place for all your Instagram photos.  It\u2019s eclectic, pretty and worth a stroll.  It\u2019s all restaurants, so come hungry or just for picture taking, as there\u2019s not much else to do.",
          "It's quite far-fetched from central area of Lisboa and Parisian. Plus there is no direct bus to the spot, hence you'll have to walk at least around 300m from any nearest bus stop. \n\nWe went during the day and the place was essentially dead \u2026",
          "Looks nice but over priced by a country mile",
          "would recomend",
          "The place was really huge. You could spend half a day just roaming around. The view was great, it felt like you're in a different country.\nRestaurants, stores and casinos are everywhere. Hotels are crazily luxurious but may not be the best place to stay when you're in a budget.",
          "good location and good place you can shopping and walk around and enjoy with casino and a lot of restuarent and food if you com to macao you must visit hare",
          "Tourist trap. Fake Roman buildings, packed with 100% Chinese tourist, a far cry from Macau unique Portugal style.",
          "The ambience was good as it was Christmas.. The coliseum wall was okay and Rome theme was not very prominent..",
          "Nothing to brag about. This place is dead. How to get here: Take any shuttle to Wynn Macau. Fisherman's Wharf is in front of the building.",
          "The place exceeded my expectation. I thought it was just a simple wharf, but it actually had a ruins that was good for picture taking. It also had a lot of restaurants if you'd like to dine. However, they are mostly open at night. The breeze from the sea was also refreshing.",
          "A white elephant project gone wrong from the pre-Financial crisis period of 2007-2008, Fisherman's Wharf (FW) never lived up to its billing as Macau grew and developed elsewhere, mostly around the Cotai Strip on other areas of the city.\n\nIn \u2026",
          "Recommended place in macau",
          "Not very known but a wonderful place",
          "Less crowded place anytime of the day. So you may take a picture of arena replica as much as you want.",
          "Good site seen at macau for photo graphy and silent place \nSafe for families visit",
          "Great place with nice view \ud83d\ude42",
          "The place was nice with a Roman Amphitheater inspired.. Harbour view , where you can spot the longest bridge that connects Macau & HK... There were many hotels to choose around it. Sorrounded by casinos..There\u2019s a restaurant along legend boulevard.",
          "Is it wild and open good place beside the bay and freshing air with yummy foods",
          "Wonderful place! Rome in Asia!",
          "Fine place to Stay, dinner or party",
          "Ok...",
          "Nice theme park to have a stroll, the eateries and shops were uninspiring, very manicured like a themed hotel in Vegas strip. nice view from the wharf and interesting fake european monuments that makes a great photo backdrop.",
          "It is dying. A real shame because it could have been a great attraction. Many of the restaurants had closed their business. However, it is still pretty and looks nice.",
          "A very beautiful tourist attraction place. Picturesque view. An Instagram - worthy place.",
          "At the back of the Roman Amphitheatre you will see the docks and also the HKZM bridge.",
          "Bit silence. Not crowded. Good selection of food at reasonable prices. Little offerings in gifts.",
          "It doesnt have many attractions",
          "It was mistaken for a fisherman colony but the place is very high end. All branded shops and you good cafes to eat.",
          "Nice place to hop around like a mall with loads of local street food.",
          "Great place to visit.",
          "I have mixed feelings about this place. Good place for a walk but it is a little bit kitschy.",
          "This is an abandoned theme park, but it is still clean and worth a visit. Just 10 minutes walk from the ferry terminal.",
          "Very touristy place with many good but pricey restaurants. Came here on a Monday night and we found it very quiet.",
          "It is absolutely wonderful to see the bars there, to feel the sea and the atmosphere at night. Have a drink at the Africans Dschungel Lodge or enter the magic of the \"SANDS\". it is Awsome there!",
          "It was a great place. You can take pictures around. It is as if I\u2019m in Rome. Very nice ambience.",
          "Fisherman\u2019s Wharf is a large theme park, with various port 'towns' \u2013 like Amsterdam,Lisbon,  Miami, New Orleans, Venice, the Italian Riviera and Cape Town and is spread over 100K Sq Metres which is just  within walking distance of the ferry \u2026",
          "Built on reclaimed land . Beautiful sea and hongkong macaw bridge view. Lots of Chinese and macaueaun eating joints. But entry to the replica of colloeseum is restricted now.",
          "Take one of the free shuttles from main hotels to Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, from there take the free shuttle to Fisherman's Wharf. Public toilets available, many hotels, restaurants, coffees, shops. Nice to walk around for couple of hours.",
          "Really cool place to visit, looks like europe",
          "The place recreates the Colosseum and ancient Rome, the place is not interesting, and there is generally nothing to be done here.",
          "Nice place to have lunch and snap photos but nothing else going on",
          "Nice place for photo \ud83d\ude06",
          "It's really well made..they have a colosseum as well and the whole place is very scenic.The view of the sea from the edge of the wharf is amazing..You can see ferries as well as the cars on the distant bridge..",
          "Place for every tourist to visit. Quiet, Serene and the view facing the sea is just mesimerizing. The breeze will take you back to  your romantic memories in past. \u2764\ufe0f",
          "I like the feeling of sea breeze while dining..love the music too as there was a band performing when we get to the place.",
          "Good views for picture taking.",
          "Calm and quite by the day but is surrounded by leading Casinos.",
          "No so Many people in this place, I dont know why it's a nice place",
          "Good photograph location,easily transfer from shuttle stand,Macau.\nNice restaurants,available here too,not to mention the amazing Babylon casino.",
          "This place is dead. Even a waitress admitted nothing happens here unless an event is happening in Macau. I sat in a restaurant with 6 staff plus a chef and a 5 piece live band and had a meal and I was the only person in the restaurant for over an hour. Embarrassing clapping for a band when your the only one there.",
          "Good location for quietness places",
          "Absolutely fantastic! Such a beautiful spot to sit and relax. There are events and shows happening later in the day. However during the day time it\u2019s a very popular spot to come and take pictures.",
          "Great view.. attractive theme.. but not maintained well...",
          "A picturesque place! And there's not much people  during noon, makes taking photos easier!\n\nThis is definitely one of my favorite places here in Macau.",

          "Wonderful place*-* I want  come back\ud83d\ude1c",
          "One of the few places you shouldn't miss going to in Macau. If haven't been to Rome this will give you a jist of it. Amazing place to click pictures and the also has kids play area at the back and a great view of the ocean",
          "A bit uh underwhelming, because I had high expectations.",
          "The attraction is so disappointing. We expect a lot of shops and things to see there. There was probably less than a quarter of the shops open for business. They tried to make a outdoor mall with fake houses and streets.",
          "Nice place went to it for a while. Wish to have had more time to sit near this place",
          "Nice to go here on a rainy day. We were for lunch at Rio's Grill and it was great",
          "ok convenient",
          "Nice place for take awesome pictures",
          "A walk from the Outer Ferry.\n\nNothing really special about the place for me. \nThe place is \"roman-themed\".\nYou can skip this in your itinerary but if you fancy roman structures. \nThis is the place.\nThere are food stalls and some shops in the area too.",
          "Historical place!!!",

          "Nice walk round by the water with eateries etc",
          "Nice place to take some photos. A little resemblance to the ruins of City of Rome. Other buildings are beautiful too but most are eateries.",

          "The view is nice, but very shops opened in the afternoon.",

          "Interesting attractions, but not somewhere I'll visit again.",

          "This is an overlooked Scenic spot because it is so close to the ferry that people are in a rush to go to senado or St Paul's. It is a 10-minute walk from the ferry and I would highly recommend going as you have a good view of the bay and \u2026",

It's an artificially looking shopping street with shops, restaurants and kiosks, much like the shopping area of a thematic park. At the time I visited it 90% of the shops and restaurants were closed.\n\nBetter spend your time somewhere else in Macau.",

        "wiki": "The Venetian Macao (Chinese: \u6fb3\u9580\u5a01\u5c3c\u65af\u4eba) is a luxury hotel and casino resort in Macau owned by the American Las Vegas Sands company. The Venetian is a 39-story, casino hotel on the Cotai Strip in Macau. The 10,500,000-square-foot (980,000 m2) Venetian Macao is modeled on its sister casino resort The Venetian Las Vegas. The Venetian Macao is the 2nd largest casino in the world, the largest single structure hotel building in Asia, and also the seventh-largest building in the world by floor area.\nThe main hotel tower was finished in July 2007 and the resort officially opened on 28 August 2007. The resort has 3,000 suites, 1,200,000 sq ft (110,000 m2) of convention space, 1,600,000 sq ft (150,000 m2) of retail, 550,000 square feet (51,000 m2) of casino space \u2013 with 3,400 slot machines and 800 gambling tables and the 15,000-seat Cotai Arena for entertainment and sports events.\nThe lead architect for the Venetian Macao were Aedas and HKS, Inc. joint venture, who were responsible for the design, coordination and implementation of the project on site.\n\n\n== Casino ==\n\nThe casino measures 546,000 sq ft (50,700 m2). It is further divided into four themed gaming areas\u2014namely, Golden Fish, Imperial House, Red Dragon and Phoenix. The casino consists of over 6,000 slot machines and 800 gambling tables.\nThe hotel offers a club called Paiza Club which caters to premium guests. The club comes with its own entrance, lobby, reception, and guest lifts to the rooms. The gaming area of the Paiza Club is divided into individual private gaming rooms each named for notable Asian cities and regions such as Yunnan, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.\nThe guests of the club have exclusive access to the club dining outlet, the Paiza Club Dining & Lounge, which is open 24 hours a day.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe hotel uses Venice, Italy, as its design inspiration and features architectural replicas of various Venetian landmarks.\n\n\n== Accommodation ==\nThe hotel tower offers 2,905 suites. The accommodation floors go from level 7 up to level 38. These floors are served by guest lifts.\nPaiza suites are reserved for premium guests. The largest is the Presidente, a 12-bay suite with four bedrooms.\n\n\n== Entertainment ==\n\nThe Cotai Arena (formerly known as the Venetian Arena) is an indoor arena, opened in 2007 with a seating capacity of 15,000. It hosts sporting events such as basketball, tennis, and boxing, as well as concerts and international televised awards shows.\n\n\n=== Zaia ===\nZaia, a 90-minute stage production by the Canadian entertainment company Cirque du Soleil, ran between 27 August 2008 and 19 February 2012 in a custom-built theater at the Venetian Macao. The show, directed by Neilson Vignola and Gilles Maheu, featured a cast of 75 circus artists. The show's theme was a young girl's perception of the stars and planets, space and infinity, populated by otherworldly creatures. The theater housing the performance seated 1,800 spectators at a time.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nOn 12 November 2008, the gates were locked to the construction labour force from a variety of Asian countries as projects were suspended.  Hsin Chong, the project manager for the Venetian, laid off approximately 400 staff. As many workers had been there for less than two years, no severance was due.  The next day, Sands' president for Asia announced that up to 11,000 workers would be losing their jobs as the company was halting building projects in Macao.In 2010 the Chinese press reported that as part of a \"sex-trade crackdown\" authorities had found more than 100 prostitutes inside the casino.In early 2011 the United States Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation into the Las Vegas Sands Corporation with respect to the compliance of its Macao properties with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGambling in Macau\nCotai Jet \u2013 owned by The Venetian Macao, operating high speed Catamaran ferry services between Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal and Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal, Hong Kong\nList of properties on the Cotai Strip\nList of Macau casinos\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Venetian Macao",

          "very enjoyable ! entry age is 25 and they are quite particular about it. casino is bustling with good crowd. i tried the roullete, slot machines and a couple of card games. lost a few dollars and made a couple hundred bucks so it was all fun for me. nice experience. the shops",
          "I could not leave Macau without visiting at least one of the casinos, since this city is the most successful gambling one in the world, with many incredible casinos. 5 of Macau\u2019s casinos have made the list of the 10 biggest casinos in the world. So I decided to visit the",
          "This was the first stop on our day tour of Macau and we were given some time to wander around and explore. It\u2019s like the original in Vegas, just bigger. There are many shops, gondola rides, and of course the casino. Photography isn\u2019t allowed in the gaming area, but our guide",
          "You can walk in there without entry fees and see hundreds of slot machine and gambling tables and view what large sums people are throwing away for hope to win",
          "This is such an amazing place where everything you see is nice and lovely anywhere you look. You would have a so-called mock-up of Venice. The best thing? The biggest casino in the world is here. Play for fun.",
          "Yes, superbly crowded on weekends, so avoid if you can. But the place is used to crowd, and indeed built for it, so dont worry! The whole interior is built to look exactly like Venice. Beautiful photo moments at every corner too! Big, upscale brands, as you might expect too.",
          "Somehow I like to go to a Casino with fewer people and Casino Venetian is not the one. It is because I prefer to have a less crowded Casino. But some people like to have fun with more people!",
          "last time i was in this hotel was in the year 2013, still the check in was chaotic, however when i went to the foodcourt, i was amazed at the available food choices , offering taiwanese. japanese, korean , macao , thai, and western food.",
          "Like the landmark in Macao. Many shop to walk around and great to shopping even to photo itself. If you inside you never know the time coz it always day time.",
          "it was a total de ja vu, like being back in Vegas- a total replica. however, everything is newer, grander, cleaner...",
          "I am with my fiance and my mom at the Venetian Casino till midnite and what makes me suprise that there are a lot of prostitute hanging around looking for customer. A few of this hoe are disturning my fiance which really piss me off.. I do hope the management will do something",
          "Very lovely place for adult and kids all can enjoy their time together So many kids attraction and also adult relaxing time. Both can enjoy their holiday, sure gonna come back again if we go to Macao",
          "Although we didn't stay at the Venetian, it was still worth a visit for the almost theme park vibe, the impressive recreation of Venice, and just to check out the sheer size of the complex. We splurged on the gondola ride which was probably almost as expensive as the real",
          "Eating dim sum in the Chinese dim sum restaurant in Venetian is a bad experience for me because they are not made the Cantonese way of cooking . They are more like half northern and half southern style. To make the matter worse is the price is not cheap either.",
          "I recommend just having a look but as one of the most famous properties in Macau, it\u2019s highly monitored and controlled to ensure no one makes any big winnings. They have lots to learn from Vegas.",
          "It is a comprehensive place for casino, hotel, exhibition, shopping, restaurant and leisure facilities which is filled with Venetian arches and man-made canal for gondola rides. The whole place is beautifully decorated and lighted.",
          "This is a very big place . The decor is very beautiful and there are a lot of very expensive shops. Nice to visit to experience the place but if you are not gambler like me it is just another Casino resort.",
          "We actually planned to go somewhere to celebrate \ud83c\udf84 \ud83c\udf84but not much choice as my mom and dad who are in 90s don\u2019t want to go too far. Then decided to go Macau and randomly picked a restaurant for Christmas dinner. We do not expect too much of the service as it\u2019s Christmas time,",
          "Really impressive place, absolutely huge and lots to do. Shopping is a must if your there as there is something for everyone at good prices especially brand clothing brands. I did a two night stay and the accommodation was brilliant worthy of 5 stars and the staff are super",
          "Wow. I have been told this was world\u2019s biggest casino. Very massive building, it has lots of shop, restaurants. Busy place, very clean, great decor and friendly staff.",
          "I am not a gambler, but the casino is worth a look for the floor shows and maybe the odd flutter on one of the games.",
          "If you feel that biggest is best, than this is the place for you. It is either the world's largest or 2nd largest casino. Either way, it has a wide variety of both table games and slots, but I would say that the table games dominate unless I missed out on a whole area of",
          "i really enjoy playing there,,that is my first time playing in casino..the staft there is very acommodating and very comfortable place to play",
          "As young westerners, we felt most comfortable in this casino. We were intensely stared at by other casino-goers in all the other casinos we entered! We were also consistently ID\u2019d in the other casinos whereas this one ID\u2019d us upon entry then made us feel super welcome once we",
          "Stunning hotel and casino, but their food court was so crowded that it took us almost 30 minutes to sit down and eat. The food was served right away but we can't sit since there's no vacant space for us to eat. Still excellent hotel and casino though.",
          "I have been to Casino at Venetian in Las Vegas, but this one in Macao features much bigger shopping areas. Besides, this is far cleaner than the real Venice in Italy. You can enjoy great restaurants in reasonable prices. Take frequent free shuttle buses to and from the old",
          "Spent 4h here. 2 of them were willingly then We couldnt find our way out. A LOT to do in here so I still recommend it. High end shopping, spontaneous shows along the halls and incredible decor. Worth it for the art and culture alone. There is just so much to see and do here. I",
          "I was part of a rigged game on Poker, was cheated by a group of Chinese, after facing all issues with the management they were on the side of the locals . Such a racist place, worst poker experience in my life. If you are not from a Chinese origin better dont go there to play",
          "Now I'm not a gambler but there is so much to look at inside here. The shops are all top brand labels so you could spend a fortune. There are a myriad of food places to eat at from buffets, food halls and restaurants. The hallways between places are wide but I did find the",
          "Must see for fake Venice, pretty in St marks square Food hall good, no western choices though As with all casinos, lots of gamblers",
          "The walk by the 'canal' is so realistic - just keep looking away from the shops and enjoy the antics of the gondoliers! Don't miss Lord Stowe's Portuguese custard tarts - but be prepared to queue, they are very popular.",
          "It\u2019s a casino and it\u2019s what you expect, lots of tables although they could do with black jack. Beer is free if playing but you have to push to get one.",
          "Change your money at the airport. At the Cotai Strip, none of the casinos exchange Philippine Peso to MOP. Just ended up withdrawing from the ATM.",
          "The casino at Venetian Macao opened in 2007 on the Cotai Strip and is presently the second largest casino in the world with 546,000 square feet of floor space. Even for non-gamblers, its size, scale and crowds are really something to see. The casino occupies much of the ground",
          "Hotel is huge and needs lots of walking. Casino did not provide free mineral water unlike in Galaxy Hotel. Still prefer Galaxy Hotel due to its stragic pathway.",
          "This is supposed to be the world's largest casino It will take more than a day to just walk around the casino It's an amazing hotel & I keep coming around for this amazing experience",
          "You will be spoilt for choices when it comes to casino in Macau. The casino is Venetian is considered one of the biggest among the many. Whichever time you go, it is always crowded. All casinos provide free beverages n bottle water for the guests. Restaurants are easily",
          "Having visited venice the hotel really gives you that kinda feel . Amazing shops restaurants and gondolas a rotating skyline feel Italy in macau. A must visit .",
          "This is the best casino in macau....it is is super huge in size n is always filled up with so so many guests / tourists Love the energy on the casino floor Dont both wasting time going from casino to casino...just come to venetian n gamble",
          "Typical of the buzz you expect at a Macau casino. Very clean and well laid out. Tables are busy at all times but that\u2019s to be expected. Huge casino, a must visit if you\u2019re in Macau.",
          "Look like Las Vegas but more bigger then that. This Venetian building make my dream to Las Vegas come true even it not in Las Vegas. But the feel i get it's like Las Vegas.",
          "Vinetion has everything. You atleast need 2 days to cover this place . From Casio to shopping and amazing restuarant like cafe deco and the peacock. It's beautiful made at every corner you would like to get your self clicked. They have Venice like theme for the shopping area.",
          "I've been going to this casino ever since it opened. No longer. All good slot machines have gone, very little choice now, all boring machines. Staff extremely unhelpful. MGM, Wynn and City of Dreams are a thousand times better. Give it a miss unless absolutely necessary.",
          "Massive gaming floor at The Venetian Macao casino. Enough floor space to fill cattle trains (bus loads) full of people mainly from Mainland China. And does so. Replica of Venetian canals in the adjoining shopping mall. We know how faked it is, because the facade buildings are",
          "We were excited to see the second largest casino in the world. It was huge for sure. You can go on a gondola ride just like the one in Vegas. But a lot of the games were exactly the same and we got bored quickly. If you love slots, this is the place for you.",
          "A must visit when in Macau. Free shuttle bus from and to macau ferry terminal. Huge casino, mostly crowded at all times. Many different kind of gambling games available. You\u2019d be asked to make a card first in order to play which will have your name and photo (photo will be",
          "Eastern Las Vegas. Very impressive building complex, at night even more spectacular. It is a very much touristic spot but a nonetheless a must see in Macau.",
          "The casino is at the first floor of the Venetian hotel, very big and you can find different kinds of gambling games, but seriously too crowded. If you enjoy surrounded by people, it\u2019s perfect to you. If you don\u2019t bet your luck, there is a big shopping mall above the casino.",
          "What a visit yesterday night I did not expect such a huge building with an amazing architecture. Inside, it is was also impressive. I had never seen such a big surface for gambling: you have everything. If you are a gambler, you found THE place here.",
          "The Venetian is an indoor street environment with boats on a canal. It is made to look like Venice Itay but also has a casino. We chose not to go to one of the expensive restaurants and not to eat Asian fast food. We had instead an Australian burger that did not disappoint. We",
          "One of the best professionally managed Casino. It was an experience of it's kind. Good courtesy & highly smart people to manage the whole show. Worth visiting, even though if you do not play in casino.",
          "Very big casino. Plenty of food courts. Nice set up. Very huge and scenic. Worth the visit. But no halal food restaurants.",
          "How nicely they are maintaining this place is the question u will be having in ur mind, its a Casino, a very big mall, food courts, Mac D, etc etc etc.. without venetian trip ur Macau visit is incomplete. Its a must visit place",
          "O stayed in Venetian in Vegas and it was much better. Being so big and with so few people, specially the shopping area, I missed more liveliness . The decor and the building is great, just not the correct atmosphere.",
          "Big and nice place for fun,a lot of machine to play for fun.It\u2019s beautiful inside many shops for shopping.",
          "This hotel with the architecture, the painted ceilings and the grand canals of Venice is an impressive experience. The queue for the gondola ride can be lengthy but the experience makes it well worth while. Truly romantic place for a weekend getaway.",
          "It took me quite a while to walk through the indoor streets to find the main lobby because I moved from Sheraton nearby. It's a city on its own. It would have been more impressive to me had I not been to places like the Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.",
          "The fish is very costly around 2400.00 for small fish..staff could not speak basic English. There is no price in menu book.but when I got the bill, I was shocked until now..Be careful guyz, you might be grab without knowing.",
          "Thank you to Venetian casino!! My wife and I had a lucky and wonderful night with you, will come back win you again soon lol",
          "Great casino.. lots of resturants and great shops for clothing Victoria secret store and all brands as well.",
          "Be it this casino in macao or any other casino, they are so aptly built that one cannot escape from here easily. They serve tea coffee and juices to all in the house free.",
          "It so huge casino lot of shop and resturant for lunch and dinner . Have a free shuttle bus from airport are provide.",
          "This casino is huge, it is my favorite one to go gamble. The tables starts at 300-1000 hk dollars a bet. Pretty hefty for a casino. It is very crowded on the weekends, and can easily get lost, it's huge. The casino only play with hk dollars so don't change your money to macau",
          "This hotel is very big and the casino full of people, if you like shopping you can come to this hotel because they have more than 1000 shop and a lot of food you can try in this hotel. If you visit this hotel better becareful with your belonging because to crowded.",
          "If you plan on gambling, you'd better be ready with a large amount of cash. The minimums are often at least US$ 130 while finding US$ 5, 10, 15 & 20 tables in Las Vegas are the norm. The games are mainly Chinese and European games with a small mixing of the games you'd find in",
          "The hotel is very large and the casino is quite spacious, many visitor try their lucky in this casino",
          "This is expensive compared to Australian casinos. Blackjack was minimum $60au a hand )$300hk) with most tables $100-$200au ($500-$1000hk) a hand. Pokies are just a place to donate money to the casino, minimal bar service areas, you really have to search if you want a drink,",
          "I loved the Casino at the Venetian, I felt like I was in Vegas again. As busy and beautiful as it is it did lack my fave places to gamble. All or mostly all of the machines are in Asian and made it very difficult to enjoy.",
          "The area in the Venetian is so big, I was trying to find the exit which I entered from but even after 2 hours, damn I couldn't find it. The casino is huge, the high end mall also spans a few floors. It's cute that they have the canals and gondola to mimic venice.",
          "With more than 12 types of games and 8 types of betting activities its one of the biggest casinos in asia. Enjoyed a lot with people winning and losing at the same table but one should always play as per their pocket in order to have good experience.",
          "This casino may be the largest in the world but we found it to be soul-less and expensive in terms of minimum bets and there were only 8 black jack tables. Just no atmosphere which didn\u2019t help the winnings. Tables only accept HK dollars. Would not go again.",
          "Stayed here for 3 day had great time ,room was massive beautifully layout.casino is huge got lost few times expensive to gamble chips are min $100 aud but plenty to see and do",
          "Visited on a day trip to Macau whilst on holiday in Hong Kong. Easy to get to via the Macau ferry and numerous buses available when you step out of the terminal. The hotel itself was voted our first stop and was by far the best of the day, apparently a replica of the hotel in",
          "1. Just excellent - makes u feel spell bound on the sheer architecture of the huge building 2. Indian vegetarian food is available at a particular restaurant at the venetian 3. Do eat at the big food court - lots of good options. 4. Have the egg tarts - they cannot be missed 5.",
          "absolutely loved the casino even though am not a gambler, the whole venetian hotel, shopping mall, restaurants, service, d\u00e9cor is amazing and well worth a visit its a experience on its own loved it",
          "I watched the building of this commence in 2008. It was a ma.grove swamp at this time. When you visit you can see the video of the construction. Its bigger and better than America. More canals, more outlets. Great restaurants catering for ALL tastes. A must do. One amongst",
          "We spent half a day at the Venetian and the time just flew. There are an enormous number of shops and eateries and of course a large casino facility. You could well believe you were in Venice when watching the gondola gliding along the waterway. Well worth a visit.",
          "Try Your Luck and Enjoy lots of Variety of card games as well as slot machine and rollatee. Biggest Table and Good Staff",
          "Easily one of the biggest casinos which i have visited and was always full of people with lot of choices and convenient because was staying in the same place",
          "This seems to be the largest casino in Macau. If you are in a group of people, it will be hard to find each other. It is really huge but also super elegant and exciting. We had fun.",
          "In case you are first time visitor to Macau then Venetian casino should be your first stop. Although there are multiple casinos in Macau which have helped it earn the name of Las Vegas of Asia. You can choose any one from several casinos as most of these hotels provide free pick",
          "Casino in Venetian Macau is impressive and is big place for enjoying the play and loose money or gain money.",
          "If your in Macau then you are in the Vegas of the East. Similar to Las Vegas the Venetian is a cheesy representation of everthing from ancient Venice and Rome. While it will never compare to the real thing it does give you a taste of what is 100 times better if you make a trip",
          "big mall with gondolas on the upper floor, underground mall connection with the different hotels/casinos around - watch out that u don't get lost",
          "Spent last 4 days at the Venetian Casino Macau, at the G2E Gaming conference. The service, facilities and Casino floor were all first class. This is a must see if you are in Macau.",
          "Genuinely lovely. Definitely recommend checking it out. They say it's the Vegas of asia and that isn't an understatement.",
          "It was a good experience. Food mall inside, shopping plaza with discounts as well. I felt the sky false ceiling could be better without the visible caps and in some places faulty shadow lighting. Gondola ride is amazing anyways...",
          "huge and beautiful property(city by itself),stayed with family in suite room,room service food and service is the most professional.Big area so one need to walk a lot and might get confused as many entrance though good signages,reception area small with many counters close and",
          "Had to check out the Casino at Venetian Macao and I have to say - because I have been to the Venetian in Las Vegas Nevada - it's very similar with the gondola rides, the various in door food and shopping - but what was different was how they really ONLY let adults (18 and over)",
          "I visited the Venitian on my last day. I walked from the Parisian using their connected walkways. I enjoyed watching the gondolas. Sometimes you can even hear a serenade during gondola rides. I also enjoyed Lord Stow's egg tart. I did a quick shopping before heading to the",
          "Well worth a visit. The canals are endless and the walkways are filled with shops. The atmosphere inside was great. Had a nice cleansing ale in one of the bars. Much bigger than the venetian in Las Vegas and worth a visit if you have a spare hour or two.",
          "Having stayed at the Venetian Las Vegas I was keen to see the bigger version in Macau - it did not disappoint. Great selection of pokies although very limited black jack (this was the same everywhere) tables with reasonable min stakes. the big difference between Vegas and Macau",
          "The Venetian Macao is the biggest casino in the world with numerous number of tables and machine slots. We had no plan to gamble, however visited the casino to get firsthand experience of world\u2019s largest casino. The place is massive but was crowded, it was a different kind of",

          "It\u2019s one of the largest casinos in Macau, a very busy casino indeed, especially at weekends, as my self do not gamble, it was very noisy, and crowded for my liking",
          "US funds have re-established a Las Vegas in Asia to a larger area, volumes and wealth. With its buildings, the most important buildings of Venice (Duke's Palace, Rialto Bridge, St. Mark's bell tower, clock tower) have been depicted, while on the huge ground floor of the building",
          "Waited over 15 minutes with the service light on to get some water and no one ever came to help me. Attendants seem to be few and far between, not walking around very much. Instead they can be seen standing still doing nothing but too far away to attract their attention. Our",
          "We travelled over to Macao on the Cotai water jet cost 200H.K.D about \u20ac50 . it is a quick service but remember to bring your passport to Macao as it was a Portuguese protectorate and you will need the passport , The Venetian is absolutely huge with an impressive gambling area",
          "This casino inside tries to attract visitors with entertainment in Italian style: canal, gondolas and Italian singing. A lot of shops of all styles: clothing, jewelry, cosmetics, etc. Food zone will meet tastes and expectation of any visitor, even the most experienced one. You",
          "The Venetian has a massive casino . Lots of tables n slots . Enjoy a few spins or do some serious gambling you are sure to enjoy it . Soft drinks are free not alcohol. No need for formal as frequented by tourist all day n night . Good luck to all of you .",
          "Even if it looks really artificial it is impressive to see how they have reproduced this city. I prefer of course the original one :-)",
          "This casino is huge! Could accommodate hundreds upon hundreds of people. Some of the buy ins for the tables are quite high but, there is also a big array of slot machines to try.",
          "No need to go to Italy because Venetian offers a lot from shopping malls and restaurants and also gondola.Very luxurious painting in the ceiling.",
          "Larger than the Venetian in Las Vegas, but also feel quite impersonal than the buzzling, vibrant feel of a Las Vegas Venetian casino. Awe nevertheless.",
          "If you like casino gamble machines then it's no fun in this casino. Allmost all the games are the same. There are still plenty of table games but you can't played that all day long. The casino is big like the other casinos and there are shops inside. Another fun thing to do is",
          "Venetian Macau is over all good,but extremely over hyped place.Nothing wow about place.its good place",
          "Take on the hop on bus when you reach Macau and they will bring you to this magnificent tower- Casio at Venetian Macao. It\u2019s a Wow Wow wow. (Cant compare to our little Casio in the red dot). Seeing is believing.",
          "The Venetian boasts one of the most luxurious casinos in the world. The decor is undoubtedly extravagent. However non-gamblers have no reason to stay more than ten minutes.",
          "The casino was featured in discovery channel as a feat of engineering. But other than extravagant design. It is just another big casino. The so called canal replica is nothing near than venice culture.",
          "The Venetian is definitely worth a look if you are in Macau, even if it is just to see the weird indoor canals. It\u2019s actually super impressive when you first see it. It gets boring pretty quickly but definitely something to see. The casino it\u2019s is super boing like all the",
          "The Venetian is worth a visit if you\u2019re planning to travel to Macau. There are plenty of shops in the Hotel Casino to kill a couple of hours with window shopping. They provide a shuttle bus to and from the Hong Kong Macau Ferry Terminal. And if you want to stop by Macau\u2019s City",
          "Day trip to Macau via ferry. Took a cab to the Venetian. This place is huge! Stopped and deposited 100 hkd at the casino! They have a Venetian style boat and waterway throughout the mall. You can rent a boat ride through the canals. Lots of shopping to be had. And extremely",
          "It's huge but about the same as the Venetian in Las Vegas. It's so tiring to walk and the shops are about the same as Las Vegas, maybe less.",
          "Immense, crowdy, big difference the number of baccarat tables is very high and the same for other Asian games. For the test copy paste of the Venetian in Las Vegas. Perhaps also a bit more Asian restaurants, but that is logic",
          "This place is HUGE - I went in at one place and came out I think on the other side of Macau (insert sarcasm). It has every store you can think of and then some. There\u2019s a gondola with singers and the atmosphere is amazing as they have outdone themselves creating a feeling that",
          "We\u2019ve stayed at the Venetian many times In Vegas. And while this hotel has a similar feel and \u201clook\u201d it\u2019s definitely not as spectacular. However, it seems to be \u201cthe\u201d casino to be at in Macao. The place is awesome for people watching and the casino is massive and packed with",
          "Maybe the glitz here is more attractive to draw in visitors? Certainly it was busy and buzzy whilst other casinos were quiet. But maybe the food court attracts many?",
          "We visited this place just to see the light show in the lobby which lasted for about three minutes or so. But really enjoyed seeing this.",
          "A bit steep minimum bet is $300 HK \u00a330 for your casual gamblers, very busy and Baccarat was on 90% of tables.",
          "Great for gamblers, but if you want a drink or a dance, go somewhere else. Close to town, easy access",
          "Huge casino that serves mostly Chinese clientele as 99% of the tables are for games that are unknown to the west. Unfortunately some of the dealers do not speak comprehensible English and they use gestures to guide the player... Clean and tidy however for the huge space with",
          "We had some time left to visit the Casino and it was OK but nothing special somehow. Good thing is that all Casinos in Macau provide free Shuttles from and to the Ferry!",
          "Best of the best restaurant. Food was great staff was nice. Certainly recommended place to visit in Macao",
          "This was more of a tacky arcade rather than a casino. Rather small, situated in the lobby area of the hotel, used as a through walk to the hotel suites. It had no atmosphere and seemed rather dead.",
          "This Casino is the best one,I ever have seen. The variety of games available is Awesome...There is no cheating or Bouncers.. They keep high standards",
          "Its a huge casino with so many tables including high & medium stakes table. Apart from tables it offers huge variety of machine games which are very picket friendly also.",
          "We didn't visit it inside because we are not up to casino and we haven't got time to do it but from outside it's just stunning with all its lights and around there are also others casino. its a really nice area if you are interested about pictures",

          "We did not want to gamble but came to The Venetian for a look at one example of the extravagance that casinos embody. This place is enormous, over the top, and every other phrase you can think of that says over done. As a suitably cheesy finish to our day in Macau we had a",

          "It is the most visited casino in Macau. It is huge and the one can get lost in the crowd. The staff is very friendly. Though i am not into gambling, i enjoyed watching people play and win. The hotel itself is designed very beautifully.",

          "I wanted to play some Texas hold'em. I ended up waiting 1h before i could take a seat. There was min. 50/100 hkd tables. To big when youre just wanna play for fun. In Vegas there is room for all types of gamblers. In Macau only highrollers.",

          "Caught a ferry from Kowloon to visit Macau which is comfortable and reasonably priced. On arriving you just grab a complimentary bus to the casino of choice in city. The Venetian is a pretty good attempt to create a bit of Italy in Macau. A recreated Campanile from St Marks",

          "This was my third visit to the Macau Venetian Casino. During each visit, I was amazed by how much larger than it was compared to its twin in Las Vegas as I wandered around. Outside the piazza was expansive along with the imposing clock tower. Inside the casino across the",
          "not a fan of these kinds of places, but still it is interesting to see what attracts so many people to throw their money at... not meaning only the casino, but the whole public part of the place - the shopping areas, replicas of Venice above all. The technology and design are",
          "We joined a tour group and was taken to the venetian. The hotel was very busy and many tourist. Appears to be a drop-off point. The gondola ride looks interesting although it is a short ride. Personally i dont find it a value for money but have seen people queuing for this.",
          "Loved it! It felt like we were really in Italy. Although it was a bit crowded. But we still enjoyed. The place is clean and well maintained which I liked because some place similar to this don't maintian theirs really well",

          "This hotel is over rated in terms of class and service. I was rudely refused entry in to the casinos over the pretext I didn\u2019t look 21. I am 40 years old (nowhere close to 21) and had valid electronic passport ID which Mr.Roshan (security to casinos) refused to accept. These",

          "We arrived here from HK at approx 7pm after leaving our hotel in HK at 430pm. One regret we have is that we should of left earlier as we were unaware of the sheer vastness of the casinos. The casino is very grand and vast. You need a personal tour guide if that\u2019s even a thing",
          "The tower looks wonderful at night. Whilst its about half the size of the actual one its a nice spend of a few hours. The hotel itself is very good and has shops, casino etc and no more different on the inside then the rest along the strip.",

          "It is what it is. The table limits are way too high, but the variety of machines can\u2019t be faulted. I still have not got my head around why casinos in Macau don\u2019t use the local currency, aside from the fact that they are making money off currency exchange. It does seem odd to",
          "Very big. Very busy. When I was there looked like half the poker machines were being replaced - but there were still plenty of free ones. It looked like free drinks (just small water bottles) were being handed out, but no one came near me - won't dwell on why that was.",
          "It is worth a brief visit to casinos to get a feel of the atmosphere and activity that goes on inside a glamorous building. The second floor of the building contains a replica of a Venetian canal complete with gondolas.",
          "This one can be considered as the best casino of Macao. Grand and beautiful building with lots to see and those who love gambling, it's a paradise for them. We went there as a part of our day tour to Macao and really found it a must visit place. You can see clear blue sky in",

          "Quite interesting venue even when we are not gamblers. Interesting to watch the hordes of mainland nationals burn their money like they're on a mission. The associated mall and architecture is very nicely done. Not been to Vegas Venetian but understand very comparable in 'no",
          "The Venetian is just an impressive building, with the artificial canal and entire Venice setting. Overall it was very crowded, but that's what a casino is normally for. For having fun, gambling and shopping at exclusive stores.",

          "If there is any casino in Macao it is this one, as the slot machines are not too tight and all is well",
          "Its a pretty good atmosphere but what I don't understand is why does this casino do not want to accept its own currency. Logic failed when they refused to take a small currency note of their own currency but were very happy with any currency note of their neighbor's Hong Kong.",
          "Unique hotel decor ... cleaner & grander than Venice itself \ud83d\ude0athe casino is huge & caters to a many slabs of stakes .

          "The casino at the Venetian is big and for me felt well planned. Slot machines and card games nicely separated so each has its share of guests but close enough to take a peek and at each. The gambling here scales up very well and there are different areas for those who want to",
          "Easy to get lost I the massive casino and shopping experience. Lots of food options - many expensive Worth a walk through",
          "Please be aware the Venetian is not the place to go if you want a decent drink. Couldn\u2019t help but feel we were robbed when ordering 2 Aperol Spritz\u2019s. They were very sneaky with the ice cube being almost the same size as the glass. For over USD10.00 we got about 1\u201d of drink in",

          "I surprised that this hotel have so beautiful ornament and decoration, many stores for shopping 'till we tired and we can dine at food court with many dishes we can choose suitable with our taste.",
          "It was very surprising for me to see that Venetian and all other Macao casinos lack variety of games which is standard and can be found worldwide at casinos like Monaco, Singapore, USA, Goa etc. 75% pf the casino floor is occupied by Bacarrat tables and slot machines. No variety",
          "Very nice hotel based on the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas which again is based upon as its name would suggest Venice Italy. Just no atmosphere here unlike Vegas. Maybe this was a really low season on our visit. But still worth a visit all the same.",

          "We took the free shuttle bus from the Sands to the Venetian, and just walked around for an hour. The Grand Canal precinct is worth seeing for the reproduction of Venice without the smells and the rubbish. The gondoliers can sing well and the sky is always blue. Very kitsch, but",
          "It was worth the wait, the gondola I was in had a gondolier who could belt out any song and he was such an entertainer. I realised later that all gondoliers are basically opera singers. As for the Venetian itself, I have to admit it did a good job replicating a Venetian feel",
          "We went here on one of our walk abouts, just to check it out, its massive, and very nicely done, lots of shoppes, restaurants, and even gondola rides, amazing, a lot to see, do, and play here, just simply amazing to see, we were glad to take the time, to check it out.",

It is said that when the Portuguese sailors landed at the coast just outside the temple and asked the name of the place, the natives replied Maa-gok or A-maa-gok (lit. \"The Pavilion of the Mother\"). The Portuguese then named the peninsula \"Macau\". The temple was well described in ancient Chinese texts, as well as represented in paintings, related to Macao. It is also one of the first scenes photographed in Macao.\nIn 2005, the temple became one of the designated sites of the Historic Centre of Macau, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe temple consists of six main parts: Gate Pavilion, the Memorial Arch, the Prayer Hall, the Hall of Benevolence (the oldest part of the temple), the Hall of Guanyin, Zhengjiao Chanlin - Buddhist Pavilion.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nReligion in Macau\nList of historic buildings and structures in Macau\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Taipa (Chinese: \u6c39\u4ed4, Cantonese: [t\u02b0\u0250\u030cm.t\u0361s\u0250\u030ci\u032f]; Portuguese: Taipa, pronounced [\u02c8tajp\u0250]) is an island in Macau, presently united with the island of Coloane by reclaimed land known as Cotai. Administratively, the boundaries of the traditional civil parish Freguesia de Nossa Senhora do Carmo are coterminous with that of former Taipa Island.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTaipa is 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) from Macau Peninsula and east of the Lesser Hengqin Island of Zhuhai, Guangdong Province. Macau International Airport, University of Macau, Macau Jockey Club and Macau Stadium are situated in Taipa.\n\nArea: 6.33 square kilometres (2.44 sq mi) (1.5 by 3.5 kilometres (0.93 by 2.17 miles))\nPopulation: 70,000Most Chinese settlement of Taipa occurred during the Southern Song Dynasty, while the Portuguese occupied the island in 1851. Prior to land reclamation, Taipa consisted of two islands: Greater Taipa and Lesser Taipa.\nThe 159.1-metre (522.0-foot) Taipa Grande Hill (\u5927\u6f6d\u5c71) is to the east, and Taipa Pequena Hill (\u5c0f\u6f6d\u5c71) to the west. Central Taipa is a plain as a result of siltation and land reclamation. Initially Taipa was connected to Coloane Island only by the Estrada do Istmo (\u8def\u6c39\u9023\u8cab\u516c\u8def) causeway; but the area called Cotai, built on reclaimed land from 2004 and which is home to mega-resorts, casinos, and convention and exhibition centres, has now connected the two islands into one piece of land. Taipa is connected to peninsular Macau by Governador Nobre de Carvalho Bridge, Friendship Bridge and the Sai Van Bridge.\nTaipa is predominantly a growing residential area with many new apartment complexes, mostly up-scale, under construction as of 2006. As a new town of Macau, Taipa has better city planning than Macau Peninsula; however, many people choose to live in Macau Peninsula since most of the famous schools are located there.\n\n\n== The names of Taipa ==\nIn Cantonese, Taipa has been known by many names over time, including \u9f8d\u74b0 (Lung Waan, meaning \"Dragon Ring\"), \u96de\u9838 (Gai Geng, \"Chicken's neck\"), \u6f6d\u4ed4 (Taam Jai, \"Pool\"), and \u9f8d\u982d\u74b0 (Lung Tau Waan, \"Dragon's-Head Ring\").\nThe Portuguese and English name \"Taipa\" comes from the Chinese pronunciation of \u6c39\u4ed4 in Min Nan /tiap-\u00e1/ (similar to \"tiamp-a\") then became \"Taipa\". The putonghua pinyin for \u6c39\u4ed4 is d\u00e0ngz\u01cei, and this is how the island is referred to in Mandarin. Both the character \u6c39 and the alternative form \u51fc mean cesspit, but are obsolete in modern Chinese, and only used in relation to Taipa and the Macau-Taipa Bridge (\u6fb3\u6c39\u5927\u6865 \u00e0od\u00e0ng d\u00e0qi\u00e1o). The character \u6c39, or \u51fc (often used in Mainland Chinese texts), is often missing from mobile phone and computer input systems.\nAnother version according to legend, comes from an exchange between early Portuguese settlers on Taipa and local Chinese settlers. The Portuguese asked the Chinese the name (nome in Portuguese) of the place. The Chinese settlers were local grocery shopkeepers and spoke no Portuguese, but took the Portuguese nome for the Chinese \u7cef\u7c73, \"sticky rice\", which is pronounced similar to nome in Cantonese. Thinking the Portuguese settlers were asking if they sold sticky rice, the Chinese responded with \"\u5927\u628a,\" pronounced \"daai ba\" in Cantonese, meaning \"a lot.\" The Portuguese, hearing the response, took this to be the name of the place. There is, however, no historical evidence to support this story. \"Taipa\" is also what the Portuguese call the clay-mud, rammed into moulds, used to build mud houses in Portugal in times gone by, in recent times referred to as Rammed Earth.\nIt is also worth noting that, as the great majority of the population in Taipa and Macau is Chinese; however, there is a growing community of expatriates living in Taipa who work at the casinos on the Cotai Strip or at the schools and universities. Most people refer to this island by its Cantonese name, \"Tamzai\", and most taxi drivers and bus drivers will not understand if asked how to go to \"Taipa.\"\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nPublic preschool and primary school:\n\nEscola Luso-Chinesa da Taipa (\u6c39\u4ed4\u4e2d\u8461\u5b78\u6821) - Preschool and primary schoolPrivate tuition-free primary and secondary schools:\n\nMacau Anglican College - Preschool through secondary\nEscola C\u00e1ritas de Macau (\u660e\u611b\u5b78\u6821) - Special education\nEscola Dom Jo\u00e3o Paulino - Preschool and primary school\nFong Chong School of Taipa (Escola Fong Chong da Taipa; \u6c39\u4ed4\u574a\u773e\u5b78\u6821) - Preschool through senior secondary school\nHou Kong Middle School Macau Affiliated English School (\u6fe0\u6c5f\u4e2d\u5b78\u9644\u5c6c\u82f1\u624d\u5b78\u6821)\nMacau Pooi To Middle School Taipa Elementary School Branch (\u6fb3\u57f9\u9053\u4e2d\u5b78\u6c39\u4ed4\u5c0f\u5b78\u5206\u6821)\nPui Va Middle School (Escola Secund\u00e1ria Pui Va; \u57f9\u83ef\u4e2d\u5b78) - Preschool through secondary school\nMacao Sam Yuk Middle School - Primary and secondary school\nAffiliated School of the University of Macau (Escola de Aplica\u00e7\u00e3o Anexa \u00e0 Universidade de Macau; \u6fb3\u9580\u5927\u5b78\u9644\u5c6c\u61c9\u7528\u5b78\u6821) - Preschool through secondaryPrivate non-free primary and secondary schools:\n\nThe International School of Macao - Located in Block K of the Macau University of Science and Technology - Preschool through secondary\nSchool of the Nations - Preschool through secondary and special education\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nMacau University of Science and Technology (MUST), Institute for Tourism Studies, and City University of Macau are located in Taipa.

        "wiki": "Saint Dominic's Church (Chinese: \u677f\u6a1f\u5802; Portuguese: Igreja de S\u00e3o Domingos) is a late 16th-century Baroque-style church that serves within the Cathedral Parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau.  It is located in the peninsular part of the city at the Largo de S\u00e3o Domingos, situated near the Leal Senado Building.\nThe construction of the church was finished in 1587 and was overseen by three Spanish Dominican priests.  Due to renovations and reconstruction, the current structure dates back to the early 17th century.  The church is listed as one of the 29 sites that form the Historic Centre of Macau, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was established in 1587 by three Spanish Dominican priests who arrived from Acapulco, Mexico.  It was the scene of violence in 1644, when a Spanish officer\u2014loyal to the King of Spain and opposing the colony's determination to stay allegiant with Portugal after the dissolution of the Iberian Union\u2014entered the church in order to seek refuge from an angry mob.  He was promptly murdered at the foot of the altar while mass was being celebrated.  Sixty-three years later, in 1707, the Dominicans supported the Pope's stance with regards to the Chinese Rites controversy.  This was in opposition and defiance to the view of the Bishop of Macau, who subsequently excommunicated them.  When soldiers were sent to the church in order to uphold this ruling, the friars responded by closing the church for three days and throwing rocks to repel them.The first Portuguese-language newspaper in China\u2014A Abelha da China (The China Bee)\u2014was published at St. Dominic's on September 12, 1822.  The church closed down in 1834 when monastic orders were dissolved and expropriated to the government, who then converted it into barracks, a stable and an office for public works.  However, it later reopened and was given many works of sacred art from other religious orders dissolved back in Portugal.The church underwent renovation in 1997 and a museum was added alongside the church.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe church of St. Dominic was built in a Baroque style and is noted for its mixture of European and local Macanese features in its design.  This is demonstrated in the church's use of Chinese-style roof tiles and doors made of teak.  The church's high altar features a statue of the Madonna and Child as the centrepiece and is flanked by wood and ivory-carved statues of several saints.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe Treasure of Sacred Art Museum was established as part of the 1997 renovation and is located inside the church's bell tower.  It contains approximately 300 religious works of art and artifacts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of oldest buildings and structures in Macau\nReligion in Macau\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt. Dominic's Church Museum \u2013 Treasure of Sacred Art\n Geographic data related to Church of Saint Dominic, Macau at OpenStreetMap",

          "Firstly, the Immigration into Macau, horrendous guys, they think no sky to themselves, totally and absolutely absurdly rude. But once you cross them, DONT LET THEM AFFECT YOUR MOODS, you will be in paradise. The government and of course STANLEY HO the \"king of Macau\" has spared",
          "I lived in a place where there are so many catholic churches around with different design and art. But this church is a nice one because of its history.",
          "this was the least interesting place in Macau. It looked like your average catholic church. I did like the history behind it, but it wasn't all that great.",
          "If you want to pray & have a quiet moment in the middle of a busy tourist area, this is the place to be. While it's open to tourists, noise & picture-taking inside are not allowed. The seating area is exclusive for those who would like to pray. Unfortunately, there's no Mass on",

          "This is a World Heritage Site, with a functional Catholic Church. Although most of the building was rebuild in the 1800, the church sends of vibes of dignity, holiness and a general sense of wellness once you set foot on its ground. One can witness the old style of the layout",

          "Coming from Europe we expected probably too much. The church is historic and old but not special. You would not even notice such a church in Europe.",
          "Take a picture inside and outside the church. But the ceiling was plain unlike old church / cathedral as I expected it would be. When you get inside, it would be better to be not noisy since there would be people praying.",
          "We popped in here, as I am sure many other visitors do, on the way up to finding the ruins of St Pauls; but I am so glad that we did as the ruins proved to be just that, with no spirituality at all, whereas this beautiful church was quiet and tranquil. Quite simple in its decor",
          "Constructed in 1587, and now can be found at Largo Sao Domingos, I was very happy to be able to come inside and say a prayer. Amidst the busy, touristry and commercial atmosphere outside, it is peaceful inside. And was able to hear a Portuguese mass last February.",

          "Visited this church during our stay. It feels like it doesn't fit the city of Macau, almost out of place with it's style. The church is peaceful, nicely decorated and is beautiful to walk through. It's a quick stop as you explore the square.",

          "One of the attractions whilst wondering around old Macau, worth a quick pop in here. Nothing like the wealth you see in Rome and other Italian cities, but clearly is a reflection of a more simple, basic style of Catholicism. Not a 'must see' but if you are in the area, is",
          "The church sits in between the ruins of St Paul's and Senado Square, and it definitely caught my attention although I was not looking out for it. The architecture sticks out even though the surrounding buildings are also of colonial style. I did not go in, but the facade is",

          "I get the historical context behind it, but it's one of those places you go to just because it's there. The sanctuary was pretty, but up on the third floor there was an open trunk with a Jesus statue broken down in pieces. It was quite \"odd.\"",

          "I hadn't done any real research before embarking on my day-out in Macau during my stopover in Hong Kong but this church was a pleasant surprise. Brightly coloured, simple yet it has something about it, at least for me. Probably having something Portuguese in the middle of Asia.",

          "St. Dominic's is located on a small St. Dominic's Square at the far end of the much larger Senado Square in the heart of the city center of Macau. It is an important and interesting member of the World Heritage collection and easily one of the frequently visited attractions in",

          "Lots of history (probably) but you'll not know it unless you bring a guidebook. Still, inside is basic but beautiful, and it's a great place to duck into from the Square. The Square is loud & noisy, and inside St Domingo's it's quiet and calm. A nice contrast, and a beautiful",
          "The exterior of this church is just beautiful. I love the style of the Senate Square part of town. The inside of the church is not on the same level as the exterior, and the artifacts could probably be skipped, but the church as a whole should definitely be on your list in",
          "Am in love with Portuguese interior design style. So down to earth with pastel color. Nothing grand, but simply beautiful",

          "We really like St. Domingo's church near Senado Square. There is not much to see inside and it can appear underwhelming compared to Italian Catholic churches but its nice to see the more simple, humble version of a church built for Dominican worship. St. Domingo's is",

Galleries lead off the walkway, mainly consisting of interactive exhibits aimed at science education.\nThere is also a planetarium with 3D projection facilities and Omnimax films.\nThe building is in a prominent position by the sea and is now a landmark of Macau. It is visible when arriving on the ferry from Hong Kong.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe project to build the science center was conceived in 2001 and completed in 2009. The building was designed by Pei Partnership Architects in association with I. M. Pei and construction started in 2006. The structural engineer was Leslie E. Robertson Associates. The center was opened in December 2009 by Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party Hu Jintao.It caught on fire on 20 November 2015, due to welding occurring on the top level of the building.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMacau Science and Culture Centre, Lisbon, Portugal\nList of museums in Macau\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMacao Science Centre website\nReference Page at Pei Architects",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Taipa (Chinese: \u6c39\u4ed4, Cantonese: [t\u02b0\u0250\u030cm.t\u0361s\u0250\u030ci\u032f]; Portuguese: Taipa, pronounced [\u02c8tajp\u0250]) is an island in Macau, presently united with the island of Coloane by reclaimed land known as Cotai. Administratively, the boundaries of the traditional civil parish Freguesia de Nossa Senhora do Carmo are coterminous with that of former Taipa Island.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTaipa is 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) from Macau Peninsula and east of the Lesser Hengqin Island of Zhuhai, Guangdong Province. Macau International Airport, University of Macau, Macau Jockey Club and Macau Stadium are situated in Taipa.\n\nArea: 6.33 square kilometres (2.44 sq mi) (1.5 by 3.5 kilometres (0.93 by 2.17 miles))\nPopulation: 70,000Most Chinese settlement of Taipa occurred during the Southern Song Dynasty, while the Portuguese occupied the island in 1851. Prior to land reclamation, Taipa consisted of two islands: Greater Taipa and Lesser Taipa.\nThe 159.1-metre (522.0-foot) Taipa Grande Hill (\u5927\u6f6d\u5c71) is to the east, and Taipa Pequena Hill (\u5c0f\u6f6d\u5c71) to the west. Central Taipa is a plain as a result of siltation and land reclamation. Initially Taipa was connected to Coloane Island only by the Estrada do Istmo (\u8def\u6c39\u9023\u8cab\u516c\u8def) causeway; but the area called Cotai, built on reclaimed land from 2004 and which is home to mega-resorts, casinos, and convention and exhibition centres, has now connected the two islands into one piece of land. Taipa is connected to peninsular Macau by Governador Nobre de Carvalho Bridge, Friendship Bridge and the Sai Van Bridge.\nTaipa is predominantly a growing residential area with many new apartment complexes, mostly up-scale, under construction as of 2006. As a new town of Macau, Taipa has better city planning than Macau Peninsula; however, many people choose to live in Macau Peninsula since most of the famous schools are located there.\n\n\n== The names of Taipa ==\nIn Cantonese, Taipa has been known by many names over time, including \u9f8d\u74b0 (Lung Waan, meaning \"Dragon Ring\"), \u96de\u9838 (Gai Geng, \"Chicken's neck\"), \u6f6d\u4ed4 (Taam Jai, \"Pool\"), and \u9f8d\u982d\u74b0 (Lung Tau Waan, \"Dragon's-Head Ring\").\nThe Portuguese and English name \"Taipa\" comes from the Chinese pronunciation of \u6c39\u4ed4 in Min Nan /tiap-\u00e1/ (similar to \"tiamp-a\") then became \"Taipa\". The putonghua pinyin for \u6c39\u4ed4 is d\u00e0ngz\u01cei, and this is how the island is referred to in Mandarin. Both the character \u6c39 and the alternative form \u51fc mean cesspit, but are obsolete in modern Chinese, and only used in relation to Taipa and the Macau-Taipa Bridge (\u6fb3\u6c39\u5927\u6865 \u00e0od\u00e0ng d\u00e0qi\u00e1o). The character \u6c39, or \u51fc (often used in Mainland Chinese texts), is often missing from mobile phone and computer input systems.\nAnother version according to legend, comes from an exchange between early Portuguese settlers on Taipa and local Chinese settlers. The Portuguese asked the Chinese the name (nome in Portuguese) of the place. The Chinese settlers were local grocery shopkeepers and spoke no Portuguese, but took the Portuguese nome for the Chinese \u7cef\u7c73, \"sticky rice\", which is pronounced similar to nome in Cantonese. Thinking the Portuguese settlers were asking if they sold sticky rice, the Chinese responded with \"\u5927\u628a,\" pronounced \"daai ba\" in Cantonese, meaning \"a lot.\" The Portuguese, hearing the response, took this to be the name of the place. There is, however, no historical evidence to support this story. \"Taipa\" is also what the Portuguese call the clay-mud, rammed into moulds, used to build mud houses in Portugal in times gone by, in recent times referred to as Rammed Earth.\nIt is also worth noting that, as the great majority of the population in Taipa and Macau is Chinese; however, there is a growing community of expatriates living in Taipa who work at the casinos on the Cotai Strip or at the schools and universities. Most people refer to this island by its Cantonese name, \"Tamzai\", and most taxi drivers and bus drivers will not understand if asked how to go to \"Taipa.\"\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nPublic preschool and primary school:\n\nEscola Luso-Chinesa da Taipa (\u6c39\u4ed4\u4e2d\u8461\u5b78\u6821) - Preschool and primary schoolPrivate tuition-free primary and secondary schools:\n\nMacau Anglican College - Preschool through secondary\nEscola C\u00e1ritas de Macau (\u660e\u611b\u5b78\u6821) - Special education\nEscola Dom Jo\u00e3o Paulino - Preschool and primary school\nFong Chong School of Taipa (Escola Fong Chong da Taipa; \u6c39\u4ed4\u574a\u773e\u5b78\u6821) - Preschool through senior secondary school\nHou Kong Middle School Macau Affiliated English School (\u6fe0\u6c5f\u4e2d\u5b78\u9644\u5c6c\u82f1\u624d\u5b78\u6821)\nMacau Pooi To Middle School Taipa Elementary School Branch (\u6fb3\u57f9\u9053\u4e2d\u5b78\u6c39\u4ed4\u5c0f\u5b78\u5206\u6821)\nPui Va Middle School (Escola Secund\u00e1ria Pui Va; \u57f9\u83ef\u4e2d\u5b78) - Preschool through secondary school\nMacao Sam Yuk Middle School - Primary and secondary school\nAffiliated School of the University of Macau (Escola de Aplica\u00e7\u00e3o Anexa \u00e0 Universidade de Macau; \u6fb3\u9580\u5927\u5b78\u9644\u5c6c\u61c9\u7528\u5b78\u6821) - Preschool through secondaryPrivate non-free primary and secondary schools:\n\nThe International School of Macao - Located in Block K of the Macau University of Science and Technology - Preschool through secondary\nSchool of the Nations - Preschool through secondary and special education\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nMacau University of Science and Technology (MUST), Institute for Tourism Studies, and City University of Macau are located in Taipa.

        "wiki": "Macau, also spelled Macao ( (listen); \u6fb3\u9580, Cantonese: [\u014du.m\u01d4\u02d0n]; official Portuguese: [m\u0250\u02c8kaw] Macau), and officially the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is a city in the western Pearl River Delta by the South China Sea. It is a special administrative region of China and maintains separate governing and economic systems from those of mainland China. With a population of 649,335 and an area of 32.9 km2 (12.7 sq mi), it is the most densely populated region in the world.\nMacau was a former colony of the Portuguese Empire, after Ming China leased the territory as a trading post in 1557. Portugal paid an annual rent and administered the territory under Chinese sovereignty until 1887 when it gained perpetual colonial rights in the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking. The colony remained under Portuguese rule until 1999, when it was transferred to China.\nOriginally a sparsely populated collection of coastal islands, the territory has become a major resort city and the top destination for gambling tourism. Its gambling industry is seven times larger than that of Las Vegas. Although the city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, it has severe income inequality. Its GDP per capita by purchasing power parity is one of the highest in the world and higher than any country in the world in 2014 according to the World Bank. However, income inequality remains high.Macau has a very high Human Development Index, although it is only calculated by the Macau government instead of the United Nations. Macau has the fourth-highest life expectancy in the world. The territory is highly urbanised and most development is built on reclaimed land; two-thirds of the total land area is reclaimed from the sea.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe first known written record of the name \"Macau\", rendered as \"Ya/A Ma Gang\" (\"\u4e9e/\u963f-\u5abd/\u99ac-\u6e2f\"), is found in a letter dated 20 November 1555. The local inhabitants believed that the sea-goddess Mazu (alternatively called A-Ma) had blessed and protected the harbour and called the waters around A-Ma Temple using her name. When Portuguese explorers first arrived in the area and asked for the place name, the locals thought they were asking about the temple and told them it was \"Ma Kok\" (\u5abd\u95a3). The earliest Portuguese spelling for this was Amaqu\u00e3o. Multiple variations were used until Amac\u00e3o / Amacao and Mac\u00e3o / Macao became common during the 17th century. By the 1911 reform of Portuguese orthography, the spelling Macau became the standardised form, however the use of Macao persisted in English and other European languages.Macau Peninsula had many names in Chinese, including Jing'ao (\u4e95\u6fb3/\u93e1\u6fb3), Haojing (\u6fe0\u93e1), and Haojing'ao (\u6fe0\u93e1\u6fb3). The islands Taipa, Coloane, and Hengqin were collectively called Shizimen (\u5341\u5b57\u9580). These names would later become Aomen (\u6fb3\u9580), Oum\u00fan in Cantonese and translating as \"bay gate\" or \"port gate\", to refer to the whole territory.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDuring the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC), the region was under the jurisdiction of Panyu County, Nanhai Prefecture of the province of Guangdong. The region is first known to have been settled during the Han dynasty. It was administratively part of Dongguan Prefecture in the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420 AD), and alternated under the control of Nanhai and Dongguan in later dynasties. In 1152, during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279 AD), it was under the jurisdiction of the new Xiangshan County. In 1277, approximately 50,000 refugees fleeing the Mongol conquest of China settled in the coastal area.Macau did not develop as a major settlement until the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century. The first European visitor to reach China by sea was the explorer Jorge \u00c1lvares, who arrived in 1513. Merchants first established a trading post in Hong Kong waters at Tam\u00e3o (present-day Tuen Mun), beginning regular trade with nearby settlements in southern China. Military clashes between the Ming and Portuguese navies followed the expulsion of the Tam\u00e3o traders in 1521. Despite the trade ban, Portuguese merchants continued to attempt settling on other parts of the Pearl River estuary, finally settling on Macau. Luso-Chinese trade relations were formally reestablished in 1554 and Portugal soon after acquired a permanent lease for Macau in 1557, agreeing to pay 500 taels of silver as annual land rent.The initially small population of Portuguese merchants rapidly became a growing city. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau was created in 1576, and by 1583, the Senate had been established to handle municipal affairs for the growing settlement. Macau was at the peak of its prosperity as a major entrep\u00f4t during the late 16th century, providing a crucial connection in exporting Chinese silk to Japan during the Nanban trade period. Although the Portuguese were initially prohibited from fortifying Macau or stockpiling weapons, the Fortaleza do Monte was constructed in response to frequent Dutch naval incursions. The Dutch attempted to take the city in the 1622 Battle of Macau, but were repelled successfully by the Portuguese. Macau entered a period of decline in the 1640s following a series of catastrophic events for the burgeoning colony: Portuguese access to trade routes was irreparably severed when Japan halted trade in 1639, Portugal revolted against Spain in 1640, and Malacca fell to the Dutch in 1641.Maritime trade with China was banned in 1644 following the Qing conquest under the Haijin policies and limited only to Macau on a lesser scale while the new dynasty focused on eliminating surviving Ming loyalists. While the Kangxi Emperor lifted the prohibition in 1684, China again restricted trade under the Canton System in 1757. Foreign ships were required to first stop at Macau before further proceeding to Canton. Qing authorities exercised a much greater role in governing the territory during this period; Chinese residents were subject to Qing courts and new construction had to be approved by the resident mandarin beginning in the 1740s. As the opium trade became more lucrative during the eighteenth century, Macau again became an important stopping point en route to China.Following the First Opium War and establishment of Hong Kong, Macau lost its role as a major port. Firecracker and incense production, as well as tea and tobacco processing, were vital industries in the colony during this time. Portugal was able to capitalise on China's post-war weakness and assert its sovereignty; the Governor of Macau began refusing to pay China annual land rent for the colony in the 1840s, and annexed Taipa and Coloane, in 1851 and 1864 respectively. Portugal also occupied nearby Lapa and Montanha, but these would be returned to China by 1887, when perpetual occupation rights over Macau were formalised in the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking. This agreement also prohibited Portugal from ceding Macau without Chinese approval. Despite occasional conflict between Cantonese authorities and the colonial government, Macau's status remained unchanged through the republican revolutions of both Portugal in 1910 and China in 1911. The Kuomintang further affirmed Portuguese jurisdiction in Macau when the Treaty of Peking was renegotiated in 1928.During the Second World War, the Empire of Japan did not occupy the colony and generally respected Portuguese neutrality in Macau. However, after Japanese troops captured a British cargo ship in Macau waters in 1943, Japan installed a group of government \"advisors\" as an alternative to military occupation. The territory largely avoided military action during the war except in 1945, when the United States ordered air raids on Macau after learning that the colonial government was preparing to sell aviation fuel to Japan. Portugal was later given over US$20 million in compensation for the damage in 1950.\n\nRefugees from mainland China swelled the population as they fled from the Chinese Civil War. Access to a large workforce enabled Macau's economy to grow as the colony expanded its clothing and textiles manufacturing industry, developed tourism, and legalised casino gaming. However, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, residents dissatisfied with the colonial administration rioted in the 1966 12-3 incident, in which 8 people were killed and over 200 were injured. Portugal lost full control over the colony afterwards, and agreed to cooperate with the communist authorities in exchange for continued administration of Macau.Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal formally relinquished Macau as an overseas province and acknowledged it as a \"Chinese territory under Portuguese administration\". After China first concluded arrangements on Hong Kong's future with the United Kingdom, it entered negotiations with Portugal over Macau in 1986. They were concluded with the signing of the 1987 Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau, in which Portugal agreed to transfer the colony in 1999 and China would guarantee Macau's political and economic systems for 50 years after the transfer. In the waning years of colonial rule, Macau rapidly urbanised and constructed large-scale infrastructure projects, including Macau International Airport and a new container port. Macau was transferred to China on 20 December 1999, after 442 years of Portuguese rule.Following the transfer, Macau liberalised its casino industry (previously operating under a government-licensed monopoly) to allow foreign investors, starting a new period of economic development. The regional economy grew by a double-digit annual growth rate from 2002 to 2014, making Macau one of the richest economies in the world on a per capita basis. Political debates have centred on the region's jurisdictional independence and the central government's adherence of \"one country, two systems\". While issues such as national security legislation have been controversial, Macanese residents generally have high levels of trust in the government.\n\n\n== Lusophonia ==\nMacau is the last Portuguese colony to gain independence and the only one which is not a member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. Portuguese is one of the official languages of Macau. In 2006, during the II Ministerial meeting between China and Portuguese Speaking Countries, the CPLP Executive Secretary and Deputy ambassador Tadeu Soares invited the Chief Executive of the Government of the Macau Special Administrative Region, Edmund Ho, to request the Associate Observer status for Macau. The Government of Macau has not yet formalized this request. In 2016, Murade Murargy, then executive secretary of CPLP said in an interview that Macau's membership is a complicated question, since like the Galicia region in Spain, it is not an independent country, but only a part of China. But the Instituto Internacional de Macau and the University of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 are Consultative Observers of CPLP.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nMacau is a special administrative region of China, with executive, legislative, and judicial powers devolved from the national government. The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration provided for economic and administrative continuity through the transfer of sovereignty, resulting in an executive-led governing system largely inherited from the territory's history as a Portuguese colony. Under these terms and the \"one country, two systems\" principle, the Basic Law of Macao is the regional constitution. Because negotiations for the Joint Declaration and Basic Law began after transitional arrangements for Hong Kong were made, Macau's structure of government is very similar to Hong Kong's.The regional government is composed of three branches:\n\nExecutive: The Chief Executive is responsible for enforcing regional law, can force reconsideration of legislation, and appoints Executive Council members, a portion of the legislature, and principal officials. Acting with the Executive Council, the Chief Executive can propose new bills, issue subordinate legislation, and has authority to dissolve the legislature.\nLegislature: The unicameral Legislative Assembly enacts regional law, approves budgets, and has the power to impeach a sitting Chief Executive.\nJudiciary: The Court of Final Appeal and lower courts, whose judges are appointed by the Chief Executive on the advice of a recommendation commission, interpret laws and overturn those inconsistent with the Basic Law.The Chief Executive is the head of government, and serves for a maximum of two five-year terms. The State Council (led by the Premier of China) appoints the Chief Executive after nomination by the Election Committee, which is composed of 400 business, community, and government leaders.The Legislative Assembly has 33 members, each serving a four-year term: 14 are directly elected, 12 indirectly elected, and 7 appointed by the Chief Executive. Indirectly elected assemblymen are selected from limited electorates representing sectors of the economy or special interest groups. All directly elected members are chosen with proportional representation.Twelve political parties had representatives elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 2017 election. These parties have aligned themselves into two ideological groups: the pro-establishment (the current government) and pro-democracy camps. Macau is represented in the National People's Congress by 12 deputies chosen through an electoral college, and 29 delegates in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference appointed by the central government.\n\nChinese national law does not generally apply in the region, and Macau is treated as a separate jurisdiction. Its judicial system is based on Portuguese civil law, continuing the legal tradition established during colonial rule. Interpretative and amending power over the Basic Law and jurisdiction over acts of state lie with the central authority, however, making regional courts ultimately subordinate to the mainland's socialist civil law system. Decisions made by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress can also override territorial judicial processes.The territory's jurisdictional independence is most apparent in its immigration and taxation policies. The Identification Department issues passports for permanent residents which differ from those issued by the mainland or Hong Kong, and the region maintains a regulated border with the rest of the country. All travellers between Macau and China and Hong Kong must pass border controls, regardless of nationality. Chinese citizens resident in mainland China do not have the right of abode in Macau and are subject to immigration controls. Public finances are handled separately from the national government, and taxes levied in Macau do not fund the central authority.The Macao Garrison is responsible for the region's defence. Although the Chairman of the Central Military Commission is supreme commander of the armed forces, the regional government may request assistance from the garrison. Macau residents are not required to perform military service and current law also has no provision for local enlistment, so its defence force is composed entirely of nonresidents.The State Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs handle diplomatic matters, but Macau retains the ability to maintain separate economic and cultural relations with foreign nations. The territory negotiates its own trade agreements and actively participates in supranational organisations, including agencies of the World Trade Organization and United Nations. The regional government maintains trade offices in Greater China and other nations.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe territory is divided into seven parishes. Cotai, a major area developed on reclaimed land between Taipa and Coloane, and areas of the Macau New Urban Zone do not have defined parishes. Historically, the parishes belonged to one of two municipalities (the Municipality of Macau or the Municipality of Ilhas) that were responsible for administering municipal services. The municipalities were abolished in 2001 and superseded by the Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau in providing local services.\n\n\n=== Sociopolitical issues and human rights ===\nSex trafficking in Macau is a problem. Macau and foreign women and girls are forced into prostitution in brothels, homes, and businesses in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMacau is on China's southern coast, 60 km (37 mi) west of Hong Kong, on the western side of the Pearl River estuary. It is surrounded by the South China Sea in the east and south, and neighbours the Guangdong city of Zhuhai to the west and north. The territory consists of Macau Peninsula, Taipa, and Coloane. A 1 km2 (0.39 sq mi) parcel of land in neighbouring Hengqin island that hosts the University of Macau also falls under the regional government's jurisdiction. The territory's highest point is Coloane Alto, 170.6 metres (560 ft) above sea level.Urban development is concentrated on peninsular Macau, where most of the population lives. The peninsula was originally a separate island with hilly terrain, which gradually became a tombolo as a connecting sandbar formed over time. Both natural sedimentation and land reclamation expanded the area enough to support urban growth. Macau has tripled its land area in the last century, increasing from 10.28 km2 (3.97 sq mi) in the late 19th century to 32.9 km2 (12.7 sq mi) in 2018.Cotai, the area of reclaimed land connecting Taipa and Coloane, contains many of the newer casinos and resorts established after 1999. The region's jurisdiction over the surrounding sea was greatly expanded in 2015, when it was granted an additional 85 km2 (33 sq mi) of maritime territory by the State Council. Further reclamation is currently underway to develop parts of the Macau New Urban Zone. The territory also has control over part of an artificial island to maintain a border checkpoint for the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMacau has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa), characteristic of southern China. The territory is dual season dominant \u2013 summer (May to September) and winter (November to February) are the longest seasons, while spring (March and April) and autumn (October) are relatively brief periods. The summer monsoon brings warm and humid air from the sea, with the most frequent rainfall occurring during the season. Typhoons also occur most often then, bringing significant spikes in rainfall. During the winter, northern winds from the continent bring dry air and much less rainfall. The highest and lowest temperatures recorded at the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau are 38.9 \u00b0C (102.0 \u00b0F) on both 2 July 1930 and 6 July 1930 and \u22121.8 \u00b0C (28.8 \u00b0F) on 26 January 1948.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe Statistics and Census Service estimated Macau's population at 667,400 at the end of 2018. With a population density of 21,340 people per square kilometre, Macau is the most densely populated region in the world. The overwhelming majority (88.7 per cent) are Chinese, many of whom originate from Guangdong (31.9 per cent) or Fujian (5.9 per cent). The remaining 11.6 per cent are non-ethnic Chinese minorities, primarily Filipinos (4.6 per cent), Vietnamese (2.4 per cent), and Portuguese (1.8 per cent). Several thousand residents are of Macanese heritage, native-born multiracial people with mixed Portuguese ancestry. Of the total population (excluding migrants), 49.4 per cent were born in Macau, followed by 43.1 per cent in Mainland China. A large portion of the population are Portuguese citizens, a legacy of colonial rule; at the time of the transfer of sovereignty in 1999, 107,000 residents held Portuguese passports.The predominant language is Cantonese, a variety of Chinese originating in Guangdong. It is spoken by 87.5 per cent of the population, 80.1 per cent as a first language and 7.5 per cent as a second language. Only 2.3 per cent can speak Portuguese, the other official language; 0.7 per cent are native speakers, and 1.6 per cent use it as a second language. Increased immigration from mainland China in recent years has added to the number of Mandarin speakers, making up about half of the population (50.4 per cent); 5.5 per cent are native speakers and 44.9 per cent are second language speakers. Traditional Chinese characters are used in writing, rather than the simplified characters used on the mainland. English is considered an additional working language and is spoken by over a quarter of the population (27.5 per cent); 2.8 per cent are native speakers, and 24.7 per cent speak English as a second language. Macanese Patois, a local creole generally known as Patu\u00e1, is now spoken only by a few in the older Macanese community.Chinese folk religions have the most adherents (58.9 per cent) and are followed by Buddhism (17.3 per cent) and Christianity (7.2 per cent), while 15.4 per cent of the population profess no religious affiliation at all. Small minorities adhering to other religions (less than 1 per cent), including Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam, are also resident in Macau.Life expectancy in Macau was 81.6 years for males and 87.7 years for females in 2018, the fourth highest in the world. Cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease are the territory's three leading causes of death. Most government-provided healthcare services are free of charge, though alternative treatment is also heavily subsidised.Migrant workers living in Macau account for over 25 per cent of the entire workforce. They largely work in lower wage sectors of the economy, including construction, hotels, and restaurants. As a growing proportion of local residents take up employment in the gaming industry, the disparity in income between local and migrant workers has been increasing. Rising living costs have also pushed a large portion of non-resident workers to live in Zhuhai.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMacau has a capitalist service economy largely based on casino gaming and tourism. It is the world's 83rd-largest economy, with a nominal GDP of approximately MOP433 billion (US$53.9 billion). Although Macau has one of the highest per capita GDPs, the territory also has a high level of wealth disparity. Macau's gaming industry is the largest in the world, generating over MOP195 billion (US$24 billion) in revenue and about seven times larger than that of Las Vegas. Macau's gambling revenue was $37 billion in 2018.The regional economy is heavily reliant on casino gaming. The vast majority of government funding (79.6 per cent of total tax revenue) comes from gaming. Gambling as a share of GDP peaked in 2013 at over 60 per cent, and continues to account for 49.1 per cent of total economic output. The vast majority of casino patrons are tourists from mainland China, making up 68 per cent of all visitors. Casino gaming is illegal in both the mainland and Hong Kong, giving Macau a legal monopoly on the industry in China. Revenue from Chinese high rollers has been falling and was forecast to fall as much as 10% more in 2019. Economic uncertainty may account for some of the drop, but alternate Asian gambling venues do as well. For example, Chinese visitors to the Philippines more than doubled between 2015 and 2018, since the City of Dreams casino opened in Manila.Casino gambling was legalised in 1962 and the gaming industry initially operated under a government-licensed monopoly granted to the Sociedade de Turismo e Divers\u00f5es de Macau. This license was renegotiated and renewed several times before ending in 2002 after 40 years. The government then allowed open bidding for casino licenses to attract foreign investors. Along with an easing of travel restrictions on mainland Chinese visitors, this triggered a period of rapid economic growth; from 1999 to 2016, Macau's gross domestic product multiplied by 7 and the unemployment rate dropped from 6.3 to 1.9 per cent. The Sands Macao, Wynn Macau, MGM Macau, and Venetian Macau were all opened during the first decade after liberalisation of casino concessions. Casinos employ about 24 per cent of the total workforce in the region. \"Increased competition from casinos popping up across Asia to lure away Chinese high rollers and tourists\" in Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam and the Russian Far East led in 2019 to the lowest revenues in three years.Export-oriented manufacturing previously contributed to a much larger share of economic output, peaking at 36.9 per cent of GDP in 1985 and falling to less than 1 per cent in 2017. The bulk of these exports were cotton textiles and apparel, but also included toys and electronics. At the transfer of sovereignty in 1999, manufacturing, financial services, construction and real estate, and gaming were the four largest sectors of the economy. Macau's shift to an economic model entirely dependent on gaming caused concern over its overexposure to a single sector, prompting the regional government to attempt re-diversifying its economy.The government traditionally had a non-interventionist role in the economy and taxes corporations at very low rates. Post-handover administrations have generally been more involved in enhancing social welfare to counter the cyclical nature of the gaming industry. Economic growth has been attributed in large part to the high number of mainlander visits to Macau, and the central government exercises a role in guiding casino business growth through its control of the flow of tourists. The Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement formalised a policy of free trade between Macau and mainland China, with each jurisdiction pledging to remove remaining obstacles to trade and cross-boundary investment.Due to a lack of available land for farming, agriculture is not significant in the economy. Food is exclusively imported to Macau and almost all foreign goods are transshipped through Hong Kong.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nMacau has a highly developed road system, with over 400 km (250 mi) of road constructed in the territory. Automobiles drive on the left (unlike in both mainland China and Portugal), due to historical influence of the Portuguese Empire. Vehicle traffic is extremely congested, especially within the oldest part of the city, where streets are the most narrow. Public bus services operate over 80 routes, supplemented by free hotel shuttle buses that also run routes to popular tourist attractions and downtown locations. About 1,500 black taxicabs are licensed to carry riders in the territory. The Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge, opened in 2018, provides a direct link with the eastern side of the Pearl River estuary. Cross-boundary traffic to mainland China may also pass through border checkpoints at the Portas do Cerco and L\u00f3tus Bridge.Macau International Airport serves over 8 million passengers each year and is the primary hub for local flag carrier Air Macau. The territory's first rail network, the Macau Light Rapid Transit, is currently under construction. Phase 1 of the Taipa line had begun operations in December 2019, the Taipa line will connect 11 metro stations throughout Taipa and Cotai. Ferry services to Hong Kong and mainland China operate out of Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, Inner Harbour Ferry Terminal, and Taipa Ferry Terminal. Daily helicopter service is also available to Hong Kong and Shenzhen.The Macau Light Rapid Transit (MLRT) also known in Portuguese as Metro Ligeiro de Macau (MLM) is a mass transit system in Macau. It serves the Macau Peninsula, Taipa and Cotai, serving major border checkpoints such as the Border Gate, the Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, the Lotus Bridge Border and the Macau International Airport.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n\nMacau is served by one major public hospital, the Hospital Conde S. Janu\u00e1rio, and one major private hospital, the Kiang Wu Hospital, both located in Macau Peninsula, as well as a university associated hospital called Macau University of Science and Technology Hospital in Cotai. In addition to hospitals, Macau also has numerous health centres providing free basic medical care to residents. Consultation in traditional Chinese medicine is also available.None of the Macau hospitals are independently assessed through international healthcare accreditation. There are no western-style medical schools in Macau, and thus all aspiring physicians in Macau have to obtain their education and qualification elsewhere. Local nurses are trained at the Macau Polytechnic Institute and the Kiang Wu Nursing College. Currently there are no training courses in midwifery in Macau. A study by the University of Macau, commissioned by the Macau SAR government, concluded that Macau is too small to have its own medical specialist training centre.The Macau Corps of Firefighters (Portuguese: Corpo de Bombeiros de Macau) is responsible for ambulance service (Ambul\u00e2ncia de Macau). The Macau Red Cross also operates ambulances (Toyota HiAce vans) for emergency and non-emergencies to local hospitals with volunteer staff. The organization has a total of 739 uniformed firefighters and paramedics serving from 7 stations in Macau.The Health Bureau in Macau is mainly responsible for coordinating the activities between the public and private organizations in the area of public health, and assure the health of citizens through specialized and primary health care services, as well as disease prevention and health promotion. The Macau Centre for Disease Control and Prevention was established in 2001, which monitors the operation of hospitals, health centres, and the blood transfusion centre in Macau. It also handles the organization of care and prevention of diseases affecting the population, sets guidelines for hospitals and private healthcare providers, and issues licences.As of 2016 Macau healthcare authorities send patients to Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong in instances where the local Macau hospitals are not equipped to deal with their scenarios, and many Macau residents intentionally seek healthcare in Hong Kong because they place more trust in Hong Kong doctors than in Mainland-trained doctors operating in Macau.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nEducation in Macau does not have a single centralised set of standards or curriculum. Individual schools follow different educational models, including Chinese, Portuguese, Hong Kong, and British systems. Children are required to attend school from the age of five until completion of lower secondary school, or at age 15. Of residents aged 3 and older, 69 per cent completed lower secondary education, 49 per cent graduated from an upper secondary school, 21 per cent earned a bachelor's degree or higher. Mandatory education has contributed to an adult literacy rate of 96.5 per cent. While lower than that of other developed economies, the rate is due to the influx of refugees from mainland China during the post-war colonial era. Much of the elderly population were not formally educated due to war and poverty.Most schools in the territory are private institutions. Out of the 77 non-tertiary schools, 10 are public and the other 67 are privately run. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau maintains an important position in territorial education, managing 27 primary and secondary schools. The government provides 15 years of free education for all residents enrolled in publicly run schools, and subsidises tuition for students in private schools. Students at the secondary school level studying in neighbouring areas of Guangdong are also eligible for tuition subsidies.The vast majority of schools use Cantonese as the medium of instruction, with written education in Chinese and compulsory classes in Mandarin. A minority of private schools use English or Portuguese as the primary teaching language. Luso-Chinese schools mainly use Chinese, but additionally require mandatory Portuguese-language classes as part of their curriculum.Macau has ten universities and tertiary education institutes. The University of Macau, founded in 1981, is the territory's only public comprehensive university. The Kiang Wu Nursing College of Macau is the oldest higher institute, specialising in educating future nursing staff for the college's parent hospital. The University of Saint Joseph, Macau University of Science and Technology, and the City University of Macau were all established in subsequent years. Five other institutes specialise in specific vocations or provide continuing education.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe mixing of the Chinese and Portuguese cultures and religious traditions for more than four centuries has left Macau with an inimitable collection of holidays, festivals and events. The biggest event of the year is the Macau Grand Prix in November, when the main streets in Macau Peninsula are converted to a racetrack bearing similarities with the Monaco Grand Prix. Other annual events include Macau Arts festival in March, the International Fireworks Display Contest in September, the International Music festival in October and/or November, and the Macau International Marathon in December.\nThe Lunar Chinese New Year is the most important traditional festival and celebration normally takes place in late January or early February. The Pou Tai Un Temple in Taipa is the place for the Feast of Tou Tei, the Earth god, in February. The Procession of the Passion of Our Lord is a well-known Roman Catholic rite and journey, which travels from Saint Austin's Church to the Cathedral, also taking place in February.A-Ma Temple, which honours the Goddess Matsu, is in full swing in April with many worshippers celebrating the A-Ma festival. In May it is common to see dancing dragons at the Feast of the Drunken Dragon and twinkling-clean Buddhas at the Feast of the Bathing of Lord Buddha. In Coloane Village, the Taoist god Tam Kong is also honoured on the same day. Dragon Boat Festival is brought into play on Nam Van Lake in June and Hungry Ghosts' festival, in late August and/or early September every year. All events and festivities of the year end with Winter Solstice in December.\nMacau preserves many historical properties in the urban area. The Historic Centre of Macau, which includes some twenty-five historic locations, was officially listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO on 15 July 2005 during the 29th session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Durban, South Africa.\nHowever, the Macao government is criticized for ignoring the conservation of heritage in urban planning. In 2007, local residents of Macao wrote a letter to UNESCO complaining about construction projects around world heritage Guia Lighthouse (Focal height 108 meters), including the headquarter of the Liaison Office (91 meters). UNESCO then issued a warning to the Macau government, which led former Chief Executive Edmund Ho to sign a notice regulating height restrictions on buildings around the site. In 2015, the New Macau Association submitted a report to UNESCO claiming that the government had failed to protect Macao's cultural heritage against threats by urban development projects. One of the main examples of the report is that the headquarter of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, which is located on the Guia foothill and obstructs the view of the Guia Fortress (one of the world heritages symbols of Macao). One year later, Roni Amelan, a spokesman from UNESCO Press service, said that the UNESCO has asked China for information and is still waiting for a reply. In 2016, the Macau government approved an 81-meter construction limit for the residential project, which reportedly goes against the city's regulations on the height of buildings around world heritage site Guia Lighthouse.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nFood in Macau is mainly based on both Cantonese and Portuguese cuisine, drawing influences from Indian and Malay dishes as well, reflecting a unique cultural and culinary blend after centuries of colonial rule. Portuguese recipes were adapted to use local ingredients, such as fresh seafood, turmeric, coconut milk, and adzuki beans. These adaptations produced Macanese variations of traditional Portuguese dishes including caldo verde, minchee, and cozido \u00e0 portuguesa. While many restaurants claim to serve traditional Portuguese or Macanese dishes, most serve a mix of Cantonese-Portuguese fusion cuisine. Galinha \u00e0 portuguesa is an example of a Chinese dish that draws from Macanese influences, but is not part of Macanese cuisine. Cha chaan teng, a type of fast casual diner originating in Hong Kong that serves that region's interpretation of Western food, are also prevalent in Macau. Pastel de nata, pork chop buns, and almond biscuits are popular street food items.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nDespite its small area, Macau is home to a variety of sports and recreational facilities that have hosted a number of major international sporting events, including the 2005 East Asian Games, the 2006 Lusophony Games, and the 2007 Asian Indoor Games.\nThe territory regularly hosts the Macau Grand Prix, one of the most significant annual motorsport competitions that uses city streets as the racetrack. It is the only street circuit that hosts Formula Three, touring car, and motorcycle races in the same event. The Guia Circuit, with narrow corner clearance and a winding path, is considered an extremely challenging course and a serious milestone for prospective Formula One racers.Macau represents itself separately from mainland China with its own sports teams in international competitions. The territory maintains its own National Olympic Committee, but does not compete in the Olympic Games. Current International Olympic Committee rules specify that new NOCs can only be admitted if they represent sovereign states (Hong Kong has participated in the Olympics since before the regulation change in 1996).\n\n\n== Twin towns and sister cities ==\nMacau has six sister cities, listed chronologically by year joined:\n\nAdditionally, Macau has other cultural agreements with the following cities:\n\n Brussels, Belgium (1991)\n San Francisco, United States (2001)\n Da Nang, Vietnam (2006)\n Phuket, Thailand (2018)\n\n\n=== Union of Luso-Afro-Americo-Asiatic Capital Cities ===\nMacau is part of the Union of Luso-Afro-Americo-Asiatic Capital Cities from 28 June 1985, establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHong Kong\nIndex of Macau-related articles\nOutline of Macau\nCuiheng New Area, since 31 March 2013, a co-operation pilot zone with Macau\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n==== Government reports ====\n\n\n==== Academic publications ====\n\n\n==== Legislation ====\n\n\n==== Print ====\n\n\n==== News articles ====\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Macau\".

        "wiki": "Mandarin's House (Chinese: \u912d\u5bb6\u5927\u5c4b; Portuguese: Casa do Mandarim) is a historic residential complex in S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, Macau. It was the residence and family home of the late Qing theoretician and reformist Zheng Guanying (1842-1921). He completed his masterpiece of Shengshi Weiyan (Words of Warning in Times of Prosperity) in the house. Mandarin's House occupies an area of 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft), which is amongst the largest family houses in Macau.\n\n\n== History ==\nMandarin's House was built in 1869 (Eighth year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi) by Zheng Guanyin's father Zheng Wenrui. Zheng Guanying and his brothers gradually enlarged the complex since. It was built largely in Cantonese style but is noted for its fusion of western architectural elements.\nBetween the 1950s and the 1960s, the Zheng family gradually moved out and the house was then rented out. There were at once more than 300 tenants living inside the complex, resulting in poor living conditions.\nThe house was 4,000 square meters. The house was badly damaged because of a fire, and it took 8 years to fix the house.\nThe government overtook the complex in 2001. In 2005, the house was listed as part of the Historic Centre of Macau, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of oldest buildings and structures in Macau\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.wh.mo/mandarinhouse/en/",

        "wiki": "The Guia Fortress (Portuguese: Fortaleza da Guia; Chinese: \u6771\u671b\u6d0b\u70ae\u53f0) is a 17th-century colonial military fort, chapel, and lighthouse complex in S\u00e3o L\u00e1zaro, Macau, China. The complex is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Centre of Macau.\nThe view of the fortress and the lighthouse has been blocked by the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao Special Administrative Region since 2010. Local citizens and scholars criticize such case proved that the Macao government had ignored the conservation of heritage in urban planning.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe fort and chapel were constructed between the 1622 and 1638. The fort was already partly built during the unsuccessful attempt by the Netherlands to capture colonial Portuguese Macau from Portugal, providing an advantageous firing position for defending against naval attacks.\n\n\n=== Lighthouse ===\nThe lighthouse was constructed between 1864 and 1865, the first western style lighthouse in east Asia or on the China coast. The lighthouse stands at Guia Hill, which stands at 91.4 metres (300 ft) tall, and has a light visible for some 20 miles in clear weather conditions. The complex was built upon the highest point on Macau, Guia Hill, and named after the same location. Today, the site is a tourist destination.\n\n\n=== Chapel ===\nThe chapel (Portuguese: Capela de Nossa Senhora da Guia; Chinese: \u8056\u6bcd\u96ea\u5730\u6bbf\u6559\u5802) was built around 1622 inside the Guia Fortress.\nIn 1998, frescoes were uncovered in the chapel during routine conservation work, representing both western and Chinese themes.\n\n\n== Threat ==\n\nIn 2007, local residents of Macao wrote a letter to UNESCO complaining about construction projects around world heritage Guia Lighthouse (Focal height 108 meters), including the headquarter of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao Special Administrative Region (91 meters). UNESCO then issued a warning to the Macau government, which led former Chief Executive Edmund Ho to sign a notice regulating height restrictions on buildings around the site.In 2015, the New Macau Association submitted a report to UNESCO claiming that the government had failed to protect Macao's cultural heritage against threats by urban development projects. One of the main examples of the report is that the headquarter of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, which is located on the Guia foothill and obstructs the view of the Guia Fortress (one of the world heritages symbols of Macao). One year later, Roni Amelan, a spokesman from UNESCO Press service, said that the UNESCO has asked China for information and is still waiting for a reply.In 2016, the Macau government approved an 81-meter construction limit for the residential project, which reportedly goes against the city's regulations on the height of buildings around world heritage site Guia Lighthouse.Professor at Stanford University Dr. Ming K.Chan (Chinese: \u9673\u660e\u92b6) and professor at University of Macau Dr. Eilo Yu (Chinese: \u4f59\u6c38\u9038) commented the Guia Lighthouse case proved that the Macao government had ignored the conservation of heritage in urban planning.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFortaleza do Monte, another Portuguese fort in Macau\nList of lighthouses in Macau\nList of oldest buildings and structures in Macau\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEnglish site for Macau Heritage\nFuture of historic Guia Lighthouse\n3D video made by an anonymous architect shows the future of Outer Harbor with several tall buildings in front of Guia Lighthouse",

It was originally expected to be operational in late 2015, but was open in September 2016.  Launch quarter results were below expectations.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe Parisian has a half-scale 525-foot Eiffel Tower as one of its landmarks.The property has approximately 3000 hotel rooms, 170 shops and 56,000 sq feet of meeting space. In addition, the resort features a 1,200-seat theatre. For the first month of the hotel's opening, the theatre hosted Thriller Live, and hopes to attract more Broadway and West End performances.The interior has a large fountain and atrium giving a feel of modern France.  There are 150 gaming tables allotted to the property, of which 100 were allotted at launch and the next 50 will be allotted over the next years.Shops in the retail arcade include Adidas, Calvin Klein and Breitling.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nGambling in Macau\nList of properties on the Cotai Strip\nList of tallest buildings in Macau\nList of Macau casinos\nList of largest hotels\nParis Las Vegas - similarly themed hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "An exceptional experience! you can have a 360 view of Macau. My family surely had a better memories being there and deeply appreciated all the tall buildings in daytime and nighttime when all the beautiful lights are on since we got up half an hour before sunset. Up above, you",
          "Recommend to visit at twilight time, V. good experience and good location to take photo. For me , it's value for money at100 MOP to top of Eiffel. If you stay in Parisian hotel , you will get discount .",
          "At a scale of 1:2 of the real one, this is a nice attraction that pretty much imposes over your coat strip experience. at a 100 MOP roughly, is not exactly cheap (but then nothing in Macau is) - worth a go if you don't mind spending. Missable if you've got other stuff to do",
          "Be sure to visit during the sunset or after the sunset. This is short but inspired walk and view. But if you there , can be something memorable",
          "This is probably one of kind, a hotel with own Eiffel Tower. Unlike at Wynn Palace access to the Eiffel Tower is not free at all. One need to buy a ticket to visit the Tower. The Entrance & Ticket counter for Eiffel Tower is from inside hotel. Particularly in evening the",
          "We were recommended to visit the Eiffel tower in the evening for the lights. We went at 6:30pm and were taken back by the view from the top floor. You can see the casinos/ some of the hotels and the lights from the top - it looks stunning. It was chilly given the time of the",

          "It is located a few steps away from the Venetian Hotel, on its left side. A short Eiffel Tower is visible from the neighbouring areas, and it is very easy to find it. Many people take a photo in front of it. There is a huge shopping centre nearby, with nice cafes and",
          "It was interesting visiting the Eiffel Tower in Macau and not Paris :-) View from the top was nice but was very windy when we went so we did not stay long. Allow time to really enjoy the view and visit.",
          "The amount of money spent was not worth it. Queue for 20min, went up by lift after 10min we came down. One good point was able to take beautiful photos of the Parisian Hotel at this level.",
          "Went up in 16 degrees weather, felt like 6 deg C up there. Luckily brought gloves, scarf and hat. Ok ok view wise, a big bald patch beside it. Probably will look stunning in a few years. Up / down in 10 mins. Expensive! A light show and a ice skating spot below.",
          "This place could be mistaken for the real one in pictures. It was a picture perfect replica only shorter from the original one.",
          "Having been to the real Eiffel Tower in Paris my only reason to go up this one was to see the lights of nearby casinos/hotels at night. I was a little disappointed as i expected more lights. There is a light show on the tower itself but best viewed from the street below. I",
          "Nice to look from outside, across the road... No point buying tickets to enter. Go in the late afternoon to take photos. Shop for a while. Wait till the light-up starts in the evening to take photos.",
          "as soon as you enter the hotel and look for the tower entrance you understand you will love the experience! you are not in Paris of course with the beauty of ancient buildings but you will love the lights and the modernity of Macao!!",
          "Arrived at Macao for the first time on November 9, 2018 with my hubby and son. We rode a ferry booked via web \"cotai class\" it took us 1 and half hour for the travel time. Macau is such a nice place and very homey. There are a lot of Filipinos working there. We visited \"Parisian",
          "this is the next best thing if you can't go to paris. although not as tall as the real eiffel tower, this is only half the size of it but still an iconic structure along cotai strip.",
          "Built to scale of 50 percent of the french one 37 or 38 storeys high don't worry you don't have to walk ,elevator takes you to the top, not overly priced, during the night lights of all colours put on a great spectacle.",
          "If you haven't been to the real one in Paris then this is pretty close to it! It even sparkles at night. Views of Macau are great from the 37th floor. If you don't go up the tower, just take pics from below and be entertained by the music and light shows that happen frequently.",
          "Just half the height of the one in Las Vegas not worth the money and time to have an Eiffel Tower ride in Macau",
          "Located in the Hotel Parisian, the Eiffel Tower, a replica of the original one, is a nice place to visit. Lift takes visitors to viewing platforms on the 7th and 37th floor.",
          "We passed through while checking out as many of the casinos as we could. I loved here. Like all of Macau the staff are very attentive and the service is first class.",
          "Probably one of the best things we did on the strip. Well worth the $100 each the views were absolutely amazing and definitely recommend doing on a rainy day when limited outside activities",
          "I visit Venetian Casino & complex every time I go to Macau (once a year) but this time was shocked by the amount of tourist and the inability of the staff to cope with cleaning of the food court and (yuk) washrooms...., the shopping is still ok.",
          "for people who dreamed Eiffel tower in paris in their wishlist but you still far away to visit it, take a look to this one",
          "The night view was stunning, though it was too cold and windy to stay long. It was complimentary entry as a hotel guest. Doesn't worth the ticket price.",
          "Yes you read that right. There's a replica of Eiffel Tower in Macao at the Parisian and it's a must experience.",
          "This was a great way to see the strip and didn't cost much at all. There was no line when we went there.",
          "The Parisian and the Eiffel Tower in The Parisian is great. i was in a hotel room and had a view to it.",
          "Its a small replica of the orginal eiffel tower, they charge you seprately for the entry and the to the 37th floor, you can see all the sky scrappers from the top. They have a restaurant on the 7th floor, which serves food and drinks but the best part is the music which is just",
          "the spectacular lights are amazing to see especially when changing colors. this eiffel tower replica can still pass as a tourist attraction because of its location and grandeur. it may offer a grand view but those who have gone ahead of us discouraged us from riding to the top",
          "A wonderful experience 32 stories high up overlooking the spectacular casinos below. Much better and far more impressive structure then the one in the Paris hotel in Vegas",
          "This structure obviosuly adds to the skyline with its pretty lights but its not hugely impressive compared to the stunning buildings around it. Perfect for a few pictures but there is more to see.",
          "We loved exploring this area, the Tower is huge with to lifts to an observation deck where the views of Macau are stunning. We were there at dusk and watched the city lights come to life. Make sure you follow the signs, enter via the Parisian Casino. Enjoy!",
          "It was a great experience to visit the Eiffel Tower at Parisian Macau. The lighting of the Tower is excellent and going up the tower was thrilling. Superb views from the viewing deck at 365 feet. Great for photography, specially at sunset and after hours. A must visit to this",
          "for the price they charge its not worth it,better to visit macau tower.The Eiffel tower looks good at night though because of all the lights but not really worth it to climb up and pay for the view",
          "I visited The Parisian and the Eiffel Tower in The Parisian last week and truly loved the whole experience, the view was excellent and provided nice photography opportunity to me.",
          "It\u2019s so Great to experience to go top of the Eiffel tower\ud83d\uddfc. You can really see the beautiful Macau. But i really want to catch the Parisian purple light at night, coz we been there like it\u2019s around 3:30pm. And it\u2019s so hot. But it\u2019s Nice to go. I can\u2019t wait to be there AGAIN.",
          "Good experience, but not worth the high price. The views up there are good, but you don't need more than 2 minutes up there, so not value for money.",
          "We visited Parisian hotel on 26 april 2018 , me & my family feels like we are in paris , eiffel tower not exact like it was in paris but replica made was fantastic",
          "The tower is part of parisian macau casino. The tower really made like its original. An Instagramable view...You can take selfie in front of it or you can enter the tower..Don't miss it while you are in macau",

          "Was good experience. Before heading into the elevator one can stop by, to place the lock on the iron grids. The elevator goes up to 37th floor and once you step outside it's a spectacular view to the Cotai strip of Hotels and around Macau. They have lit up the whole tower in",
          "Great view for a Paris experience. It has music and light show in the evening. Worth the visit for photos.",
          "Having been to the real Eiffel Tower a dozen times, I didn't think the one of the Parisian Macau would rate highly compared to the real thing. I was surprisingly proven wrong. Although it is only half the height of the one in Paris, it is still a great experience, especially",
          "No line the day we visited. Typical tourist attraction with lovely views of the surrounding area. Staff as nice and helpful. This is something easy to do if you have extra time.",
          "It has great lighting and view at night. However, it was very windy on top at 37th floor level when we visited. It may be a bit costly to go up top.",
          "comparing to visit daytime, I personally suggest to visit at night. The place will have the hourly light show which is really nice with the music.",
          "I did not go inside the observation tower coz need to pay kkk. I went outside and sit below the Eiffel Tower, I dont' know that there is a show on the tower. Music and Lights on the Eiffel Tower, beautiful.",

          "This extravagant landmark is truly a beauty, especially at the night! Makes for great photos and memories <3",
          "We went there around 6pm and the light was on already. The view from down is very nice and worth taking picture. We were lucky as we manage to catch the music lighting show around 6.30pm.",
          "Very beutiful when arrive at night, very nice light decoration, many tourists take photos here at night. If you want to go inside it will cost you a bit (not sure exactly price).",
          "We arrive there at night and we don\u2019t have time to go around. We make mistakes because we paid the entrance ticket to enter the mini Eiffel Tower there. After we enter, then we realize that we can take photo from below. The fee is 100HKD/MOP and not worth it.",
          "The eiffel tower at Parisian is a smaller but similar kind of beautiful structure. The best time to visit is in the evening when the tower is showcased in lighting. It is a very good point as you can see both the eiffel tower and parisian hotel in beautiful lighting which is",
          "Parisian having a replica of Eiffel tower, in the evening Eiffel tower mesmerizing with lighting on. Is a good attraction place for \"check-In\"",

          "For MOP50 each (slight discount for senior citizen & student) you get to enjoy the Eiffel Tower view from level 7 to level 37. At level 7, there were row of lovers padlock chained on the panel infront of the tower. Macau city view at level 37 but night selfie photo was nothing",
          "What a marvellous experience. We went up the Eiffel tower at about 8 pm and we had the most amazing view of Macau. So worth it!",
          "Not sure about the daytime, but this is a beautiful experience at night. The Tower lights up to different colors, and if you take the ride up to the top, you will see how the Cotai part of the city lights up as well. It may or may not be worth the entry cost, but remember that",
          "Beautiful at day and night. Its a must see with its beautiful lights. With picture spots at the Parisian.",
          "Its was amazing as decorated with lights for Christmas....Beautiful...Good spot to take pictures with family",
          "it is worth the amount you are required to pay for entering this experience. at night, when their is a cold breeze, you have to walk across some open area to reach there. high speed lifts take you to the top floor, which offers excellent 360 view of the city.",

          "It is half size of real Eiffel in Paris , and there is no telescope on the 37 th floor , the top space is much smaller and view is quickly finished , the spot is photographer took a nice professional photo for 220 mop to had 1 with frame, another 1 with cup photo , the locks on",
          "You need to conquer your fear of heights in order to enjoy the breathtaking view from above.We went at the wrong time coz the weather was windy and rain was to be expected so they advised us that we can only go further on the 7th floor if my memory was correct. I was so",
          "Positive: amazing 360 degrees view of the Parisian Macau and it's nearby attractions, good for photography especially for night photography. Negative: the long queue to get to the top, quiet not advisable for those on steep budget.",
          "We went all the way upto 37 F and had a magnificent view of the hotel, the Parisian, especially the swimming pools well scattered. Worth the visit.",

          "A small Eiffel Tower. It is good for you to take photos and see the night view. The viewing plat is not that big. We were the last there on that day, it was ready to close because of a coming typhoon. It was raining and the wind was strong, but the tower stood very still.",

          "Unfortunately, there is nothing \"really special\" about the whole experience. It is average at best. You are better off exploring the more cultural side of Macau.",

          "Not a experience. Line up times depends on time of day, suggest you go late at night to avoid long line ups. Also the lights/view are much better at night. The only down side is that the space is a little tight/limited once you get up to the top.",

It represents the architectural legacies of the city's cultural heritage, including monuments such as urban squares, streetscapes, churches and temples.  \nIn 2005 the Historic Centre of Macau was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, making it the 31st designated World Heritage site in China.  It was described by UNESCO as: \"with its historic street, residential, religious and public Portuguese and Chinese buildings, the historic centre of Macao provides a unique testimony to the meeting of aesthetic, cultural, architectural and technological influences from East and West,\" and \"...it bears witness to one of the earliest and longest-lasting encounters between China and the West, based on the vibrancy of international trade.\"\n\n\n== List of sites ==\nThe Historic Centre of Macao is made up of two separated core zones in city center on the Macau peninsula.  Each core zone is surrounded by a buffer zone.\n\n\n=== Zone 1 ===\nThe narrow-stripped Zone 1 is located between Mount Hill and Barra Hill.\n\n\n==== Buildings ====\n\n\n==== Squares ====\n\n\n=== Zone 2 ===\nThe Zone is surrounded by a buffer zone that covers a park and immediate urban area.\nGuia Fortress incorporating Guia Chapel and Guia Lighthouse\n\n\n== Management ==\nMost of the items (buildings) are owned by the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) and managed by various departments or authority. Cultural Institute of the SAR Government manages the Mandarin's House, the Ruins of St. Paul's, the Section of the Old Wall, Mount Fortress and Guia Fortress (includes the Lighthouse and Chapel).\nLeal Senado Building is managed by the Provisional Municipal Council of Macao while the two government-owned temples, A-Ma Temple and Na Tcha Temple are managed by the Board of A-Ma Temple Charity Association and Management Board of Na Tcha Temple respectively. The Moorish Barracks is managed by the Macao Harbour Administration Building.The rest of the items are owned and managed by the respective institutions. St. Joseph's Seminary Building and Church is owned by St. Joseph's Seminary and managed by the Catholic Diocese of Macao. The Holy House of Mercy Building is owned and managed by Holy House of Mercy Charitable Foundation. Dom Pedro V Theatre is owned and managed by the Management Board of Dom Pedro V Theatre.The nominated buildings of the Historic Center are protected by various laws, including the Basic Law of the Macao SAR.\n\n\n== Threat ==\n\nIn 2007, local residents of Macao wrote a letter to UNESCO complaining about construction projects around world heritage Guia Lighthouse (Focal height 108 meters), including the headquarter of the Liaison Office (91 meters). UNESCO then issued a warning to the Macau government, which led former Chief Executive Edmund Ho to sign a notice regulating height restrictions on buildings around the site.\nIn 2015, the New Macau Association submitted a report to UNESCO claiming that the government had failed to protect Macao's cultural heritage against threats by urban development projects. One of the main examples of the report is that the headquarter of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao Special Administrative Region, which is located on the Guia foothill and obstructs the view of the Guia Fortress (one of the world heritages symbols of Macao). One year later, Roni Amelan, a spokesman from UNESCO Press service, said that the UNESCO has asked China for information and is still waiting for a reply. In 2016, the Macau government approved an 81-meter construction limit for the residential project, which reportedly goes against the city\u2019s regulations on the height of buildings around world heritage site Guia Lighthouse.Professor at Stanford University Dr. Ming K.Chan (Chinese: \u9673\u660e\u92b6) and professor at University of Macau Dr. Eilo Yu (Chinese: \u4f59\u6c38\u9038) commented the Guia Lighthouse case proved that the Macao government had ignored the conservation of heritage in urban planning.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of oldest buildings and structures in Macau\nReligion in Macau\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nInformation from the website of UNESCO World Heritage Centre\n1001wonders.org : visit this site in panophotographies - 360 x 180 degree images",

        "wiki": "Studio City is a hotel and casino resort in Cotai, Macau, China. It is Asia's first leisure resort to integrate television and film production facilities, retail, gaming and hotels. It is jointly developed by U.S. investment firms Silver Point Capital LP and Oaktree Capital Management LLC and a Hong Kong entertainment company, eSun Holdings Ltd. In June 2011, Melco Crown Entertainment took over a 60% share of the property developer. Studio City Macau was officially opened on 27 October 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe US$2 billion project was built on Macau's Cotai Strip and opened in 2015.\n\n\n=== Taubman Centers ===\nTaubman Centers was acquiring a 25 percent interest in The Mall at Studio City, the retail component of Macau Studio City, Taubman was to fund an initial cash payment of US$54 million. Taubman's total investment in the project (including the initial payment, allocation of construction debt and additional payments anticipated in years two and five after opening) was expected to be approximately US$200 million. But in August 2009, Taubman announced that it had pulled out of the project, recovering its 25 percent, US$65 million interest in the project's huge shopping mall development, according to www.macaubusiness.com.\n\"Under the established agreement, if the developers, Cyber One, were unable to secure financing within an 18 month period, Taubman would get its 25 percent share back. That's what happened, as the set period expired on August 11,\" Morgan Parker, Taubman's Asia Pacific region president told www.macaubusiness.com.\n\n\n=== Melco Crown takeover ===\nGaming operator Melco Crown Entertainment gained control of the long-delayed Macau Studio City project by buying a 60 percent share in the Cotai resort developer. Melco announced the deal on 16 June 2011 morning and co-chairman Lawrence Ho Yau Lung said at a press conference it would invest US$1.7 billion (MOP 13.7 billion) in the development.\nOn 12 January 2015, the chairman of Melco announced that the Studio City resort would open around \"mid-year\" 2015, adding 1,600 hotel rooms and an intended 400 gambling tables to the Cotai Strip. Inspired by Hollywood, the cinematic-themed resort were to comprise a 30,000-square-foot Family Entertainment Center in collaboration with Time Warner Inc. subsidiaries Warner Bros and DC Comics. Highlighted in the unveiling ceremony, the entertainment center would feature popular DC Comics characters, such as Superman, Wonder Woman and The Flash. Visitors were to be taken on a virtual reality Batman ride in the resort, as well as a 130-meter-tall Ferris wheel.\n\n\n=== Gaming facility dispute ===\n\nMacau's Secretary for Transport and Public Works Lau Si Io confirmed on 6 July 2011 that there would be no gaming facility in the Macau Studio City project. The secretary reiterated that the developer of this Cotai property is required to adhere to the 2008 development plan approved by the government. The plan, he reaffirmed, includes a major component of a film production facility but should not contain any gaming elements. But Melco Crown Entertainment was confident that the Macao Studio City will receive the necessary government approvals to include a gaming floor.  The company's chief executive and co-chairman Lawrence Ho Yau Lung said he was confident of striking a deal with the SAR Government to build a casino on the site.\n\n\n== Design and attractions ==\nStudio City Macau features an Art Deco design inspired by two asteroids shooting through a Gotham City building. The resort was designed by Goddard Group, a Los Angeles-based entertainment design firm also responsible for the design of Cotai's Galaxy Macau Resort.The resort's two hotel towers (The Star Tower and the Celebrity Tower) are connected by the Golden Reel, the world's first figure-8 ferris wheel. Boarding at the hotel's 23rd floor, the wheel features 17 cabins holding up to 10 passengers each. The design was developed by the Goddard Group, and the hardware was manufactured by Liechtenstein's Intamin Amusement Rides.Another attraction is Batman Dark Flight, a flying theater attraction.Studio City is home to a food court called Cosmos Food Station, on which guest can look out upon space through giant portal windows.The resort also features a 40,000 square foot children's playground called the Warner Brothers Fun Zone\n\n\n== See also ==\nGambling in Macau\nCotai Strip\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Studio City is a hotel and casino resort in Cotai, Macau, China. It is Asia's first leisure resort to integrate television and film production facilities, retail, gaming and hotels. It is jointly developed by U.S. investment firms Silver Point Capital LP and Oaktree Capital Management LLC and a Hong Kong entertainment company, eSun Holdings Ltd. In June 2011, Melco Crown Entertainment took over a 60% share of the property developer. Studio City Macau was officially opened on 27 October 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe US$2 billion project was built on Macau's Cotai Strip and opened in 2015.\n\n\n=== Taubman Centers ===\nTaubman Centers was acquiring a 25 percent interest in The Mall at Studio City, the retail component of Macau Studio City, Taubman was to fund an initial cash payment of US$54 million. Taubman's total investment in the project (including the initial payment, allocation of construction debt and additional payments anticipated in years two and five after opening) was expected to be approximately US$200 million. But in August 2009, Taubman announced that it had pulled out of the project, recovering its 25 percent, US$65 million interest in the project's huge shopping mall development, according to www.macaubusiness.com.\n\"Under the established agreement, if the developers, Cyber One, were unable to secure financing within an 18 month period, Taubman would get its 25 percent share back. That's what happened, as the set period expired on August 11,\" Morgan Parker, Taubman's Asia Pacific region president told www.macaubusiness.com.\n\n\n=== Melco Crown takeover ===\nGaming operator Melco Crown Entertainment gained control of the long-delayed Macau Studio City project by buying a 60 percent share in the Cotai resort developer. Melco announced the deal on 16 June 2011 morning and co-chairman Lawrence Ho Yau Lung said at a press conference it would invest US$1.7 billion (MOP 13.7 billion) in the development.\nOn 12 January 2015, the chairman of Melco announced that the Studio City resort would open around \"mid-year\" 2015, adding 1,600 hotel rooms and an intended 400 gambling tables to the Cotai Strip. Inspired by Hollywood, the cinematic-themed resort were to comprise a 30,000-square-foot Family Entertainment Center in collaboration with Time Warner Inc. subsidiaries Warner Bros and DC Comics. Highlighted in the unveiling ceremony, the entertainment center would feature popular DC Comics characters, such as Superman, Wonder Woman and The Flash. Visitors were to be taken on a virtual reality Batman ride in the resort, as well as a 130-meter-tall Ferris wheel.\n\n\n=== Gaming facility dispute ===\n\nMacau's Secretary for Transport and Public Works Lau Si Io confirmed on 6 July 2011 that there would be no gaming facility in the Macau Studio City project. The secretary reiterated that the developer of this Cotai property is required to adhere to the 2008 development plan approved by the government. The plan, he reaffirmed, includes a major component of a film production facility but should not contain any gaming elements. But Melco Crown Entertainment was confident that the Macao Studio City will receive the necessary government approvals to include a gaming floor.  The company's chief executive and co-chairman Lawrence Ho Yau Lung said he was confident of striking a deal with the SAR Government to build a casino on the site.\n\n\n== Design and attractions ==\nStudio City Macau features an Art Deco design inspired by two asteroids shooting through a Gotham City building. The resort was designed by Goddard Group, a Los Angeles-based entertainment design firm also responsible for the design of Cotai's Galaxy Macau Resort.The resort's two hotel towers (The Star Tower and the Celebrity Tower) are connected by the Golden Reel, the world's first figure-8 ferris wheel. Boarding at the hotel's 23rd floor, the wheel features 17 cabins holding up to 10 passengers each. The design was developed by the Goddard Group, and the hardware was manufactured by Liechtenstein's Intamin Amusement Rides.Another attraction is Batman Dark Flight, a flying theater attraction.Studio City is home to a food court called Cosmos Food Station, on which guest can look out upon space through giant portal windows.The resort also features a 40,000 square foot children's playground called the Warner Brothers Fun Zone\n\n\n== See also ==\nGambling in Macau\nCotai Strip\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Got a complimentary ticket from buying the ticket for The House of Dancing Water. The concept itself is pretty cool as I have never ridden a 8-shape wheel before. The view was just fair, and it is not worthy to go if you need to buy the ticket from your own pocket.",

          "As the day was hazy and the surrounding view is that of construction sites, there really isnt much to see. We had gotten free tickets so we decided to try it out but its not exciting just a short ride in the capsule so if you have to pay for the tickets, I suggest you put your",

          "Just to make this clear for people before you go: I was fascinated by the idea of a figure of eight ferris wheel and had spent the weeks up to my stay wondering how they manage to produce the mechanism. It was fairly disappointing then to find that it is not a figure of eight",
          "With an impressive outlooking, I expected it would be a wonderful journey on this ferris wheel. But actually it is only cable cars running on track. Despite its expensive entrance charge, it didn't provide a stunning view. While you looking out of the cabin, most of the views",

        "wiki": "The Order of Saint Augustine (Latin: Ordo sancti Augustini; abbreviated OSA) is a mendicant order of the Catholic Church. It was founded in 1244 by bringing together several eremetical groups in the Tuscany region who were following the Rule of Saint Augustine, written by Saint Augustine of Hippo in the fifth century. They are also commonly known as the Augustinians or Austin friars, and were also historically known as the Order of Hermits of Saint Augustine (Latin: Ordo eremitarum sancti Augustini; abbreviated OESA).\nThe order has, in particular, spread internationally the veneration of the Virgin Mary under the title of Our Lady of Good Counsel (Mater boni consilii).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nAugustine of Hippo, first with some friends and afterward as bishop with his clergy, led a monastic community life. Religious vows were not obligatory. Regarding the use of property or possessions, Augustine did not make a virtue of poverty, but of sharing. Their manner of life led others to imitate them. Instructions for their guidance were found in several writings of Augustine, especially in De opere monachorum (P.L., XL, 527), mentioned in the ancient codices regularum of the eighth or ninth century as the \"Rule of St. Augustine\". Epistola ccxi, otherwise cix (P.L., XXXIII, 958), contains the early \"Augustinian Rule for Nuns\"; Epistolae ccclv and ccclvi (P.L., mmmlxv, 3065) contains De moribus clericorum. Between 430 and 570 this life-style was carried to Europe by monks and clergy fleeing the persecution of the Vandals. This system of life for cathedral clergy continued in various locations throughout Europe for centuries.\nAs the first millennium came to an end, the fervor of this life began to wane, and the cathedral clergy began to live independently of one another. At the start of the second millennium, there was a revival in interest in the stricter form of clerical life. Several groups of canons were established under various disciplines, all with the Augustinian Rule as their basis. Examples of these were the Congregation of canons in Ravenna, founded by the Blessed Peter de Honestis about 1100, as well as the Norbertines. The instructions contained in Augustine's Rule formed the basis of the Rule that, in accordance with the decree of the Lateran Synod of 1059, was adopted by canons who desired to practice a common apostolic life (Holstenius, Codex regularum, II, Rome, 1661, 120), hence the title of Canons Regular of Saint Augustine.\n\n\n=== First eremitical communities ===\nAround the start of the 13th century, many eremitical communities, especially in the vicinity of Siena, Italy, sprang up. These were often small (no more than ten) and composed of laymen, thus they lacked the clerical orientation of the canons. Their foundational spirit was one of solitude and penance. With time, some of the communities adopted a more outward looking way of life. As the number of hermit-priests increased, assisting the local clergy in providing spiritual care for their neighbors became a larger part of their lives. In 1223 four of the communities around Siena joined in a loose association, which had increased to thirteen within five years.\n\n\n=== Little Union ===\nThe Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 issued the decree Ne nimium to organise these small groups of religious people by requiring them to live in community, to hold elective chapters, to be under obedience to a major superior and to adopt one of the Rules of community life that were approved by the Church.\nThe Augustinian friars came into being as part of the mendicant movement of the 13th century, a new form of religious life which sought to bring the religious ideals of the monastic life into an urban setting which allowed the religious to serve the needs of the People of God in an apostolic capacity. At this time there were a number of eremitical groups living in such diverse places as Tuscany, Latium, Umbria, Liguria, England, Switzerland, Germany, and perhaps France. In 1243 the Tuscan hermits petitioned Pope Innocent IV to unite them all as one group. Innocent IV issued the Bull Incumbit Nobis on 16 December 1243, an essentially pastoral letter which exhorted these hermits to adopt \"the Rule and way of life of the Blessed Augustine,\" to profess this Augustinian manner of life in a way that they themselves would decide with regards to a specific charism and apostolate, and to elect a Prior General. The bull also appointed Cardinal Riccardo Annibaldi as their supervisor and legal guide. The importance of this man in the foundation of the order cannot be overstated.\n\n\n=== Grand Union ===\nOn 15 July 1255, Pope Alexander IV issued the bull Cum quaedam salubria to command a number of religious groupings to gather for the purpose of being amalgamated into a new Order of Hermits of Saint Augustine. The delegates including other small religious communities met in Rome on 1 March 1256, which resulted in a union. Lanfranc Septala of Milan, Prior of the Bonites, was appointed the first Prior General of the newly constituted Order. The belted, black tunic of the Tuscan hermits was adopted as the common religious habit, and the walking sticks carried by the Bonites in keeping with eremetical tradition\u2014and to distinguish themselves from those hermits who went around begging\u2014ceased to be used.On 9 April 1256 Pope Alexander IV issued the bull Licet Ecclesiae catholicae (Bullarium Taurinense, 3rd ed., 635 sq.) which confirmed the integration of the Hermits of John the Good (Rule of St. Augustine, 1225), the Hermits of St. William (Rule of St. Benedict), the Hermits of Brettino (Rule of St. Augustine, 1228), the Hermits of Monte Favale (Rule of St. Benedict), other smaller congregations, and the Tuscan Hermits into what was officially called the Order of Hermits of Saint Augustine.Special constitutions were drawn up for its government, on the same lines as the Dominicans and other mendicants\u2014a general elected by chapter, provincials to rule in the different countries, with assistants, definitors and visitors. For this reason, and because almost from the beginning the term \"hermits\" became a misnomer (for they abandoned the deserts and lived conventionally in towns), they ranked among the friars, and became the fourth of the mendicant orders. The observance and manner of life was mild relative to those times, meat being allowed four days in the week.\n\n\n=== Privileges of the order ===\nEcclesiastical privileges were granted to the order almost from its beginning. Alexander IV freed the order from the jurisdiction of the bishops; Innocent VIII, in 1490, granted to the churches of the order indulgences such as can only be gained by making the Stations at Rome; Pope Pius V placed the Augustinians among the mendicant orders and ranked them next to the Carmelites. Since the end of the 13th century the sacristan of the Papal Palace was always to be an Augustinian friar, who would be ordained as a Bishop. This privilege was ratified by Pope Alexander VI and granted to the Order forever by a Bull issued in 1497. The holder of the office was Rector of the Vatican parish (of which the chapel of St. Paul is the parish church). To his office also belonged the duty of preserving in his oratory a consecrated Host, which had to be renewed weekly and kept in readiness in case of the pope's illness, when it was the privilege of the papal sacristan to administer the last sacraments to the pope. The sacristan had always to accompany the pope when he traveled, and during a conclave it was he who celebrated Mass and administered the sacraments. He lived at the Vatican with a sub-sacristan and three lay brothers of the order (cf. Rocca, \"Chronhistoria de Apostolico Sacrario\", Rome, 1605). Augustinian friars, as of 2009, still perform the duties of papal sacristans, but the appointment of an Augustinian bishop-sacristan lapsed under Pope John Paul II with the retirement of Petrus Canisius Van Lierde in 1991. In papal Rome the Augustinian friars always filled one of the Chairs of the Sapienza University, and one of the consultorships in the Congregation of Rites.\n\n\n=== Missions ===\nThe value set upon learning and science by the Augustinian friars is demonstrated by the care given to their missionary work, their libraries, and by the historic establishment of their own printing-press in their convent at Nuremberg (1479), as well as by the numerous learned individuals produced by the order. The order has produced many saints, for example Clare of Montefalco, Nicholas of Tolentino (d. 1305), Rita of Cascia, John of Sahag\u00fan (a Sancto Facundo) (d. 1479), and Thomas of Villanova (d. 1555). Stefano Bellesini (d. 1840), the Augustinian parish priest of Genazzano, in the Roman province, was beatified by Pius X on 27 December 1904.\n\n\n==== Africa ====\nThe Augustinians followed the Portuguese flag in Africa and the Gulf behind the explorer and seafarer Vasco da Gama. Nikolaus Teschel (d. 1371), auxiliary Bishop of Ratisbon, where he died, with some brethren preached the Gospel in Africa. He had sailed from Lisbon in 1497, and arrived at Mozambique in March 1498. Portuguese Augustinians also arrived in Gold coast (now Ghana) in 1572 and started their missionary work, and also worked on the island of Sao Tome, in Warri (Nigeria), and in what is now known as Angola, in the Congo, in Equatorial Guinea, and in Gabon up until 1738. The Portuguese also took control of the port of Goa in India\u2014giving the Augustinians a foothold there also. Besides the early Portuguese Augustinians, other Augustinian missionaries have since followed to Africa from America, Ireland, Belgium and Australia.\n\n\n==== The Americas ====\n\n\n===== North America (US and Canada) =====\n\nThe North American foundation of the order occurred in 1796 when Irish friars founded Olde St. Augustine's Church in Philadelphia. Michael Hurley was the first American to join the order the following year. Friars established schools, universities and other works throughout the Americas, including Villanova University (1842) near Philadelphia and Merrimack College (1947) near Boston.\nSecondary schools in the United States included:\n\nMalvern Preparatory School (1842), Malvern, Pennsylvania;\nSt. Rita of Cascia High School (1905), Chicago, Illinois;\nSt. Augustine High School (1922), San Diego, California;\nVillanova Preparatory School (1925), Ojai, California;\nCascia Hall Preparatory School (1926), Tulsa, Oklahoma;\nMendel Catholic High School (1951), Chicago, Illinois;\nMonsignor Bonner High School (1953), Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania;\nAustin Catholic Preparatory School (1954-1978), Detroit, Michigan;\nSt. Augustine College Preparatory School (1959), Richland, New Jersey;\nAustin Preparatory School (1961), Reading, Massachusetts;\nProvidence Catholic High School (1962), New Lenox, Illinois;\nSt. Thomas of Villanova College (1999), King City, Ontario.From 1925 and later during the Great Depression German Augustinians began arriving in North America to teach. After 1936, with the political situation in Nazi Germany worsening, more German Augustinians departed for North America. By 1939 there were 46 German priests, 13 German religious brothers and 8 German candidates in North America. The order established the first of their Canadian houses at Tracadie, Nova Scotia, in Canada in 1938. Among other Canadian foundations, the order also established a significant priory and school King City, Ontario, near Toronto. Since 2006, it has since professed many native Canadians.\nLatest Statistics:As of 2006 there were more than 70 Augustinian priories in the United States and Canada with 386 friars in solemn vows and 16 in simple vows.\n\n\n===== Latin America =====\n\nSent by their Provincial St. Thomas of Villanova, the first group of Spanish/Castilian Augustinians arrived in Mexico in 1533 after the subjugation of Aztec Mexico by Hernan Cortez. Melchor de Vargas composed, in 1576, a catechism in the Mexican Otomi language; Diego Basalenque (d. 1651) and Miguel de Guevara compiled works in the languages of the Matlaltzinkas of Mexico; Manuel Perez translated the Roman Catechism into Aztec in 1723. Monasteries sprang up in the principal places and became the centers of Christianity, art, and civilization. The Patio (Cloister) of the former monastery of St. Augustine, now the post office, at Quer\u00e9taro, is one of the most beautiful examples of stone-carving in America. They soon formed multiple priories, including at Guanajuato (pictured) and were later instrumental in establishing the Pontifical and Royal University of Mexico. By 1562 there were nearly 300 Spanish Augustinians in Mexico, and they had established some 50 priories. Their history in Mexico was not to be an easy one, given the civil strife of events like the Cristero War, periodic anti-clericalism and suppression of the church that was to follow.\nSpanish Augustinians first went to Peru in 1551. From there they went to Ecuador in 1573, and from Ecuador in 1575 to Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Panama and Venezuela. The order founded the Ecuadorean University of Quito in 1586. Augustinians also entered Argentina via Chile between 1617 and 1626, and their history there was eventful. The order had considerable property confiscated by the Argentinian government under the secularisation laws in the 19th century, and were entirely suppressed for 24 years until 1901 when they returned. The Augustinian Province of the Netherlands later also founded houses in Bolivia from 1930.\nIn 1962, Pope John XXIII asked for religious orders in the United States to send 10% of their members to evangelize Latin America. He later specifically invited the Augustinians of the Midwest Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel, headquartered near Chicago, to care for missionary territory in Northern Peru. The Augustinians accepted the invitation and began their missionary service in 1964. Their primary assignment was to the newly created Prelature of Chulucanas, which was later erected to become the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chulucanas. The diocese split what was once the Eastern territory of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Piura. The Augustinians also began new service in the nation's capital of Lima.The Provincia Michoacanensis had about 55 members, while the Provincia Mexicana had 31, most of whom are priests. Augustinian missionaries extended their friaries to South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru). Political events in these countries prevented the order from prospering and hindered the success of its undertakings, so that during the 19th century the monasteries became deserted. Later events in the Philippine Islands, however, permitted the Augustinians to return to their former churches and monasteries and even to found new ones.\nIn the Republic of Colombia, 26 members of the Philippine province were employed in 1900, including 6 at the residence of Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1, 8 in the college at Facatativa, and 12 at other stations. In Peru 49 members of the same province were employed: 14 priests and 2 lay brothers belonging to the convent at Lima; 12 priests to the college in the same city; 6 in each of the two seminaries at Cuzco and Ayacucho. In the Prefecture Apostolic of San Le\u00f3n de Amazonas, at the mission stations of Peba, R\u00edo Tigre, and Leticia in the territory of the Iquito Indians there were 9 priests in 1900. In June, 1904, Bernardo Calle, the lay brother Miguel Vilajoli, and more than 70 Christians were murdered at a then recently erected mission station, Huabico, in Upper Maranon and the station itself was destroyed.\nThe Augustinian settlements in Brazil of the 19th century then belonged to the Philippine province. In the procuration house at S. Paulo (Rua Apeninos 6) and in the college at Brotas there were 4 Augustinians each; in the diocesan seminary at S. Jos\u00e9 de Manaos, 6; and in the other settlements, 27 priests\u2014in all, 42 members of the order, including one lay brother. In Argentina, there were 25 priests and two lay brothers in the six colleges and schools of the order in 1900. In Ecuador, which formed a province by itself, there were 21 members of the order in 1900, with 9 priests and 7 lay brothers in the monastery at Quito, 3 priests in the convent at Latagun, and 2 in that at Guayaquil. The province of Chile had 56 members in 1900, including 18 lay brothers: 11 at Santiago, 4 at La Serena, 5 at Concepci\u00f3n, 22 at Talca, 8 at San Fernando, 4 at Melipilla, and 2 in the residence at Picazo. The province of the United States of America increased in the end of the 19th century as the Augustinians were driven out of many European countries, and in 1848 sought refuge in the USA. The province numbered 200 members in 1900. The largest convent was then at Villanova, Pennsylvania; it was also the novitiate for North America, and among the 117 religious then occupying the convent 21 were priests. The other convents contained 60 members by 1900, of whom 5 were lay brothers. The order (from Mexico) arrived in Cuba in 1608. It was suppressed by force in 1842. From 1892 the province of the United States had care of St. Augustine's College at Havana, Cuba, where there were 5 priests and 3 lay brothers in 1900 before they were expelled in 1961 by the government of Fidel Castro.\n\nLatest Statistics:In the year 2000 in Central and South America, the Augustinians remain established in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela as well three Peruvian Vicariates of Iquitos, Apur\u00edmac and Chulucanas, and the Province of Peru. There are currently 814 friars in Latin America.\n\n\n==== Oceania ====\nBy the early 20th century, the Augustinians established missions in Oceania and Australia. The Spanish Augustinians took over the missions founded by Spanish and German Jesuits in the Ladrones, which then numbered 7 stations with about 10,000 people on Guam, and about 2500 on each of the German islands of Saipan, Rota and Tinian. The mission on the German islands was separated from the Diocese of Ceb\u00fa on 1 October 1906, and made a prefecture Apostolic on 18 June 1907, with Saipan as its seat of administration, and the mission given in charge to the German Capuchins.\n\n\n===== Australia =====\nIn Australia the Augustinians were established in the ecclesiastical Province of Melbourne and in the Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown, Queensland, with twelve priests of the Irish province under Monsignor James D. Murray. The order has furnished some prominent bishops to Australia, e.g. Irishman James Alipius Goold. The Irish Augustinian college of St. Patrick at Rome, built in 1884 by Patrick Glynn, was then the training college for the Augustinian missions.\nJames Alipius Goold had been the first Augustinian to arrive in the Australian colonies in 1838. He had been convinced to go to Australia by William Bernard Ullathorne (then the Benedictine Vicar-General of New Holland) after a chance meeting on the steps of the Roman Augustinian church at the monastery of Santa Maria del Popolo.Goold began his missionary work in Sydney under Archbishop John Bede Polding, becoming parish priest at Campbelltown. He went on in 1848 to become the founding bishop and first Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Melbourne. He also commenced the design and construction of its Neo-Gothic Cathedral. Despite's Goold's initial desire to establish immediately an Australian branch of the order, the first Australian Augustinian was not ordained until 1940, and the Australian Province was not formally established as separate from its Irish founding province until 1952.\nThe Irish Augustinian friars formally accepted responsibility in 1884 for the part of Queensland that became the Diocese of Cairns, and the first Australian priory was founded at Echuca, Victoria, in 1886. Priories were established at Rochester in 1889 and Kyabram in 1903. The order worked at different times in the colonies of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, taking part in some critical moments of the settlement and establishment of modern Australia. Charles O'Hea O.S.A. baptized Ned Kelly. Matthew Downing O.S.A. tried to calm the miners who were part of the Eureka Stockade in 1854. The order also supplied a number of the other early Australian bishops including Martin Crane O.S.A. and Stephen Reville O.S.A both in Sandhurst (Bendigo), John Heavey O.S.A. (Cairns), John Hutchinson O.S.A (Cooktown), and James Murray O.S.A. (Cooktown).\nThe order presently conducts parishes, two schools (one established 1948 in Brisbane, the other established 1956 in Sydney), St John Stone House (a centre for Augustinian Spirituality), a formation centre, and special ministries such as palliative care, HIV/AIDS ministry, and Aboriginal ministry.\nAssociated orders such as the St John of God Brothers (arrived Australia 1947 and established mental health services) and the Filipino Augustinian Sisters of our Lady of Consolation also established an Australian house in the 1990s.\n\nLatest Statistics:As of 2006 there were 11 other Augustinian priories in Australia with 36 friars in solemn vows, and one in simple vows. The order of friars is in numerical decline in Australia while affiliated orders are growing.\n\n\n===== Papua =====\nThe Augustinian Delegation of Papua has operated since 1953. It presently contains five Dutch-born Augustinians and thirty-three Indonesian-born Augustinians.The order of friars and affiliated orders are growing in the Indonesian territories.\n\n\n==== South-East Asia ====\n\n\n===== Indonesia =====\nTwo Dutch Augustinian friars re-established the order in Papua (now Indonesia) in 1953 while it was still a Dutch colony. In 1956 the order took responsibility for the area that was to become the Diocese of Manokwari. As of 2006, the Augustinian Vicariate of Indonesia has 15 friars in solemn profession, and 7 in simple vows. It is now predominantly Papuan.\nThe order of friars and affiliated orders are growing in Indonesia.\n\n\n===== Philippines =====\nThe Augustinian friars were the first Christian missionaries to settle in what is now regarded as Asia's only Catholic nation, and the leader of these first missionaries was the navigator Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta (1498 \u2013 June 3, 1568, Mexico), an Augustinian friar. He was navigator on the journey that established the first permanent Spanish settlement in the Philippines. The historic Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines was officially formed on December 31, 1575, as an offshoot of the establishment of the first permanent Spanish settlements. San Agust\u00edn Church and Monastery in Manila became the centre of Augustinian efforts to evangelise the Philippines. Herrera wrote a poetical life of Jesus in the Tagalog language in 1639.\nCipriano Navarro's important work on \"The Inhabitants of the Philippines\" and a monumental work in six volumes entitled \"La Flora de Filipinas\" (Madrid, 1877\u2013 ) are valuable contributions to literature and learning on the Philippines. Manuel Blanco, Ignacio Mercado, Antonio Llanos, Andr\u00e9s Naves and Celestino Fernandez are also worthy of mention. Angelo Perez and Cecilio Guemes published in 1905 a work in four volumes entitled \"La Imprenta de Manila\".\nArguably, the most energetic missionary activity of the Augustinian Order has been displayed in the Philippine Islands. When Ferdinand Magellan discovered the Philippines (16 March 1521) and took possession of them in the name of the King of Spain, he was accompanied by the chaplain of the fleet, who preached the Gospel to the inhabitants, baptizing Kings Colambu and Siagu and 800 natives of Mindanao and Ceb\u00fa, on Low Sunday, 7 April 1521. The effect of these conversions, however, were soon almost negated. Magellan was killed in a fight with natives on the little island of Mactan on 27 April and the Catholic foundation established by the first Spanish missionaries almost disappeared. The missionaries brought from Mexico in 1543 by Ruy L\u00f3pez Villalobos were not more successful, for they were forced to return to Europe by way of Goa, having had little influence on the islanders. Under the Adelantado Legaspi who in 1565 established the sovereignty of Spain in the Philippines and selected Manila as the capital in 1571, Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta and 4 other Augustinian friars landed at Ceb\u00fa in 1565, and at once began a very successful apostolate. The first houses of the Augustinians were established at Ceb\u00fa, in 1565, and at Manila, in 1571.\nAugustinian friars made researches in the languages of the Philippine Islands including Diego Bergano, and Jos\u00e9 Sequi (d. 1844), a prominent missionary of the order who baptized 30,000 people. Many wrote grammars and compiled dictionaries.\nIn 1575, under the leadership of Alfonso Gutierez, twenty-four Spanish Augustinians landed in the islands and, with the respective provincials Diego de Herrera and Martin de Rado, worked very successfully, at first as wandering preachers. Franciscans first appeared in the Philippines in 1577 and were welcomed by the Augustinians. Soon they were joined by Dominicans and Jesuits. Sent by Philip III, the first Discalced Augustinians landed in 1606. All these Orders shared in the work and challenges of the missions. Protected by Spain, they prospered, and their missionary efforts became more and more successful. In 1773 the Jesuits, however, were obliged to give up their missions in consequence of the suppression of the Society.\nReligious orders suffered persecution in the Philippines at the end of the 19th century, especially the Augustinians. In 1897 the Calced Augustinians, numbering 319 out of 644 religious then in the Philippine province, had charge of 225 parishes, with 2,377,743 people; the Augustinian Recollects, numbering about 220, with 233 parishes and 1,175,156 people; the Augustinians of the Philippine province numbered in all 522, counting those in the priories at Manila, Cavite, San Sebastian, and Ceb\u00fa, those at the large model farm at Imus, and those in Spain at the colleges of Monteagudo, Marcilla, and San Millan de la Cogulla. Besides the numerous parishes served by the Calced Augustinians, they possessed several educational institutions: a superior and intermediate school at Vigan (Villa Fernandina) with 209 students, an orphanage and trade school at Tambohn near Manila, with 145 orphans, etc. Because of the disturbances, the schools and missions were deserted; six Augustinian priests were killed and about 200 imprisoned and some of them harshly treated. Those who escaped unmolested fled to the principal house at Manila, to Macao, to Han-kou, to South America, or to Mexico. Up to the beginning of 1900, 46 Calced and 120 Discalced Augustinians had been imprisoned. Upon their release, they returned to the few monasteries still left them in the islands or set out for Spain, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Argentina and China. The province of the United States sent some members to supply the vacancies in the Philippines. The Monastery of St. Paul, at Manila, had 24 priests and 6 lay brothers back in 1900; that at Ceb\u00fa, 5 members of the order, that at Iloilo, on the island of Panay, 11 priests and 2 lay brothers, while in the 10 residences there were 20 priests; so that in 1900 there were only 68 Calced Augustinians in the islands. In all, the \"Provincia Ss. Nominis Jesu Insularum Philippinarum\", including theological students and the comparatively small number of lay brothers, had 600 members in 1900: 359 being in Spain, 185 of whom were priests; 68 in the Philippines; 29 in China (before their later expulsion) ; 26 in Colombia; 49 in Peru; 42 in Brazil; 27 in Argentina.\nThe Order in the 21st century still has responsibility for one of the oldest churches in the Philippines, the Basilica del Santo Ni\u00f1o de Cebu in Cebu. Before the Philippine Revolution of 1898, which accelerated the separation of church and state in the Philippines, the Augustinians conducted more than 400 schools and churches there and had pastoral care for some 2,237,000 Filipinos, including 328 village missions. The Philippine Revolution of 1896 cost the order its heaviest losses in the entire 19th century, breaking the historic connection with, or destroying the majority of its established works there. This included the removal of friars from 194 parishes, the capture of 122 friars by Filipino revolutionaries and the deprivation of income from 240 friars. Many Spanish Augustinians were forced to leave the country for Spain or Latin America, repopulating the Augustinian houses in Spain and reinforcing Augustinian missionary work in South America.\nIn 1904 members of the order belonging to the Philippine province established the University of San Agustin in Iloilo City, Philippines. They have also since established schools such as the Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod in Negros Occidental (1962), the Colegio San Agustin, Makati (1969) and the Colegio San Agustin, Bi\u00f1an in Bi\u00f1an, Laguna (1985). In 1968 friars of the Philippine province re-established the Augustinian presence on the Indian subcontinent.\nIn 2004 the all-Filipino Augustinian Province of Cebu celebrated its twentieth year of existence. It has 85 members in final vows with 19 in simple profession. There are 12 priories including a mission on Socorro Island.The Order of friars is again growing in the Philippines. The Augustinian Recollects are also present in the Philippines.\n\n\n==== Asia ====\n\n\n===== China =====\nThe first Western major work on the history of China was by Augustinian friar Juan Gonz\u00e1lez de Mendoza. It was a description of a visit to China by three others (including another Augustinian friar), and included the first known depiction of Chinese characters in Western publishing. In 1585 he published it at Rome in Spanish.\nMartin de Hereda and Hieronymus penetrated into the interior of China in 1577, to study Chinese literature with the intention of bringing it into Europe. Antonius Aug. Georgius (d. 1797) composed the \"Alphabetum Tibetanum\" for the use of missionaries. Agostino Ciasca (d. 1902), titular Archbishop of Larissa and cardinal, established a special faculty for Oriental languages at the Roman Seminary, published an Arabic translation of Tatian's \"Diatessaron\" and wrote \"Bibliorum Fragmenta Copto-Sahidica\". Dionysius of Borgo San Sepolcro (d. 1342), Bishop of Monopoli in Lower Italy, is the author of a commentary on the \"Factorum et dictorum memorabilium libri IX\" of Valerius Maximus, and was also much esteemed for his talents as poet, philosopher, and orator. The missionaries of the order have also given us valuable descriptive works on foreign countries and peoples.\nIn about 1681, the Filipino Augustinian Alvaro de Benevente arrived in China and established the first of the Augustinian houses in China at Kan-chou. Benevente was made bishop and became head of the newly created Vicariate of Kiang-si in 1699. The Augustinian missionaries had success in propagating Catholicism, but in 1708, during the Chinese Rites controversy they were forced to withdraw from China. Portuguese Augustinians also served in the colonial port of Macau from 1586 until 1712.\nIn 1879 Spanish Augustinians from Manila (Elias Suarez and Agostino Villanueva) entered China to re-establish an Augustinian mission.\nIn 1891 there were only 219 Christians and 11 catechumens, as well as 29 schools, with 420 children and 750 orphans. In 1900 the order possessed the mission of Northern Hu-nan, China, where there were 24 members, 2 of whom were natives; 6 were in the district of Yo-chou; 6 in the district of Ch'ang-te; 9 in the district of Li-chu; three other religious were also labouring in other districts\u2014all under the vicar Apostolic, then Mgr. Perez. The 1900 mission comprised about 3000 baptized Christians and 3500 catechumens in a population of 11 million. In 1900 there were also two priests at the mission house at Han-kou and two at the procuration house at Shang-hai (Yang-tsze-poo Road, 10). By 1910 the Augustinian mission had 24 members of the order, two were indigenous Chinese. By 1947 the Augustinian mission counted 24,332 baptised Catholics as well as 3,250 preparing for baptism. They had established 20 major churches and 90 satellite churches. By that time there were 25 Chinese-born priests.\nAll foreign missionaries were expelled or imprisoned from 1953 by the Communist government. Chinese-born Augustinians were dispersed by government order and directed not to live the monastic life. Church officials were arrested, schools and other church institutions closed or confiscated by the State. Many priests, religious brothers and sisters, as well as leaders among the Christian laity were sent to labour camps. One of the last of the pre-Revolution Chinese Augustinians was the Rev. Dai O.S.A.. He died in 2003.\n\nLatest Information:Since the re-unification of the former colonies of Macau and Hong-Kong with the central Chinese government and further developments in government religious policy, Roman Catholicism in China\u2014including clergy, Roman Catholic bishops, and a Cardinal\u2014once again exists openly alongside the members of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and their co-religionists in the continuing underground Church.\nThe Augustinian have recently re-established friendly relations with Chinese educational organisations through school-placement programmes as well as through the University of the Incarnate Word Chinese campus founded by the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word.\nWhile there are Chinese Augustinian friars, there is not yet a priory in mainland China re-established.\n\n\n===== India =====\nAfter an extensive period of expansion in India from the 15th century the Portuguese Augustinians had not only established the order but also provided sixteen Indian bishops between 1579 and 1840. The order subsequently disappeared in India, cut off from its usual governance after the suppression of Portuguese monasteries in 1838, and the friars were forced to become secular priests. The order had failed successfully to establish itself as an autonomous indigenous Indian foundation.\nHowever, the Augustinians were re-established by Andr\u00e9s G. Ni\u00f1o, OSA, Spanish Augustinian, named coordinator of the project by the General Chapter of the Order in 1971 .... (cf., Estudio Agustiniano, 45 (2010) 279-303)  ....... and the Indian Augustinians took on further responsibilities in Kerala in 2005. The Indian delegation currently has 16 ordained friars and 8 in simple vows. The order is growing numerically in India.\n\n\n===== Iran =====\nThe missionary history of Iran (Persia) also mentions the Augustinians. Towards the close of the sixteenth century, Aleixo de Menezes, Count of Cantanheda (d. 1617), a member of the order, appointed Archbishop of Goa in 1595, and of Braga in 1612, Primate of the East Indies, and several times Viceroy of India, sent several Augustinians as missionaries to Iran (Persia) while he himself laboured for the reunion of the Thomas Christians, especially at the Synod of Diamper, in 1599, and for the conversion of the Muslims and the non-Christians of Malabar.\n\n\n===== Japan =====\nDespite a vigorous early Christian foundation in Nagasaki by Jesuits, Franciscans and Filipino Augustinians and the many 17th century Japanese Augustinian martyrs, the earlier Augustinian mission attempts eventually failed after the repression of Tokugawa Hidetada (ruled 1605\u20131623; second Tokugawa shogun of Japan) and the expulsion of Christians under Tokugawa Iemitsu (ruled 1623 to 1651; third Tokugawa shogun of Japan).\nThe Augustinian missions in the Philippines provided missionaries for the East since their first establishment. In 1602 some of them penetrated into Japan, where several were martyred around the 1607 during a period of Christian persecution. Among the martyred, Augustinians include: Ferdinand of Saint Joseph, Andrew Yoshida, Peter Zu\u00f1iga, John Shozaburo, Michael Kiuchi Tayemon, Peter Kuhieye, Thomas Terai Kahioye, Mancio Seisayemon, Lawrence Hachizo, Bartholomew Guitierrez, Vincent of Saint Anthony, Francis of Jesus, Martin of Saint Nicholas Lumbreras and Melchior of Saint Augustine S\u00e1nchez, and Thomas \u201cKintsuba\u201d Jihyoe of Saint Augustine. The Augustinian Martyrs of Japan collectively celebrate their feast day on September 28. Augustinian Ferdinand of Saint Joseph, along with Andrew Yoshida, a catechist who worked with him, were beheaded in 1617. Peter Z\u00faniga was burned to death in 1622. Br. John Shozaburo, Oblates Michael Kiuchi Tayemon, Peter Kuhieye, Thomas Terai Kahioye, and Tertiaries Mancio Scisayemon and Lawrence Hachizo were beheaded in 1630. Bartholomew Gutierrez, Vincent of Saint Anthony Simoens, Francis of Jesus Terrero, Martin of St. Nicholas Lumbreras and Melchior of St. Augustine S\u00e1nchez were burned to death in 1632. Thomas Jihyoe of Saint Augustine in 1637 was hung by his feet with his head inserted into a pit of rotting garbage until he died. In 1653 others entered China, where, in 1701, the order had six missionary stations before their expulsion.\nHowever, American Augustinian friars returned to Japan in 1954, symbolically establishing their first priory in 1959 at Nagasaki (also site of the second atomic bomb dropped on August 13, 1945). They then established priories in Fukuoka (1959), Nagoya (1964), and Tokyo (1968). As of 2006, there are seven United States Augustinian friars and five Japanese Augustinian friars.\nEarly Japanese Augustinian leaders, including St Magdalen of Nagasaki and St Thomas Jihyoe are venerated as saints.\n\n\n===== Korea =====\nThe Augustinian Recollects are also present in Korea, but for the Augustinian friars, the Region of Korea was founded in 1985 by Australian, English and Scottish friars. Filipinos later replaced the UK friars. As of 2006 there are 5 Koreans professed in the order and 12 in formation.\nThe order of friars is growing numerically in Korea.\n\nLatest Statistics:As of 2006 (and not counting Spanish Augustinian priories) there were more than 21 other Augustinian houses across the Philippines, India, Korea, Japan, and Indonesia, with more than 140 friars in solemn vows and more than 40 in simple vows.\nThe order of friars is growing in Asia.\n\n\n==== Europe ====\nIn its most flourishing state at the beginning of the 14th century AD, the order in Europe had forty-two provinces (besides the two vicariates of India and Moravia) with 2,000 monasteries and about 30,000 members. The Canons Regular and the Augustinian Recollects also have considerable history in Europe.\n\nLatest statistics:As of 2006 there were 148 active Augustinian priories in Europe, including Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Ireland, England, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain and Spanish houses in the Philippines. This includes 1,031 friars in solemn vows, and 76 in simple vows.\n\n\n===== England =====\nIn England and Ireland of the 14th century the Augustinian order had had over 800 friars, but these priories had declined (for other reasons) to around 300 friars before the anti-clerical laws of the Reformation Parliament and the Act of Supremacy. The friaries were dispersed from 1538 in the dissolution of monasteries during the English Reformation. The martyr St John Stone was one of the few British Augustinians to publicly defy the will of Henry VIII in this matter. The partial List of monasteries dissolved by Henry VIII of England alone includes 19 Augustinian houses.\nThe Augustinians were re-established in England in the 1860s with the creation of the Augustinian priory, church and school of St Monica in Hoxton Square, London, N1 (architect: E. W. Pugin) built 1864\u201366.Clare Priory \u2013 one of the houses dissolved by King Henry VIII \u2013 was re-acquired by the order in 1953, with help from the family who then owned it.\n\n\n===== Spain =====\nA significant Augustinian missionary college was established at the former Spanish capital of Valladolid in 1759\u2014and this house was exempted from the suppression of monastic houses in Spain c.1835, later becoming the centre of restoration for the order in Spain. In 1885 Filipino Augustinians took charge of the famous Escorial, and friars continue to administer it today. The modern Augustinian province of Spain was refounded in 1926\u2014largely through Spanish and Filipino friars from the Philippines\u2014but that was not the end of difficulty for the order in Spain. During the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339) ninety eight Augustinians were murdered\u2014sixty five friars from the Escorial alone were executed. Many of the discalced Augustinian nuns of Valencia were also put to death.\nAs of 2006 there were 177 Spanish Augustinian friars, with 23 in simple profession.\n\n\n===== Ireland =====\nThe English Province of the Order of Saint Augustine founded their first house in Dublin some time before 1280, and for a considerable time the Augustinians of Ireland were all English, effectively serving the English settlers in Ireland. Great Connell Priory was founded about 1202. Ballybeg Priory of St. Thomas \u00e0 Becket, was founded by Phillip de Barry in 1229 for the Canons Regular of St. Augustine. However, by the mid 14th century thirteen houses of the order had been established in Ireland. The Irish branch was relatively poor, and very few of the indigenous Irish friars were sent to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge for their education (unlike the English Augustinians). The fortunes of the Irish order changed in 1361 when Lionel, the second son of King Edward III, became viceroy of Ireland. He favoured the order, and soon established an Augustinian professor of theology based at St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and the Irish order then grew significantly until the time of the English Reformation.\nIn Ireland after the Reformation Parliament that began in 1529, the Augustinian houses in Leinster, Munster, Dublin, Dungarvan and Drogheda were soon suppressed. The houses in Ardnaree, Ballinrobe, Ballyhaunis, Banada and Murrisk managed to remain functioning until 1610. By decree in 1542 the English parliament had allowed the Augustinian community at Dunmore in County Galway, Ireland to continue. After 1610 the Dunmore community was the only surviving foundation, and in 1620 the Irish Province of the Augustinians was given pastoral charge of both England (where all houses had been forcibly closed) and Ireland. Irish Augustinian students were sent to the Continent to study, and the Irish Augustinians continued their work in Ireland under the harsh English Penal laws designed to protect the establishment of the Church of England. A number were executed\u2014including William Tirry OSA (executed 1654 for saying mass). In 1656, in response to the persecution at home, Pope Alexander VII established the Irish Augustinians in Rome in the church and priory of San Matteo in Merulana. Many Augustinians though remained in Ireland. One such Bishop John Sleyne O.S.A was administrator in commendam and last Prior of Ballybeg Priory. In 1751 Augustine Cheevers, an Irish Augustinian, was made Bishop of Ardagh. Others left to work in America and after the 1830s to Australia. After the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829, the order began to re-organise more openly in Ireland. The Irish friars took the order back to England, establishing a priory at Hoxton, London in 1864. They further turned their attention to Nigeria, Australia, America and missionary work. The contemporary Irish order conducts parishes, a school in Dungarvan (founded 1874), a school in New Ross and special ministries in Ireland.\nContemporary Ireland is undergoing rapid change, and this presents challenges to the order there. Many Irish emigrants (including Augustinian friars) are now returning. Over 40,000 immigrants each year are admitted to keep the Irish economy working, and many are coming from the new Eastern European members of the European Union. For example, there are now over 100,000 Poles in the country as well as asylum seekers from Africa and the Balkan countries.\n\n\n===== Europe (setbacks) =====\nMany European Augustinian priories and foundations suffered serious setbacks (including suppression and destruction) from the various periods of anti-clericalism during the Reformation and other historical events such as the French Revolution, the Spanish civil war (among more than 6,000 clergy, 155 Spanish Augustinians were killed), the two World Wars and Communist repression.\n\n\n====== French-speaking lands ======\nThe order of friars in Spain and France has had an eventful history, from being part of the Grand Union, through the periods of extensive Spanish colonisation, the French Revolution, the effects of the Napoleonic wars, the War of the Spanish Succession, suppression of the order, the Spanish Civil War, and then Francisco Franco.\n\n\n====== German-speaking lands ======\nThe successful German branch, which until 1299 was counted as one province, was then divided into four provinces. These provinces produced significant Augustinian leaders and reformers. These included the most famous German Augustinian theologian before the Augustinian Martin Luther: Andreas Proles (d. 1503), the founder of the Union or Congregation of the Observant Augustinian Hermits, organized after strict principles; Johann von Paltz, the famous Erfurt professor and pulpit-orator (d. 1511); Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen (d. 1532); as well as Johann von Staupitz, Luther's monastic superior and Wittenberg colleague (d. 1524).\nReforms were also introduced into the extra-German branches of the order, but a long time after Proles's reform and in connection with the Counter-Reformation of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Augustinian credentials of Martin Luther did not prevent anti-clerical attacks on the order during the Reformation, and neither did it enhance the order's political influence within the Catholic Church during the Counter-Reformation.\nA number of mathematicians, astronomers, and musicians are also found among the members of the order, but it was the great scientist Johann Gregor Mendel, abbot of the Czech monastery of St. Thomas at Old Brno in Moravia (d. 1884) who gave great credit to the Augustinian Order's scholarship in the 19th century. He was the discoverer of the Mendelian laws of heredity and hybridization.\n\n\n=== Growth or decline of the order internationally ===\n\nGiven that the Roman Catholic Church in the Western world has been experiencing a decline in vocations to the priesthood and religious life since the 1960s, a relatively simple way to assess the vigour of this order is to compare the numbers of those in solemn profession (vows) with those in simple profession. For a mendicant order such as the Augustinians, the most formal and significant commitments are the permanent and lifelong vows of Solemn profession. Ordination is considered a separate matter, and though most are, the Augustinian friar may or may not be ordained priest or deacon. Those in simple profession are the newer members of the order, but have agreed to make a serious commitment (temporary, but with a view to permanent commitment), and been formally accepted as suitable by senior members of the order to make that formal commitment. The figures quoted do not include aspirants to the order who have not reached the significant step of simple profession. The details of the median age of friars in respective national grouping is another way of assessing the vigour of the order, but these details are not included here. They may be found on the order's international website. Likewise, the growth of lay organisations of Augustinian spirituality is another (less-precise) way of measuring the vigour of the order.\n\n\n=== Extension ===\nThe Bull \"Licet ecclesiae catholicae\" mentions the hermit convents that had been invited to take part in the proceedings at Rome, in 1256, which led to the union. \"Quaedam [domus] S. Guillelmi, quaedam S. Augustini ordinum, nonnullae autem fratris Joannis Boni, aliquae vero de Fabali, aliae vero de Britinis.\" According to this statement, the original branches of the hermits were: \n\nThe Williamites, founded by St. William of Maleval shortly before his death in 1157. From this congregation sprang two others, the principal houses being at Stabulum Rodis, in the valley of Maleval, and at Fabali on Monte Fabali. The mode of life, originally very severe, was mitigated by Pope Gregory IX, under whom the majority of the Williamite monasteries adopted the Rule of St. Benedict. When these were required by the Bull \"Licet ecclesiae catholicae\" to join the new order, they raised objections and obtained a prohibition to exchange the Benedictine Rule for the milder one of the Augustinians. (See Guil. De Waha, \"Explanatio vitae S. Guillelmi Magni\" etc., 1693; \"Acta Sanct. Boll.\", Feb., II, 450 sqq.; \"Kirchenlex.\", 2nd ed., XII, 1609 sqq.)\nSeveral unspecified houses of the Order of St. Augustine, established chiefly in Italy, and forming separate congregations. To these belong the Hermits of the Holy Trinity in Tuscany, who had already been united into an Augustinian congregation by Pope Innocent IV, in 1243, with Cardinal Richard for a protector, and with indulgences granted to those who visited their churches (in 1244).\nThe Bonites, so called from their founder, Blessed John Buoni, a member of the Buonuomini family, born about 1168 in Mantua. He lived a hermit's life at Cesena, and died in his native city in 1249 (Lodi, \"Vita e miracoli del b. Giov. Buoni\", Mantua, 1591; \"Acta SS. Boll.\", Oct., IX, 693 sq.). In the year 1256 the Bonites possessed eleven monasteries and gave the first general to the Augustinian Order (see above).\nThe Brittinians (Brictinians), so called from their oldest foundation, that of St. Blasius de Brittinis, near Fano, in the Marche district of Ancona. Many congregations, such as the Brothers of Penance of Christ (Saccati, or \"Sack-bearers\"), the foundations of Durandus of Huesca (Osca), and those of the \"Catholic Poor\", united with the Bonites.The Hermits of St. Augustine spread rapidly, partly because they did not radiate from a single parent monastery, and partly because, after violent conflicts in the previously existing congregations, the active life was finally adopted by the greater number of communities, following the example of the Friars Minor and the Dominicans. To the Brittinians alone, in 1260, was granted permission to continue following the contemplative life. A few years after the reorganization of the Augustinian Order, Hermit monasteries sprang up in Germany, France and Spain. Germany soon possessed forty, many of them large and important, such as those at Mainz, W\u00fcrzburg, Worms, Nuremberg, Speyer, Strasburg, Ratisbon, all built between 1260 and 1270. As early as the year 1299, the German province was divided into four sub-provinces: the Rhenish-Swabian, the Cologne, the Bavarian and the Saxon. At the period of its greatest prosperity the order comprised 42 ecclesiastical provinces and 2 vicariates numbering 2000 monasteries and about 30,000 members. (Cf. Aug. Lubin, \"Orbis Augustinianus sive conventuum O. Erem. S. A. chorographica et topographica descriptio\", Paris, 1659, 1671, 1672.)\nThis modern Latin Rite branch is active in society (i.e. not enclosed) and it is counted comprehensively in the article below. It is headed by the international Prior-General in Rome, and while spiritually and historically connected is now canonically separate from the other Independent Augustinian communities such as the Discalced Augustinians, Augustinian nuns, and the Augustinian Recollects.\n\n\n=== Priories ===\nThe modern order of friars (Under the Prior General in Rome) is associated with the United Nations as a Non-Governmental Organization and maintains a full-time representative to the United Nations. Worldwide there are nearly 2,800 Augustinian friars working in:\n\nAround 1,500 women live in Augustinian enclosed convents in: \n\n\n=== Historic reform movements ===\nIn the fourteenth century, owing to various causes such as the mitigation of the rule\u2014either by permission of the pope, or through a lessening of fervour, but chiefly because of the Plague and the Great Western Schism\u2014discipline became relaxed in the Augustinian monasteries; and so reformers emerged who were anxious to restore it. These reformers were themselves Augustinians and instituted several reformed congregations, each having its own vicar-general (vicarius-generalis), but all under the control of the general of the order.\nThe most important of these congregations of the \"Regular Observants\" were those of Illiceto, in the district of Siena, established in 1385. They initially had 12, and subsequently 8, convents. St. John ad Carbonariam (founded c. 1390) had 14 convents, Perugia (1491), had 11, and the Lombardic Congregation (1430) had 56. The Congregation of the Spanish Observance (1430) included all the Castilian monasteries from 1505. The reform of Monte Ortono near Padua (1436) had 6 convents, the Regular Observants of the Blessed Virgin at Genoa (also called Our Lady of Consolation (c. 1470) had 25. The Regular Observants of Apulia (c. 1490) had 11; the Congregation of Zampani in Calabria (1507) had 40. The German (or Saxon) Congregation (1493) flourished; the Dalmatian Congregation (1510) had 6, the Congregation of the Colorites (of Monte Colorito in Calabria (1600) had 11. At Centorbio in Sicily (1590) there were 18, and the \"Little Augustinians\" of Bourges, France (c. 1593) had 20. The Spanish, Italian and French congregations of Discalced, or Barefooted, Augustinians were successful (see below), and the Congregation del Bosco in Sicily established in the year 1818 had 3 convents.\nAmong these reformed congregations, besides those of the Barefooted Augustinians, the most important was the German (Saxon) Congregation. As in Italy, Spain and France, reforms were begun as early as the fifteenth century in the four German provinces existing since 1299. Johannes Zachariae, an Augustinian monk of Eschwege, Provincial of the Order from 1419\u20131427 and professor of theology at the University of Erfurt, began a reform in 1492. Andreas Proles, prior of the Himmelpforten Monastery, near Wernigerode, strove to introduce the reforms of Heinrich Zolter in as many Augustinian monasteries as possible. Proles, aided by Simon Lindner of Nuremberg and other zealous Augustinians, worked indefatigably till his death, in 1503, to reform the Saxon monasteries, even calling in the assistance of the secular ruler of the country. As the result of his efforts, the German, or Saxon, Reformed Congregation, recognized in 1493, comprised nearly all the important convents of the Augustinian Hermits in Germany.\nJohann von Staupitz, his successor as vicar of the congregation, followed in his footsteps. Staupitz had been prior at T\u00fcbingen, then at Munich, and had taken a prominent part in founding the University of Wittenberg in 1502, where he became a professor of theology and the first dean of that faculty. He continued to reform the order with the zeal of Proles, as well as in his spirit and with his methods. He collected the \"Constitutiones fratrum eremitarum S. August. ad apostolicorum privilegiorum formam pro Reformatione Alemanniae\", which were approved in a chapter held at Nuremberg in 1504. A printed copy of these is still to be seen in the university library of Jena. Supported by the general of the order, Aegidius of Viterbo, he obtained a papal brief (15 March 1506), granting independence under their own vicar-general to the reformed German congregations and furthermore, 15 December 1507, a papal Bull commanding the union of the Saxon province with the German Congregation of the Regular Observants. All the Augustinian convents of Northern Germany were, in accordance with this decree, to become parts of the regular observance. But when, in 1510, Staupitz commanded all the hermits of the Saxon province to accept the regular observance on pain of being punished as rebels, and to obey him as well as the general of the order, and, on 30 September, published the papal Bull at Wittenberg, seven convents refused to obey, among them that of Erfurt, of which Martin Luther was a member\u2014Luther seems to have gone to Rome on this occasion as a representative of the rebellious monks.\nBecause of this appeal to Rome, the consolidation did not take place. Staupitz also continued to favour Luther even after this. They had become acquainted at Erfurt, during a visitation, and Staupitz was responsible for Luther's summons to Wittenberg in 1508; yet even after 1517 he entertained friendly sentiments for Luther, looking upon his ideas as being motivated only against abuses. From 1519 on, he gradually turned away from Luther. Staupitz resigned his office of vicar-general of the German congregations in 1520. Wenzel Link, preacher at Nuremberg, former professor and dean of the theological faculty at Wittenberg, who was elected his successor, cast his lot with Luther, whose views were endorsed at a chapter of the Saxon province held in January, 1522, at Wittenberg. In 1523 Link resigned his office and became a Lutheran preacher at Altenberg, where he introduced the Reformation and married. In 1528 he went as preacher to Nuremberg, where he died in 1547. The examples of Luther and Link were followed by many Augustinians of the Saxon province, and their convents gradually became more and more deserted. The convent of Erfurt ceased to exist in 1525. German houses that remained in communion with Rome then united with the Lombardic Congregation.\nMany Augustinians in Germany opposed the Reformation by their writings and their sermons, such as Bartholom\u00e4us Arnoldi of Usingen (d. 1532 at W\u00fcrzburg), who for thirty years was professor at Erfurt and one of Luther's teachers, Johannes Hoffmeister (d. 1547), Wolfgang Cappelmair (d. 1531) and Konrad Treger (d. 1542).\nThe chief house of the order remains the International College of St. Monica at Rome, Via S. Uffizio No. 1. It is also the residence of the general of the order (prior generalis) and of the curia generalis. Another priory of the Augustinian order in Rome is that of S. Augustinus de Urbe, established in 1483, near the church of St. Augustine. It was there that the remains of St. Monica, the mother of St. Augustine, were deposited when they were brought from Ostia in the year 1430. This, formerly the chief priory of the order, was later occupied by the Italian Ministry of Marine, and the Augustinian friars who serve the church retained only a small portion of their former property. Another Augustinian priory in Rome is S. Maria de Populo de Urbe.\nIn 1331 Pope John XXII had appointed the Augustinian Hermits guardians of the tomb of St. Augustine in the Church of S. Pietro in Ciel d'Oro at Pavia. They were driven from there in 1700, and evacuated to Milan. Their priory was destroyed in 1799, the church desecrated, and the remains of St. Augustine were taken back to Pavia and placed in its cathedral. The church of S. Pietro was restored, and on 7 October 1900, the body of the saint and Doctor of the church was removed from the cathedral and replaced in San Pietro\u2014an event commemorated in a poem by Pope Leo XIII. The Augustinians were subsequently restored their old church of S. Pietro.\n\n\n=== Organization of the order ===\n\n\n==== Government ====\nThe Order of St Augustine, while following the rule known as that of St. Augustine, are also subject to the Constitutions drawn up by Augustinus Novellus (d. 1309), prior general of the order from 1298 to 1300, and by Clement of Osimo. The Rule and Constitutions were approved at the general chapter held at Florence in 1287 and at Ratisbon in 1290. A revision was made at Rome in 1895. The Constitutions have frequently been printed: at Rome, in 1581, and, with the commentary of Girolamo Seripando, at Venice, in 1549, and at Rome, in 1553. The newly revised Constitutions were published at Rome in 1895, with additions in 1901 and 1907.\nThe government of the order is as follows: At the head is the prior general. Currently, the prior general is Alejandro Moral, OSA, who was elected in September 2013. The prior general is elected every six years by the general chapter. The prior general is aided by six assistants and a secretary, also elected by the general chapter. These form the Curia Generalitia. Each province is governed by a provincial, each commissariate by a commissary general, each of the two congregations by a vicar-general, and every monastery by a prior (only the Czech monastery of Alt-Brunn, in Moravia, is under an abbot) and every college by a rector. The members of the order are divided into priests and brothers. \nThe Augustinians, like most religious orders, have a cardinal protector.\n\n\n===== The habit =====\nThe choir and outdoor dress of the monks is of black woollen material, with long, wide sleeves, a black leather cincture and a long pointed capuche reaching to the cincture. The indoor dress consists of a black habit with capuche and cincture. In many Augustinian houses white is used in Summer and also worn in public, usually in places where there were no Dominicans. Shoes and out of doors (prior to Vatican II) a black hat or biretta completed the habit.\n\n\n=== Modern distribution ===\nAs of 2006 there were 148 active Augustinian priories in Europe, including Germany, Belgium, Poland, Ireland, England, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, Malta, Spain and Spanish houses in the Philippines. This includes 1,031 friars in solemn vows, and 76 in simple vows. The order established the first of their Canadian houses at Tracadie, Nova Scotia in Canada in 1938. Among other Canadian foundations, the order also established a significant priory and St. Thomas of Villanova College in Toronto. The order, by 2006 has since professed many native Canadians.\nAs of 2006 there were more than 70 Augustinian priories in the United States and Canada with 386 friars in solemn vows and 16 in simple vows. In Central and South America, the Augustinians remain established in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela as well three Peruvian Vicariates of Iquitos, Apur\u00edmac and Chulucanas, and the Province of Peru. There are currently 814 friars in Latin America.\nAs of 2006, there were more than 30 other Augustinian priories in Nigeria, Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and Algeria, with over 85 friars in solemn vows, and more than 60 in simple vows. There are also Augustinians working in the Republic of Benin, Togo, Madagascar, Guinea and Burkina.\nThe Augustinian order in the Region of Korea was founded in 1985 by Australian, English and Scottish friars. Filipinos later replaced the UK friars. As of 2006 there are 5 Koreans professed in the order and 12 in formation.As of 2006 there were 11 Augustinian priories in Australia with 36 friars in solemn vows, and one in simple vows. The order of friars is in numerical decline in Australia while affiliated orders are growing.\nAs of 2006 (and not counting Spanish Augustinian priories) there were more than 21 other Augustinian houses across the Philippines, India, Korea, Japan, and Indonesia, with more than 140 friars in solemn vows and more than 40 in simple vows.\n\n\n== Legacy and impact ==\nThe work of the Augustinians includes teaching, scientific study, parish and pastoral work (cure of souls) and missions.\n\n\n=== Teaching ===\nThe history of education makes frequent mention of Augustinians who distinguished themselves particularly as professors of philosophy and theology at the great universities of Salamanca, Coimbra, Alcal\u00e1, Padua, Pisa, Naples, Oxford, Paris, Vienna, Prague, W\u00fcrzburg, Erfurt, Heidelberg, and Wittenberg, amongst others. Others taught successfully in the schools of the order, which controlled a number of secondary schools, colleges, and other educational institutions. In 1685 the Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg, Johann Gottfried II, confided to the care of the Augustinians the parish and the gymnasium of Munnerstadt in Lower Franconia (Bavaria), a charge that they still retain; connected with the monastery of St. Michael in that place is a monastic school, while the seminary directed by the Augustinians forms another convent, that of St. Joseph. From 1698 to 1805 there existed an Augustinian gymnasium at Bedburg in the district of Cologne. The order possesses altogether fifteen colleges, academies and seminaries in Italy, Spain and America. The chief institutions of this kind in Spain are that at Valladolid and that in the Escorial.\n\n\n=== Augustinian devotional practices ===\nThe particular devotional practices connected with the Augustinian Order, and which it has striven to propagate, include the veneration of the Blessed Virgin under the title of \"Mother of Good Counsel\" (Mater Boni Consilii), whose miraculous picture is to be seen in the Augustinian church at Genazzano in the Roman province. This devotion has spread to other churches and countries, and confraternities have been formed to encourage it. Several periodicals dedicated to the honour of Our Lady of Good Counsel are published in Italy, Spain and Germany by the Augustinians (cf. Meschler on the history of the miraculous picture of Genazzano in \"Stimmen aus Maria-Laach\", LXVII, 482 sqq.).\nBesides this devotion, the order traditionally fostered the Archconfraternity of Our Lady of Consolation. Traditionally, the girdle confraternity, members of which wear a blessed girdle of black leather in honour of Saints Augustine, Monica and Nicholas of Tolentino, recite daily thirteen Our Fathers and Hail Marys and the Salve Regina, fast strictly on the eve of the feast of St. Augustine, and received Holy Communion on the feasts of the three above-named saints. This confraternity was founded by Pope Eugene IV at San Giacomo, Bologna, in 1439, made an archconfraternity by Gregory XIII, in 1575, aggregated to the Augustinian Order, and favoured with indulgences. The Augustinians, with the approbation of Pope Leo XIII, also encourage the devotion of the Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel and the propagation of the Third Order of St. Augustine for the laity, as well as the veneration of Augustine and his mother Monica, to instil the Augustinian spirit of prayer and self-sacrifice into their parishioners.\n\n\n=== Notable figures ===\nThe Augustianian Order has produced a number of notable members, especially theologians and writers, including:\n\nBl.

The church was then constructed in 1622 and became the property of the Augustinians until 1834 when they were expelled from Macau. In 1837, the church was reconstructed along with the Bishop residence next to it. In 1935, it was then again completely rebuilt.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe church is located at the top of Penha Hill.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nAt the front courtyard of the church stands the Our Lady of Lourdes statue. At the steps of the hillside staircase exists the picturesque grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes.\n\n\n== Opening time ==\nThe building complex is opened everyday from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and the chapel is opened everyday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tourist attractions in Macau\nChristianity in Macau\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChapel of Our Lady of Penha \u2013 Macao Government Tourism Office website",

        "wiki": "The Historic Centre of Macao, Portuguese: Centro Hist\u00f3rico de Macau, Chinese: \u6fb3\u9580\u6b77\u53f2\u57ce\u5340, is a collection of over twenty locations that witness the unique assimilation and co-existence of Chinese and Portuguese cultures in Macau, a former Portuguese colony.  It represents the architectural legacies of the city's cultural heritage, including monuments such as urban squares, streetscapes, churches and temples.  \nIn 2005 the Historic Centre of Macau was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, making it the 31st designated World Heritage site in China.  It was described by UNESCO as: \"with its historic street, residential, religious and public Portuguese and Chinese buildings, the historic centre of Macao provides a unique testimony to the meeting of aesthetic, cultural, architectural and technological influences from East and West,\" and \"...it bears witness to one of the earliest and longest-lasting encounters between China and the West, based on the vibrancy of international trade.\"\n\n\n== List of sites ==\nThe Historic Centre of Macao is made up of two separated core zones in city center on the Macau peninsula.  Each core zone is surrounded by a buffer zone.\n\n\n=== Zone 1 ===\nThe narrow-stripped Zone 1 is located between Mount Hill and Barra Hill.\n\n\n==== Buildings ====\n\n\n==== Squares ====\n\n\n=== Zone 2 ===\nThe Zone is surrounded by a buffer zone that covers a park and immediate urban area.\nGuia Fortress incorporating Guia Chapel and Guia Lighthouse\n\n\n== Management ==\nMost of the items (buildings) are owned by the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) and managed by various departments or authority. Cultural Institute of the SAR Government manages the Mandarin's House, the Ruins of St. Paul's, the Section of the Old Wall, Mount Fortress and Guia Fortress (includes the Lighthouse and Chapel).\nLeal Senado Building is managed by the Provisional Municipal Council of Macao while the two government-owned temples, A-Ma Temple and Na Tcha Temple are managed by the Board of A-Ma Temple Charity Association and Management Board of Na Tcha Temple respectively. The Moorish Barracks is managed by the Macao Harbour Administration Building.The rest of the items are owned and managed by the respective institutions. St. Joseph's Seminary Building and Church is owned by St. Joseph's Seminary and managed by the Catholic Diocese of Macao. The Holy House of Mercy Building is owned and managed by Holy House of Mercy Charitable Foundation. Dom Pedro V Theatre is owned and managed by the Management Board of Dom Pedro V Theatre.The nominated buildings of the Historic Center are protected by various laws, including the Basic Law of the Macao SAR.\n\n\n== Threat ==\n\nIn 2007, local residents of Macao wrote a letter to UNESCO complaining about construction projects around world heritage Guia Lighthouse (Focal height 108 meters), including the headquarter of the Liaison Office (91 meters). UNESCO then issued a warning to the Macau government, which led former Chief Executive Edmund Ho to sign a notice regulating height restrictions on buildings around the site.\nIn 2015, the New Macau Association submitted a report to UNESCO claiming that the government had failed to protect Macao's cultural heritage against threats by urban development projects. One of the main examples of the report is that the headquarter of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao Special Administrative Region, which is located on the Guia foothill and obstructs the view of the Guia Fortress (one of the world heritages symbols of Macao). One year later, Roni Amelan, a spokesman from UNESCO Press service, said that the UNESCO has asked China for information and is still waiting for a reply. In 2016, the Macau government approved an 81-meter construction limit for the residential project, which reportedly goes against the city\u2019s regulations on the height of buildings around world heritage site Guia Lighthouse.Professor at Stanford University Dr. Ming K.Chan (Chinese: \u9673\u660e\u92b6) and professor at University of Macau Dr. Eilo Yu (Chinese: \u4f59\u6c38\u9038) commented the Guia Lighthouse case proved that the Macao government had ignored the conservation of heritage in urban planning.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of oldest buildings and structures in Macau\nReligion in Macau\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nInformation from the website of UNESCO World Heritage Centre\n1001wonders.org : visit this site in panophotographies - 360 x 180 degree images",

          "We stopped here while walking around the historic centre of Macau - it is a short walk beyond the ruins of St Pauls, adjacent to the Casa Garden & Camoes Garden. It was interesting to look at the tombstones and imagine how these people ended up in Macau.",
          "We were wandering around Macau near the St. Anthony's Chapel and we ran across this old protestant cemetery. This is a very tiny cemetery, yet it is really cool to check out if you are in the area. Plan for a 15 minute visit. Most of the graves are the above the ground style",
          "Interesting to see this space in Macau -- not easy to get to from the main attractions in the city, but if you're walking around in the area stop by and spend a few minutes looking around and reading some of the inscriptions on the grave stones.",
          "This is a very magical place with a spiritual feel. If you are in the area then it's well worth a visit. Especially moving are the children's graves.",

          "Next to the Luis Camoes garden and the Casa Garden so easy to look into, but it's small and not much of a sanctuary, especially with the lack of seating.",
          "The Old Protestant Cemetery is in the historic district of old Macau, and there is a small, white chapel on the grounds, and the cemetery itself lies below. The graves themselves are from individuals from many countries, and the oldest ones are from the late 18th century.",
          "Visiting historical places in Macau, we had time for only one final place to visit and we picked Morrison's Chapel and the Protestant Cemetery. What a wonderful choice getting away from the hustle bustle of Macau during the Golden Week. The cemetery was one of peace, solitary",
          "The Old Protestant Cemetery is found on Camoes Square along with fellow World Heritage attractions, Casa Garden, St. Anthony's church and the non-World Heritage Camoes Garden and Grotto. It is a nice inclusion to the Macau World Heritage collection, being the location where you",
          "It is very remarkable to find in a Catholic Portuguese enclave an old Protestant Cemetery and a Protestant Church as well, the Morrisson Chapel named after Robert Morrison (1782-1834), the first Protestant missionary in China and author of the first Chinese to English dictionary",
          "This is a small cemetery, located two doors down from the entrance to Camoes Garden. Probably only a hundred tombstones and box tombs, they are all of a sturdy size and from pre 1900 era. It is a lovely location, with very old large trees and completely walled in from the",
          "This cemetery is specially interesting because its style is without any doubt european, but then you remember, \u00aboh wait, this is China!\u00bb I liked it there, it's small, but beautiful and well preserved, so you can actually analyse the graves and learn about who is there, because"

        "wiki": "The transfer of sovereignty of Macau from Portugal to the People's Republic of China (PRC) occurred on 20 December 1999.\nMacau was settled by Portuguese merchants in 1535, during the Ming Dynasty (1368\u20131644 CE) and was subsequently under various degrees of Portuguese rule until 1999. Portugal's involvement in the region was formally recognised by the Qing in 1749. The Portuguese governor Jo\u00e3o Maria Ferreira do Amaral, emboldened by the First Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking, attempted to annex the territory, expelling Qing authorities in 1846, but was assassinated.  After the Second Opium War, the Portuguese government, along with a British representative, signed the 1887 Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking that gave Portugal perpetual colonial rights to Macau on the condition that Portugal would cooperate in efforts to end the smuggling of opium.After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and the transfer of China's seat to the PRC at the United Nations in 1971, foreign minister Huang Hua appealed to the UN Special Committee on Decolonization to remove Macau (and Hong Kong) from its list of colonies, preferring bilateral negotiations ending in a return of the territory, rather than the independence of the territory as was implied by its inclusion on the list.\nOn 25 April 1974, a group of left-wing Portuguese officers organized a coup d'\u00e9tat, overthrowing the right-wing ruling government that had been in power for 48 years. The new government began to transition Portugal to a democratic system and was committed to decolonization. The new Portuguese government carried out de-colonization policies, and proposed Macau's handover to China in 1978. The Chinese government rejected this proposal, believing that an early transfer of Macau would impact relations with Hong Kong.On 31 December 1975, the Portuguese government withdrew its remaining troops from Macau. On 8 February 1979, the Portuguese government decided to break off diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, and established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China the next day. Both Portugal and the People's Republic of China recognized Macau as Chinese territory. The colony remained under Portuguese rule until 20 December 1999, when it was transferred to China.\n\n\n== Negotiations ==\nOn 20 May 1986, the People's Republic of China, along with Portugal, officially announced that talks on Macanese affairs would take place in Beijing on 30 June 1986. The Portuguese delegation arrived in Beijing in June, and was welcomed by the Chinese delegation led by Zhou Nan.The talks consisted of four sessions, all held in Beijing:\n\nThe first conference: 30 June \u2013 1 July 1986\nThe second conference: 9 \u2013 10 September 1986\nThe third conference: 21 \u2013 22 October 1986\nThe fourth conference: 18 \u2013 23 March 1987During the negotiations, Portuguese representatives offered to return Macau in 1985, but Chinese representatives rejected that year (as well rejecting previous requests for 1967, 1975, and 1977). China requested 1997, the same year as Hong Kong, but Portugal refused. 2004 was suggested by Portugal, as well as 2007 as that year would mark the 450th anniversary of Portugal renting Macau. However, China insisted for a year before 2000 as the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group in Hong Kong would be dissolved in 2000 as envisioned in 1986 (the Joint Liaison Group would be dissolved in 1999). Eventually the year 1999 was agreed upon.On 13 April 1987, the Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau by the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Portuguese Republic was formally signed by the Prime Ministers of both governments in Beijing.\n\n\n== Transition Period (1987-1999) ==\nThe twelve years between the signing of the \"Sino-Portuguese Declaration\" on 13 April 1987 and the transfer of sovereignty on 20 December 1999 were known as \"the transition\".\nOn 15 January 1988, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Department announced the Chinese members of the groups that would begin the talk on the issues of Macau during the transition. On 13 April, the \"Draft of the Basic Law of the Macau Special Administrative Region Committee\" was established during the seventh National People's Congress, and on 25 October, the committee convened the first conference, in which they passed the general outline of the draft and the steps, and decided to organise the \"Draft of the Basic Law of Macau Special Administrative Region Information Committee\". On 31 March 1993, the National People's Congress passed the resolution on the Basic Law of Macau, which marked the beginning of the latter part of the transition.\n\n\n== Transfer ==\n\nIn the afternoon of 19 December 1999, the 127th Portuguese Governor of Macau Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira lowered the flags in Macau, which was the prelude of the ceremony for the establishment of the Macau Special Administrative Region. The official transfer of sovereignty was held at midnight on that day at the Cultural Centre of Macau Garden. The ceremony began in the evening and ended at dawn of 20 December.\nThe evening of 19 December began with dragon and lion dances. These were followed by a slideshow of historical events and features of Macau, which included a mixture of the religions and races of the East and the West, and the unique society of native Portuguese born in Macau. In the final performance, 422 children who represented the 422 years of Portuguese history in Macau were presented along with several international stars to perform the song \"Praise for Peace\".\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter the transfer of the sovereignty of Macau to China, the Macau Special Administrative Region, the Legislative Assembly and the Judiciary were all put into practice accordingly under the regulation of the Basic Law.\nThe introduction of the Individual Visit Scheme policy made it easier for Chinese mainland residents to travel back and forth. In 2005 alone, there were more than 10 million tourists from mainland China, which made up 60% of the total number of tourists in Macau. The income from the gambling houses in Macau reached almost US$5.6 billion. On 15 July 2005, the Historic Centre of Macau was listed as a World Cultural Heritage site. The increasing development of tourism became a major factor in the rapid development of the economy of Macau.\nFor Portugal, the transfer of the sovereignty of Macau to China marked the end of the Portuguese Empire and its decolonisation process and also the end of European imperialism in China & Asia.\n\n\n== Before and after handover ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nTransfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong\nOne country, two systems\nHandover Gifts Museum of Macao\nTime Capsule (Macau)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Chinese garrison in Macau (in Chinese)\nLai, Pauline Pou San. \"Civil service training in the Macau Government\" (Chapter 7).

        "wiki": "The Historic Centre of Macao, Portuguese: Centro Hist\u00f3rico de Macau, Chinese: \u6fb3\u9580\u6b77\u53f2\u57ce\u5340, is a collection of over twenty locations that witness the unique assimilation and co-existence of Chinese and Portuguese cultures in Macau, a former Portuguese colony.  It represents the architectural legacies of the city's cultural heritage, including monuments such as urban squares, streetscapes, churches and temples.  \nIn 2005 the Historic Centre of Macau was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, making it the 31st designated World Heritage site in China.  It was described by UNESCO as: \"with its historic street, residential, religious and public Portuguese and Chinese buildings, the historic centre of Macao provides a unique testimony to the meeting of aesthetic, cultural, architectural and technological influences from East and West,\" and \"...it bears witness to one of the earliest and longest-lasting encounters between China and the West, based on the vibrancy of international trade.\"\n\n\n== List of sites ==\nThe Historic Centre of Macao is made up of two separated core zones in city center on the Macau peninsula.  Each core zone is surrounded by a buffer zone.\n\n\n=== Zone 1 ===\nThe narrow-stripped Zone 1 is located between Mount Hill and Barra Hill.\n\n\n==== Buildings ====\n\n\n==== Squares ====\n\n\n=== Zone 2 ===\nThe Zone is surrounded by a buffer zone that covers a park and immediate urban area.\nGuia Fortress incorporating Guia Chapel and Guia Lighthouse\n\n\n== Management ==\nMost of the items (buildings) are owned by the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) and managed by various departments or authority. Cultural Institute of the SAR Government manages the Mandarin's House, the Ruins of St. Paul's, the Section of the Old Wall, Mount Fortress and Guia Fortress (includes the Lighthouse and Chapel).\nLeal Senado Building is managed by the Provisional Municipal Council of Macao while the two government-owned temples, A-Ma Temple and Na Tcha Temple are managed by the Board of A-Ma Temple Charity Association and Management Board of Na Tcha Temple respectively. The Moorish Barracks is managed by the Macao Harbour Administration Building.The rest of the items are owned and managed by the respective institutions. St. Joseph's Seminary Building and Church is owned by St. Joseph's Seminary and managed by the Catholic Diocese of Macao. The Holy House of Mercy Building is owned and managed by Holy House of Mercy Charitable Foundation. Dom Pedro V Theatre is owned and managed by the Management Board of Dom Pedro V Theatre.The nominated buildings of the Historic Center are protected by various laws, including the Basic Law of the Macao SAR.\n\n\n== Threat ==\n\nIn 2007, local residents of Macao wrote a letter to UNESCO complaining about construction projects around world heritage Guia Lighthouse (Focal height 108 meters), including the headquarter of the Liaison Office (91 meters). UNESCO then issued a warning to the Macau government, which led former Chief Executive Edmund Ho to sign a notice regulating height restrictions on buildings around the site.\nIn 2015, the New Macau Association submitted a report to UNESCO claiming that the government had failed to protect Macao's cultural heritage against threats by urban development projects. One of the main examples of the report is that the headquarter of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao Special Administrative Region, which is located on the Guia foothill and obstructs the view of the Guia Fortress (one of the world heritages symbols of Macao). One year later, Roni Amelan, a spokesman from UNESCO Press service, said that the UNESCO has asked China for information and is still waiting for a reply. In 2016, the Macau government approved an 81-meter construction limit for the residential project, which reportedly goes against the city\u2019s regulations on the height of buildings around world heritage site Guia Lighthouse.Professor at Stanford University Dr. Ming K.Chan (Chinese: \u9673\u660e\u92b6) and professor at University of Macau Dr. Eilo Yu (Chinese: \u4f59\u6c38\u9038) commented the Guia Lighthouse case proved that the Macao government had ignored the conservation of heritage in urban planning.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of oldest buildings and structures in Macau\nReligion in Macau\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nInformation from the website of UNESCO World Heritage Centre\n1001wonders.org : visit this site in panophotographies - 360 x 180 degree images",

        "wiki": "The Venetian Macao (Chinese: \u6fb3\u9580\u5a01\u5c3c\u65af\u4eba) is a luxury hotel and casino resort in Macau owned by the American Las Vegas Sands company. The Venetian is a 39-story, casino hotel on the Cotai Strip in Macau. The 10,500,000-square-foot (980,000 m2) Venetian Macao is modeled on its sister casino resort The Venetian Las Vegas. The Venetian Macao is the 2nd largest casino in the world, the largest single structure hotel building in Asia, and also the seventh-largest building in the world by floor area.\nThe main hotel tower was finished in July 2007 and the resort officially opened on 28 August 2007. The resort has 3,000 suites, 1,200,000 sq ft (110,000 m2) of convention space, 1,600,000 sq ft (150,000 m2) of retail, 550,000 square feet (51,000 m2) of casino space \u2013 with 3,400 slot machines and 800 gambling tables and the 15,000-seat Cotai Arena for entertainment and sports events.\nThe lead architect for the Venetian Macao were Aedas and HKS, Inc. joint venture, who were responsible for the design, coordination and implementation of the project on site.\n\n\n== Casino ==\n\nThe casino measures 546,000 sq ft (50,700 m2). It is further divided into four themed gaming areas\u2014namely, Golden Fish, Imperial House, Red Dragon and Phoenix. The casino consists of over 6,000 slot machines and 800 gambling tables.\nThe hotel offers a club called Paiza Club which caters to premium guests. The club comes with its own entrance, lobby, reception, and guest lifts to the rooms. The gaming area of the Paiza Club is divided into individual private gaming rooms each named for notable Asian cities and regions such as Yunnan, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.\nThe guests of the club have exclusive access to the club dining outlet, the Paiza Club Dining & Lounge, which is open 24 hours a day.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe hotel uses Venice, Italy, as its design inspiration and features architectural replicas of various Venetian landmarks.\n\n\n== Accommodation ==\nThe hotel tower offers 2,905 suites. The accommodation floors go from level 7 up to level 38. These floors are served by guest lifts.\nPaiza suites are reserved for premium guests. The largest is the Presidente, a 12-bay suite with four bedrooms.\n\n\n== Entertainment ==\n\nThe Cotai Arena (formerly known as the Venetian Arena) is an indoor arena, opened in 2007 with a seating capacity of 15,000. It hosts sporting events such as basketball, tennis, and boxing, as well as concerts and international televised awards shows.\n\n\n=== Zaia ===\nZaia, a 90-minute stage production by the Canadian entertainment company Cirque du Soleil, ran between 27 August 2008 and 19 February 2012 in a custom-built theater at the Venetian Macao. The show, directed by Neilson Vignola and Gilles Maheu, featured a cast of 75 circus artists. The show's theme was a young girl's perception of the stars and planets, space and infinity, populated by otherworldly creatures. The theater housing the performance seated 1,800 spectators at a time.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nOn 12 November 2008, the gates were locked to the construction labour force from a variety of Asian countries as projects were suspended.  Hsin Chong, the project manager for the Venetian, laid off approximately 400 staff. As many workers had been there for less than two years, no severance was due.  The next day, Sands' president for Asia announced that up to 11,000 workers would be losing their jobs as the company was halting building projects in Macao.In 2010 the Chinese press reported that as part of a \"sex-trade crackdown\" authorities had found more than 100 prostitutes inside the casino.In early 2011 the United States Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation into the Las Vegas Sands Corporation with respect to the compliance of its Macao properties with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGambling in Macau\nCotai Jet \u2013 owned by The Venetian Macao, operating high speed Catamaran ferry services between Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal and Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal, Hong Kong\nList of properties on the Cotai Strip\nList of Macau casinos\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Venetian Macao",

          "This hotel is over rated in terms of class and service. I was rudely refused entry in to the casinos over the pretext I didn\u2019t look 21. I am 40 years old (nowhere close to 21) and had valid electronic passport ID which Mr.Roshan (security to casinos) refused to accept. These",

          "We arrived here from HK at approx 7pm after leaving our hotel in HK at 430pm. One regret we have is that we should of left earlier as we were unaware of the sheer vastness of the casinos. The casino is very grand and vast. You need a personal tour guide if that\u2019s even a thing",

          "It is what it is. The table limits are way too high, but the variety of machines can\u2019t be faulted. I still have not got my head around why casinos in Macau don\u2019t use the local currency, aside from the fact that they are making money off currency exchange. It does seem odd to",
          "Very big. Very busy. When I was there looked like half the poker machines were being replaced - but there were still plenty of free ones. It looked like free drinks (just small water bottles) were being handed out, but no one came near me - won't dwell on why that was.",
          "It is worth a brief visit to casinos to get a feel of the atmosphere and activity that goes on inside a glamorous building. The second floor of the building contains a replica of a Venetian canal complete with gondolas.",

          "It was very surprising for me to see that Venetian and all other Macao casinos lack variety of games which is standard and can be found worldwide at casinos like Monaco, Singapore, USA, Goa etc. 75% pf the casino floor is occupied by Bacarrat tables and slot machines. No variety",
          "Very nice hotel based on the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas which again is based upon as its name would suggest Venice Italy. Just no atmosphere here unlike Vegas. Maybe this was a really low season on our visit. But still worth a visit all the same.",
          "If you love Blackjack its best to play during the day as the odds of winning are best. The odds seems against you after 1 AM and I've always won playing during day . They do have more tables offering Blackjack at HKD 300 per hand then other casinos in the Cotai area.",

          "We took the free shuttle bus from the Sands to the Venetian, and just walked around for an hour. The Grand Canal precinct is worth seeing for the reproduction of Venice without the smells and the rubbish. The gondoliers can sing well and the sky is always blue. Very kitsch, but",
          "It was worth the wait, the gondola I was in had a gondolier who could belt out any song and he was such an entertainer. I realised later that all gondoliers are basically opera singers. As for the Venetian itself, I have to admit it did a good job replicating a Venetian feel",

          "Like all the casinos in Macau, people there mean business. You don't have the buzz and enjoyment from vegas and people keep to themselves and are focused on winning. Nevertheless the casino at the venetian is still better than most others in town as it features all the various",
          "We caught the bus to the Venetian Casino from the Sands Casino (free service). It was definitely worth the trip. The indoor rivers and condolas were very interesting. The consolation driver even sings to you!!!! Lots of shops and eateries. Only spent about 1 and a half hours",

          "The title says it all. It is packed with food courts, shops, and a casino, so it is easy to get lost. We asked for directions from a worker, who formerly worked in Las Vegas. Gondola in the canal was a pleasant ride, and the rower sang during the ride.",

          "It was worth seeing but not more. If you re coming from Europe and if you have been to Venice, this place wouldn't impress you that much. It was more interesting to see the reaction of the Asians and there amazed faces. Casinos are worth seeing. Quite a lot of money turning",

        "wiki": "\u2039See TfM\u203a\nSun Yat-sen (; born Sun Wen; 12 November 1866 \u2013 12 March 1925) was a Chinese politician, physician, and political philosopher, who served as the provisional first president of the Republic of China and the first leader of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party of China). He is referred as the \"Father of the Nation\" in the Republic of China for his instrumental role in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution. Sun is unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for being widely revered in both mainland China and Taiwan.Sun is considered to be one of the greatest leaders of modern China, but his political life was one of constant struggle and frequent exile. After the success of the revolution in 1911, he quickly resigned as President of the newly founded Republic of China and relinquished it to Yuan Shikai. He soon went to exile in Japan for safety but returned to found a revolutionary government in the South as a challenge to the warlords who controlled much of the nation. In 1923, he invited representatives of the Communist International to Canton to re-organize his party and formed a brittle alliance with the Chinese Communist Party. He did not live to see his party unify the country under his successor, Chiang Kai-shek in the Northern Expedition. He died in Beijing of gallbladder cancer on 12 March 1925.Sun's chief legacy is his political philosophy known as the Three Principles of the People: M\u00ednz\u00fa (\u6c11\u65cf\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednz\u00fa Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) or nationalism (independence from foreign imperialist domination), M\u00ednqu\u00e1n (\u6c11\u6b0a\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednqu\u00e1n Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) or \"rights of the people\" (sometimes translated as \"democracy\"), and M\u00ednsh\u0113ng (\u6c11\u751f\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednsh\u0113ng Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) or people's livelihood (sometimes translated as \"socialism\" or \"welfare\").\n\n\n== Names ==\n\nSun was born as Sun Wen (Cantonese: Sy\u016bn M\u00e0hn; \u5b6b\u6587), and his genealogical name was Sun Deming (Sy\u016bn D\u0101k-m\u00echng; \u5b6b\u5fb7\u660e). As a child, his pet name was Tai Tseung (Dai-jeuhng; \u5e1d\u8c61). Sun's courtesy name was Zaizhi (Jai-j\u012b; \u8f09\u4e4b), and his baptized name was Rixin (Yaht-s\u0101n; \u65e5\u65b0). While at school in Hong Kong he got the art name Yat-sen (Chinese: \u9038\u4ed9; pinyin: Y\u00ecxi\u0101n).  S\u016bn Zh\u014dngsh\u0101n (\u5b6b\u4e2d\u5c71), the most popular of his Chinese names, is derived from his Japanese name Nakayama Sh\u014d (\u4e2d\u5c71\u6a35), the pseudonym given to him by T\u014dten Miyazaki while in hiding in Japan.\n\n\n== Early years ==\n\n\n=== Birthplace and early life ===\nSun Wen was born on 12 November 1866 to Sun Dacheng and Madame Yang. His birthplace was the village of Cuiheng, Xiangshan County (now Zhongshan City), Guangdong. He had a cultural background of Hakka and Cantonese. His father owned very little land and worked as a tailor in Macau, and as a journeyman and a porter. After finishing primary education, he moved to Honolulu in the Kingdom of Hawaii, where he lived a comfortable life of modest wealth supported by his elder brother Sun Mei.\n\n\n=== Education years ===\nAt the age of 10, Sun began seeking schooling, and he met childhood friend Lu Haodong. By age 13 in 1878, after receiving a few years of local schooling, Sun went to live with his elder brother, Sun Mei (\u5b6b\u7709) in Honolulu. Sun Mei financed Sun Yat-sen's education and would later be a major contributor for the overthrow of the Manchus.\n\nDuring his stay in Honolulu, Sun Yat-sen went to \u02bbIolani School where he studied English, British history, mathematics, science, and Christianity. While he was originally unable to speak English, Sun Yat-sen quickly picked up the language and received a prize for academic achievement from King David Kal\u0101kaua before graduating in 1882. He then attended Oahu College (now known as Punahou School) for one semester. In 1883 he was sent home to China as his brother was becoming worried that Sun Yat-sen was beginning to embrace Christianity.When he returned to China in 1883 at age 17, Sun met up with his childhood friend Lu Haodong again at Beijidian (\u5317\u6975\u6bbf), a temple in Cuiheng Village. They saw many villagers worshipping the Beiji (literally North Pole) Emperor-God in the temple, and were dissatisfied with their ancient healing methods. They broke the statue, incurring the wrath of fellow villagers, and escaped to Hong Kong. While in Hong Kong in 1883 he studied at the Diocesan Boys' School, and from 1884 to 1886 he was at The Government Central School.In 1886 Sun studied medicine at the Guangzhou Boji Hospital under the Christian missionary John G. Kerr. Ultimately, he earned the license of Christian practice as a medical doctor from the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese (the forerunner of The University of Hong Kong) in 1892. Notably, of his class of 12 students, Sun was one of the only two who graduated.\n\n\n== Religious views and Christian baptism ==\nIn the early 1880s, Sun Mei sent his brother to \u02bbIolani School, which was under the supervision of British Anglicans and directed by an Anglican prelate named Alfred Willis. The language of instruction was English. Although Bishop Willis emphasized that no one was forced to accept Christianity, the students were required to attend chapel on Sunday. At Iolani School, young Sun Wen first came in contact with Christianity. In his work, Schriffin speculated that Christianity was to have a great influence on Sun's whole future political life.Sun was later baptized in Hong Kong (on 4 May 1884) by Rev. C. R. Hager an American missionary of the Congregational Church of the United States (ABCFM) to his brother's disdain. The minister would also develop a friendship with Sun. Sun attended To Tsai Church (\u9053\u6fdf\u6703\u5802), founded by the London Missionary Society in 1888, while he studied Western Medicine in Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese. Sun pictured a revolution as similar to the salvation mission of the Christian church. His conversion to Christianity was related to his revolutionary ideals and push for advancement.\n\n\n== Transformation into a revolutionary ==\n\n\n=== Four Bandits ===\n\nDuring the Qing-dynasty rebellion around 1888, Sun was in Hong Kong with a group of revolutionary thinkers who were nicknamed the Four Bandits at the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese. Sun, who had grown increasingly frustrated by the conservative Qing government and its refusal to adopt knowledge from the more technologically advanced Western nations, quit his medical practice in order to devote his time to transforming China.\n\n\n=== Furen and Revive China Society ===\nIn 1891, Sun met revolutionary friends in Hong Kong including Yeung Ku-wan who was the leader and founder of the Furen Literary Society. The group was spreading the idea of overthrowing the Qing.  In 1894, Sun wrote an 8,000 character petition to Qing Viceroy Li Hongzhang presenting his ideas for modernizing China. He traveled to Tianjin to personally present the petition to Li but was not granted an audience. After this experience, Sun turned irrevocably toward revolution.  He left China for Hawaii and founded the Revive China Society, which was committed to revolutionizing China's prosperity. Members were drawn mainly from Chinese expatriates, especially the lower social classes. The same month in 1894 the Furen Literary Society was merged with the Hong Kong chapter of the Revive China Society. Thereafter, Sun became the secretary of the newly merged Revive China society, which Yeung Ku-wan headed as president. They disguised their activities in Hong Kong under the running of a business under the name \"Kuen Hang Club\" (\u4e7e\u4ea8\u884c).\n\n\n=== First Sino-Japanese War ===\nIn 1895, China suffered a serious defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War.  There were two types of responses.  One group of intellectuals contended that the Manchu Qing government could restore its legitimacy by successfully modernizing. Stressing that overthrowing the Manchu would result in chaos and would lead to China being carved up by imperialists, intellectuals like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao supported responding with initiatives like the Hundred Days' Reform. In another faction, Sun Yat-sen and others like Zou Rong wanted a revolution to replace the dynastic system with a modern nation-state in the form of a republic. The Hundred Days' reform turned out to be a failure by 1898.\n\n\n== From uprising to exile ==\n\n\n=== First Guangzhou uprising ===\n\nIn the second year of the establishment of the Revive China society on 26 October 1895, the group planned and launched the First Guangzhou uprising against the Qing in Guangzhou. Yeung Ku-wan directed the uprising starting from Hong Kong. However, plans were leaked out and more than 70 members, including Lu Haodong, were captured by the Qing government.  The uprising was a failure. Sun received financial support mostly from his brother who sold most of his 12,000 acres of ranch and cattle in Hawaii. Additionally, members of his family and relatives of Sun would take refuge at the home of his brother Sun Mei at Kamaole in Kula, Maui.\n\n\n=== Exile in Japan ===\nSun Yat-sen spent time living in Japan while in exile.  He was supported by the Japanese politician T\u014dten Miyazaki. Most Japanese who actively worked with Sun were motivated by a pan-Asian fear of encroaching Western imperialism. While in Japan, Sun also met and befriended Mariano Ponce, then a diplomat of the First Philippine Republic. During the Philippine Revolution and the Philippine\u2013American War, Sun helped Ponce procure weapons salvaged from the Imperial Japanese Army and ship the weapons to the Philippines. By helping the Philippine Republic, Sun hoped that the Filipinos would win their independence so that he could use the archipelago as a staging point of another revolution. However, as the war ended in July 1902, America emerged victorious from a bitter 3-year war against the Republic. Therefore, the Filipino dream of independence vanished with Sun's hopes of collaborating with the Philippines in his revolution in China.\n\n\n=== Huizhou uprising in China ===\nOn 22 October 1900, Sun launched the Huizhou uprising to attack Huizhou and provincial authorities in Guangdong. This came five years after the failed Guangzhou uprising.  This time, Sun appealed to the triads for help. This uprising was also a failure.  Miyazaki, who participated in the revolt with Sun, wrote an account of this revolutionary effort under the title \"33-year dream\" (\u4e09\u5341\u4e09\u5e74\u4e4b\u5922) in 1902.\n\n\n=== Further exile ===\nSun was in exile not only in Japan but also in Europe, the United States, and Canada.  He raised money for his revolutionary party and to support uprisings in China. While the events leading up to it are unclear, in 1896 Sun Yat-sen was detained at the Chinese Legation in London, where the Chinese Imperial secret service planned to smuggle him back to China to execute him for his revolutionary actions. He was released after 12 days through the efforts of James Cantlie, The Globe, The Times, and the Foreign Office; leaving Sun a hero in Britain. James Cantlie, Sun's former teacher at the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, maintained a lifelong friendship with Sun and would later write an early biography of Sun.\n\n\n=== Heaven and Earth Society, overseas travel ===\nA \"Heaven and Earth Society\" sect known as Tiandihui had been around for a long time. The group has also been referred to as the \"three cooperating organizations\" as well as the triads. Sun Yat-sen mainly used this group to leverage his overseas travels to gain further financial and resource support for his revolution. According to the New York Times \"Sun Yat-sen left his village in Guangdong, southern China, in 1879 to join a brother in Hawaii. He eventually returned to China and from there moved to the British colony of Hong Kong in 1883. It was there that he received his Western education, his Christian faith and the money for revolution.\" This is where Sun Yat-sen realized that China needed to change its ways. He knew that the only way that China would change and modernize would be to overthrow the Qing Dynasty.\nAccording to Lee Yun-ping, chairman of the Chinese historical society, Sun needed a certificate to enter the United States at a time when the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 would have otherwise blocked him. However, on Sun's first attempt to enter the US, he was still arrested. He was later bailed out after 17 days. In March 1904, while residing in Kula, Maui, Sun Yat-sen obtained a Certificate of Hawaiian Birth, issued by the Territory of Hawaii, stating that \"he was born in the Hawaiian Islands on the 24th day of November, A.D. 1870.\" He renounced it after it served its purpose to circumvent the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Official files of the United States show that Sun had United States nationality, moved to China with his family at age 4, and returned to Hawaii 10 years later.\n\n\n== Revolution ==\n\n\n=== Tongmenghui ===\n\nIn 1904, Sun Yat-sen came about with the goal \"to expel the Tatar barbarians (i.e. Manchu), to revive Zhonghua, to establish a Republic, and to distribute land equally among the people\" (\u9a45\u9664\u97c3\u865c, \u6062\u5fa9\u4e2d\u83ef, \u5275\u7acb\u6c11\u570b, \u5e73\u5747\u5730\u6b0a). One of Sun's major legacies was the creation of his political philosophy of the Three Principles of the People. These Principles included the principle of nationalism (minzu, \u6c11\u65cf), of democracy (minquan, \u6c11\u6b0a), and of welfare (minsheng, \u6c11\u751f).On 20 August 1905, Sun joined forces with revolutionary Chinese students studying in Tokyo to form the unified group Tongmenghui (United League), which sponsored uprisings in China. By 1906 the number of Tongmenghui members reached 963 people.\n\n\n=== Malaya support ===\n\nSun's notability and popularity extends beyond the Greater China region, particularly to Nanyang (Southeast Asia), where a large concentration of overseas Chinese resided in Malaya (Malaysia and Singapore).  While in Singapore, he met local Chinese merchants Teo Eng Hock (\u5f35\u6c38\u798f), Tan Chor Nam (\u9673\u695a\u6960) and Lim Nee Soon (\u6797\u7fa9\u9806), which mark the commencement of direct support from the Nanyang Chinese. The Singapore chapter of the Tongmenghui was established on 6 April 1906, though some records claim the founding date to be end of 1905. The villa used by Sun was known as Wan Qing Yuan. At this point Singapore was the headquarters of the Tongmenghui.Thus, after founding the Tong Meng Hui, Dr Sun advocated the establishment of The Chong Shing Yit Pao as the alliance's mouthpiece to promote revolutionary ideas. Later, he initiated the establishment of reading clubs across Singapore and Malaysia, in order to disseminate revolutionary ideas among the lower class through public readings of newspaper stories. The United Chinese Library, founded on 8 August 1910, was one such reading club, first set up at leased property on the second floor of the Wan He Salt Traders in North Boat Quay.The first actual United Chinese Library building was built between 1908 and 1911 below Fort Canning \u2013 51 Armenian Street, commenced operations in 1912.  The library was set up as a part of the 50 reading rooms by the Chinese Republicans to serve as an information station and liaison point for the revolutionaries. In 1987, the library was moved to its present site at Cantonment Road. But the Armenian Street building is still intact with the plaque at its entrance with Sun Yat Sen's words. With an initial membership of over 400, the library has about 180 members today. Although the United Chinese Library, with 102 years of history, was not the only reading club in Singapore during the time, today it is the only one of its kind remaining.\n\n\n=== Siamese support ===\nIn 1903, Sun made a secret trip to Bangkok in which he sought funds for his cause in Southeast Asia. His loyal followers published newspapers, providing invaluable support to the dissemination of his revolutionary principles and ideals among Chinese descent in Thailand. In Bangkok, Sun visited Yaowarat Road, in Bangkok's Chinatown. It was on this street that Sun gave a speech claiming that overseas Chinese were \"the Mother of the Revolution\". He also met local Chinese merchants Seow Houtseng, whose sent financial support to him.\nSun's speech on Yaowarat street was commemorated by the street later being named \"Sun Yat Sen Street\" or \"Soi Sun Yat Sen\" (Thai: \u0e0b\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e0b\u0e38\u0e19\u0e22\u0e31\u0e15\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e47\u0e19) in his honour.\n\n\n=== Zhennanguan uprising ===\nOn 1 December 1907, Sun led the Zhennanguan uprising against the Qing at Friendship Pass, which is the border between Guangxi and Vietnam. The uprising failed after seven days of fighting. In 1907 there were a total of four uprisings that failed including Huanggang uprising, Huizhou seven women lake uprising and Qinzhou uprising. In 1908 two more uprisings failed one after another including Qin-lian uprising and Hekou uprising.\n\n\n=== Anti-Sun movements ===\nBecause of these failures, Sun's leadership was challenged by elements from within the Tongmenghui who wished to remove him as leader.  In Tokyo 1907\u20131908 members from the recently merged Restoration society raised doubts about Sun's credentials. Tao Chengzhang (\u9676\u6210\u7ae0) and Zhang Binglin publicly denounced Sun with an open leaflet called \"A declaration of Sun Yat-sen's criminal acts by the revolutionaries in Southeast Asia\". This was printed and distributed in reformist newspapers like Nanyang Zonghui Bao. Their goal was to target Sun as a leader leading a revolt for profiteering gains.The revolutionaries were polarized and split between pro-Sun and anti-Sun camps. Sun publicly fought off comments about how he had something to gain financially from the revolution. However, by 19 July 1910, the Tongmenghui headquarters had to relocate from Singapore to Penang to reduce the anti-Sun activities. It is also in Penang that Sun and his supporters would launch the first Chinese \"daily\" newspaper, the Kwong Wah Yit Poh in December 1910.\n\n\n=== 1911 revolution ===\n\nTo sponsor more uprisings, Sun made a personal plea for financial aid at the Penang conference held on 13 November 1910 in Malaya. The leaders launched a major drive for donations across the Malay Peninsula. They raised HK$187,000.On 27 April 1911, revolutionary Huang Xing led a second Guangzhou uprising known as the Yellow Flower Mound revolt against the Qing.  The revolt failed and ended in disaster; the bodies of only 72 revolutionaries were found. The revolutionaries are remembered as martyrs.On 10 October 1911, a military uprising at Wuchang took place led again by Huang Xing.  At the time, Sun had no direct involvement as he was still in exile.  Huang was in charge of the revolution that ended over 2000 years of imperial rule in China.  When Sun learned of the successful rebellion against the Qing emperor from press reports, he returned to China from the United States accompanied by his closest foreign advisor, the American, \"General\" Homer Lea.  He met Lea in London, where he and Lea unsuccessfully tried to arrange British financing for the new Chinese republic.  Sun and Lea then sailed for China, arriving there on 21 December 1911.The uprising expanded to the Xinhai Revolution also known as the \"Chinese Revolution\" to overthrow the last Emperor Puyi.  After this event, 10 October became known as the commemoration of Double Ten Day.\n\n\n== Republic of China with multiple governments ==\n\n\n=== Provisional government ===\n\nOn 29 December 1911 a meeting of representatives from provinces in Nanking (Nanjing) elected Sun Yat-sen as the \"provisional president\" (\u81e8\u6642\u5927\u7e3d\u7d71). 1 January 1912 was set as the first day of the First Year of the Republic. Li Yuanhong was made provisional vice-president and Huang Xing became the minister of the army.  The new Provisional Government of the Republic of China was created along with the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China.  Sun is credited for the funding of the revolutions and for keeping the spirit of revolution alive, even after a series of failed uprisings. His successful merger of minor revolutionary groups to a single larger party provided a better base for all those who shared the same ideals.  A number of things were introduced such as the republic calendar system and new fashion like Zhongshan suits.\n\n\n=== Beiyang government ===\n\nYuan Shikai, who controlled the Beiyang Army, the military of northern China, was promised the position of President of the Republic of China if he could get the Qing court to abdicate. On 12 February 1912 Emperor Puyi did abdicate the throne. Sun stepped down as President, and Yuan became the new provisional president in Beijing on 10 March 1912. The provisional government did not have any military forces of its own. Its control over elements of the New Army that had mutinied was limited and there were still significant forces which still had not declared against the Qing.\nSun Yat-sen sent telegrams to the leaders of all provinces requesting them to elect and to establish the National Assembly of the Republic of China in 1912. In May 1912 the legislative assembly moved from Nanjing to Beijing with its 120 members divided between members of Tongmenghui and a Republican party that supported Yuan Shikai. Many revolutionary members were already alarmed by Yuan's ambitions and the northern based Beiyang government.\n\n\n=== Nationalist party and Second Revolution ===\nTongmenghui member Song Jiaoren quickly tried to control the parliament.  He mobilized the old Tongmenghui at the core with the merger of a number of new small parties to form a new political party called the Kuomintang (Chinese nationalist party, commonly abbreviated as \"KMT\") on 25 August 1912 at Huguang Guild Hall Beijing. The 1912\u20131913 National assembly election was considered a huge success for the KMT winning 269 of the 596 seats in the lower house and 123 of the 274 senate seats. In retaliation the national party leader Song Jiaoren was assassinated, almost certainly by a secret order of Yuan, on 20 March 1913. The Second Revolution took place where Sun and KMT military forces tried to overthrow Yuan's forces of about 80,000 men in an armed conflict in July 1913. The revolt against Yuan was unsuccessful. In August 1913, Sun Yat-sen fled to Japan, where he later enlisted financial aid via politician and industrialist Fusanosuke Kuhara.\n\n\n=== Political chaos ===\nIn 1915 Yuan Shikai proclaimed the Empire of China (1915\u20131916) with himself as Emperor of China.  Sun took part in the Anti-Monarchy war of the Constitutional Protection Movement, while also supporting bandit leaders like Bai Lang during the Bai Lang Rebellion.  This marked the beginning of the Warlord Era.  In 1915 Sun wrote to the Second International, a socialist-based organization in Paris, asking it to send a team of specialists to help China set up the world's first socialist republic. At the time there were many theories and proposals of what China could be. In the political mess, both Sun Yat-sen and Xu Shichang were announced as President of the Republic of China.\n\n\n== Path to Northern Expedition ==\n\n\n=== Guangzhou militarist government ===\n\nChina had become divided among regional military leaders. Sun saw the danger of this and returned to China in 1917 to advocate Chinese reunification.  In 1921 he started a self-proclaimed military government in Guangzhou and was elected Grand Marshal. Between 1912 and 1927 three governments had been set up in South China: the Provisional government in Nanjing (1912), the Military government in Guangzhou (1921\u20131925), and the National government in Guangzhou and later Wuhan (1925\u20131927). The government in the South was established to rival the Beiyang government in the north. Yuan Shikai had banned the KMT.  The short lived Chinese Revolutionary Party was a temporary replacement for the KMT.  On 10 October 1919 Sun resurrected the KMT with the new name Chung-kuo Kuomintang, or the \"Nationalist Party of China\".\n\n\n=== KMT\u2013CPC cooperation ===\n\nBy this time Sun had become convinced that the only hope for a unified China lay in a military conquest from his base in the south, followed by a period of political tutelage that would culminate in the transition to democracy.  In order to hasten the conquest of China, he began a policy of active cooperation with the Communist Party of China (CPC).  Sun and the Soviet Union's Adolph Joffe signed the Sun-Joffe Manifesto in January 1923. Sun received help from the Comintern for his acceptance of communist members into his KMT.  Revolutionary and socialist leader Vladimir Lenin praised Sun and the KMT for their ideology and principles. Lenin praised Sun and his attempts at social reformation, and also congratulated him for fighting foreign Imperialism. Sun also returned the praise, calling him a \"great man\", and sent his congratulations on the revolution in Russia.With the Soviets' help, Sun was able to develop the military power needed for the Northern Expedition against the military at the north.  He established the Whampoa Military Academy near Guangzhou with Chiang Kai-shek as the commandant of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA). Other Whampoa leaders include Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin as political instructors.  This full collaboration was called the First United Front.\n\n\n=== Finance concerns ===\nIn 1924 Sun appointed his brother-in-law T. V. Soong to set up the first Chinese Central bank called the Canton Central Bank. To establish national capitalism and a banking system was a major objective for the KMT. However Sun was not without some opposition as there was the Canton volunteers corps uprising against him.\n\n\n=== Final speeches ===\n\nIn February 1923 Sun made a presentation to the Students' Union in Hong Kong University and declared that it was the corruption of China and the peace, order and good government of Hong Kong that turned him into a revolutionary. This same year, he delivered a speech in which he proclaimed his Three Principles of the People as the foundation of the country and the Five-Yuan Constitution as the guideline for the political system and bureaucracy. Part of the speech was made into the National Anthem of the Republic of China.\nOn 10 November 1924, Sun traveled north to Tianjin and delivered a speech to suggest a gathering for a \"national conference\" for the Chinese people.  It called for the end of warlord rules and the abolition of all unequal treaties with the Western powers. Two days later, he traveled to Beijing to discuss the future of the country, despite his deteriorating health and the ongoing civil war of the warlords. Among the people he met was the Muslim General Ma Fuxiang, who informed Sun that they would welcome his leadership. On 28 November 1924 Sun traveled to Japan and gave a speech on Pan-Asianism at Kobe, Japan.\n\n\n=== Illness and death ===\nFor many years, it was popularly believed that Sun died of liver cancer. On 26 January 1925, Sun underwent an exploratory laparotomy at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) to investigate a long-term illness. This was performed by the head of the Department of Surgery, Adrian S. Taylor, who stated that the procedure \"revealed extensive involvement of the liver by carcinoma\" and that Sun only had about ten days to live. Sun was hospitalized and his condition was treated with radium. Sun survived the initial ten-day period and on 18 February, against the advice of doctors, he was transferred to the KMT headquarters and treated with traditional Chinese medicine. This too was unsuccessful and he died on 12 March at the age of 58. Contemporary reports in The New York Times, Time, and the Chinese newspaper Qun Qiang Bao all reported the cause of death as liver cancer, based on Taylor's observation.Following this the body then was preserved in mineral oil and taken to the Temple of Azure Clouds, a Buddhist shrine in the Western Hills a few miles outside of Beijing. He also left a short political will (\u7e3d\u7406\u907a\u56d1) penned by Wang Jingwei, which had a widespread influence in the subsequent development of the Republic of China and Taiwan.In 1926, construction began on a majestic mausoleum at the foot of Purple Mountain in Nanjing, and this was completed in the spring of 1929. On 1 June 1929, Sun's remains were moved from Beijing and interred in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.\nBy pure chance, in May 2016, an American pathologist named Rolf F. Barth was visiting the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou when he noticed a faded copy of the original autopsy report on display. The autopsy was performed immediately after Sun's death by James Cash, a pathologist at PUMCH. Based on a tissue sample, Cash concluded that the cause of death was an adenocarcinoma in the gallbladder that had metastasized to the liver. In modern China, liver cancer is far more common than gallbladder cancer and although the incidence rates of either in 1925 are not known, if one assumes that they were similar at that time, then the original diagnosis by Taylor was a logical conclusion. From the time of Sun's death until the appearance of Barth's report in the Chinese Journal of Cancer in September 2016 (now known as Cancer Communications since 1 March 2018), the true cause of death of Sun Yat-sen was not reported in any English-language publication. Even in Chinese-language sources, it only appeared in one non-medical online report in 2013.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Power struggle ===\n\nAfter Sun's death, a power struggle between his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chiang Kai-shek and his old revolutionary comrade Wang Jingwei split the KMT. At stake in this struggle was the right to lay claim to Sun's ambiguous legacy. In 1927 Chiang Kai-shek married Soong Mei-ling, a sister of Sun's widow Soong Ching-ling, and subsequently he could claim to be a brother-in-law of Sun. When the Communists and the Kuomintang split in 1927, marking the start of the Chinese Civil War, each group claimed to be his true heirs, a conflict that continued through World War II.  Sun's widow, Soong Ching-ling, sided with the Communists during the Chinese Civil War and served from 1949 to 1981 as Vice-President (or Vice-Chairwoman) of the People's Republic of China and as Honorary President shortly before her death in 1981.\n\n\n=== Cult of personality ===\nA personality cult in the Republic of China was centered on Sun and his successor, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Chinese Muslim Generals and Imams participated in this cult of personality and one party state, with Muslim General Ma Bufang making people bow to Sun's portrait and listen to the national anthem during a Tibetan and Mongol religious ceremony for the Qinghai Lake God. Quotes from the Quran and Hadith were used among Hui Muslims to justify Chiang Kai-shek's rule over China.The Kuomintang's constitution designated Sun as party president.  After his death, the Kuomintang opted to keep that language in its constitution to honor his memory forever.  The party has since been headed by a director-general (1927\u20131975) and a chairman (since 1975), which discharge the functions of the president.\n\n\n=== Father of the Nation ===\n\nSun Yat-sen remains unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for having a high reputation both in mainland China and in Taiwan. In Taiwan, he is seen as the Father of the Republic of China, and is known by the posthumous name Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Zhongshan (Chinese: \u570b\u7236\u3000\u5b6b\u4e2d\u5c71\u5148\u751f, where the one-character space is a traditional homage symbol). His likeness is still almost always found in ceremonial locations such as in front of legislatures and classrooms of public schools, from elementary to senior high school, and he continues to appear in new coinage and currency.\n\n\n=== \"Forerunner of the revolution\" ===\nOn the mainland, Sun is seen as a Chinese nationalist, proto-socialist, first president of a Republican China and is highly regarded as the Forerunner of the Revolution (\u9769\u547d\u5148\u884c\u8005). He is even mentioned by name in the preamble to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. In recent years, the leadership of the Communist Party of China has increasingly invoked Sun, partly as a way of bolstering Chinese nationalism in light of Chinese economic reform and partly to increase connections with supporters of the Kuomintang on Taiwan which the PRC sees as allies against Taiwan independence. Sun's tomb was one of the first stops made by the leaders of both the Kuomintang and the People First Party on their pan-blue visit to mainland China in 2005. A massive portrait of Sun continues to appear in Tiananmen Square for May Day and National Day.\n\n\n=== Economic development ===\nSun Yat-sen spent years in Hawaii as a student in the late 1870s and early 1880s, and was highly impressed with the economic development he saw there. He used the independent Kingdom of Hawaii as a model to develop his vision of a technologically modern and politically independent and actively anti-imperialist China. Sun Yat-sen was an important pioneer of international development, proposing  in the 1920s international institutions of the sort that appeared after World War II.  He focused on China, with its vast potential and weak base of mostly local entrepreneurs. \nHis key proposal was socialism. He proposed:\n\nThe State will take over all the large enterprises; we shall encourage and protect enterprises which may reasonably be entrusted to the people; the nation will possess equality with other nations; every Chinese will be equal to every other Chinese both politically and in his opportunities of economic advancement.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nSun Yat-sen was born to Sun Dacheng (\u5b6b\u9054\u6210) and his wife, Lady Yang (\u694a\u6c0f) on 12 November 1866. At the time his father was age 53, while his mother was 38 years old.  He had an older brother, Sun Dezhang (\u5b6b\u5fb7\u5f70), and an older sister, Sun Jinxing (\u5b6b\u91d1\u661f), who died at the early age of 4.  Another older brother, Sun Deyou (\u5b6b\u5fb7\u7950), died at the age of 6.  He also had an older sister, Sun Miaoqian (\u5b6b\u5999\u831c), and a younger sister, Sun Qiuqi (\u5b6b\u79cb\u7dba).At age 20, Sun had an arranged marriage with fellow villager Lu Muzhen. She bore a son, Sun Fo, and two daughters, Sun Jinyuan (\u5b6b\u91d1\u5a9b) and Sun Jinwan (\u5b6b\u91d1\u5a49). Sun Fo was the grandfather of Leland Sun, who spent 37 years working in Hollywood as an actor and stuntman. Sun Yat-sen was also the godfather of Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger, American author and poet who wrote under the name Cordwainer Smith.Sun's first concubine, the Hong Kong-born Chen Cuifen, lived in Taiping, Perak, Malaysia for 17 years. The couple adopted a local girl as their daughter. Cuifen subsequently relocated to China, where she died.On 25 October 1915 in Japan, Sun married Soong Ching-ling, one of the Soong sisters, Soong Ching-Ling's father was the American-educated Methodist minister Charles Soong, who made a fortune in banking and in printing of Bibles. Although Charles Soong had been a personal friend of Sun's, he was enraged when Sun announced his intention to marry Ching-ling because while Sun was a Christian he kept two wives, Lu Muzhen and Kaoru Otsuki; Soong viewed Sun's actions as running directly against their shared religion.\nSoong Ching-Ling's sister, Soong Mei-ling, later married Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\n\n\n=== Memorials and structures in Asia ===\n\nIn most major Chinese cities one of the main streets is named Zhongshan Lu (\u4e2d\u5c71\u8def) to celebrate his memory. There are also numerous parks, schools, and geographical features named after him. Xiangshan, Sun's hometown in Guangdong, was renamed Zhongshan in his honor, and there is a hall dedicated to his memory at the Temple of Azure Clouds in Beijing. There are also a series of Sun Yat-sen stamps.\nOther references to Sun include the Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou and National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung. Other structures include Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall subway station, Sun Yat-sen house in Nanjing, Dr. Sun Yat-sen Museum in Hong Kong, Chung-Shan Building, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall in Singapore. Zhongshan Memorial Middle School has also been a name used by many schools. Zhongshan Park is also a common name used for a number of places named after him.  The first highway in Taiwan is called the Sun Yat-sen expressway. Two ships are also named after him, the Chinese gunboat Chung Shan and Chinese cruiser Yat Sen. The old Chinatown in Calcutta (now known as Kolkata), India has a prominent street by the name of Sun Yat-sen street. There are also two streets named after Sun Yat-sen, located in the cities of Astrakhan and Ufa, Russia.\nIn George Town, Penang, Malaysia, the Penang Philomatic Union had its premises at 120 Armenian Street in 1910, during the time when Sun spent more than four months in Penang, convened the historic \"Penang Conference\" to launch the fundraising campaign for the Huanghuagang Uprising and founded the Kwong Wah Yit Poh; this house, which has been preserved as the Sun Yat-sen Museum (formerly called the Sun Yat Sen Penang Base), was visited by President designate Hu Jintao in 2002. The Penang Philomatic Union subsequently moved to a bungalow at 65 Macalister Road which has been preserved as the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Centre Penang.\nAs dedication, the 1966 Chinese Cultural Renaissance was launched on Sun's birthday on 12 November.The Nanyang Wan Qing Yuan in Singapore have since been preserved and renamed as the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall. A Sun Yat-sen heritage trail was also launched on 20 November 2010 in Penang.Sun's US citizen Hawaii birth certificate that show he was not born in the ROC, but instead born in the US was on public display at the American Institute in Taiwan on US Independence day 4 July 2011.A street in Medan, Indonesia is named \"Jalan Sun Yat-Sen\" in honour of him.A street named \"T\u00f4n D\u1eadt Ti\u00ean\" (Sino-Vietnamese name for Sun Yat-Sen) is located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Memorials and structures outside of Asia ===\n\nSt. John's University in New York City has a facility built in 1973, the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall, built to resemble a traditional Chinese building in honor of Sun. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden is located in Vancouver, the largest classical Chinese gardens outside of Asia.  There is the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Park in Chinatown, Honolulu. On the island of Maui, there is the little Sun Yat-sen Park at Kamaole.  It is located near to where his older brother had a ranch on the slopes of Haleakala in the Kula region.In Chinatown, Los Angeles, there is a seated statue of him in Central Plaza. In Sacramento, California there is a bronze statue of Sun in front of the Chinese Benevolent Association of Sacramento. Another statue of Sun Yat-sen by Joe Rosenthal can be found at Riverdale Park in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. There is also the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. In Chinatown, San Francisco, there is a 12-foot statue of him on Saint Mary's Square.In late 2011, the Chinese Youth Society of Melbourne, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, unveiled, in a Lion Dance Blessing ceremony, a memorial statue of Sun outside the Chinese Museum in Melbourne's Chinatown, on the spot where their traditional Chinese New Year Lion Dance always ends.\n\nIn 1993 Lily Sun, one of Sun Yat-sen's granddaughters, donated books, photographs, artwork and other memorabilia to the Kapi'olani Community College library as part of the \"Sun Yat-sen Asian collection\". During October and November every year the entire collection is shown. In 1997 the \"Dr Sun Yat-sen Hawaii foundation\" was formed online as a virtual library. In 2006 the NASA Mars Exploration Rover Spirit labeled one of the hills explored \"Zhongshan\".The plaque shown earlier in this article is by Dora Gordine, and is situated on the site of Sun's lodgings in London in 1896, 8 Grays Inn Place.  There is also a blue plaque commemorating Sun at The Kennels, Cottered, Hertfordshire, the country home of the Cantlies where Sun came to recuperate after his rescue from the legation in 1896.A street named Sun Yat-Sen Avenue is located in Markham, Ontario. This is the first such street name outside of Asia.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Opera ===\n\nDr. Sun Yat-sen (\u4e2d\u5c71\u9038\u4ed9; Zh\u014dngSh\u0101n y\u00ec xi\u0101n) is a 2011 Chinese-language western-style opera in three acts by the New York-based American composer Huang Ruo who was born in China and is a graduate of Oberlin College's Conservatory as well as the Juilliard School. The libretto was written by Candace Mui-ngam Chong, a recent collaborator with playwright David Henry Hwang. It was performed in Hong Kong in October 2011 and was given its North American premiere on 26 July 2014 at The Santa Fe Opera.\n\n\n=== TV series and films ===\nThe life of Sun is portrayed in various films, mainly The Soong Sisters and Road to Dawn. A fictionalized assassination attempt on his life was featured in Bodyguards and Assassins. He is also portrayed during his struggle to overthrow the Qing dynasty in Once Upon a Time in China II.  The TV series Towards the Republic features Ma Shaohua as Sun Yat-sen.  In the 100th anniversary tribute of the film 1911, Winston Chao played Sun. In Space: Above and Beyond, one of the starships of the China Navy is named the Sun Yat-sen.\n\n\n=== Performances ===\nIn 2010, a theatrical play Yellow Flower on Slopes (\u659c\u8def\u9ec3\u82b1) was created and performed.\nIn 2011, there is also a Mandopop group called \"Zhongsan Road 100\" (\u4e2d\u5c71\u8def100\u865f) known for singing the song \"Our Father of the Nation\" (\u6211\u5011\u570b\u7236).\n\n\n== Controversy ==\n\n\n=== New Three Principles of the People ===\nAt one time CPC general secretary and PRC president Jiang Zemin claimed that Sun Yat-sen advocated a movement known as the \"New Three Principles of the People\" (\u65b0\u4e09\u6c11\u4e3b\u7fa9) which consisted of \"working with the soviets, working with the communists and helping the farmers\" (\u806f\u4fc4, \u806f\u5171, \u6276\u52a9\u5de5\u8fb2). In 2001 Lily Sun said that the CPC was distorting Sun's legacy.  She then voiced her displeasure in 2002 in a private letter to Jiang about the distortion of history. In 2008 Jiang Zemin was willing to offer US$10 million to sponsor a Xinhai Revolution anniversary celebration event.  According to Ming Pao she could not take the money because she would no longer have the freedom to communicate about the revolution. This concept is still currently available on Baike Baidu.\n\n\n=== KMT emblem removal case ===\nIn 1981, Lily Sun took a trip to Sun Yat-sen mausoleum in Nanjing, People's Republic of China. The emblem of the KMT had been removed from the top of his sacrificial hall at the time of her visit, but was later restored. On another visit in May 2011, she was surprised to find the four characters \"General Rules of Meetings\" (\u6703\u8b70\u901a\u5247), a document that Sun wrote in reference to Robert's Rules of Order had been removed from a stone carving.\n\n\n=== Father of Independent Taiwan issue ===\n\nIn November 2004, the ROC Ministry of Education proposed that Sun Yat-sen was not the father of Taiwan.  Instead, Sun was a foreigner from mainland China. Taiwanese Education minister Tu Cheng-sheng and Examination Yuan member Lin Yu-ti, both of whom supported the proposal, had their portraits pelted with eggs in protest. At a Sun Yat-sen statue in Kaohsiung, a 70-year-old ROC retired soldier committed suicide as a way to protest the ministry proposal on the anniversary of Sun's birthday 12 November.\n\n\n== Works ==\nThe Outline of National Reconstruction/Chien Kuo Ta Kang (1918)\nThe Fundamentals of National Reconstruction/Jianguo fanglue (1924)\nThe Principle of Nationalism (1953)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nChiang Kai-shek\nChinese Anarchism\nHistory of the Republic of China\nPolitics of the Republic of China\nSun Yat-sen Museum Penang\nUnited States Constitution and worldwide influence\nZhongshan suit\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBerg\u00e8re, Marie-Claire (2000).

In theory, a part of Guangdong province also belongs to the diocese, but in practice, the diocese is limited to Macau.\nIts cathedral is the Cathedral of the Nativity of Our Lady.\nIts patron saints are Francis Xavier and Catherine of Siena, and its motto is Scientia et Virtus (Knowledge and Virtue).\nStephen Lee Bun-sang is the current bishop and the third Chinese bishop of the diocese.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was established on January 23, 1576 by the edict of Pope Gregory XIII, on vast territory split off from Roman Catholic Diocese of Malacca. It originally covered China, Japan, Vietnam and the Malay archipelago, with the exception of the Philippines. From its founding, the diocese was a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese (soon Patriarchate) of Goa, in Portuguese India.\nIt gradually lost most of its territory, in and around continental China:\n\non February 19, 1588 to establish the Diocese of Funai (Japan)\non September 9, 1659 to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Tonkin, the Apostolic Vicariate of Cochinchina (both in Vietnam), and Apostolic Vicariate of Nanjing\non April 22, 1841 to establish the then-Apostolic Prefecture of Hong Kong\non May 10, 1848 to establish the then-Apostolic Vicariate of Guangdong-Guangxi\non April 9, 1940 to establish the Diocese of D\u00edli (on Timor)It was made exempt in 1975, following Portugal's loss of sovereignty over Goa, its former Metropolitan.\nIt now only administers Macau alone, the last regions outside Macau under its administration were the parishes of Saint Joseph in Singapore (re-united with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore c. 1972) and St. Peter's Church in Malacca (now as part of Roman Catholic Diocese of Malacca-Johor), which separated from the Diocese of Macau in 1981.\n\n\n== Bishops ==\n\n\n=== Bishops of Macau ===\nDiego N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Figueroa (1576-1578); never consecrated\nLeonardo Fernandes de S\u00e1, O.Cist.

          "I've been here for the Sunday mass in the evening and the church was packed as if it was in the heart of Lisboa on Christmas or Easter. The interior of the church is very rich in statues and paintings. It's extremely well maintained and clean. It's worth the detour for a quick",

          "The Cathedral locates in a narrow and somehow noisy street corner in TAIPA. If you do not look for it carefully, you may miss it. The Cathedral is more likely to be a historical remaining of the Portuguese dominating in the Macau history. The Cathedral contains two floors and",
          "In my opinion, some of the best places in the world to really experience art, aren't museums at all, but churches. In fact, any location where art remains in its original place, still serving its original function. It provides an experience unlike anything else in my experience.",

        "wiki": "Francis Xavier (born Francisco de Jasso y Azpilicueta; Latin Franciscus Xaverius; Basque: Frantzisko Xabierkoa; Spanish: Francisco Javier; Portuguese: Francisco Xavier; April 7, 1506 \u2013 December 3, 1552), venerated as Saint Francis Xavier, was a Navarrese Catholic priest, missionary and saint who was the co-founder of the Society of Jesus.\nBorn in Javier (Xavier in Old Spanish and in Navarro-Aragonese), Kingdom of Navarre (in present-day Spain), he was a companion of Ignatius of Loyola and one of the first seven Jesuits who took vows of poverty and chastity at Montmartre, Paris, in 1534. He led an extensive mission into Asia, mainly in the Portuguese Empire of the time and was influential in evangelization work, most notably in India. Although some sources claim that the Goa Inquisition was proposed by Francis Xavier, his letter to the king of Portugal, John III, asked for a special minister whose sole office would be to further Christianity in Goa. He also was the first Christian missionary to venture into Japan, Borneo, the Maluku Islands, and other areas. In those areas, struggling to learn the local languages and in the face of opposition, he had less success than he had enjoyed in India. Xavier was about to extend his missionary preaching to China when he died on Shangchuan Island.\nHe was beatified by Pope Paul V on 25 October 1619 and canonized by Pope Gregory XV on 12 March 1622. In 1624 he was made co-patron of Navarre. Known as the \"Apostle of the Indies\" and \"Apostle of Japan\", he is considered to be one of the greatest missionaries since Paul the Apostle. In 1927, Pope Pius XI published the decree \"Apostolicorum in Missionibus\" naming Francis Xavier, along with Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, co-patron of all foreign missions. He is now co-patron saint of Navarre with Fermin. The Day of Navarre in Navarre, Spain, marks the anniversary of Francis Xavier's death, on 3 December 1552.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nFrancis Xavier was born in the royal castle of Xavier, in the Kingdom of Navarre, on 7 April 1506 according to a family register. He was the youngest son of Juan de Jasso y Atondo, seneschal of Xavier castle, who belonged to a prosperous farming family and had acquired a doctorate in law at the University of Bologna. Basque and Romance were his two mother tongues. Juan later became privy counsellor and finance minister to King John III of Navarre (Jean d'Albret). Francis's mother was Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda de Azpilcueta y Azn\u00e1rez, sole heiress of two noble Navarrese families. He was through her related to the great theologian and philosopher Mart\u00edn de Azpilcueta.In 1512, Ferdinand, King of Aragon and regent of Castile, invaded Navarre, initiating a war that lasted over 18 years. Three years later, Francis's father died when Francis was only nine years old. In 1516, Francis's brothers participated in a failed Navarrese-French attempt to expel the Spanish invaders from the kingdom. The Spanish Governor, Cardinal Cisneros, confiscated the family lands, demolished the outer wall, the gates, and two towers of the family castle, and filled in the moat. In addition, the height of the keep was reduced by half. Only the family residence inside the castle was left. In 1522 one of Francis's brothers participated with 200 Navarrese nobles in dogged but failed resistance against the Castilian Count of Miranda in Amaiur, Baztan, the last Navarrese territorial position south of the Pyrenees.\nIn 1525, Francis went to study in Paris at the Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe, University of Paris, where he would spend the next eleven years. In the early days he acquired some reputation as an athlete and a high-jumper.In 1529, Francis shared lodgings with his friend Pierre Favre. A new student, Ignatius of Loyola, came to room with them. At 38, Ignatius was much older than Pierre and Francis, who were both 23 at the time. Ignatius convinced Pierre to become a priest, but was unable to convince Francis, who had aspirations of worldly advancement. At first Francis regarded the new lodger as a joke and was sarcastic about his efforts to convert students. When Pierre left their lodgings to visit his family and Ignatius was alone with Francis, he was able to slowly break down Francis's resistance. According to most biographies Ignatius is said to have posed the question: \"What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\" However, according to James Broderick such method is not characteristic of Ignatius and there is no evidence that he employed it at all.In 1530 Francis received the degree of Master of Arts, and afterwards taught Aristotelian philosophy at Beauvais College, University of Paris.\n\n\n== Missionary work ==\n\nOn 15 August 1534, seven students met in a crypt beneath the Church of Saint Denis (now Saint Pierre de Montmartre), on the hill of Montmartre, overlooking Paris. They were Francis, Ignatius of Loyola, Alfonso Salmeron, Diego La\u00ednez, Nicol\u00e1s Bobadilla from Spain, Peter Faber from Savoy, and Sim\u00e3o Rodrigues from Portugal. They made private vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience to the Pope, and also vowed to go to the Holy Land to convert infidels. Francis began his study of theology in 1534 and was ordained on 24 June 1537.\nIn 1539, after long discussions, Ignatius drew up a formula for a new religious order, the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits). Ignatius's plan for the order was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540.In 1540 King John of Portugal had Pedro Mascarenhas, Portuguese ambassador to the Holy See, request Jesuit missionaries to spread the faith in his new possessions in India, where the king believed that Christian values were eroding among the Portuguese. After successive appeals to the Pope asking for missionaries for the East Indies under the Padroado agreement, John III was encouraged by Diogo de Gouveia, rector of the Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe, to recruit the newly graduated students that would establish the Society of Jesus.\n\nIgnatius promptly appointed Nicholas Bobadilla and Sim\u00e3o Rodrigues. At the last moment, however, Bobadilla became seriously ill. With some hesitance and uneasiness, Ignatius asked Francis to go in Bobadilla's place. Thus, Francis Xavier began his life as the first Jesuit missionary almost accidentally.Leaving Rome on 15 March 1540, in the Ambassador's train, Francis took with him a breviary, a catechism, and De Institutione bene vivendi by Croatian humanist Marko Maruli\u0107, a Latin book that had become popular in the Counter-Reformation. According to a 1549 letter of F. Balthasar Gago from Goa, it was the only book that Francis read or studied. Francis reached Lisbon in June 1540 and, four days after his arrival, he and Rodrigues were summoned to a private audience with the King and the Queen.Francis Xavier devoted much of his life to missions in Asia, mainly in four centres: Malacca, Amboina and Ternate, Japan, and off-shore China. His growing information about new places indicated to him that he had to go to what he understood were centres of influence for the whole region. China loomed large from his days in India. Japan was particularly attractive because of its culture. For him, these areas were interconnected; they could not be evangelised separately.\n\n\n=== Goa and India ===\nFrancis Xavier left Lisbon on 7 April 1541, his thirty-fifth birthday, along with two other Jesuits and the new viceroy Martim Afonso de Sousa, on board the Santiago. As he departed, Francis was given a brief from the pope appointing him apostolic nuncio to the East. From August until March 1542 he remained in Portuguese Mozambique, and arrived in Goa, then capital of Portuguese India, on 6 May 1542, thirteen months after leaving Lisbon.\nThe Portuguese, following quickly on the great voyages of discovery, had established themselves at Goa thirty years earlier. Francis's primary mission, as ordered by King John III, was to restore Christianity among the Portuguese settlers. According to Teotonio R. DeSouza, recent critical accounts indicate that apart from the posted civil servants, \"the great majority of those who were dispatched as 'discoverers' were the riff-raff of Portuguese society, picked up from Portuguese jails.\" Nor did the soldiers, sailors, or merchants come to do missionary work, and Imperial policy permitted the outflow of disaffected nobility. Many of the arrivals formed liaisons with local women and adopted Indian culture. Missionaries often wrote against the \"scandalous and undisciplined\" behaviour of their fellow Christians.The Christian population had churches, clergy, and a bishop, but there were few preachers and no priests beyond the walls of Goa. The Velliapura family of Velim, Goa, of the St Thomas Christians sect, welcomed the missionaries. Xavier decided that he must begin by instructing the Portuguese themselves, and gave much of his time to the teaching of children. The first five months he spent in preaching and ministering to the sick in the hospitals. After that, he walked through the streets ringing a bell to summon the children and servants to catechism. He was invited to head Saint Paul's College, a pioneer seminary for the education of secular priests, which became the first Jesuit headquarters in Asia.\n\nXavier soon learned that along the Pearl Fishery Coast, which extends from Cape Comorin on the southern tip of India to the island of Mannar, off Ceylon (Sri Lanka), there was a J\u0101ti of people called Paravas. Many of them had been baptised ten years before, merely to please the Portuguese who had helped them against the Moors, but remained uninstructed in the faith. Accompanied by several native clerics from the seminary at Goa, he set sail for Cape Comorin in October 1542. He taught those who had already been baptised, and preached to those who weren't. His efforts with the high-caste Brahmins remained unavailing.He devoted almost three years to the work of preaching to the people of southern India and Ceylon, converting many. He built nearly 40 churches along the coast, including St. Stephen's Church, Kombuthurai, mentioned in his letters dated 1544.\nDuring this time, he was able to visit the tomb of Thomas the Apostle in Mylapore (now part of Madras/Chennai then in Portuguese India). He set his sights eastward in 1545 and planned a missionary journey to Makassar on the island of Celebes (today's Indonesia).\nAs the first Jesuit in India, Francis had difficulty achieving much success in his missionary trips. His successors, such as de Nobili, Matteo Ricci, and Beschi, attempted to convert the noblemen first as a means to influence more people, while Francis had initially interacted most with the lower classes; (later though, in Japan, Francis changed tack by paying tribute to the Emperor and seeking an audience with him).\n\n\n=== South East Asia ===\nIn the spring of 1545 Xavier started for Portuguese Malacca. He laboured there for the last months of that year. About January 1546, Xavier left Malacca for the Maluku Islands, where the Portuguese had some settlements. For a year and a half he preached the Gospel there. He went first to Ambon Island, where he stayed until mid-June. He then visited other Maluku Islands, including Ternate, Baranura, and Morotai. Shortly after Easter 1547, he returned to Ambon Island; a few months later he returned to Malacca.\n\n\n=== Japan ===\n\nIn Malacca in December 1547, Francis Xavier met a Japanese man named Anjir\u014d. Anjir\u014d had heard of Francis in 1545 and had travelled from Kagoshima to Malacca to meet him. Having been charged with murder, Anjir\u014d had fled Japan. He told Francis extensively about his former life, and the customs and culture of his homeland.  Anjir\u014d became the first Japanese Christian and adopted the name of 'Paulo de Santa F\u00e9'.  He later helped Xavier as a mediator and interpreter for the mission to Japan that now seemed much more possible.\nIn January 1548 Francis returned to Goa to attend to his responsibilities as superior of the mission there. The next 15 months were occupied with various journeys and administrative measures. He left Goa on 15 April 1549, stopped at Malacca, and visited Canton. He was accompanied by Anjiro, two other Japanese men, Father Cosme de Torr\u00e8s and Brother Juan Fern\u00e1ndez. He had taken with him presents for the \"King of Japan\" since he was intending to introduce himself as the Apostolic Nuncio.\n\nEuropeans had already come to Japan: the Portuguese had landed in 1543 on the island of Tanegashima, where they introduced matchlock firearms to Japan.From Amboina, he wrote to his companions in Europe: \"I asked a Portuguese merchant, ... who had been for many days in Anjir\u014d's country of Japan, to give me ... some information on that land and its people from what he had seen and heard. ...All the Portuguese merchants coming from Japan tell me that if I go there I shall do great service for God our Lord, more than with the pagans of India, for they are a very reasonable people. (To His Companions Residing in Rome, From Cochin, 20 January 1548, no. 18, p. 178).Francis Xavier reached Japan on 27 July 1549, with Anjiro and three other Jesuits, but he was not permitted to enter any port his ship arrived at until 15 August, when he went ashore at Kagoshima, the principal port of Satsuma Province on the island of Ky\u016bsh\u016b. As a representative of the Portuguese king, he was received in a friendly manner. Shimazu Takahisa (1514\u20131571), daimy\u014d of Satsuma, gave a friendly reception to Francis on 29 September 1549, but in the following year he forbade the conversion of his subjects to Christianity under penalty of death; Christians in Kagoshima could not be given any catechism in the following years. The Portuguese missionary Pedro de Alc\u00e1\u00e7ova would later write in 1554:\n\n In Cangoxima, the first place Father Master Francisco stopped at, there were a good number of Christians, although there was no one there to teach them; the shortage of labourers prevented the whole kingdom from becoming Christian. \nHe was hosted by Anjir\u014d's family until October 1550. From October to December 1550, he resided in Yamaguchi. Shortly before Christmas, he left for Kyoto but failed to meet with the Emperor. He returned to Yamaguchi in March 1551, where the daimyo of the province gave him permission to preach. However, lacking fluency in the Japanese language, he had to limit himself to reading aloud the translation of a catechism.Francis was the first Jesuit to go to Japan as a missionary. He brought with him paintings of the Madonna and the Madonna and Child. These paintings were used to help teach the Japanese about Christianity. There was a huge language barrier as Japanese was unlike other languages the missionaries had previously encountered. For a long time Francis struggled to learn the language.Having learned that evangelical poverty did not have the appeal in Japan that it had in Europe and in India, he decided to change his approach. Hearing after a time that a Portuguese ship had arrived at a port in the province of Bungo in Kyushu and that the prince there would like to see him, Xavier now set out southward. The Jesuit, in a fine cassock, surplice, and stole, was attended by thirty gentlemen and as many servants, all in their best clothes. Five of them bore on cushions valuable articles, including a portrait of Our Lady and a pair of velvet slippers, these not gifts for the prince, but solemn offerings to Xavier, to impress the onlookers with his eminence. Handsomely dressed, with his companions acting as attendants, he presented himself before Oshindono, the ruler of Nagate, and as a representative of the great kingdom of Portugal, offered him letters and presents: a musical instrument, a watch, and other attractive objects which had been given him by the authorities in India for the emperor.For forty-five years the Jesuits were the only missionaries in Asia, but the Franciscans also began proselytising in Asia as well. Christian missionaries were later forced into exile, along with their assistants. Some were able to stay behind, however Christianity was then kept underground so as to not be persecuted.The Japanese people were not easily converted; many of the people were already Buddhist or Shinto. Francis tried to combat the disposition of some of the Japanese that a God who had created everything, including evil, could not be good. The concept of Hell was also a struggle; the Japanese were bothered by the idea of their ancestors living in Hell. Despite Francis's different religion, he felt that they were good people, much like Europeans, and could be converted.Xavier was welcomed by the Shingon monks since he used the word Dainichi for the Christian God; attempting to adapt the concept to local traditions. As Xavier learned more about the religious nuances of the word, he changed to Deusu from the Latin and Portuguese Deus. The monks later realised that Xavier was preaching a rival religion and grew more aggressive towards his attempts at conversion.\n\nWith the passage of time, his sojourn in Japan could be considered somewhat fruitful as attested by congregations established in Hirado, Yamaguchi, and Bungo. Xavier worked for more than two years in Japan and saw his successor-Jesuits established. He then decided to return to India. Historians debate the exact path he returned by, but from evidence attributed to the captain of his ship, he may have travelled through Tanegeshima and Minato, and avoided Kagoshima because of the hostility of the daimyo.\n\n\n=== China ===\nDuring his trip from Japan back to India, a tempest forced him to stop on an island near Guangzhou, China, where he met Diogo Pereira, a rich merchant and an old friend from Cochin.  Pereira showed him a letter from Portuguese prisoners in Guangzhou, asking for a Portuguese ambassador to speak to the Chinese Emperor on their behalf. Later during the voyage, he stopped at Malacca on 27 December 1551, and was back in Goa by January 1552.On 17 April he set sail with Diogo Pereira on the Santa Cruz for China. He planned to introduce himself as Apostolic Nuncio and Pereira as ambassador of the King of Portugal. But then he realized that he had forgotten his testimonial letters as an Apostolic Nuncio. Back in Malacca, he was confronted by the captain \u00c1lvaro de Ata\u00edde da Gama who now had total control over the harbour. The captain refused to recognize his title of Nuncio, asked Pereira to resign from his title of ambassador, named a new crew for the ship, and demanded the gifts for the Chinese Emperor be left in Malacca.In late August 1552, the Santa Cruz reached the Chinese island of Shangchuan, 14 km away from the southern coast of mainland China, near Taishan, Guangdong, 200 km south-west of what later became Hong Kong. At this time, he was accompanied only by a Jesuit student, \u00c1lvaro Ferreira, a Chinese man called Ant\u00f3nio, and a Malabar servant called Christopher. Around mid-November he sent a letter saying that a man had agreed to take him to the mainland in exchange for a large sum of money. Having sent back \u00c1lvaro Ferreira, he remained alone with Ant\u00f3nio. He died from a fever at Shangchuan, Taishan, China, on 3 December 1552, while he was waiting for a boat that would take him to mainland China.\n\n\n== Burials and relics ==\n\nXavier was first buried on a beach at Shangchuan Island, Taishan, Guangdong. His body was taken from the island in February 1553 and temporarily buried in St. Paul's church in Portuguese Malacca on 22 March 1553. An open grave in the church now marks the place of Xavier's burial. Pereira came back from Goa, removed the corpse shortly after 15 April 1553, and moved it to his house. On 11 December 1553, Xavier's body was shipped to Goa.\nThe body is now in the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Goa, where it was placed in a glass container encased in a silver casket on 2 December 1637. This casket, constructed by Goan silversmiths between 1636 and 1637, was an exemplary blend of Italian and Indian aesthetic sensibilities. There are 32 silver plates on all the four sides of the casket depicting different episodes from the life of the Xavier:\n\nFrancis lies on the ground with his arms and legs tied, but the cords break miraculously.\nFrancis kisses the ulcer of a patient in a Venetian hospital.\nHe is visited by Jerom as he lies ailing in the hospital of Vicenza.\nA vision about his future apostolate.\nA vision about his sister's prophecy about his fate.\nHe saves the secretary of the Portuguese Ambassador while crossing the Alps.\nHe lifts a sick man who dies after receiving communion but freed from fever.\nHe baptises in Travancore.\nHe resuscitates a boy who died in a well at Cape Comorin.\nHe cures miraculously a man full of sores.\nHe drives away the Badagas in Travancore.\nHe resuscitates three persons: a man who was buried at Coulao; a boy about to be buried at Multao; and a child.\nHe takes money from his empty pockets and gives to a Portuguese at Malyapore.\nA miraculous cure.\nA crab restores his crucifix which had fallen into the sea.\nHe preaches in the island of Moro.\nHe preaches in the sea of Malacca and announces the victory against the enemies.\nHe converts a Portuguese soldier.\nHe helps the dying Vicar of Malacca.\nFrancis kneels down and on his shoulders there rests a child whom he restores to health.\nHe goes from Amanguchi to Macao walking.\nHe cures a dumb and paralytic man in Amanguchi.\nHe cures a deaf Japanese person.\nHe prays in the ship during a storm.\nHe baptises three kings in Cochin.\nHe cures a religious in the college of St. Paul.\nDue to the lack of water, he sweetens the sea water during a voyage.\nThe agony of Francis at Sancian.\nAfter his death he is seen by a lady according to his promise.\nThe body dressed in sacerdotal vestments is exposed for public veneration.\nFrancis levitates as he distributes communion in the College of St. Paul.\nThe body is placed in a niche at Chaul with lighted candles. On the top of this casket there is a cross with two angels. One is holding a burning heart and the other a legend which says, \"Satis est Domine, satis est.\" (It's enough Lord, it's enough)The right forearm, which Xavier used to bless and baptise his converts, was detached by Superior General Claudio Acquaviva in 1614. It has been displayed since in a silver reliquary at the main Jesuit church in Rome, Il Ges\u00f9.\n\nAnother of Xavier's arm bones was brought to Macau where it was kept in a silver reliquary. The relic was destined for Japan but religious persecution there persuaded the church to keep it in Macau's Cathedral of St. Paul. It was subsequently moved to St. Joseph's and in 1978 to the Chapel of St. Francis Xavier on Coloane Island. More recently the relic was moved to St. Joseph's Church.In 2006, on the 500th anniversary of his birth, the Xavier Tomb Monument and Chapel on the Shangchuan Island, in ruins after years of neglect under communist rule in China, was restored with support from the alumni of Wah Yan College, a Jesuit high school in Hong Kong.\nFrom December 2017 to February 2018, Catholic Christian Outreach (CCO) in cooperation with the Jesuits, brought Xavier's right forearm to tour throughout Canada. The faithful, especially university students participating with CCO at Rise Up 2017 in Ottawa, venerated the relics. The tour continued to every city where CCO and/or the Jesuits are present in Canada: Quebec City, St. John's, Halifax, St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish (neither CCO nor the Jesuits are present here), Kingston, Toronto, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Regina, Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria, and Montreal before returning to Ottawa. The relic was then returned to Rome with a Mass of Thanksgiving celebrated by Archbishop Terrence Prendergast at the Church of the Gesu.\n\n\n== Veneration ==\n\n\n=== Beatification and canonization ===\nFrancis Xavier was beatified by Paul V on 25 October 1619, and was canonized by Gregory XV on 12 March 1622, at the same time as Ignatius Loyola. Pius XI proclaimed him the \"Patron of Catholic Missions\". His feast day is 3 December.\n\n\n=== Pilgrimage centres ===\n\n\n==== Goa ====\nSaint Francis Xavier's relics are kept in a silver casket, elevated inside the Bom Jesus Basilica and are exposed (being brought to ground level) generally every ten years, but this is discretionary. The sacred relics went on display starting on 22 November 2014 at the XVII Solemn Exposition. The display closed on 4 January 2015. The previous exposition, the sixteenth, was held from 21 November 2004 to 2 January 2005.\nRelics of Saint Francis Xavier are also found in the Espirito Santo (Holy Spirit) Church, Marg\u00e3o, in Sanv Fransiku Xavierachi Igorz (Church of St. Francis Xavier), Batpal, Canacona, Goa, and at St. Francis Xavier Chapel, Portais, Panjim.\n\n\n==== Other places ====\nOther pilgrimage centres include Xavier's birthplace in Navarra, Church of Il Gesu, Rome, Malacca (where he was buried for 2 years, before being brought to Goa), Sancian (place of death), and more.\nXavier is a major venerated saint in both Sonora and the neighbouring U.S. state of Arizona. In Magdalena de Kino in Sonora, Mexico, in the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena, there is reclining statue of San Francisco Xavier brought by pioneer Jesuit missionary Padre Eusebio Kino in the early 18th century. The statue is said to be miraculous and is the object of pilgrimage for many in the region. Also Mission San Xavier del Bac is a pilgrimage site. The mission is an active parish church ministering to the people of the San Xavier District, Tohono O'odham Nation, and nearby Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\n=== Novena of grace ===\n\nThe Novena of Grace is a popular devotion to Francis Xavier, typically prayed either on the nine days before 3 December, or on 4 March through 12 March (the anniversary of Pope Gregory XV's canonisation of Xavier in 1622). It began with the Italian Jesuit missionary Marcello Mastrilli. Before he could travel to the Far East, Mastrilli was gravely injured in a freak accident after a festive celebration dedicated to the Immaculate Conception in Naples. Delirious and on the verge of death, Mastrilli saw Xavier, who he later said asked him to choose between travelling or death by holding the respective symbols, to which Mastrilli answered, \"I choose that which God wills.\" Upon regaining his health, Mastrilli made his way via Goa and the Philippines to Satsuma, Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate beheaded the missionary in October 1637, after undergoing three days of tortures involving the volcanic sulphurous fumes from Mt. Unzen, known as the Hell mouth or \"pit\" that had supposedly caused an earlier missionary to renounce his faith.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nFrancis Xavier is noteworthy for his missionary work, both as organiser and as pioneer, reputed to have converted more people than anyone else has done since Paul the Apostle. Pope Benedict XVI said of both Ignatius of Loyola and Francis Xavier: \"not only their history which was interwoven for many years from Paris and Rome, but a unique desire \u2013 a unique passion, it could be said \u2013 moved and sustained them through different human events: the passion to give to God-Trinity a glory always greater and to work for the proclamation of the Gospel of Christ to the peoples who had been ignored.\" By consulting with the earlier ancient Christians of St. Thomas in India, Xavier developed Jesuit missionary methods. His success also spurred many Europeans to join the order, as well as become missionaries throughout the world. His personal efforts most affected Christians in India and the East Indies (Indonesia, Malaysia, Timor). India still has numerous Jesuit missions, and many more schools. Xavier also worked to propagate Christianity in China and Japan. However, following the persecutions of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the subsequent closing of Japan to foreigners, the Christians of Japan were forced to go underground to develop an independent Christian culture. Likewise, while Xavier inspired many missionaries to China, Chinese Christians also were forced underground and developed their own Christian culture.\nA small chapel designed by Achille-Antoine Hermitte was completed in 1869 over Xavier's death place on Shangchuan Island, Canton.\nIt was damaged and restored several times, with the most recent restoration in 2006 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of his birth. \nFrancis Xavier is the patron saint of his native Navarre, which celebrates his feast day on 3 December as a government holiday. In addition to Roman Catholic Masses remembering Xavier on that day (now known as the Day of Navarra), celebrations in the surrounding weeks honour the region's cultural heritage. Furthermore, in the 1940s, devoted Catholics instituted the Javierada, an annual day-long pilgrimage (often on foot) from the capital at Pamplona to Xavier, where the Jesuits have built a basilica and museum and restored his family's castle.\n\n\n=== Namesake ===\n\nAs the foremost saint from Navarre and one of the main Jesuit saints, he is much venerated in Spain and the Hispanic countries where Francisco Javier or Javier are common male given names. The alternative spelling Xavier is also popular in the Basque Country, Portugal, Catalonia, Brazil, France, Belgium, and southern Italy. In India, the spelling Xavier is almost always used, and the name is quite common among Christians, especially in Goa and the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka. The names Francisco Xavier, Ant\u00f3nio Xavier, Jo\u00e3o Xavier, Caetano Xavier, Domingos Xavier et cetera, were very common till quite recently in Goa. Fransiskus Xaverius is commonly used as a name for Indonesian Catholics, usually abbreviated as FX. In Austria and Bavaria the name is spelled as Xaver (pronounced (\u02c8k\u0361sa\u02d0f\u0250)) and often used in addition to Francis as Franz-Xaver (frant\u0361s\u02c8k\u0361sa\u02d0f\u0250). Many Catalan men are named for him, often using the two-name combination Francesc Xavier. In English speaking countries, \"Xavier\" until recently was likely to follow \"Francis\"; in the 2000s, however, \"Xavier\" by itself has become more popular than \"Francis\", and since 2001 is now one of the hundred most common male baby names in the U.S.A. Furthermore, the Sevier family name, possibly most famous in the United States for John Sevier, originated from the name Xavier.\nMany churches all over the world, often founded by Jesuits, have been named in honour of Xavier. The many in the United States include the historic St. Francis Xavier Shrine at Warwick, Maryland (founded 1720), and the Basilica of St. Francis Xavier in Dyersville, Iowa. There are also the American educational teaching order Xaverian Brothers, and the Mission San Xavier del Bac in Tucson, Arizona (founded in 1692, and known for its Spanish Colonial architecture).\n\n\n=== In art ===\nRubens painted St Francis Xavier Raising the Dead for a Jesuit church in Antwerp, in which he depicted one of St Francis's many miracles. The Charles Bridge in Prague, Czech Republic, features a statue of Francis Xavier.\nIn front of Oita Station of Oita City, in Oita Prefecture, previously known as Bungo Province in Japan, there is one statue of Francis Xavier.\nThe monument Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos in Bel\u00e9m (Lisbon), Portugal, features a Francis Xavier image.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nMarc-Antoine Charpentier, In honorem Sancti Xaverij canticum H 355, for soloists, chorus, flutes, strings and continuo (1688 ?)\nMarc-Antoine Charpentier, Canticum de Sto Xavierio  H 355 a, for soloists, chorus, flutes, oboes, strings and continuo 1690.\n\n\n=== Missionary ===\nShortly before leaving for the East, Xavier issued a famous instruction to Father Gaspar Barazeuz who was leaving to go to Ormuz (a kingdom on an island in the Persian Gulf, formerly attached to the Empire of Persia, now part of Iran), that he should mix with sinners:\n\n And if you wish to bring forth much fruit, both for yourselves and for your neighbours, and to live consoled, converse with sinners, making them unburden themselves to you. These are the living books by which you are to study, both for your preaching and for your own consolation. I do not say that you should not on occasion read written books... to support what you say against vices with authorities from the Holy Scriptures and examples from the lives of the saints.\nModern scholars place the number of people converted to Christianity by Francis Xavier at around 30,000. And while some of Xavier's methods have been since criticised (he forced converts to take Portuguese names and dress in Western clothes, approved the persecution of the Eastern Church, and used the Goa government as a missionary tool), he has also earned praise. He insisted that missionaries adapt to many of the customs, and most certainly the language, of the culture they wish to evangelise. And unlike later missionaries, Xavier supported an educated native clergy. Though for a time it seemed his work in Japan was subsequently destroyed by persecution, Protestant missionaries three centuries later discovered that approximately 100,000 Christians still practised in the Nagasaki area.Francis Xavier's work initiated permanent change in eastern Indonesia, and he was known as the \"Apostle of the Indies\" where in 1546\u20131547 he worked in the Maluku Islands among the people of Ambon, Ternate, and Morotai (or Moro), and laid the foundations for a permanent mission. After he left the Maluku Islands, others carried on his work and by the 1560s there were 10,000 Roman Catholics in the area, mostly on Ambon. By the 1590s there were 50,000 to 60,000.\n\n\n=== Role in the Goa Inquisition ===\nThe role of Francis Xavier in the Goa Inquisition is controversial. He had written to King Jo\u00e3o III of Portugal in 1546, encouraging him to dispatch the Inquisition to Goa. Francis Xavier died in 1552 without living to see the horrors of the Goa Inquisition, but some historians believe that he was aware of the Portuguese Inquisition's brutality. In an interview to an Indian newspaper, historian Teot\u00f3nio de Souza stated that Francis Xavier and Sim\u00e3o Rodrigues, another founder-member of the Society of Jesus, were together in Lisbon before Francis left for India. Both were asked to assist spiritually the prisoners of the Inquisition and were present at the very first auto-da-f\u00e9 celebrated in Portugal in September 1540, at which 23 were absolved and two were condemned to be burnt, including a French cleric. Hence, he believes that Xavier was aware of the brutality of the Inquisition.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCatholicism in China\nCatholicism in Indonesia\nChristianity in China\nChristianity in Indonesia\nGoa Inquisition\nHistory of Roman Catholicism in Japan\nJesuit China missions\nList of Westerners who visited Japan before 1868\nMission San Xavier del Bac \u2014 San Xavier District, Tohono O'odham Nation, Arizona\nXaverian Brothers \u2014 religious order in America\nXavier High School (New York City)\nXavier School \u2014 San Juan City, Philippines\nXavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines\nSt. Francis Xavier University - Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada\nSt. Xavier's Institution - Georgetown, Penang, Malaysia\nSaint Francis Xavier, patron saint archive\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article incorporates material from the Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religion\nAttwater, Donald.

          "This church has the relic of St Francis Xavier. Peaceful and one of the places to pray. Walking distance from other churches and tourist spots.",
          "We sneaked behind a local guide and learnt a bit more than expected as we wanted only to have a seat and feel the ambeince of this beautiful and calm church. We think the connection to the heaven is intact and working well here. Come, sit down, and have a peacful moment.",
          "I was pretty amazed at this place, great building, even to me. What amazed me more was the amount of effort, energy and money people have historically put into religious artifacts. The detail in some of these items was incredible, especially considering how long ago the are",
          "the church is a great stop to look at the history and the great antiques as well there this was a great stop to look and read about the history",
          "Not much to see in here but is Instagram worthy. Love the pastel color paint and inside the church, it's very peaceful",
          "Good to take picture and there's a beautiful fountain nearby. You might take note it's a bit uphill way",
          "St. Francis Xavier Church is located at Eduardo Marques Garden along the harbour promenade in the village of Coloane. This church was built in 1928 and is of the of traditional European architecture and design. What makes this church interesting is that it has been the",
          "It is a small historic centre and this church is among the few tourist sights around. It is simple inside, and it takes 15 minutes to visit it.",
          "This quaint yellow church has stood in Coloane for about 90 years and used to contain many important Catholic relics that were later transferred o the museum. In front of the church is a square where there is a monument commemorating a victory over pirates in 1910.",
          "Build by the Portuguese and has an small museum gallery upstairs, well preserved and maintained, must visit when at city center",
          "This is right in the center and its quite a nice church and the inside is clean and artistic. Spend a few minutes wandering the church",
          "This is the historic highlight of Coloane Village. The influential Sao Francisco Xavier's digit allegedly resides here, not that we saw it on the day that we visited recently. But what we could soak up was the heady atmosphere of old Macau...before it became the Las Vegas of the",
          "This Church is beautiful inside and out and is well worth a visit. Easy to find with nice gardens around the outside.",
          "A small chapel in the attractive Coloane area. I love how this tiny, Catholic place of worship faces the might of the secular area to the north, just a stone throw across a narrow straight. It is unfortunate that we cannot find this type of history in the other nearby former",
          "Another tropical baroque chuch built in Macau during Portuguese rule. It is similar to other Macau Catholic churches but they are indeed the reflection of a special past and history. Worth to visit, but if you have a tight schedule, you can skip this church in case you are",
          "In the main part of Macau is quite crowded while this church is fine, not so many people. Really relaxing to visit.",
          "Just has 10 minutes, was a bit rushed. However can say, was worth the stop. Its a functional Church not only for tourism. Nice architecture, for those into such stuff. Neatly kept grounds.",
          "We arrived here around 10am on a weekday and there was not a tourist in sight aside from our little group. The place was small and the architecture was not impressive but it was peaceful, the right ambience for a church.",
          "Another delightful Portuguese chuch built in Macau reflecting their Christian faith but also it adds to cultural and religious diversity when the east succesfuly met the west in Macau.",
          "This is another illustration that using tours is not necessarily the best way to go. Although the place and the garden looked great, our tour guide did not get us time to enjoy the place and limited the story to a few phrase. I do not want to make any general comments - it is",
          "week days, not holidays this is the place to relax, week ends you must forget as half china will enjoy the holiday with you, and it will be more crowded than a sardine tin. the old part of Macau also the streets around the strip that breath old Macau, and where you can shop for",

          "This church is located in the village of Coloane. Must see for breath taking Portugal architecture at its best.",
          "Take your Heritage guidebook and follow the little backstreets of Old Macau. It's exactly like walking in the older parts of upper Lisbon",
          "You cannot miss this church as you walk through the Coloane walking area as it is in the middle of the square. Going inside is free of charge but is rather small and underwhelming although the exterior and surrounding areas are colorful. Given that it is on the way, stop by",
          "The Church was built in 1928, located in the middle of Coloane, a peaceful village away from the artificial tourist attractions, on the southwestern coast It is a small beautiful baroque-style Chapel, once held some important Christian relics, including the bone from the arm of",
          "Beautiful little church in Coloane just by the waterfront. Very colourful and pretty. Unfortunately I didn't go inside at the time and I regret it now. Well worth a quick visit.",
          "The size is compact, cant compare with the old town church. If you just want to come for foto shooting, u might be disappointed to its scare and internal decoration, btw, its easy to find.",
          "I didn't manage to visit the interior, as I was on my way to Ruins of St. Paul's and was passing by. But I did stop to admire the exterior and I love the colours of this cathedral so much. Definitely not your usual expectations when it comes to a cathedral. Against the blue",
          "I have seen quite a few churches in my life. This is hands down one of the most colorful exteriors that I have seen. The interior is not as ornate but so light filled.",
          "One of the best representations of the colonial era in Coloane Village is the small square in front of Chapel of St. Francis Xavier. This is a quaint little spot that seems lost in time. Here you will see a memorial column that is almost always surrounded with flowerpots, two",
          "This was once one of the famous church of Macau. The outside color of the church was very unite. Inside the church was very basic and simple. Around the church has some small restaurants and also has a very nice river view of the other side of Macau.",
          "Located at the bottom of the hill of the Ruins of St Paul, this church looks like a wedding cake. Worth a visit.",
          "build in 1928 , this is an old world church. well maintained though with yellow painted walls .close to senado square.....you approach this through tiny lanes. crowd can be heavy..",
          "This is the window to the area's Christian past. The church is well maintained and located in the heart of old European quarters of the city. Approach roads are narrow and mostly one-way traffic is allowed. So be ready to rub shoulders in the crowd. Good place for tourists to",
          "one of the must-see place in Macau... it would be nice if you went there for a mass, just be ready for the huge crowd though... it's an old structure but you can see that it is very well maintained... it was even newly painted when we went there...",
          "Macau/Macao is tiny, so is this chapel which was built in 1928, at the Largo Eduardo Marques square. 3 minutes north is the Lord Stow\u2019s Bakery (famous for egg tarts) and a second to the south is the Chan Seng Kei, a Michelin Guide eatery (famous for ducks), a few steps toward",

          "A well preserved historical place at Coloane. You must pay a visit to St.Francois church at Coloane. They are restaurant outside the church that offer local snack and meals.Around the area are the old buildings. A great place to discover old macau.",
          "Nice quite spot, not much to see but just sit and have a bite and a couple of beers next to the church ideal time 5-7 pm",

          "It's a beautiful place to take a photo the yellow is a nice change from the usual white churches. It's quite a standout the only problem is there so much people all the time you will have a crowd with you in the picture.",
          "If you are a K-Drama fan and loved Goong or Princess Hours, you would know why I visited the place. This is where the characters got married. This is where the princess went when they had a scandal in the palace. And the place in the series was soo nice you'd wish you could",
          "One cannot go to Macau and not visit the Chapel of St Francis Xavier. I was being adventurous and so caught a 26A public bus ( fare MOP 5.00 ) to the location which is on another island of Macau. You have to hang on whilst standing in the bus, if you don't get a seat. There",
          "You can feel the spirit when you pass by. Beautiful combination of colour that really make people feel calm and happy. I love it!",

          "We first got to know this Portuguese style liitle church from the Korean drama, Goong. It was a beautiful & small church in Coloane, away from the busy Macau Peninsula. The church can be reached by taking buses such as 15,25, 26. it was not crowded as it was quiet weekday late",
          "A Scenic and lovely place in the nice and quiet 'old' Macau. This is the way the Portuguese felt when the were here. If you like the history this is a must visit small town.",

          "The church is small, but there are lots of things there which is very informative. There is a litte museum which has some interesting items.",
          "If you are in Macau you absolutely MUST visit Coloane Village. This is a quaint little district with so much history. The church is lovely and it feels like you have stepped back in time, with a strong Portuguese influence in the architecture and the tranquility of the area.",
          "It's located near a very small town, we went all the way there to try a so call famous Egg tarts, we had it in a nice caf\u00e9, quite nice but saw some long queue nearby. I suspect the best one is the one for take away, hahaha.",

          "We have long felt underwhelmed by St. Francis Xavier Church considering the significant of the patron saint for which the church is named and the lovely location of this building in Coloane village. From the outside, St. Francis Xavier is nice church to see, like many others",
          "Absolutely loved my visit to this church in Macau. The entire place was so calm and serene. I spent 2 hours exploring the entire Coloane area. Church architecture is simple but with good history behind it. Worth a visit if you are in Macau next time.",
          "We spent a couple of hours exploring Coloane and this little church is an absolute gem to visit. Brightly painted in yellow, it entices you to enter and explore.",
          "Small place full of serenity, the church (or rather chapel) contain holiest relics of catholic church in Far East. Beautifully renovated, and is again the main adornment of Coloane's central square. The painting of central nave is very simple, but its photos became highest-rated",
          "The church is a very simple and small architecture. All elements are simple but the colour is rich. Try to spend few minutes and sit inside, you should have spiritual peaceful. The front piazza have mosaic stone floor and a Memorial but Chinese restaurant set large table to",
          "This is a great Church, the location if you not carefully you will not find it because inside Coloane area (there is a lot of boutique, cafe, store, and anything else you want to buy cheaper). Church is otentik and beautiful. Especially if you go at night, you will find a great",
          "The chapel is now under renovation, and facade is fully covered. Entrance is closed also. If this chapel is only one reason for visiting Coloane, just cancel. But fortunately, there are lot things to do around",
          "This is one of the many churches on the historic route. Everytime you enter a church you will be amazed that you are still in China. It sure feels like Europe.",
          "Having visited Macau many times, I finally managed to make the trip to the Coloane area where the church is located. It is also very near to the famous Lord Stow's cafe. The church is so beautiful...... I will definitely be back again soon",
          "We recently visited St. Francis Xavier cathedral in Coloane village and were disappointed with what we found compared to the many nice church visits you can make in Macau. This church, built in 1928, as the potential to be a very important place to visit as it supposed holds",
          "This is my favourite church in Macau. It is so tiny and pretty and obviously loved by its congragation.",
          "Having studied a few reviews before I made the trip to Macao, I must say I was quite intrigued by the church and some reviews raved about it however once I got there, all i saw was a very small church with very minimal decor inside it. The hype The church was made famous in",
          "The architecture of the church is just phenomenal. The statues inside the church prescribe the history themselves. The place is so beautiful and so peaceful that one would like to spend hours with conscience towards the Almighty.",
          "Great architecture styles of portuguese and chinese, and really great place to pray and indulge your self. Make sure you pay a visit here, quietly...",

          "I like how Chinese is being used widely in this church. It is very small but one can sense its' strong community spirit built around it. Lovely nativity scene in the adjourning room... At sun set, the sun beats a path light of gold through the church doors. Lovely .",
          "A nice place to see. Read the guide for historic information,",

        "wiki": "Volgograd (UK: , US: ; Russian: \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0434, IPA: [v\u0259\u026b\u0261\u0250\u02c8\u0261rat] (listen)), formerly Tsaritsyn (Russian: \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0301\u0446\u044b\u043d\u200b ), 1589\u20131925, and Stalingrad (; Russian: \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0434\u200b ), 1925\u20131961, is an industrial city and the administrative centre of Volgograd Oblast, Russia. The city lies on the western bank of the Volga River. Volgograd was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nThe Soviets' Battle of Stalingrad against invading German and its allied forces in World War II was one of the largest and bloodiest battles in the history of warfare. Known locally as the \"Hero City\", Volgograd today is the site of The Motherland Calls, an 85-metre high statue dedicated to the heroes of the battle. The city has many tourist attractions, such as museums, sandy beaches, and a self-propelled floating church. Its population was 1,021,215 at the 2010 Census, growing from 1,011,417 in the 2002 Census.   \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Tsaritsyn ===\nAlthough the city may have originated in 1555, documented evidence of Tsaritsyn at the confluence of the Tsaritsa and Volga rivers dates from 1589. Grigori Zasekin established the fortress Sary Su (the local Tatar-language name means \"yellow water\" or \"yellow river\") as part of the defences of the unstable southern border of the Tsardom of Russia. The structure stood slightly above the mouth of the Tsaritsa River on the right bank. It soon became the nucleus of a trading settlement.\nIn 1607 the fortress garrison rebelled for six months against the troops of Tsar Vasili Shuisky. In 1608 the first stone church was built in the city and was dedicated to St. John the Baptist. At the beginning of the 17th century, the garrison consisted of 350 to 400 people.\nIn 1670 troops of Stepan Razin captured the fortress; they left after a month. In 1708 the insurgent Cossack Kondraty Bulavin (died July 1708) held the fortress. In 1717 in the Kuban pogrom, raiders from the Kuban under the command of the Crimean Tatar Bakhti Gerai blockaded the town and enslaved thousands in the area. In August 1774 Yemelyan Pugachev unsuccessfully attempted to storm the city.\nIn 1691 Moscow established a customs-post at Tsaritsyn. In 1708 Tsaritsyn was assigned to the Kazan Governorate; in 1719 to the Astrakhan Governorate. According to the census in 1720, the city had a population of 408 people. In 1773 the settlement was designated as a provincial and district town. From 1779 it belonged to the Saratov Viceroyalty. In 1780 the city came under the newly established Saratov Governorate.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, Tsaritsyn became an important river-port and commercial centre. The population expanded rapidly, increasing from fewer than 3,000 people in 1807 to about 84,000 in 1900. The first railway reached the town in 1862. The first theatre opened in 1872, the first cinema in 1907. In 1913 Tsaritsyn got its first tram-line, and the city's first electric lights were installed in the city centre.\nDuring the Russian Civil War of 1917\u20131923, Tsaritsyn came under Soviet control from November 1917. In 1918 White Movement troops under Pyotr Krasnov, the Ataman of the Don Cossack Host, besieged Tsaritsyn. The Reds repulsed three assaults by the Whites. However, in June 1919 the White Armed Forces of South Russia, under the command of General Denikin, captured Tsaritsyn, and held it until January 1920. The fighting from July 1918 to January 1920 became known as the Battle for Tsaritsyn.\n\n\n=== Stalingrad ===\nOn April 10, 1925, the city was renamed Stalingrad, in honour of Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the Communist Party. This was officially to recognise the city and Stalin's role in its defence against the Whites between 1918 and 1920. In 1931, the German settlement-colony Old Sarepta (founded in 1765) became a district of Stalingrad. Renamed Krasnoarmeysky Rayon (or \"Red Army District\"), it was the largest area of the city.\nThe first higher education institute was opened in 1930. A year later, the Stalingrad Industrial Pedagogical Institute, now Volgograd State Pedagogical University, was opened.\nUnder Stalin, the city became a centre of heavy industry and transshipment by rail and river. During World War II, German and Axis forces attacked the city, and in 1942 it was the site of one of the pivotal battles of the war. The Battle of Stalingrad had perhaps the greatest casualty figures of any single battle in the history of warfare (estimates are between 1,250,000 and 1,798,619). \n\nThe battle began on August 23, 1942, and on the same day, the city suffered heavy aerial bombardment that reduced most of it to rubble. By September, the fighting reached the city centre. The fighting was of unprecedented intensity; the city's central railway station changed hands thirteen times, and the Mamayev Kurgan (one of the highest points of the city) was captured and recaptured eight times. \nBy early November, the German forces controlled 90 percent of the city and had cornered the Soviets in two narrow pockets, but they were unable to eliminate the last pockets of Soviet resistance before Soviet forces launched a huge counterattack on November 19. This resulted in the Soviet encirclement of the German Sixth Army and other Axis units. On January 31, 1943 the Sixth Army's commander, Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus, surrendered, and by February 2, with the elimination of straggling German troops, the Battle of Stalingrad was over.\nIn 1945 the Soviet Union awarded Stalingrad the title Hero City for its resistance. Great Britain's King George VI awarded the citizens of Stalingrad the jewelled \"Sword of Stalingrad\" in recognition of their bravery. \nA number of cities around the world (especially those that had suffered similar wartime devastation) established sister, friendship, and twinning links (see list below) in the spirit of solidarity or reconciliation. One of the first \"sister city\" projects was that established during World War II between Stalingrad and Coventry in the United Kingdom; both had suffered extensive devastation from aerial bombardment.\n\n\n=== Volgograd ===\n\nOn 10 November 1961, Nikita Khrushchev's administration changed the name of the city to Volgograd (\"Volga City\") as part of his programme of de-Stalinisation following Stalin's death. He was trying to reduce the \"cult of personality\". This action was and remains somewhat controversial, because Stalingrad has such importance as a symbol of resistance during World War II. \nDuring Konstantin Chernenko's brief administration in 1984, proposals were floated to revive the city's historic name for that reason. There is a strong degree of local support for a reversion, but  the Russian government has not accepted such proposals.\nOn May 21, 2007, the Communist Party obtained an important success in the Volgograd mayoral election. Communist candidate Roman Grebennikov was elected as mayor with 32.47% of the vote, a plurality. Grebennikov is Russia's youngest mayor of a federal subject administrative centre.\nIn 2010, Russian monarchists and leaders of the Orthodox organisations demanded that the city should take back its original name of Tsaritsyn, but the authorities rejected their proposal.\nOn January 30, 2013, the Volgograd City Council passed a measure to use the title \"Hero City Stalingrad\" in city statements on nine specific dates annually. On the following dates the title \"Hero City Stalingrad\" can officially be used in celebrations: \n\nFebruary 2 (end of the Battle of Stalingrad),\nFebruary 23 (Defender of the Fatherland Day),\nMay 9 (Victory Day),\nJune 22 (start of Operation Barbarossa),\nAugust 23 (start of the Battle of Stalingrad),\nSeptember 2 (Victory over Japan Day),\nNovember 19 (start of Operation Uranus),\nDecember 9 (Day of the Fatherland's Heroes)In addition, 50,000 people signed a petition to Vladimir Putin, asking that the city's name be permanently changed to Stalingrad. President Putin has replied that such a move should be preceded by a local referendum and that the Russian authorities will look into how to bring about such a referendum.\n\n\n=== Terrorist attacks ===\n\nOn August 24, 2004, the Volga-AviaExpress Flight 1353, a Tupolev Tu-134 aircraft flying from Moscow to Volgograd, exploded in mid-air and crashed as a result of a  suicide terrorist attack. 34 passengers and 9 crew members were on board the aircraft, all of whom died in the crash.  A Siberia Airlines flight bound for Sochi that day was also bombed, killing all 46 who were on board.\nAt approximately 2:00 p.m. on Monday 21 October 2013, Russian intelligence officers reported a bomb carried by a female suicide bomber exploded on a passenger bus carrying forty people, when it was stopped at the Lesobaza bus stop. Irina Gogolyeva, a spokesperson from the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry, reported that at least five people died in the blast and seventeen others were injured. On October 22, 2013, Vladimir Markin from Russia's investigative Committee reported that the suicide bomber had been identified as 30-year-old Naida Asiyalova of Dagestan.On December 29, 2013, a suicide bomb attack occurred at the Volgograd railway station, killing at least seventeen people. It is not clear how many bombers were involved or who they were. The following day a suicide bombing on a trolleybus killed at least fifteen people.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nIn 2011, the City Duma cancelled direct election of the mayor and confirmed the position of City Manager. This was short-lived, as in March 2012, Volgograd residents voted for relevant amendments to the city charter to reinstate the direct mayoral elections.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nVolgograd is the administrative center of Volgograd Oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Volgograd\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Volgograd is incorporated as Volgograd Urban Okrug.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nModern Volgograd remains an important industrial city. Industries include shipbuilding, oil refining, steel and aluminum production, manufacture of machinery and vehicles, and chemical production. The large Volgograd Hydroelectric Plant is a short distance to the north of Volgograd.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nVolgograd is a major railway junction served by the Privolzhskaya Railway. Rail links from the Volgograd railway station include Moscow; Saratov; Astrakhan; the Donbas region of Ukraine; the Caucasus  and Siberia. It stands at the east end of the Volga\u2013Don Canal, opened in 1952 to link the two great rivers of Southern Russia. European route E40, the longest European route connecting Calais in France with Ridder in Kazakhstan, passes through Volgograd. The M6 highway between Moscow and the Caspian Sea also passes through the city.  The Volgograd Bridge, under construction since 1995, was inaugurated in October 2009. The city river terminal is the centre for local passenger shipping along the Volga River.\nThe Volgograd International Airport provides air links to major Russian cities as well as Antalya, Yerevan and Aktau.\nVolgograd's public transport system includes a light rail service known as the Volgograd metrotram.  Local public transport is provided by buses, trolleybuses and trams.\nThe Volga River still is a very important communication channel.\nVolgograd hosts one of the few floating churches in the world: the floating church of Saint Vladimir of Volgograd.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Climate ==\nVolgograd has a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa). The city is only slightly warmer than Minneapolis (both in summer and winter, but transitional seasons are almost identical) at the same time that despite being taxed \"moist\" is drier than most of the climate of group D due to proximity to the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nA memorial complex commemorating the battle of Stalingrad, dominated by an immense allegorical sculpture The Motherland Calls, was erected on the Mamayev Kurgan, the hill that saw some of the most intense fighting during the battle.\nThe Panorama Museum sited on the Volga contains artifacts from World War II. These include a panoramic painting of the battlefield from the location of the monument on Mamayev Kurgan. A rifle of the famous sniper Vasily Zaytsev is also on display. \nThe Musical Instrument Museum is a branch of the Volgograd regional Museum of local lore.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHigher education facilities include:\n\nVolgograd State University\nVolgograd State Technical University (former Volgograd Polytechnical University)\nVolgograd State Agriculture University\nVolgograd State Medical University\nVolgograd State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering\nVolgograd Academy of Industry\nVolgograd Academy of Business Administration\nVolgograd State Pedagogical University\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nVolgograd was a host city to four matches of the FIFA World Cup in 2018. A new modern stadium, Volgograd Arena, was built for this occasion on the bank of the Volga River to serve as the venue. The stadium has a seating capacity for 45,000 people, including a press box, a VIP box and seats for people with limited mobility.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nVolgograd is twinned with:\n\nSeveral communities in France and Italy have streets or avenues named after Stalingrad, hence Place de Stalingrad in Paris and the eponymous Paris M\u00e9tro station of Stalingrad.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u211620/362 \u043e\u0442 29 \u0438\u044e\u043d\u044f 2005 \u0433. \u00ab\u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u00bb, \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u211632/1000 \u043e\u0442 15 \u0438\u044e\u043b\u044f 2015 \u0433. \u00ab\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u00bb. \u0412\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0432 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0443 10 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 2006 \u0433.

          "We had the opportunity to visit this museum with a beautiful personal guide. The history of the battle of Stalingrad was revealed to us from the Russian optic. Very interesting points of view and quite different from our history lesson. The fact that family members were involved",
          "A fantastic museum combining contemporary objects and stories from the battle, wit moving personal effects and tremendous use of technology to show the various phases of the conflict.",
          "Higher charge for foreigners but never mind. Still well worth a visit. Will give an insight into how Russia turned the tide of the war and pushed the Germans back from the brink of victory. Not one step back.",
          "The museum exhibits everything you need to see about the great Stalingrad Battle. From uniforms and weapons, to photographs of the heroes, elements of the battlefield (Russian as well as Nazi), medals, etc. It's very well organized and the displays are magnificent. Finally, as",
          "I liked that museum. it broaden our mind very much. It opens some kinds of weapons whic were used during the Stalingrad Battle that was really interesting. We love Russian army & respected all unnamed fighting solders for it.",
          "this will take a lot of your time (panorama and museum both) and some physical activity (you will have to climb quite an amount of stairs), but you will love it, i guarantee. Even if you are not a huge WW2 history geek, just the size and the atmosphere of the panorama picture",
          "The Panoramic Museum Battle of Stalingrad was a great way to learn more about the history of Volgograd and of course the Battle of Stalingrad. The panorama itself was a great artistic depiction that helped to give a person an idea of the battle itself.",
          "I visited this impressive panorama with a guide who explained me details of the painting and the story of the 200 days of battle between the nazi's (that is how they call them in Russia) and the army of Russia. More than 2.500.000 people died in 200 days. This is more than you",
          "Spent there several hours. Panorama located next to Grudinins mill one of few WW2 places saved for us to see it today. Panorama offers outside and inside exhibitions. I will add some pictures to my review so you can see how interesting it is. Also fro here great view on",

          "You will be overwhelmed by the tons of real weapons and artifacts gathered from this battle. Here you can realize how devastating and hellish this was, that the town was a ruined to crumbles and everything was used as weapon. In general I do not like war worshiping, but this",
          "A great museum for history buffs. This museum like so many in russia is dedicated to wwii,it's really quite comprehensive and impressive. From tanks outside to original medals of Vasili Zaitzev and other wwii heroes.",
          "I have written over 180 reviews on Trip Advisor and believe in the power of feedback. I hope you find my review helpful. I studied WW2 and Russian history in college. I also had the opportunity to study in Russia for 3 years and learn to speak Russian. A full understanding of",
          "I studied history in college, and have travelled around the world visiting WWII battlefields and sights, but none of them compare to visiting Stalingrad, and specifically to visiting this museum. It is incredibly thorough and well made. Very happy we decided to visit Volgograd!",
          "It is a big memorial space. There is a very big torch on the center, guarded by incredibly still soldiers, the room itself is beautiful and is good to visit before you head to the Mamaev Statue.",
          "In regards to this entire area- Mamaev Kurgan should be at the top of any list, however, this is easily the second choice and you won't regret it. I did find myself in a good hearted debate with the staff there as I listened to the audio presentation and I had to point out that",
          "We visited the museum with a local guide as part of our Vodohod river cruise tour. There is no doubt that it is the best way of seeing this amazing venue. While audio guides are available, we enjoyed our knowledgeable human guide who answered questions as required! The top floor",
          "After Mamaev Kurgan this is the second must see in town. A stunning historical museum with everything you always wanted to know about the Great War, at least from an official Russian perspective that is. It's a big place and will easily take you two hours.",
          "Moving and meaningful stuff. Well set out with English audio guides to hire. This cost 100 roubles with a 1000 roubles returnable deposit. Didn't try the cafe but the souvenir shop is disappointingly sparse, everything else is clean, neat and easy to access",
          "Stunning collection of material from one of the greatest and most important battles in history. I've read a lot of books and seen many documentaries but this museum complex takes the history to the next level. The panoramic painting and display is jaw dropping. Lucky to have a",
          "It simply does not get any better than this museum. It was just beyond belief. The display was incredible",
          "Visited Panoramic Museum and Panorama several times since it was opened. Recent visit - 70 Victory Anniversary with my younger daughter. I was really impressed of 8 new Diarama and interactive battke Plot-plan.",
          "On our first visit here the museum was closed, and we had to manage with looking round at the exhibits outside, which was fine and there is lots to see. We came back the next day (Tuesday) and spent several hours in the museum. There is a lot to see. We took an audio guide which",
          "Having seen the Borodino panaroma museum in Moscow, I was not expecting much. How wrong was I. The panaroma is bigger than Borodino and employing an English speaking guide brings the entire battle to life. The exhibits will easily occupy two hours without getting bored.",
          "In the lower floors, 8 exhibition halls shows Russian and German arms and medals. What soldiers carried on battle fields. Russian posters during the war - especially \"Motherland calls you !\" Climb up up to the most high floor, there's famous panorama. In Russia, there are 3",
          "A very informative museum about WW2. There is a lot of items dating back to that era and you move yourself in circles from top to bottom. Easy to navigate. A VERY impressive painting follows you over a long distance, covering the battle at Volgograd. That itself is a good reason",
          "It's a really well made museum. I was not expecting it will be that good. In front of it there are few IS tanks. Unfortunatelly, nearly everything is just in russian but luckilly you can have a guide.",
          "This is what happens when two bullheaded leaders are willing to sacrifice their boys to the war gods rather than move forward with the conflict. Thank God for intervening with the coldest winter on record otherwise they would still be fighting. Praises to Russia for winning and",
          "Visiting this monument is very overwhelming. Man can feel the atmosphere from those horrible period during WW2. Starting from the river bank you go up the huge stairs and you keep going up through a mausoleum until you end at the feet of the immense statue of 91 meters high;\"The",
          "While the dioramas are excellent, the museum is otherwise a bit of a non-event. Don't bother to buy a ticket to take photos unless you want to photograph the dioramas, because there's otherwise not much of real interest here (Paulus's last headquarters under the Univermag",
          "So much to see in here. Our local guide Mikhael explained every piece of the exhibits. The diorama was particularly interesting",
          "I visited Volgograd State Panoramic Museum 2 days ago . It was realy amazing presantation. During my visit one of the offical quide who was represanted all museum with perfect explanation. I would like to thank you quide Anna for more than two hours presantation.",
          "I learned an amazing deal about the second world war in Russia. I understand the Russian people better, due to learning about the hardships they had to endure. Very nicely depicted! Much bigger than i expected from the outside of the building. To be recommended by a Dutch",
          "The museum is worth visiting if you like your history. It shows you how Volgograd was devastated in just 1 day. The 360 degree handpainting is a must to see.",
          "The most amazing collection, with fascinating diorama and artefacts, but no English translation, which is a shame.",
          "Amazing insight into the battle of the Volga .. So many lives lost in such deplorable winter conditions. No English, so a guide is invaluable. Diorama is very representative of such an unfortunate battle!",
          "Interesting museum, very well-arranged exhibits, including Zaitsev's sniper rifles or the gift to Volgograd from British empire to commemorate the battle of Staliningrad: a beautiful sword. Includes four 90\u00b0 panoramas with battle scenes during different seasons of the year and",
          "Excellent collection of artefacts and memorabilia relating to the famous battle on the Volga which raged non-stop from August 1942 until February 1943 and resulted in the ultimate deaths of perhaps 1.5 million men women and children on both sides of the Russo-German conflict.",
          "The artifacts in this museum are excellent, though there is little in the way of explanation in English. It is next to the destroyed old brick bakery, worth a look. However, this should be just one stop in Stalingrad/Volgograd to understand the WWII battle - be sure to visit",
          "This museum has a great mix of models , photos , & personal items that all go together to tell the story of Stalingrad's struggle.The exhibits take you through several halls to graphically tell the history of this extraordinary city. It really shows the reality of the battle &",
          "This is a good museum that has lots of history and significance. Located very centrally in Volgograd, right by Volga and is surrounded by other historic \"leftovers\" of WWII. Museum has multiple levels, starting on level 1 are multiple halls full of history and things left from",

          "Well worth visting irrespective of your knowledge of the titanic battle that happened here. Good cafe and small gift shop too.",
          "Visited this museum on Victory Day so the line was insanely long to get in, but apparently it's not normally like that. They had a lot of artifacts but all the exhibits were in Russian so you either need to speak Russian or have a translator. At the entrance to every room are",
          "The biggest and best museum in volgograd, it houses many war relics and interesting antiques that were used in the soviet union, especially against the nazi's invasion during world war II. The museum is huge and spacious, everything is well places, and the best part is the top",
          "Like a lot of my reviews of Stalingrad, I have to say you will need a guide unless you speak Russian. There is very little in English. Sure, it's not in the modern western style of museum, but it contains everything and more relating to the battle. If you've taken the trouble to",
          "Panoramic is worthwhile but all the exhibition is in Russian only?",
          "Good museum. English speaking people be sure to read the plaques posted at the beginning of each room for a good summation of what's in each room. Also, at the end head up the spiral stairs to the dome.",
          "a must to visit in Volgograd, It's like a time capsule filled with all memories of the infamous Stalingrad battle against the Germans. You will be standing in the middle as you are at the highest point of the city centre with 360 degrees panoramic view of the war condition and",

The city lies on the western bank of the Volga River. Volgograd was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nThe Soviets' Battle of Stalingrad against invading German and its allied forces in World War II was one of the largest and bloodiest battles in the history of warfare. Known locally as the \"Hero City\", Volgograd today is the site of The Motherland Calls, an 85-metre high statue dedicated to the heroes of the battle. The city has many tourist attractions, such as museums, sandy beaches, and a self-propelled floating church. Its population was 1,021,215 at the 2010 Census, growing from 1,011,417 in the 2002 Census.   \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Tsaritsyn ===\nAlthough the city may have originated in 1555, documented evidence of Tsaritsyn at the confluence of the Tsaritsa and Volga rivers dates from 1589. Grigori Zasekin established the fortress Sary Su (the local Tatar-language name means \"yellow water\" or \"yellow river\") as part of the defences of the unstable southern border of the Tsardom of Russia. The structure stood slightly above the mouth of the Tsaritsa River on the right bank. It soon became the nucleus of a trading settlement.\nIn 1607 the fortress garrison rebelled for six months against the troops of Tsar Vasili Shuisky. In 1608 the first stone church was built in the city and was dedicated to St. John the Baptist. At the beginning of the 17th century, the garrison consisted of 350 to 400 people.\nIn 1670 troops of Stepan Razin captured the fortress; they left after a month. In 1708 the insurgent Cossack Kondraty Bulavin (died July 1708) held the fortress. In 1717 in the Kuban pogrom, raiders from the Kuban under the command of the Crimean Tatar Bakhti Gerai blockaded the town and enslaved thousands in the area. In August 1774 Yemelyan Pugachev unsuccessfully attempted to storm the city.\nIn 1691 Moscow established a customs-post at Tsaritsyn. In 1708 Tsaritsyn was assigned to the Kazan Governorate; in 1719 to the Astrakhan Governorate. According to the census in 1720, the city had a population of 408 people. In 1773 the settlement was designated as a provincial and district town. From 1779 it belonged to the Saratov Viceroyalty. In 1780 the city came under the newly established Saratov Governorate.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, Tsaritsyn became an important river-port and commercial centre. The population expanded rapidly, increasing from fewer than 3,000 people in 1807 to about 84,000 in 1900. The first railway reached the town in 1862. The first theatre opened in 1872, the first cinema in 1907. In 1913 Tsaritsyn got its first tram-line, and the city's first electric lights were installed in the city centre.\nDuring the Russian Civil War of 1917\u20131923, Tsaritsyn came under Soviet control from November 1917. In 1918 White Movement troops under Pyotr Krasnov, the Ataman of the Don Cossack Host, besieged Tsaritsyn. The Reds repulsed three assaults by the Whites. However, in June 1919 the White Armed Forces of South Russia, under the command of General Denikin, captured Tsaritsyn, and held it until January 1920. The fighting from July 1918 to January 1920 became known as the Battle for Tsaritsyn.\n\n\n=== Stalingrad ===\nOn April 10, 1925, the city was renamed Stalingrad, in honour of Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the Communist Party. This was officially to recognise the city and Stalin's role in its defence against the Whites between 1918 and 1920. In 1931, the German settlement-colony Old Sarepta (founded in 1765) became a district of Stalingrad. Renamed Krasnoarmeysky Rayon (or \"Red Army District\"), it was the largest area of the city.\nThe first higher education institute was opened in 1930. A year later, the Stalingrad Industrial Pedagogical Institute, now Volgograd State Pedagogical University, was opened.\nUnder Stalin, the city became a centre of heavy industry and transshipment by rail and river. During World War II, German and Axis forces attacked the city, and in 1942 it was the site of one of the pivotal battles of the war. The Battle of Stalingrad had perhaps the greatest casualty figures of any single battle in the history of warfare (estimates are between 1,250,000 and 1,798,619). \n\nThe battle began on August 23, 1942, and on the same day, the city suffered heavy aerial bombardment that reduced most of it to rubble. By September, the fighting reached the city centre. The fighting was of unprecedented intensity; the city's central railway station changed hands thirteen times, and the Mamayev Kurgan (one of the highest points of the city) was captured and recaptured eight times. \nBy early November, the German forces controlled 90 percent of the city and had cornered the Soviets in two narrow pockets, but they were unable to eliminate the last pockets of Soviet resistance before Soviet forces launched a huge counterattack on November 19. This resulted in the Soviet encirclement of the German Sixth Army and other Axis units. On January 31, 1943 the Sixth Army's commander, Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus, surrendered, and by February 2, with the elimination of straggling German troops, the Battle of Stalingrad was over.\nIn 1945 the Soviet Union awarded Stalingrad the title Hero City for its resistance. Great Britain's King George VI awarded the citizens of Stalingrad the jewelled \"Sword of Stalingrad\" in recognition of their bravery. \nA number of cities around the world (especially those that had suffered similar wartime devastation) established sister, friendship, and twinning links (see list below) in the spirit of solidarity or reconciliation. One of the first \"sister city\" projects was that established during World War II between Stalingrad and Coventry in the United Kingdom; both had suffered extensive devastation from aerial bombardment.\n\n\n=== Volgograd ===\n\nOn 10 November 1961, Nikita Khrushchev's administration changed the name of the city to Volgograd (\"Volga City\") as part of his programme of de-Stalinisation following Stalin's death. He was trying to reduce the \"cult of personality\". This action was and remains somewhat controversial, because Stalingrad has such importance as a symbol of resistance during World War II. \nDuring Konstantin Chernenko's brief administration in 1984, proposals were floated to revive the city's historic name for that reason. There is a strong degree of local support for a reversion, but  the Russian government has not accepted such proposals.\nOn May 21, 2007, the Communist Party obtained an important success in the Volgograd mayoral election. Communist candidate Roman Grebennikov was elected as mayor with 32.47% of the vote, a plurality. Grebennikov is Russia's youngest mayor of a federal subject administrative centre.\nIn 2010, Russian monarchists and leaders of the Orthodox organisations demanded that the city should take back its original name of Tsaritsyn, but the authorities rejected their proposal.\nOn January 30, 2013, the Volgograd City Council passed a measure to use the title \"Hero City Stalingrad\" in city statements on nine specific dates annually. On the following dates the title \"Hero City Stalingrad\" can officially be used in celebrations: \n\nFebruary 2 (end of the Battle of Stalingrad),\nFebruary 23 (Defender of the Fatherland Day),\nMay 9 (Victory Day),\nJune 22 (start of Operation Barbarossa),\nAugust 23 (start of the Battle of Stalingrad),\nSeptember 2 (Victory over Japan Day),\nNovember 19 (start of Operation Uranus),\nDecember 9 (Day of the Fatherland's Heroes)In addition, 50,000 people signed a petition to Vladimir Putin, asking that the city's name be permanently changed to Stalingrad. President Putin has replied that such a move should be preceded by a local referendum and that the Russian authorities will look into how to bring about such a referendum.\n\n\n=== Terrorist attacks ===\n\nOn August 24, 2004, the Volga-AviaExpress Flight 1353, a Tupolev Tu-134 aircraft flying from Moscow to Volgograd, exploded in mid-air and crashed as a result of a  suicide terrorist attack. 34 passengers and 9 crew members were on board the aircraft, all of whom died in the crash.  A Siberia Airlines flight bound for Sochi that day was also bombed, killing all 46 who were on board.\nAt approximately 2:00 p.m. on Monday 21 October 2013, Russian intelligence officers reported a bomb carried by a female suicide bomber exploded on a passenger bus carrying forty people, when it was stopped at the Lesobaza bus stop. Irina Gogolyeva, a spokesperson from the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry, reported that at least five people died in the blast and seventeen others were injured. On October 22, 2013, Vladimir Markin from Russia's investigative Committee reported that the suicide bomber had been identified as 30-year-old Naida Asiyalova of Dagestan.On December 29, 2013, a suicide bomb attack occurred at the Volgograd railway station, killing at least seventeen people. It is not clear how many bombers were involved or who they were. The following day a suicide bombing on a trolleybus killed at least fifteen people.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nIn 2011, the City Duma cancelled direct election of the mayor and confirmed the position of City Manager. This was short-lived, as in March 2012, Volgograd residents voted for relevant amendments to the city charter to reinstate the direct mayoral elections.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nVolgograd is the administrative center of Volgograd Oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Volgograd\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Volgograd is incorporated as Volgograd Urban Okrug.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nModern Volgograd remains an important industrial city. Industries include shipbuilding, oil refining, steel and aluminum production, manufacture of machinery and vehicles, and chemical production. The large Volgograd Hydroelectric Plant is a short distance to the north of Volgograd.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nVolgograd is a major railway junction served by the Privolzhskaya Railway. Rail links from the Volgograd railway station include Moscow; Saratov; Astrakhan; the Donbas region of Ukraine; the Caucasus  and Siberia. It stands at the east end of the Volga\u2013Don Canal, opened in 1952 to link the two great rivers of Southern Russia. European route E40, the longest European route connecting Calais in France with Ridder in Kazakhstan, passes through Volgograd. The M6 highway between Moscow and the Caspian Sea also passes through the city.  The Volgograd Bridge, under construction since 1995, was inaugurated in October 2009. The city river terminal is the centre for local passenger shipping along the Volga River.\nThe Volgograd International Airport provides air links to major Russian cities as well as Antalya, Yerevan and Aktau.\nVolgograd's public transport system includes a light rail service known as the Volgograd metrotram.  Local public transport is provided by buses, trolleybuses and trams.\nThe Volga River still is a very important communication channel.\nVolgograd hosts one of the few floating churches in the world: the floating church of Saint Vladimir of Volgograd.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Climate ==\nVolgograd has a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa). The city is only slightly warmer than Minneapolis (both in summer and winter, but transitional seasons are almost identical) at the same time that despite being taxed \"moist\" is drier than most of the climate of group D due to proximity to the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nA memorial complex commemorating the battle of Stalingrad, dominated by an immense allegorical sculpture The Motherland Calls, was erected on the Mamayev Kurgan, the hill that saw some of the most intense fighting during the battle.\nThe Panorama Museum sited on the Volga contains artifacts from World War II. These include a panoramic painting of the battlefield from the location of the monument on Mamayev Kurgan.

        "wiki": "The Motherland Calls (Russian: \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430-\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0451\u0442!, tr. Rodina-mat' zovyot!, lit. 'Homeland-Mother Is Calling!') is the compositional centre of the monument-ensemble \"Heroes of the Battle of Stalingrad\" on Mamayev Kurgan in Volgograd, Russia. It was designed by sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich and structural engineer Nikolai Nikitin, and declared the tallest statue in the world in 1967. At 85 m (279 ft), it is the tallest statue in Europe and the tallest statue (excluding pedestals) of a woman in the world.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nThe work of sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich and engineer Nikolai Nikitin is an 85-metre (279 ft) figure of a woman stepping forward with a raised sword. The statue is an allegorical image of the Motherland, which calls on its sons and daughters to repulse the enemy and return to the attack.\nThe Motherland Calls is highly complex from an engineering point of view, due to its characteristic posture with a sword raised high in the right hand and the left hand extended in a calling gesture. The technology behind the hollow statue is based on a combination of prestressed concrete with wire ropes, a solution which can also be found in another work of Nikitin's, the Ostankino Tower in Moscow. The sculpture is hollow. Inside, the entire statue consists of separate cells or chambers, like rooms in a building. The concrete walls of the sculpture are 25\u201330 cm (9.8\u201311.8 in) thick.The construction of the monument was started in May 1959 and completed on 15 October 1967. It was the tallest sculpture in the world at the time of creation. Restoration work on the main monument of the monument complex was done in 1972, when the sword was replaced by another entirely consisting of stainless steel.It is most likely that Vuchetich sculpted the figure from the discus thrower Nina Dumbadze, and the face from his wife Vera. According to various sources, Valentina Izotova or Ekaterina Grebneva posed for the sculpture. It is also believed that the statue has parallels with the figure of the \"Marseillaise\" on the Triumphal arch in Paris, and that the statue's pose was inspired by the statue of Nike of Samothrace.\nAt night, the sculpture is illuminated by floodlights. It was specially illuminated as part of a light show titled \"The Light of the Great Victory\", marking the 72nd anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany.\n\n\n== Measurements ==\nWhen the memorial was dedicated in 1967 it was the tallest statue in the world, measuring 85 m (279 ft) from the tip of its sword to the top of the plinth. The plinth measures another 2 m (6.6 ft), and is installed on a concrete foundation with a depth of 16 m (52 ft). The figure measures 52 m (171 ft), and the sword 33 m (108 ft). The monument weighs over 8,000 tonnes (8,800 short tons). The statue contains 5,500 tonnes (6,100 short tons) tonnes of concrete and 2,400 tonnes (2,600 short tons) tons of metal structures, the sword itself weighs 14 tonnes (15 short tons). The rigidity of the frame is supported by 99 metal cables constantly in tension.\n\n\n== Dedication ==\n\nTwo hundred steps, symbolizing the 200 days of the Battle of Stalingrad, lead from the bottom of the hill to the monument. The statue appears on both the current flag and coat of arms of Volgograd Oblast.\nMarshal of the Soviet Union Vasily Ivanovich Chuikov is buried in the area of the monument, as is famous Soviet sniper Vasily Zaytsev, who killed 225 soldiers and officers of the German army and their allies in the battle of Stalingrad.\nThe monument is the central part of the triptych, consisting of the monuments \"Rear-Front\" in Magnitogorsk and \"Warrior-Liberator\" in Berlin's Treptower Park. It is understood that the sword, forged by the side of the Urals, was later raised by Motherland in Stalingrad and dropped after the Victory in Berlin.\n\n\n== Structural problems ==\nThe sword was originally made of stainless steel, trimmed with titanium sheets. The huge mass and high windage of the sword, due to its colossal dimensions, caused a strong swinging of the sword under the influence of wind loads, which caused excessive mechanical stress in the place where the hand holding the sword was attached to the body of the sculpture. Deformations in the design of the sword also caused the movement of sheets of titanium plating, creating-pitched sound of thundering metal. Therefore, in 1972, the blade was replaced by another \u2013 entirely consisting of stainless steel, \u2013 and in the upper part of the sword, holes were provided that made it possible to reduce its windage.In 2009, reports said the statue was leaning due to changes in groundwater level causing movement of the foundations. The statue is not fixed to its foundations and is held in place only by its weight. An anonymous official claimed that it had shifted 20 cm (7.9 in) and was not expected to move much farther without collapsing. A program of monument restoration was developed in 2008\u20132009, and conservation and restoration work started in 2010.In spring 2017, a comprehensive restoration program of the monument at a cost of two billion rubles ($35,000,000) began. The ropes inside the statue were replaced to ensure its stability, the interior and all formed cracks were repaired and more than 6,000 m2 (65,000 sq ft) of concrete surfaces were restored. The restoration of the statue was completed by April 2020.\n\n\n== Facts ==\n\nThe sculpture is depicted on the postage stamp of the GDR 1983.\nA copy of the sculpture is present in Manzhouli, China.\nThe sculpture is also depicted on a 1975 one Ruble commemorative coin.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSocialist realism\nMother Motherland, name for any of several huge statues in various cities of the former Soviet Union\nWorker and Kolkhoz Woman\nList of statues by height\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nScott W.

She attended a local comprehensive school. She learned to fly at the Izmailovsky aeroclub in Moscow and later worked as an instructor. Upon the German invasion of the Soviet Union, she was invited to join women's aviation group by Marina Raskova. After joining she and the rest of the women volunteers were sent for training at Engels Military Aviation School, and Nechaeva was underwent training to fly the Yak-1 for the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment, an air defense unit and the first of the three women's regiments to be deployed to the front. In September 1942 she and several other women pilots were transferred to the male 434th Fighter Aviation Regiment based in Stalingrad; the reasons for the transfer are disputed among historians, ranging from the need for more pilots in the battle of Stalingrad, to Tamara Kazarinova (commander of the women's 586th Regiment) wanting to get rid of the pilots who complained about her. Upon arrival she flew support for ships and barges transporting cargo around the city.\n\n\n== Death ==\nNechaeva died in aerial combat, protecting her squadron commander from an enemy attack over Stalingrad on 17 September 1942. After a successful mission where four enemy aircraft were shot down the squadron commander's plane was targeted on landing, but the Pe-2s they were escorting were able to reach their target. To save her squadron commander, Nechaeva took the enemy aircraft fire on herself.On 6 April 1985 she was posthumously was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War 2nd class. She is honored by a street in Volzhsky, Volgograd Oblast bearing her name as well as a school. Her name is listed in the Hall of Military Glory on Mamayev Kurgan.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLidiya Litvyak\nYekaterina Budanova\nRaisa Belyaeva\nAntonina Lebedeva\nMariya Kuznetsova\n\n\n== References ==",

The city lies on the western bank of the Volga River. Volgograd was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nThe Soviets' Battle of Stalingrad against invading German and its allied forces in World War II was one of the largest and bloodiest battles in the history of warfare. Known locally as the \"Hero City\", Volgograd today is the site of The Motherland Calls, an 85-metre high statue dedicated to the heroes of the battle. The city has many tourist attractions, such as museums, sandy beaches, and a self-propelled floating church. Its population was 1,021,215 at the 2010 Census, growing from 1,011,417 in the 2002 Census.   \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Tsaritsyn ===\nAlthough the city may have originated in 1555, documented evidence of Tsaritsyn at the confluence of the Tsaritsa and Volga rivers dates from 1589. Grigori Zasekin established the fortress Sary Su (the local Tatar-language name means \"yellow water\" or \"yellow river\") as part of the defences of the unstable southern border of the Tsardom of Russia. The structure stood slightly above the mouth of the Tsaritsa River on the right bank. It soon became the nucleus of a trading settlement.\nIn 1607 the fortress garrison rebelled for six months against the troops of Tsar Vasili Shuisky. In 1608 the first stone church was built in the city and was dedicated to St. John the Baptist. At the beginning of the 17th century, the garrison consisted of 350 to 400 people.\nIn 1670 troops of Stepan Razin captured the fortress; they left after a month. In 1708 the insurgent Cossack Kondraty Bulavin (died July 1708) held the fortress. In 1717 in the Kuban pogrom, raiders from the Kuban under the command of the Crimean Tatar Bakhti Gerai blockaded the town and enslaved thousands in the area. In August 1774 Yemelyan Pugachev unsuccessfully attempted to storm the city.\nIn 1691 Moscow established a customs-post at Tsaritsyn. In 1708 Tsaritsyn was assigned to the Kazan Governorate; in 1719 to the Astrakhan Governorate. According to the census in 1720, the city had a population of 408 people. In 1773 the settlement was designated as a provincial and district town. From 1779 it belonged to the Saratov Viceroyalty. In 1780 the city came under the newly established Saratov Governorate.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, Tsaritsyn became an important river-port and commercial centre. The population expanded rapidly, increasing from fewer than 3,000 people in 1807 to about 84,000 in 1900. The first railway reached the town in 1862. The first theatre opened in 1872, the first cinema in 1907. In 1913 Tsaritsyn got its first tram-line, and the city's first electric lights were installed in the city centre.\nDuring the Russian Civil War of 1917\u20131923, Tsaritsyn came under Soviet control from November 1917. In 1918 White Movement troops under Pyotr Krasnov, the Ataman of the Don Cossack Host, besieged Tsaritsyn. The Reds repulsed three assaults by the Whites. However, in June 1919 the White Armed Forces of South Russia, under the command of General Denikin, captured Tsaritsyn, and held it until January 1920. The fighting from July 1918 to January 1920 became known as the Battle for Tsaritsyn.\n\n\n=== Stalingrad ===\nOn April 10, 1925, the city was renamed Stalingrad, in honour of Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the Communist Party. This was officially to recognise the city and Stalin's role in its defence against the Whites between 1918 and 1920. In 1931, the German settlement-colony Old Sarepta (founded in 1765) became a district of Stalingrad. Renamed Krasnoarmeysky Rayon (or \"Red Army District\"), it was the largest area of the city.\nThe first higher education institute was opened in 1930. A year later, the Stalingrad Industrial Pedagogical Institute, now Volgograd State Pedagogical University, was opened.\nUnder Stalin, the city became a centre of heavy industry and transshipment by rail and river. During World War II, German and Axis forces attacked the city, and in 1942 it was the site of one of the pivotal battles of the war. The Battle of Stalingrad had perhaps the greatest casualty figures of any single battle in the history of warfare (estimates are between 1,250,000 and 1,798,619). \n\nThe battle began on August 23, 1942, and on the same day, the city suffered heavy aerial bombardment that reduced most of it to rubble. By September, the fighting reached the city centre. The fighting was of unprecedented intensity; the city's central railway station changed hands thirteen times, and the Mamayev Kurgan (one of the highest points of the city) was captured and recaptured eight times. \nBy early November, the German forces controlled 90 percent of the city and had cornered the Soviets in two narrow pockets, but they were unable to eliminate the last pockets of Soviet resistance before Soviet forces launched a huge counterattack on November 19. This resulted in the Soviet encirclement of the German Sixth Army and other Axis units. On January 31, 1943 the Sixth Army's commander, Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus, surrendered, and by February 2, with the elimination of straggling German troops, the Battle of Stalingrad was over.\nIn 1945 the Soviet Union awarded Stalingrad the title Hero City for its resistance. Great Britain's King George VI awarded the citizens of Stalingrad the jewelled \"Sword of Stalingrad\" in recognition of their bravery. \nA number of cities around the world (especially those that had suffered similar wartime devastation) established sister, friendship, and twinning links (see list below) in the spirit of solidarity or reconciliation. One of the first \"sister city\" projects was that established during World War II between Stalingrad and Coventry in the United Kingdom; both had suffered extensive devastation from aerial bombardment.\n\n\n=== Volgograd ===\n\nOn 10 November 1961, Nikita Khrushchev's administration changed the name of the city to Volgograd (\"Volga City\") as part of his programme of de-Stalinisation following Stalin's death. He was trying to reduce the \"cult of personality\". This action was and remains somewhat controversial, because Stalingrad has such importance as a symbol of resistance during World War II. \nDuring Konstantin Chernenko's brief administration in 1984, proposals were floated to revive the city's historic name for that reason. There is a strong degree of local support for a reversion, but  the Russian government has not accepted such proposals.\nOn May 21, 2007, the Communist Party obtained an important success in the Volgograd mayoral election. Communist candidate Roman Grebennikov was elected as mayor with 32.47% of the vote, a plurality. Grebennikov is Russia's youngest mayor of a federal subject administrative centre.\nIn 2010, Russian monarchists and leaders of the Orthodox organisations demanded that the city should take back its original name of Tsaritsyn, but the authorities rejected their proposal.\nOn January 30, 2013, the Volgograd City Council passed a measure to use the title \"Hero City Stalingrad\" in city statements on nine specific dates annually. On the following dates the title \"Hero City Stalingrad\" can officially be used in celebrations: \n\nFebruary 2 (end of the Battle of Stalingrad),\nFebruary 23 (Defender of the Fatherland Day),\nMay 9 (Victory Day),\nJune 22 (start of Operation Barbarossa),\nAugust 23 (start of the Battle of Stalingrad),\nSeptember 2 (Victory over Japan Day),\nNovember 19 (start of Operation Uranus),\nDecember 9 (Day of the Fatherland's Heroes)In addition, 50,000 people signed a petition to Vladimir Putin, asking that the city's name be permanently changed to Stalingrad. President Putin has replied that such a move should be preceded by a local referendum and that the Russian authorities will look into how to bring about such a referendum.\n\n\n=== Terrorist attacks ===\n\nOn August 24, 2004, the Volga-AviaExpress Flight 1353, a Tupolev Tu-134 aircraft flying from Moscow to Volgograd, exploded in mid-air and crashed as a result of a  suicide terrorist attack. 34 passengers and 9 crew members were on board the aircraft, all of whom died in the crash.  A Siberia Airlines flight bound for Sochi that day was also bombed, killing all 46 who were on board.\nAt approximately 2:00 p.m. on Monday 21 October 2013, Russian intelligence officers reported a bomb carried by a female suicide bomber exploded on a passenger bus carrying forty people, when it was stopped at the Lesobaza bus stop. Irina Gogolyeva, a spokesperson from the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry, reported that at least five people died in the blast and seventeen others were injured. On October 22, 2013, Vladimir Markin from Russia's investigative Committee reported that the suicide bomber had been identified as 30-year-old Naida Asiyalova of Dagestan.On December 29, 2013, a suicide bomb attack occurred at the Volgograd railway station, killing at least seventeen people. It is not clear how many bombers were involved or who they were. The following day a suicide bombing on a trolleybus killed at least fifteen people.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nIn 2011, the City Duma cancelled direct election of the mayor and confirmed the position of City Manager. This was short-lived, as in March 2012, Volgograd residents voted for relevant amendments to the city charter to reinstate the direct mayoral elections.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nVolgograd is the administrative center of Volgograd Oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Volgograd\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Volgograd is incorporated as Volgograd Urban Okrug.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nModern Volgograd remains an important industrial city. Industries include shipbuilding, oil refining, steel and aluminum production, manufacture of machinery and vehicles, and chemical production. The large Volgograd Hydroelectric Plant is a short distance to the north of Volgograd.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nVolgograd is a major railway junction served by the Privolzhskaya Railway. Rail links from the Volgograd railway station include Moscow; Saratov; Astrakhan; the Donbas region of Ukraine; the Caucasus  and Siberia. It stands at the east end of the Volga\u2013Don Canal, opened in 1952 to link the two great rivers of Southern Russia. European route E40, the longest European route connecting Calais in France with Ridder in Kazakhstan, passes through Volgograd. The M6 highway between Moscow and the Caspian Sea also passes through the city.  The Volgograd Bridge, under construction since 1995, was inaugurated in October 2009. The city river terminal is the centre for local passenger shipping along the Volga River.\nThe Volgograd International Airport provides air links to major Russian cities as well as Antalya, Yerevan and Aktau.\nVolgograd's public transport system includes a light rail service known as the Volgograd metrotram.  Local public transport is provided by buses, trolleybuses and trams.\nThe Volga River still is a very important communication channel.\nVolgograd hosts one of the few floating churches in the world: the floating church of Saint Vladimir of Volgograd.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Climate ==\nVolgograd has a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa). The city is only slightly warmer than Minneapolis (both in summer and winter, but transitional seasons are almost identical) at the same time that despite being taxed \"moist\" is drier than most of the climate of group D due to proximity to the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nA memorial complex commemorating the battle of Stalingrad, dominated by an immense allegorical sculpture The Motherland Calls, was erected on the Mamayev Kurgan, the hill that saw some of the most intense fighting during the battle.\nThe Panorama Museum sited on the Volga contains artifacts from World War II. These include a panoramic painting of the battlefield from the location of the monument on Mamayev Kurgan. A rifle of the famous sniper Vasily Zaytsev is also on display. \nThe Musical Instrument Museum is a branch of the Volgograd regional Museum of local lore.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHigher education facilities include:\n\nVolgograd State University\nVolgograd State Technical University (former Volgograd Polytechnical University)\nVolgograd State Agriculture University\nVolgograd State Medical University\nVolgograd State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering\nVolgograd Academy of Industry\nVolgograd Academy of Business Administration\nVolgograd State Pedagogical University\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nVolgograd was a host city to four matches of the FIFA World Cup in 2018. A new modern stadium, Volgograd Arena, was built for this occasion on the bank of the Volga River to serve as the venue. The stadium has a seating capacity for 45,000 people, including a press box, a VIP box and seats for people with limited mobility.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nVolgograd is twinned with:\n\nSeveral communities in France and Italy have streets or avenues named after Stalingrad, hence Place de Stalingrad in Paris and the eponymous Paris M\u00e9tro station of Stalingrad.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u211620/362 \u043e\u0442 29 \u0438\u044e\u043d\u044f 2005 \u0433. \u00ab\u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u00bb, \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u211632/1000 \u043e\u0442 15 \u0438\u044e\u043b\u044f 2015 \u0433. \u00ab\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u00bb. \u0412\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0432 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0443 10 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 2006 \u0433.

After World War II, millions of Russian soldiers were reported missing, or pronounced dead. In 1997, a Guard of Honour of the Kremlin Regiment (which had guarded the Lenin Mausoleum) was restored at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by the federal law of December 8, 1997, \"On Immortalizing the Soviet People\u2019s Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941\u20131945\". A Changing of the Guard Ceremony takes place every hour.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Tomb is located at the Kremlin Wall in the Alexander Garden in Moscow. The remains of the unknown soldiers killed in the Battle of Moscow in 1941 were initially buried in a mass grave of the Shtyki Memorial at the 40th km of the Leningrad highway at the city of Zelenograd. This was the location of the closest approach of the German armies to Moscow during the war. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the battle, in December 1966 these remains were relocated to the Kremlin Wall. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was designed by architects D. I. Burdin, V. A. Klimov, Yu. R. Rabayev and sculptor Nikolai Tomsky, and was unveiled to the public on May 8, 1967.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe dark red porphyry monument is decorated with a bronze sculpture of a laurel branch and a soldier's helmet laid upon a banner. In front of the monument, there is a five-pointed star in a square field of labradorite, which emanates the Eternal Flame from its center. The flame illuminates a bronze inscription \"\u0418\u043c\u044f \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0451 \u043d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043d\" (translit.: Imya tvoyo neizvestno, podvig tvoy bessmerten, \"Your name is unknown, your deed is immortal\").  The torch for the memorial's Eternal Flame was transported from Leningrad, where it had been lit from the Eternal Flame at the Monument to the Fighters of the Revolution on the Field of Mars. To the left of the tomb is a granite wall with an inlay stating: \"1941 \u2013 To Those Who Have Fallen For The Motherland \u2013 1945\".\nTo the right of the tomb, lining the walkway are dark red porphyry blocks with incapsulated soils from hero cities, Leningrad, Kiev, Stalingrad, Odessa, Sevastopol, Minsk, Kerch, Novorossiysk, Tula and Brest, Murmansk and Smolensk. The plate for \u201cStalingrad\u201d read \u201cVolgograd\u201d until September 2004. \nFurther to the right of these monuments is an obelisk in red granite, listing the names of 40 \u201cCities of Military Glory\u201d divided into groups of four. This monument was dedicated on May 8, 2010.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nTumarkin, Nina. The living & the dead: the rise and fall of the cult of World War II in Russia.

        "wiki": "The 1977 Moscow bombings were a series of three terrorist bombings in Moscow on 8 January 1977. The attacks killed seven people and seriously injured 37 others. No one claimed responsibility for the bombings, although three members of an Armenian nationalist organization were executed early in 1979 after a KGB investigation and a secret trial. Some Soviet dissidents said that the suspects had an alibi. Soon after the event Andrei Sakharov issued a public appeal, expressing concern that the bombings might \"be a new provocation on the part of the organs of repression\". According to historian Jay Bergman, \"who actually caused the explosion has never been determined conclusively\".\n\n\n== Bombings ==\nOn 8 January 1977, three bombs were detonated in Moscow. \nThe first exploded at 17:33 on a crowded train between the Izmailovskaya and Pervomaiskaya stations of the Moscow Metro. At 18:05, the second bomb detonated inside a grocery store close to KGB headquarters. Five minutes later, the third bomb exploded near another grocery store on 25 October Street, just a few hundred meters away from the headquarters of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.At that moment, and for the next two months, there was little public information about the explosions. The TASS news agency reported on 10 January 1977 that the explosion was not of great force, \"medical help was given to those suffering injury, and an investigation is being conducted\". Later, at meetings of Party activists, it was said that not long before the explosion in the underground on 8 January there had been two other explosions on 25 October Street.Only on 8 February 1979, after the trial and execution of the three convicted men, did a letter to Izvestia, the official newspaper of the Soviet government, indicate that the attacks had killed seven people and injured 37.\n\n\n== Investigation and trial ==\nSince this was a case of terrorism the official investigation was conducted by the KGB, rather than the Procurator General's Office.An initial suspect, named Potapov, was arrested in Tambov after setting off a bomb which killed his neighbour's wife and two daughters. After being arrested, Potapov confessed that he was also behind the acts of terrorism in Moscow. However, this turned out to have been a forced confession, and after an investigation lasting one month, this lead was dropped by KGB operatives.In October 1977, at Tashkent Airport, a KGB officer noticed a woman carrying a bag similar to a reconstructed picture of a bomb sent by the KGB to all local branches. It turned out that these bags were manufactured only in Yerevan. In November 1977, Stepan Zatikyan, a founding member of a splinter group of the National United Party, an underground Armenian nationalist organization, was arrested. His accomplices, Zaven Bagdasaryan and Hakop Stepanyan, were also taken into custody after an unsuccessful attempt to detonate a bomb at the Kursky Rail Terminal in Moscow.A secret trial followed. Zatikyan, Stepanyan, and Bagdasaryan were all found guilty on 24 January 1978 and executed five days later. The Supreme Court issued a brief statement, dated 31 January 1979, after the trial and execution, naming Zatikyan alone as the perpetrator. According to KGB general Philip Bobkov, any publications in Armenia about the bombings were blocked by Karen Demirchyan, the head of Soviet Armenia.\n\n\n== Alleged KGB involvement ==\nThe 8 January 1977 bombings occurred during systematic reprisals by the Soviet authorities against the Helsinki Groups in Moscow, Ukraine and Lithuania, set up to monitor the USSR's observance of the Helsinki Accords.On 10 January 1977, Soviet journalist Victor Louis (Vitaly Yevgenyevich Lui), a well known KGB agent provocateur, published an article in a British newspaper, hinting at the involvement of Soviet dissidents in the bombings. Several dissidents, including Albrekht, the secretary of the Soviet branch of Amnesty International, were threatened and interrogated by the KGB. (Soviet dissident Alexander Tarasov claimed to have been interrogated by a KGB investigator who tried to \"convince\" him that he was involved in the bombing. Without his strong alibi - he was confined at a hospital at the time of the bombings - \"it would be me who was executed instead of Zatikyan\", he said.) In response Andrei Sakharov wrote an \"Appeal to world community\", in which he requested an impartial investigation and suggested that the bombings might have been arranged by the KGB itself to discredit the entire Soviet dissident movement.\n\u2026 I cannot rid myself of the hunch that the explosion in the Moscow underground and the tragic deaths of individuals are a new provocation on the part of the organs of repression, and the most dangerous of recent years. Precisely this hunch, and the fears connected with it that this provocation could lead to changes in the whole internal climate of the country, have prompted me to write this article. I would be very glad if my thoughts turned out to be wrong \u2026\n\nIn an exchange with the deputy Procurator General, he added, \"I have serious grounds for concern. This is the provocation article in London Evening News by Victor Lui. These are arrests and interrogations of people who are clearly not related to the bombings. These are murders of last months, probably committed by the KGB which were not investigated. It is enough to mention only two of them: murder of poet Konstantin Bogatyrev and murder of lawyer Evgeni Brunov.\" After this statement, Sakharov was not only attacked in Soviet newspapers but also received threats by phone. Several people tried to break into his apartment, claiming to be relatives of those killed in the Metro.According to former KGB colonel Oleg Gordievsky, the three Armenians were selected as scapegoats for this terrorist act. He wrote, \"The case that most alarmed the KGB was the bombing of the Moscow subway by Armenian separatists in 1977. Three Armenians were later shot. It was rumored in the Center that, when the KGB and militia failed to track down those responsible, three other Armenian separatists had been selected as scapegoats in order to demonstrate that terrorists would always be caught and punished.\"In 1982, historians Michel Heller and Alexander Nekrich assert Zatikyan, Stepanyan, and Bagdasaryan had an alibi supported by multiple witnesses, and their execution was the first political execution in the Soviet Union after the death of Stalin.The Armenian dissident Sergei Grigoryants said in 2016 that KGB chief Yuri Andropov and Philipp Bobkov were responsible for the bombings.\n\n\n== Sakharov's letter to Brezhnev ==\nOn 30 January 1979, A. D. Sakharov wrote a letter to L. I. Brezhnev, about the trial of the three Armenian suspects:\nThere are strong grounds for fearing that a deliberate frame-up or a judicial mistake is taking place in this case. Zatikyan was not in Moscow at the time of the underground explosion \u2014 many witnesses can confirm his alibi. The investigation did not show any interest in clarifying this or other important circumstances. The trial, totally unnecessarily, was closed and secret, and even relatives did not know that it was taking place.

          "What a breath-taking location packed with Russian sculptures which are so powerful and monumental in scale; I have never seen anything like it. The changing of the guard is well worth a visit in the hall of the eternal flame, a circular building at the top of the site.",

The city lies on the western bank of the Volga River. Volgograd was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nThe Soviets' Battle of Stalingrad against invading German and its allied forces in World War II was one of the largest and bloodiest battles in the history of warfare. Known locally as the \"Hero City\", Volgograd today is the site of The Motherland Calls, an 85-metre high statue dedicated to the heroes of the battle. The city has many tourist attractions, such as museums, sandy beaches, and a self-propelled floating church. Its population was 1,021,215 at the 2010 Census, growing from 1,011,417 in the 2002 Census.   \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Tsaritsyn ===\nAlthough the city may have originated in 1555, documented evidence of Tsaritsyn at the confluence of the Tsaritsa and Volga rivers dates from 1589. Grigori Zasekin established the fortress Sary Su (the local Tatar-language name means \"yellow water\" or \"yellow river\") as part of the defences of the unstable southern border of the Tsardom of Russia. The structure stood slightly above the mouth of the Tsaritsa River on the right bank. It soon became the nucleus of a trading settlement.\nIn 1607 the fortress garrison rebelled for six months against the troops of Tsar Vasili Shuisky. In 1608 the first stone church was built in the city and was dedicated to St. John the Baptist. At the beginning of the 17th century, the garrison consisted of 350 to 400 people.\nIn 1670 troops of Stepan Razin captured the fortress; they left after a month. In 1708 the insurgent Cossack Kondraty Bulavin (died July 1708) held the fortress. In 1717 in the Kuban pogrom, raiders from the Kuban under the command of the Crimean Tatar Bakhti Gerai blockaded the town and enslaved thousands in the area. In August 1774 Yemelyan Pugachev unsuccessfully attempted to storm the city.\nIn 1691 Moscow established a customs-post at Tsaritsyn. In 1708 Tsaritsyn was assigned to the Kazan Governorate; in 1719 to the Astrakhan Governorate. According to the census in 1720, the city had a population of 408 people. In 1773 the settlement was designated as a provincial and district town. From 1779 it belonged to the Saratov Viceroyalty. In 1780 the city came under the newly established Saratov Governorate.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, Tsaritsyn became an important river-port and commercial centre. The population expanded rapidly, increasing from fewer than 3,000 people in 1807 to about 84,000 in 1900. The first railway reached the town in 1862. The first theatre opened in 1872, the first cinema in 1907. In 1913 Tsaritsyn got its first tram-line, and the city's first electric lights were installed in the city centre.\nDuring the Russian Civil War of 1917\u20131923, Tsaritsyn came under Soviet control from November 1917. In 1918 White Movement troops under Pyotr Krasnov, the Ataman of the Don Cossack Host, besieged Tsaritsyn. The Reds repulsed three assaults by the Whites. However, in June 1919 the White Armed Forces of South Russia, under the command of General Denikin, captured Tsaritsyn, and held it until January 1920. The fighting from July 1918 to January 1920 became known as the Battle for Tsaritsyn.\n\n\n=== Stalingrad ===\nOn April 10, 1925, the city was renamed Stalingrad, in honour of Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the Communist Party. This was officially to recognise the city and Stalin's role in its defence against the Whites between 1918 and 1920. In 1931, the German settlement-colony Old Sarepta (founded in 1765) became a district of Stalingrad. Renamed Krasnoarmeysky Rayon (or \"Red Army District\"), it was the largest area of the city.\nThe first higher education institute was opened in 1930. A year later, the Stalingrad Industrial Pedagogical Institute, now Volgograd State Pedagogical University, was opened.\nUnder Stalin, the city became a centre of heavy industry and transshipment by rail and river. During World War II, German and Axis forces attacked the city, and in 1942 it was the site of one of the pivotal battles of the war. The Battle of Stalingrad had perhaps the greatest casualty figures of any single battle in the history of warfare (estimates are between 1,250,000 and 1,798,619). \n\nThe battle began on August 23, 1942, and on the same day, the city suffered heavy aerial bombardment that reduced most of it to rubble. By September, the fighting reached the city centre. The fighting was of unprecedented intensity; the city's central railway station changed hands thirteen times, and the Mamayev Kurgan (one of the highest points of the city) was captured and recaptured eight times. \nBy early November, the German forces controlled 90 percent of the city and had cornered the Soviets in two narrow pockets, but they were unable to eliminate the last pockets of Soviet resistance before Soviet forces launched a huge counterattack on November 19. This resulted in the Soviet encirclement of the German Sixth Army and other Axis units. On January 31, 1943 the Sixth Army's commander, Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus, surrendered, and by February 2, with the elimination of straggling German troops, the Battle of Stalingrad was over.\nIn 1945 the Soviet Union awarded Stalingrad the title Hero City for its resistance. Great Britain's King George VI awarded the citizens of Stalingrad the jewelled \"Sword of Stalingrad\" in recognition of their bravery. \nA number of cities around the world (especially those that had suffered similar wartime devastation) established sister, friendship, and twinning links (see list below) in the spirit of solidarity or reconciliation. One of the first \"sister city\" projects was that established during World War II between Stalingrad and Coventry in the United Kingdom; both had suffered extensive devastation from aerial bombardment.\n\n\n=== Volgograd ===\n\nOn 10 November 1961, Nikita Khrushchev's administration changed the name of the city to Volgograd (\"Volga City\") as part of his programme of de-Stalinisation following Stalin's death. He was trying to reduce the \"cult of personality\". This action was and remains somewhat controversial, because Stalingrad has such importance as a symbol of resistance during World War II. \nDuring Konstantin Chernenko's brief administration in 1984, proposals were floated to revive the city's historic name for that reason. There is a strong degree of local support for a reversion, but  the Russian government has not accepted such proposals.\nOn May 21, 2007, the Communist Party obtained an important success in the Volgograd mayoral election. Communist candidate Roman Grebennikov was elected as mayor with 32.47% of the vote, a plurality. Grebennikov is Russia's youngest mayor of a federal subject administrative centre.\nIn 2010, Russian monarchists and leaders of the Orthodox organisations demanded that the city should take back its original name of Tsaritsyn, but the authorities rejected their proposal.\nOn January 30, 2013, the Volgograd City Council passed a measure to use the title \"Hero City Stalingrad\" in city statements on nine specific dates annually. On the following dates the title \"Hero City Stalingrad\" can officially be used in celebrations: \n\nFebruary 2 (end of the Battle of Stalingrad),\nFebruary 23 (Defender of the Fatherland Day),\nMay 9 (Victory Day),\nJune 22 (start of Operation Barbarossa),\nAugust 23 (start of the Battle of Stalingrad),\nSeptember 2 (Victory over Japan Day),\nNovember 19 (start of Operation Uranus),\nDecember 9 (Day of the Fatherland's Heroes)In addition, 50,000 people signed a petition to Vladimir Putin, asking that the city's name be permanently changed to Stalingrad. President Putin has replied that such a move should be preceded by a local referendum and that the Russian authorities will look into how to bring about such a referendum.\n\n\n=== Terrorist attacks ===\n\nOn August 24, 2004, the Volga-AviaExpress Flight 1353, a Tupolev Tu-134 aircraft flying from Moscow to Volgograd, exploded in mid-air and crashed as a result of a  suicide terrorist attack. 34 passengers and 9 crew members were on board the aircraft, all of whom died in the crash.  A Siberia Airlines flight bound for Sochi that day was also bombed, killing all 46 who were on board.\nAt approximately 2:00 p.m. on Monday 21 October 2013, Russian intelligence officers reported a bomb carried by a female suicide bomber exploded on a passenger bus carrying forty people, when it was stopped at the Lesobaza bus stop. Irina Gogolyeva, a spokesperson from the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry, reported that at least five people died in the blast and seventeen others were injured. On October 22, 2013, Vladimir Markin from Russia's investigative Committee reported that the suicide bomber had been identified as 30-year-old Naida Asiyalova of Dagestan.On December 29, 2013, a suicide bomb attack occurred at the Volgograd railway station, killing at least seventeen people. It is not clear how many bombers were involved or who they were. The following day a suicide bombing on a trolleybus killed at least fifteen people.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nIn 2011, the City Duma cancelled direct election of the mayor and confirmed the position of City Manager. This was short-lived, as in March 2012, Volgograd residents voted for relevant amendments to the city charter to reinstate the direct mayoral elections.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nVolgograd is the administrative center of Volgograd Oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Volgograd\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Volgograd is incorporated as Volgograd Urban Okrug.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nModern Volgograd remains an important industrial city. Industries include shipbuilding, oil refining, steel and aluminum production, manufacture of machinery and vehicles, and chemical production. The large Volgograd Hydroelectric Plant is a short distance to the north of Volgograd.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nVolgograd is a major railway junction served by the Privolzhskaya Railway. Rail links from the Volgograd railway station include Moscow; Saratov; Astrakhan; the Donbas region of Ukraine; the Caucasus  and Siberia. It stands at the east end of the Volga\u2013Don Canal, opened in 1952 to link the two great rivers of Southern Russia. European route E40, the longest European route connecting Calais in France with Ridder in Kazakhstan, passes through Volgograd. The M6 highway between Moscow and the Caspian Sea also passes through the city.  The Volgograd Bridge, under construction since 1995, was inaugurated in October 2009. The city river terminal is the centre for local passenger shipping along the Volga River.\nThe Volgograd International Airport provides air links to major Russian cities as well as Antalya, Yerevan and Aktau.\nVolgograd's public transport system includes a light rail service known as the Volgograd metrotram.  Local public transport is provided by buses, trolleybuses and trams.\nThe Volga River still is a very important communication channel.\nVolgograd hosts one of the few floating churches in the world: the floating church of Saint Vladimir of Volgograd.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Climate ==\nVolgograd has a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa). The city is only slightly warmer than Minneapolis (both in summer and winter, but transitional seasons are almost identical) at the same time that despite being taxed \"moist\" is drier than most of the climate of group D due to proximity to the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nA memorial complex commemorating the battle of Stalingrad, dominated by an immense allegorical sculpture The Motherland Calls, was erected on the Mamayev Kurgan, the hill that saw some of the most intense fighting during the battle.\nThe Panorama Museum sited on the Volga contains artifacts from World War II. These include a panoramic painting of the battlefield from the location of the monument on Mamayev Kurgan. A rifle of the famous sniper Vasily Zaytsev is also on display. \nThe Musical Instrument Museum is a branch of the Volgograd regional Museum of local lore.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHigher education facilities include:\n\nVolgograd State University\nVolgograd State Technical University (former Volgograd Polytechnical University)\nVolgograd State Agriculture University\nVolgograd State Medical University\nVolgograd State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering\nVolgograd Academy of Industry\nVolgograd Academy of Business Administration\nVolgograd State Pedagogical University\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nVolgograd was a host city to four matches of the FIFA World Cup in 2018. A new modern stadium, Volgograd Arena, was built for this occasion on the bank of the Volga River to serve as the venue. The stadium has a seating capacity for 45,000 people, including a press box, a VIP box and seats for people with limited mobility.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nVolgograd is twinned with:\n\nSeveral communities in France and Italy have streets or avenues named after Stalingrad, hence Place de Stalingrad in Paris and the eponymous Paris M\u00e9tro station of Stalingrad.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u211620/362 \u043e\u0442 29 \u0438\u044e\u043d\u044f 2005 \u0433. \u00ab\u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u00bb, \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u211632/1000 \u043e\u0442 15 \u0438\u044e\u043b\u044f 2015 \u0433. \u00ab\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u00bb. \u0412\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0432 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0443 10 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 2006 \u0433.

The city lies on the western bank of the Volga River. Volgograd was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nThe Soviets' Battle of Stalingrad against invading German and its allied forces in World War II was one of the largest and bloodiest battles in the history of warfare. Known locally as the \"Hero City\", Volgograd today is the site of The Motherland Calls, an 85-metre high statue dedicated to the heroes of the battle. The city has many tourist attractions, such as museums, sandy beaches, and a self-propelled floating church. Its population was 1,021,215 at the 2010 Census, growing from 1,011,417 in the 2002 Census.   \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Tsaritsyn ===\nAlthough the city may have originated in 1555, documented evidence of Tsaritsyn at the confluence of the Tsaritsa and Volga rivers dates from 1589. Grigori Zasekin established the fortress Sary Su (the local Tatar-language name means \"yellow water\" or \"yellow river\") as part of the defences of the unstable southern border of the Tsardom of Russia. The structure stood slightly above the mouth of the Tsaritsa River on the right bank. It soon became the nucleus of a trading settlement.\nIn 1607 the fortress garrison rebelled for six months against the troops of Tsar Vasili Shuisky. In 1608 the first stone church was built in the city and was dedicated to St. John the Baptist. At the beginning of the 17th century, the garrison consisted of 350 to 400 people.\nIn 1670 troops of Stepan Razin captured the fortress; they left after a month. In 1708 the insurgent Cossack Kondraty Bulavin (died July 1708) held the fortress. In 1717 in the Kuban pogrom, raiders from the Kuban under the command of the Crimean Tatar Bakhti Gerai blockaded the town and enslaved thousands in the area. In August 1774 Yemelyan Pugachev unsuccessfully attempted to storm the city.\nIn 1691 Moscow established a customs-post at Tsaritsyn. In 1708 Tsaritsyn was assigned to the Kazan Governorate; in 1719 to the Astrakhan Governorate. According to the census in 1720, the city had a population of 408 people. In 1773 the settlement was designated as a provincial and district town. From 1779 it belonged to the Saratov Viceroyalty. In 1780 the city came under the newly established Saratov Governorate.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, Tsaritsyn became an important river-port and commercial centre. The population expanded rapidly, increasing from fewer than 3,000 people in 1807 to about 84,000 in 1900. The first railway reached the town in 1862. The first theatre opened in 1872, the first cinema in 1907. In 1913 Tsaritsyn got its first tram-line, and the city's first electric lights were installed in the city centre.\nDuring the Russian Civil War of 1917\u20131923, Tsaritsyn came under Soviet control from November 1917. In 1918 White Movement troops under Pyotr Krasnov, the Ataman of the Don Cossack Host, besieged Tsaritsyn. The Reds repulsed three assaults by the Whites. However, in June 1919 the White Armed Forces of South Russia, under the command of General Denikin, captured Tsaritsyn, and held it until January 1920. The fighting from July 1918 to January 1920 became known as the Battle for Tsaritsyn.\n\n\n=== Stalingrad ===\nOn April 10, 1925, the city was renamed Stalingrad, in honour of Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the Communist Party. This was officially to recognise the city and Stalin's role in its defence against the Whites between 1918 and 1920. In 1931, the German settlement-colony Old Sarepta (founded in 1765) became a district of Stalingrad. Renamed Krasnoarmeysky Rayon (or \"Red Army District\"), it was the largest area of the city.\nThe first higher education institute was opened in 1930. A year later, the Stalingrad Industrial Pedagogical Institute, now Volgograd State Pedagogical University, was opened.\nUnder Stalin, the city became a centre of heavy industry and transshipment by rail and river. During World War II, German and Axis forces attacked the city, and in 1942 it was the site of one of the pivotal battles of the war. The Battle of Stalingrad had perhaps the greatest casualty figures of any single battle in the history of warfare (estimates are between 1,250,000 and 1,798,619). \n\nThe battle began on August 23, 1942, and on the same day, the city suffered heavy aerial bombardment that reduced most of it to rubble. By September, the fighting reached the city centre. The fighting was of unprecedented intensity; the city's central railway station changed hands thirteen times, and the Mamayev Kurgan (one of the highest points of the city) was captured and recaptured eight times. \nBy early November, the German forces controlled 90 percent of the city and had cornered the Soviets in two narrow pockets, but they were unable to eliminate the last pockets of Soviet resistance before Soviet forces launched a huge counterattack on November 19. This resulted in the Soviet encirclement of the German Sixth Army and other Axis units. On January 31, 1943 the Sixth Army's commander, Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus, surrendered, and by February 2, with the elimination of straggling German troops, the Battle of Stalingrad was over.\nIn 1945 the Soviet Union awarded Stalingrad the title Hero City for its resistance. Great Britain's King George VI awarded the citizens of Stalingrad the jewelled \"Sword of Stalingrad\" in recognition of their bravery. \nA number of cities around the world (especially those that had suffered similar wartime devastation) established sister, friendship, and twinning links (see list below) in the spirit of solidarity or reconciliation. One of the first \"sister city\" projects was that established during World War II between Stalingrad and Coventry in the United Kingdom; both had suffered extensive devastation from aerial bombardment.\n\n\n=== Volgograd ===\n\nOn 10 November 1961, Nikita Khrushchev's administration changed the name of the city to Volgograd (\"Volga City\") as part of his programme of de-Stalinisation following Stalin's death. He was trying to reduce the \"cult of personality\". This action was and remains somewhat controversial, because Stalingrad has such importance as a symbol of resistance during World War II. \nDuring Konstantin Chernenko's brief administration in 1984, proposals were floated to revive the city's historic name for that reason. There is a strong degree of local support for a reversion, but  the Russian government has not accepted such proposals.\nOn May 21, 2007, the Communist Party obtained an important success in the Volgograd mayoral election. Communist candidate Roman Grebennikov was elected as mayor with 32.47% of the vote, a plurality. Grebennikov is Russia's youngest mayor of a federal subject administrative centre.\nIn 2010, Russian monarchists and leaders of the Orthodox organisations demanded that the city should take back its original name of Tsaritsyn, but the authorities rejected their proposal.\nOn January 30, 2013, the Volgograd City Council passed a measure to use the title \"Hero City Stalingrad\" in city statements on nine specific dates annually. On the following dates the title \"Hero City Stalingrad\" can officially be used in celebrations: \n\nFebruary 2 (end of the Battle of Stalingrad),\nFebruary 23 (Defender of the Fatherland Day),\nMay 9 (Victory Day),\nJune 22 (start of Operation Barbarossa),\nAugust 23 (start of the Battle of Stalingrad),\nSeptember 2 (Victory over Japan Day),\nNovember 19 (start of Operation Uranus),\nDecember 9 (Day of the Fatherland's Heroes)In addition, 50,000 people signed a petition to Vladimir Putin, asking that the city's name be permanently changed to Stalingrad. President Putin has replied that such a move should be preceded by a local referendum and that the Russian authorities will look into how to bring about such a referendum.\n\n\n=== Terrorist attacks ===\n\nOn August 24, 2004, the Volga-AviaExpress Flight 1353, a Tupolev Tu-134 aircraft flying from Moscow to Volgograd, exploded in mid-air and crashed as a result of a  suicide terrorist attack. 34 passengers and 9 crew members were on board the aircraft, all of whom died in the crash.  A Siberia Airlines flight bound for Sochi that day was also bombed, killing all 46 who were on board.\nAt approximately 2:00 p.m. on Monday 21 October 2013, Russian intelligence officers reported a bomb carried by a female suicide bomber exploded on a passenger bus carrying forty people, when it was stopped at the Lesobaza bus stop. Irina Gogolyeva, a spokesperson from the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry, reported that at least five people died in the blast and seventeen others were injured. On October 22, 2013, Vladimir Markin from Russia's investigative Committee reported that the suicide bomber had been identified as 30-year-old Naida Asiyalova of Dagestan.On December 29, 2013, a suicide bomb attack occurred at the Volgograd railway station, killing at least seventeen people. It is not clear how many bombers were involved or who they were. The following day a suicide bombing on a trolleybus killed at least fifteen people.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nIn 2011, the City Duma cancelled direct election of the mayor and confirmed the position of City Manager. This was short-lived, as in March 2012, Volgograd residents voted for relevant amendments to the city charter to reinstate the direct mayoral elections.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nVolgograd is the administrative center of Volgograd Oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Volgograd\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Volgograd is incorporated as Volgograd Urban Okrug.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nModern Volgograd remains an important industrial city. Industries include shipbuilding, oil refining, steel and aluminum production, manufacture of machinery and vehicles, and chemical production. The large Volgograd Hydroelectric Plant is a short distance to the north of Volgograd.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nVolgograd is a major railway junction served by the Privolzhskaya Railway. Rail links from the Volgograd railway station include Moscow; Saratov; Astrakhan; the Donbas region of Ukraine; the Caucasus  and Siberia. It stands at the east end of the Volga\u2013Don Canal, opened in 1952 to link the two great rivers of Southern Russia. European route E40, the longest European route connecting Calais in France with Ridder in Kazakhstan, passes through Volgograd. The M6 highway between Moscow and the Caspian Sea also passes through the city.  The Volgograd Bridge, under construction since 1995, was inaugurated in October 2009. The city river terminal is the centre for local passenger shipping along the Volga River.\nThe Volgograd International Airport provides air links to major Russian cities as well as Antalya, Yerevan and Aktau.\nVolgograd's public transport system includes a light rail service known as the Volgograd metrotram.  Local public transport is provided by buses, trolleybuses and trams.\nThe Volga River still is a very important communication channel.\nVolgograd hosts one of the few floating churches in the world: the floating church of Saint Vladimir of Volgograd.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Climate ==\nVolgograd has a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa). The city is only slightly warmer than Minneapolis (both in summer and winter, but transitional seasons are almost identical) at the same time that despite being taxed \"moist\" is drier than most of the climate of group D due to proximity to the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nA memorial complex commemorating the battle of Stalingrad, dominated by an immense allegorical sculpture The Motherland Calls, was erected on the Mamayev Kurgan, the hill that saw some of the most intense fighting during the battle.\nThe Panorama Museum sited on the Volga contains artifacts from World War II. These include a panoramic painting of the battlefield from the location of the monument on Mamayev Kurgan. A rifle of the famous sniper Vasily Zaytsev is also on display. \nThe Musical Instrument Museum is a branch of the Volgograd regional Museum of local lore.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHigher education facilities include:\n\nVolgograd State University\nVolgograd State Technical University (former Volgograd Polytechnical University)\nVolgograd State Agriculture University\nVolgograd State Medical University\nVolgograd State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering\nVolgograd Academy of Industry\nVolgograd Academy of Business Administration\nVolgograd State Pedagogical University\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nVolgograd was a host city to four matches of the FIFA World Cup in 2018. A new modern stadium, Volgograd Arena, was built for this occasion on the bank of the Volga River to serve as the venue. The stadium has a seating capacity for 45,000 people, including a press box, a VIP box and seats for people with limited mobility.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nVolgograd is twinned with:\n\nSeveral communities in France and Italy have streets or avenues named after Stalingrad, hence Place de Stalingrad in Paris and the eponymous Paris M\u00e9tro station of Stalingrad.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u211620/362 \u043e\u0442 29 \u0438\u044e\u043d\u044f 2005 \u0433. \u00ab\u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u00bb, \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u211632/1000 \u043e\u0442 15 \u0438\u044e\u043b\u044f 2015 \u0433. \u00ab\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u00bb. \u0412\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0432 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0443 10 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 2006 \u0433.

        "wiki": "Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (born Ioseb Besarionis dz\u0435 Jugashvili; 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878 \u2013 5 March 1953) was the ruler of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953. He served as the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922\u20131952) and premier of the Soviet Union (1941\u20131953). Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a collective leadership, he eventually consolidated power to become the country's de facto dictator by the 1930s. A communist ideologically committed to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, Stalin formalised these ideas as Marxism\u2013Leninism, while his own policies are known as Stalinism.\nBorn to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire (now Georgia), Stalin joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, Pravda, and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings, and protection rackets. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the 1917 October Revolution and created a one-party state under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing Politburo. Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union's establishment in 1922, Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin's 1924 death. Under Stalin, \"socialism in one country\" became a central tenet of the party's dogma. Through the Five-Year Plans, the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, creating a centralised command economy. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the famine of 1932\u201333. To eradicate accused \"enemies of the working class\", Stalin instituted the \"Great Purge\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state.\nStalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements during the 1930s, particularly in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, it signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet Red Army repelled the German incursion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. The Soviets annexed the Baltic states and helped establish Soviet-aligned governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe, China, and North Korea. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global superpowers. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc and U.S.-backed Western Bloc which became known as the Cold War. Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it developed a nuclear weapon in 1949. In these years, the country experienced another major famine and an antisemitic campaign peaking in the doctors' plot. After Stalin's death in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who denounced him and initiated the de-Stalinisation of Soviet society.\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and socialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his totalitarian government has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repressions, ethnic cleansing, deportations, hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines that killed millions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Childhood to young adulthood: 1878\u20131899 ===\nStalin was born in the Georgian town of Gori, then part of the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire and home to a mix of Georgian, Armenian, Russian, and Jewish communities. He was born on 18 December [O.S. 6 Dec] 1878, and baptised on 29 December. His parents, Besarion Jughashvili and Ekaterine Geladze, were ethnically Georgian, and Stalin grew up speaking the Georgian language. He was their only child to survive past infancy, and was nicknamed \"Soso\", a diminutive of \"Ioseb\".Besarion was a shoemaker and owned his own workshop; it was initially a financial success, but later fell into decline, and the family found itself living in poverty. Besarion became an alcoholic, and drunkenly beat his wife and son. Ekaterine and Stalin left the home by 1883, and began a wandering life, moving through nine different rented rooms over the next decade. In 1886, they moved into the house of a family friend, Father Christopher Charkviani. Ekaterine worked as a house cleaner and launderer, and was determined to send her son to school. In September 1888, Stalin enrolled at the Gori Church School, a place secured by Charkviani. Although he got into many fights, Stalin excelled academically, displaying talent in painting and drama classes, writing his own poetry, and singing as a choirboy. Stalin faced several severe health problems; an 1884 smallpox infection left him with facial pock scars, and aged 12, he was seriously injured after being hit by a phaeton, which was the likely cause of a lifelong disability to his left arm.\n\nIn August 1894, Stalin enrolled in the Spiritual Seminary in Tiflis, enabled by a scholarship that allowed him to study at a reduced rate. Here he joined 600 trainee priests who boarded at the institution. Stalin was again academically successful and gained high grades. He continued writing poetry; five of his poems were published under the pseudonym of \"Soselo\" in Ilia Chavchavadze's newspaper Iveria ('Georgia'). Thematically, they dealt with topics like nature, land, and patriotism. According to Stalin's biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore they became \"minor Georgian classics\", and were included in various anthologies of Georgian poetry over the coming years. As he grew older, Stalin lost interest in priestly studies, his grades dropped, and he was repeatedly confined to a cell for his rebellious behaviour. The seminary's journal noted that he declared himself an atheist, stalked out of prayers and refused to doff his hat to monks.Stalin joined a forbidden book club at the school; he was particularly influenced by Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 pro-revolutionary novel What Is To Be Done?. Another influential text was Alexander Kazbegi's The Patricide, with Stalin adopting the nickname \"Koba\" from that of the book's bandit protagonist. He also read Capital, the 1867 book by German sociological theorist Karl Marx. Stalin devoted himself to Marx's socio-political theory, Marxism, which was then on the rise in Georgia, one of various forms of socialism opposed to the empire's governing Tsarist authorities. At night, he attended secret workers' meetings, and was introduced to Silibistro \"Silva\" Jibladze, the Marxist founder of Mesame Dasi ('Third Group'), a Georgian socialist group. Stalin left the seminary in April 1899 and never returned.\n\n\n=== Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party: 1899\u20131904 ===\nIn October 1899, Stalin began work as a meteorologist at a Tiflis observatory. He attracted a group of supporters through his classes in socialist theory, and co-organised a secret workers' mass meeting for May Day 1900, at which he successfully encouraged many of the men to take strike action. By this point, the empire's secret police \u2014 the Okhrana \u2014 were aware of Stalin's activities within Tiflis' revolutionary milieu. They attempted to arrest him in March 1901, but he escaped and went into hiding, living off the donations of friends and sympathisers. Remaining underground, he helped plan a demonstration for May Day 1901, in which 3,000 marchers clashed with the authorities. He continued to evade arrest by using aliases and sleeping in different apartments. In November 1901, he was elected to the Tiflis Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), a Marxist party founded in 1898.That month, Stalin travelled to the port city of Batumi. His militant rhetoric proved divisive among the city's Marxists, some of whom suspected that he might be an agent provocateur working for the government. He found employment at the Rothschild refinery storehouse, where he co-organised twice workers' strikes. After several strike leaders were arrested, he co-organised a mass public demonstration which led to the storming of the prison; troops fired upon the demonstrators, 13 of whom were killed. Stalin organised a second mass demonstration on the day of their funeral, before being arrested in April 1902. Held first in Batumi Prison, and then Kutaisi Prison, in mid-1903 Stalin was sentenced to three years of exile in eastern Siberia.Stalin left Batumi in October, arriving at the small Siberian town of Novaya Uda in late November. There, he lived in a two-room peasant's house, sleeping in the building's larder. He made two escape attempts; on the first he made it to Balagansk before returning due to frostbite. His second attempt, in January 1904, was successful and he made it to Tiflis. There, he co-edited a Georgian Marxist newspaper, Proletariatis Brdzola (\"Proletarian Struggle\"), with Philip Makharadze. He called for the Georgian Marxist movement to split off from its Russian counterpart, resulting in several RSDLP members accusing him of holding views contrary to the ethos of Marxist internationalism and calling for his expulsion from the party; he soon recanted his opinions. During his exile, the RSDLP had split between Vladimir Lenin's \"Bolsheviks\" and Julius Martov's \"Mensheviks\". Stalin detested many of the Mensheviks in Georgia and aligned himself with the Bolsheviks. Although Stalin established a Bolshevik stronghold in the mining town of Chiatura, Bolshevism remained a minority force in the Menshevik-dominated Georgian revolutionary scene.\n\n\n=== Revolution of 1905 and its aftermath: 1905\u20131912 ===\n\nIn January 1905, government troops massacred protesters in Saint Petersburg. Unrest soon spread across the Russian Empire in what came to be known as the Revolution of 1905. Georgia was particularly affected. Stalin was in Baku in February when ethnic violence broke out between Armenians and Azeris; at least 2,000 were killed. He publicly lambasted the \"pogroms against Jews and Armenians\" as being part of Tsar Nicholas II's attempts to \"buttress his despicable throne\". Stalin formed a Bolshevik Battle Squad which he used to try to keep Baku's warring ethnic factions apart; he also used the unrest as a cover for stealing printing equipment. Amid the growing violence throughout Georgia he formed further Battle Squads, with the Mensheviks doing the same. Stalin's Squads disarmed local police and troops, raided government arsenals, and raised funds through protection rackets on large local businesses and mines. They launched attacks on the government's Cossack troops and pro-Tsarist Black Hundreds, co-ordinating some of their operations with the Menshevik militia.In November 1905, the Georgian Bolsheviks elected Stalin as one of their delegates to a Bolshevik conference in Saint Petersburg. On arrival, he met Lenin's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya, who informed him that the venue had been moved to Tampere in the Grand Duchy of Finland. At the conference Stalin met Lenin for the first time. Although Stalin held Lenin in deep respect, he was vocal in his disagreement with Lenin's view that the Bolsheviks should field candidates for the forthcoming election to the State Duma; Stalin saw the parliamentary process as a waste of time. In April 1906, Stalin attended the RSDLP Fourth Congress in Stockholm; this was his first trip outside the Russian Empire. At the conference, the RSDLP\u2014then led by its Menshevik majority\u2014agreed that it would not raise funds using armed robbery. Lenin and Stalin disagreed with this decision, and later privately discussed how they could continue the robberies for the Bolshevik cause.Stalin married Kato Svanidze in a church ceremony at Senaki in July 1906. In March 1907 she bore a son, Yakov. By that year\u2014according to the historian Robert Service\u2014Stalin had established himself as \"Georgia's leading Bolshevik\". He attended the Fifth RSDLP Congress, held in London in May\u2013June 1907. After returning to Tiflis, Stalin organised the robbing of a large delivery of money to the Imperial Bank in June 1907. His gang ambushed the armed convoy in Yerevan Square with gunfire and home-made bombs. Around 40 people were killed, but all of his gang escaped alive.\nAfter the heist, Stalin settled in Baku with his wife and son. There, Mensheviks confronted Stalin about the robbery and voted to expel him from the RSDLP, but he took no notice of them.\n\nIn Baku, Stalin secured Bolshevik domination of the local RSDLP branch, and edited two Bolshevik newspapers, Bakinsky Proletary and Gudok (\"Whistle\"). In August 1907, he attended the Seventh Congress of the Second International\u2014an international socialist organisation\u2014in Stuttgart, Germany. In November 1907, his wife died of typhus, and he left his son with her family in Tiflis. In Baku he had reassembled his gang, the Outfit, which continued to attack Black Hundreds and raised finances by running protection rackets, counterfeiting currency, and carrying out robberies. They also kidnapped the children of several wealthy figures to extract ransom money. In early 1908, he travelled to the Swiss city of Geneva to meet with Lenin and the prominent Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov, although the latter exasperated him.In March 1908, Stalin was arrested and interned in Bailov Prison in Baku. There, he led the imprisoned Bolsheviks, organised discussion groups, and ordered the killing of suspected informants. He was eventually sentenced to two years exile in the village of Solvychegodsk, Vologda Province, arriving there in February 1909. In June, he escaped the village and made it to Kotlas disguised as a woman and from there to Saint Petersburg. In March 1910, he was arrested again, and sent back to Solvychegodsk. There he had affairs with at least two women; his landlady, Maria Kuzakova, who later gave birth to his second son, Konstantin. In June 1911, Stalin was given permission to move to Vologda, where he stayed for two months, having a relationship with Pelageya Onufrieva. He escaped to Saint Petersburg, where he was arrested in September 1911, and sentenced to a further three-year exile in Vologda.\n\n\n=== Rise to the Central Committee and editorship of Pravda: 1912\u20131917 ===\n\nIn January 1912, while Stalin was in exile, the first Bolshevik Central Committee had been elected at the Prague Conference. Shortly after the conference, Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev decided to co-opt Stalin to the committee. Still in Vologda, Stalin agreed, remaining a Central Committee member for the rest of his life. Lenin believed that Stalin, as a Georgian, would help secure support for the Bolsheviks from the Empire's minority ethnicities. In February 1912, Stalin again escaped to Saint Petersburg, tasked with converting the Bolshevik weekly newspaper, Zvezda (\"Star\") into a daily, Pravda (\"Truth\"). The new newspaper was launched in April 1912, although Stalin's role as editor was kept secret.In May 1912, he was arrested again and imprisoned in the Shpalerhy Prison, before being sentenced to three years exile in Siberia. In July, he arrived at the Siberian village of Narym, where he shared a room with fellow Bolshevik Yakov Sverdlov. After two months, Stalin and Sverdlov escaped back to Saint Petersburg.\nDuring a brief period back in Tiflis, Stalin and the Outfit planned the ambush of a mail coach, during which most of the group\u2014although not Stalin\u2014were apprehended by the authorities. Stalin returned to Saint Petersburg, where he continued editing and writing articles for Pravda.\n\nAfter the October 1912 Duma elections resulted in six Bolsheviks and six Mensheviks being elected, Stalin wrote articles calling for reconciliation between the two Marxist factions, for which he was criticised by Lenin. In late 1912, he twice crossed into the Austro-Hungarian Empire to visit Lenin in Krak\u00f3w, eventually bowing to Lenin's opposition to reunification with the Mensheviks. In January 1913, Stalin travelled to Vienna, where he conducted researches into the 'national question' of how the Bolsheviks should deal with the Russian Empire's national and ethnic minorities. Lenin, who encouraged Stalin to write up an article on the subject, wanted to attract these groups to the Bolshevik cause by offering them the right of secession from the Russian state, but at the same time hoped they would remain part of a future Bolshevik-governed Russia.Stalin's finished article was titled Marxism and the National Question, and first published in the March, April, and May 1913 issues of the Bolshevik journal Prosveshcheniye; Lenin was very happy with it. According to Montefiore, this was \"Stalin's most famous work\". The article was published under the pseudonym of \"K. Stalin\", a name he had been using since 1912. Derived from the Russian word for steel (stal), this has been translated as \"Man of Steel\"; Stalin may have intended it to imitate Lenin's pseudonym. Stalin retained this name for the rest of his life, possibly because it had been used on the article which established his reputation among the Bolsheviks.In February 1913, Stalin was arrested while back in Saint Petersburg. He was sentenced to four years exile in Turukhansk, a remote part of Siberia from which escape was particularly difficult. In August, he arrived in the village of Monastyrskoe, although after four weeks was relocated to the hamlet of Kostino. In March 1914, concerned over a potential escape attempt, the authorities moved Stalin to the hamlet of Kureika on the edge of the Arctic Circle. In the hamlet, Stalin had a relationship with Lidia Pereprygia, who was thirteen at the time and thus a year under the legal age of consent in Tsarist Russia. In or about December 1914, Pereprygia gave birth to Stalin's child, although the infant soon died. She gave birth to another of his children, Alexander, circa April 1917. In Kureika, Stalin lived closely with the indigenous Tunguses and Ostyak, and spent much of his time fishing.\n\n\n=== Russian Revolution: 1917 ===\nWhile Stalin was in exile, Russia entered the First World War, and in October 1916 Stalin and other exiled Bolsheviks were conscripted into the Russian Army, leaving for Monastyrskoe. They arrived in Krasnoyarsk in February 1917, where a medical examiner ruled Stalin unfit for military service due to his crippled arm. Stalin was required to serve four more months on his exile, and he successfully requested that he serve it in nearby Achinsk. Stalin was in the city when the February Revolution took place; uprisings broke out in Petrograd\u2014as Saint Petersburg had been renamed\u2014and Tsar Nicholas II abdicated to escape being violently overthrown. The Russian Empire became a de facto republic, headed by a Provisional Government dominated by liberals. In a celebratory mood, Stalin travelled by train to Petrograd in March. There, Stalin and fellow Bolshevik Lev Kamenev assumed control of Pravda, and Stalin was appointed the Bolshevik representative to the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, an influential council of the city's workers. In April, Stalin came third in the Bolshevik elections for the party's Central Committee; Lenin came first and Zinoviev came second. This reflected his senior standing in the party at the time.\n\nStalin helped organise the July Days uprising, an armed display of strength by Bolshevik supporters. After the demonstration was suppressed, the Provisional Government initiated a crackdown on the Bolsheviks, raiding Pravda. During this raid, Stalin smuggled Lenin out of the newspaper's office and took charge of the Bolshevik leader's safety, moving him between Petrograd safe houses before smuggling him to Razliv. In Lenin's absence, Stalin continued editing Pravda and served as acting leader of the Bolsheviks, overseeing the party's Sixth Congress, which was held covertly. Lenin began calling for the Bolsheviks to seize power by toppling the Provisional Government in a coup d'\u00e9tat. Stalin and fellow senior Bolshevik Leon Trotsky both endorsed Lenin's plan of action, but it was initially opposed by Kamenev and other party members. Lenin returned to Petrograd and secured a majority in favour of a coup at a meeting of the Central Committee on 10 October.On 24 October, police raided the Bolshevik newspaper offices, smashing machinery and presses; Stalin salvaged some of this equipment to continue his activities. In the early hours of 25 October, Stalin joined Lenin in a Central Committee meeting in the Smolny Institute, from where the Bolshevik coup\u2014the October Revolution\u2014was directed. Bolshevik militia seized Petrograd's electric power station, main post office, state bank, telephone exchange, and several bridges. A Bolshevik-controlled ship, the Aurora, opened fire on the Winter Palace; the Provisional Government's assembled delegates surrendered and were arrested by the Bolsheviks. Although he had been tasked with briefing the Bolshevik delegates of the Second Congress of Soviets about the developing situation, Stalin's role in the coup had not been publicly visible. Trotsky and other later Bolshevik opponents of Stalin used this as evidence that his role in the coup had been insignificant, although later historians reject this. According to the historian Oleg Khlevniuk, Stalin \"filled an important role [in the October Revolution]... as a senior Bolshevik, member of the party's Central Committee, and editor of its main newspaper\"; the historian Stephen Kotkin similarly noted that Stalin had been \"in the thick of events\" in the build-up to the coup.\n\n\n== In Lenin's government ==\n\n\n=== Consolidating power: 1917\u20131918 ===\nOn 26 October, Lenin declared himself Chairman of a new government, the Council of People's Commissars (\"Sovnarkom\"). Stalin backed Lenin's decision not to form a coalition with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionary Party, although they did form a coalition government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. Stalin became part of an informal foursome leading the government, alongside Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov; of these, Sverdlov was regularly absent, and died in March 1919. Stalin's office was based near to Lenin's in the Smolny Institute, and he and Trotsky were the only individuals allowed access to Lenin's study without an appointment. Although not so publicly well known as Lenin or Trotsky, Stalin's importance among the Bolsheviks grew. He co-signed Lenin's decrees shutting down hostile newspapers, and with Sverdlov chaired the sessions of the committee drafting a constitution for the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. He strongly supported Lenin's formation of the Cheka security service and the subsequent Red Terror that it initiated; noting that state violence had proved an effective tool for capitalist powers, he believed that it would prove the same for the Soviet government. Unlike senior Bolsheviks like Kamenev and Nikolai Bukharin, Stalin never expressed concern about the rapid growth and expansion of the Cheka and Terror.\n\nHaving dropped his editorship of Pravda, Stalin was appointed the People's Commissar for Nationalities. He took Nadezhda Alliluyeva as his secretary, and at some point married her, although the wedding date is unknown. In November 1917, he signed the Decree on Nationality, according ethnic and national minorities living in Russia the right of secession and self-determination. The decree's purpose was primarily strategic; the Bolsheviks wanted to gain favour among ethnic minorities but hoped that the latter would not actually desire independence. That month, he travelled to Helsinki to talk with the Finnish Social-Democrats, granting Finland's request for independence in December. His department allocated funds for the establishment of presses and schools in the languages of various ethnic minorities. Socialist Revolutionaries accused Stalin's talk of federalism and national self-determination as a front for Sovnarkom's centralising and imperialist policies.Due to the ongoing First World War, in which Russia was fighting the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary, Lenin's government relocated from Petrograd to Moscow in March 1918. There, they based themselves in the Kremlin; it was here that Stalin, Trotsky, Sverdlov, and Lenin lived. Stalin supported Lenin's desire to sign an armistice with the Central Powers regardless of the cost in territory. Stalin thought it necessary because\u2014unlike Lenin\u2014he was unconvinced that Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. Lenin eventually convinced the other senior Bolsheviks of his viewpoint, resulting in the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918. The treaty gave vast areas of land and resources to the Central Powers and angered many in Russia; the Left Socialist Revolutionaries withdrew from the coalition government over the issue. The governing RSDLP party was soon renamed, becoming the Russian Communist Party.\n\n\n=== Military Command: 1918\u20131921 ===\nAfter the Bolsheviks seized power, both right and left-wing armies rallied against them, generating the Russian Civil War. To secure access to the dwindling food supply, in May 1918 Sovnarkom sent Stalin to Tsaritsyn to take charge of food procurement in southern Russia. Eager to prove himself as a commander, once there he took control of regional military operations. He befriended two military figures, Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny, who would form the nucleus of his military and political support base. Believing that victory was assured by numerical superiority, he sent large numbers of Red Army troops into battle against the region's anti-Bolshevik White armies, resulting in heavy losses; Lenin was concerned by this costly tactic. In Tsaritsyn, Stalin commanded the local Cheka branch to execute suspected counter-revolutionaries, sometimes without trial, and\u2014in contravention of government orders\u2014purged the military and food collection agencies of middle-class specialists, some of whom he also executed. His use of state violence and terror was at a greater scale than most Bolshevik leaders approved of; for instance, he ordered several villages to be torched to ensure compliance with his food procurement program.\n\nIn December 1918, Stalin was sent to Perm to lead an inquiry into how Alexander Kolchak's White forces had been able to decimate Red troops based there. He returned to Moscow between January and March 1919, before being assigned to the Western Front at Petrograd. When the Red Third Regiment defected, he ordered the public execution of captured defectors. In September he was returned to the Southern Front. During the war, he proved his worth to the Central Committee, displaying decisiveness, determination, and a willingness to take on responsibility in conflict situations. At the same time, he disregarded orders and repeatedly threatened to resign when affronted. He was reprimanded by Lenin at the 8th Party Congress for employing tactics which resulted in far too many deaths of Red army soldiers. In November 1919, the government nonetheless awarded him the Order of the Red Banner for his wartime service.The Bolsheviks won the Russian civil war by the end of 1919. By that time, Sovnarkom had turned its attention to spreading proletarian revolution abroad, to this end forming the Communist International in March 1919; Stalin attended its inaugural ceremony. Although Stalin did not share Lenin's belief that Europe's proletariat were on the verge of revolution, he acknowledged that as long as it stood alone, Soviet Russia remained vulnerable. In December 1918, he drew up decrees recognising Marxist-governed Soviet republics in Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia; during the civil war these Marxist governments were overthrown and the Baltic countries became fully independent of Russia, an act Stalin regarded as illegitimate. In February 1920, he was appointed to head the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate; that same month he was also transferred to the Caucasian Front.Following earlier clashes between Polish and Russian troops, the Polish\u2013Soviet War broke out in early 1920, with the Poles invading Ukraine and taking Kiev on 7 May. On 26 May, Stalin was moved to Ukraine, on the Southwest Front. The Red Army retook Kiev on 10 June, and soon forced the Polish troops back into Poland. On 16 July, the Central Committee decided to take the war into Polish territory. Lenin believed that the Polish proletariat would rise up to support the Russians against J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski's Polish government. Stalin had cautioned against this; he believed that nationalism would lead the Polish working-classes to support their government's war effort. He also believed that the Red Army was ill-prepared to conduct an offensive war and that it would give White Armies a chance to resurface in Crimea, potentially reigniting the civil war. Stalin lost the argument, after which he accepted Lenin's decision and supported it. Along the Southwest Front, he became determined to conquer Lviv; in focusing on this goal he disobeyed orders in early August to transfer his troops to assist Mikhail Tukhachevsky's forces that were attacking Warsaw.In mid-August 1920, the Poles repulsed the Russian advance and Stalin returned to Moscow to attend the Politburo meeting. In Moscow, Lenin and Trotsky blamed him for his behavior in the Polish\u2013Soviet war. Stalin felt humiliated and under-appreciated; On 17 August, he demanded demission from the military, which was granted on 1 September. At the 9th Bolshevik Conference in late September, Trotsky accused Stalin of \"strategic mistakes\" in his handling of the war. Trotsky claimed that Stalin sabotaged the campaign by disobeying troop transfer orders. Lenin joined Trotsky in criticizing him, and nobody spoke on his behalf at the conference. Stalin felt disgraced and increased his antipathy toward Trotsky. The Polish-Soviet war finally ended on 18 March 1921, when a peace treaty was signed in Riga.\n\n\n=== Lenin's final years: 1921\u20131923 ===\n\nThe Soviet government sought to bring neighbouring states under its domination; in February 1921 it invaded the Menshevik-governed Georgia, while in April 1921, Stalin ordered the Red Army into Turkestan to reassert Russian state control. As People's Commissar for Nationalities, Stalin believed that each national and ethnic group should have the right to self-expression, facilitated through \"autonomous republics\" within the Russian state in which they could oversee various regional affairs. In taking this view, some Marxists accused him of bending too much to bourgeois nationalism, while others accused him of remaining too Russocentric by seeking to retain these nations within the Russian state.Stalin's native Caucasus posed a particular problem due to its highly multi-ethnic mix. Stalin opposed the idea of separate Georgian, Armenian, and Azerbaijani autonomous republics, arguing that these would likely oppress ethnic minorities within their respective territories; instead he called for a Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. The Georgian Communist Party opposed the idea, resulting in the Georgian Affair. In mid-1921, Stalin returned to the southern Caucasus, there calling on Georgian Communists to avoid the chauvinistic Georgian nationalism which marginalised the Abkhazian, Ossetian, and Adjarian minorities in Georgia. On this trip, Stalin met with his son Yakov, and brought him back to Moscow; Nadya had given birth to another of Stalin's sons, Vasily, in March 1921.After the civil war, workers' strikes and peasant uprisings broke out across Russia, largely in opposition to Sovnarkom's food requisitioning project; as an antidote, Lenin introduced market-oriented reforms: the New Economic Policy (NEP). There was also internal turmoil in the Communist Party, as Trotsky led a faction calling for the abolition of trade unions; Lenin opposed this and Stalin helped rally opposition to Trotsky's position. Stalin also agreed to supervise the Department of Agitation and Propaganda in the Central Committee Secretariat. At the 11th Party Congress in 1922, Lenin nominated Stalin as the party's new General Secretary. Although concerns were expressed that adopting this new post on top of his others would overstretch his workload and give him too much power, Stalin was appointed to the position. For Lenin, it was advantageous to have a key ally in this crucial post.\n\nIn May 1922, a massive stroke left Lenin partially paralyzed. Residing at his Gorki dacha, Lenin's main connection to Sovnarkom was through Stalin, who was a regular visitor. Lenin twice asked Stalin to procure poison so that he could commit suicide, but Stalin never did so. Despite this comradeship, Lenin disliked what he referred to as Stalin's \"Asiatic\" manner, and told his sister Maria that Stalin was \"not intelligent\". Lenin and Stalin argued on the issue of foreign trade; Lenin believed that the Soviet state should have a monopoly on foreign trade, but Stalin supported Grigori Sokolnikov's view that doing so was impractical at that stage. Another disagreement came over the Georgian Affair, with Lenin backing the Georgian Central Committee's desire for a Georgian Soviet Republic over Stalin's idea of a Transcaucasian one.They also disagreed on the nature of the Soviet state. Lenin called for establishment of a new federation named the \"Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia\", reflecting his desire for expansion across the two continents, and insisted that the Russian state should join this union on equal terms with the other Soviet states. Stalin believed this would encourage independence sentiment among non-Russians, instead arguing that ethnic minorities would be content as \"autonomous republics\" within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Lenin accused Stalin of \"Great Russian chauvinism\"; Stalin accused Lenin of \"national liberalism\". A compromise was reached, in which the federation would be renamed the \"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" (USSR). The USSR's formation was ratified in December 1922; although officially a federal system, all major decisions were taken by the governing Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow.Their differences also became personal; Lenin was particularly angered when Stalin was rude to his wife Krupskaya during a telephone conversation. In the final years of his life, Krupskaya provided governing figures with Lenin's Testament, a series of increasingly disparaging notes about Stalin. These criticised Stalin's rude manners and excessive power, suggesting that Stalin should be removed from the position of General Secretary. Some historians have questioned whether Lenin ever produced these, suggesting instead that they may have been written by Krupskaya, who had personal differences with Stalin; Stalin, however, never publicly voiced concerns about their authenticity.\n\n\n== Rise to power ==\n\n\n=== Succeeding Lenin: 1924\u20131927 ===\n\nLenin died in January 1924. Stalin took charge of the funeral and was one of its pallbearers; against the wishes of Lenin's widow, the Politburo embalmed his corpse and placed it within a mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square. It was incorporated into a growing personality cult devoted to Lenin, with Petrograd being renamed \"Leningrad\" that year. To bolster his image as a devoted Leninist, Stalin gave nine lectures at Sverdlov University on the \"Foundations of Leninism\", later published in book form. During the 13th Party Congress in May 1924, \"Lenin's Testament\" was read only to the leaders of the provincial delegations. Embarrassed by its contents, Stalin offered his resignation as General Secretary; this act of humility saved him and he was retained in the position.As General Secretary, Stalin had had a free hand in making appointments to his own staff, implanting his loyalists throughout the party and administration. Favouring new Communist Party members, many from worker and peasant backgrounds, to the \"Old Bolsheviks\" who tended to be university educated, he ensured he had loyalists dispersed across the country's regions. Stalin had much contact with young party functionaries, and the desire for promotion led many provincial figures to seek to impress Stalin and gain his favour. Stalin also developed close relations with the trio at the heart of the secret police (first the Cheka and then its replacement, the State Political Directorate): Felix Dzerzhinsky, Genrikh Yagoda, and Vyacheslav Menzhinsky. In his private life, he divided his time between his Kremlin apartment and a dacha at Zubalova; his wife gave birth to a daughter, Svetlana, in February 1926.In the wake of Lenin's death, various protagonists emerged in the struggle to become his successor: alongside Stalin was Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, and Mikhail Tomsky. Stalin saw Trotsky\u2014whom he personally despised\u2014as the main obstacle to his dominance within the party. While Lenin had been ill Stalin had forged an anti-Trotsky alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev. Although Zinoviev was concerned about Stalin's growing authority, he rallied behind him at the 13th Congress as a counterweight to Trotsky, who now led a party faction known as the Left Opposition. The Left Opposition believed the NEP conceded too much to capitalism; Stalin was called a \"rightist\" for his support of the policy. Stalin built up a retinue of his supporters in the Central Committee, while the Left Opposition were gradually removed from their positions of influence. He was supported in this by Bukharin, who like Stalin believed that the Left Opposition's proposals would plunge the Soviet Union into instability.\n\nIn late 1924, Stalin moved against Kamenev and Zinoviev, removing their supporters from key positions. In 1925, the two moved into open opposition to Stalin and Bukharin. At the 14th Party Congress in December, they launched an attack against Stalin's faction, but it was unsuccessful. Stalin in turn accused Kamenev and Zinoviev of reintroducing factionalism\u2014and thus instability\u2014into the party. In mid-1926, Kamenev and Zinoviev joined with Trotsky's supporters to form the United Opposition against Stalin; in October they agreed to stop factional activity under threat of expulsion, and later publicly recanted their views under Stalin's command. The factionalist arguments continued, with Stalin threatening to resign in October and then December 1926 and again in December 1927. In October 1927, Zinoviev and Trotsky were removed from the Central Committee; the latter was exiled to Kazakhstan and later deported from the country in 1929. Some of those United Opposition members who were repentant were later rehabilitated and returned to government.Stalin was now the party's supreme leader, although he was not the head of government, a task he entrusted to key ally Vyacheslav Molotov. Other important supporters on the Politburo were Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, and Sergo Ordzhonikidze, with Stalin ensuring his allies ran the various state institutions. According to Montefiore, at this point \"Stalin was the leader of the oligarchs but he was far from a dictator\". His growing influence was reflected in the naming of various locations after him; in June 1924 the Ukrainian mining town of Yuzovka became Stalino, and in April 1925, Tsaritsyn was renamed Stalingrad on the order of Mikhail Kalinin and Avel Enukidze.In 1926, Stalin published On Questions of Leninism. Here, he argued for the concept of \"Socialism in One Country\", which he presented as an orthodox Leninist perspective. It nevertheless clashed with established Bolshevik views that socialism could not be established in one country but could only be achieved globally through the process of world revolution. In 1927, there was some argument in the party over Soviet policy regarding China. Stalin had called for the Communist Party of China, led by Chen Duxiu, to ally itself with Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang (KMT) nationalists, viewing a Communist-Kuomintang alliance as the best bulwark against Japanese imperial expansionism. Instead, the KMT repressed the Communists and a civil war broke out between the two sides.\n\n\n=== Dekulakisation, collectivisation, and industrialisation: 1927\u20131931 ===\n\n\n==== Economic policy ====\n\nThe Soviet Union lagged behind the industrial development of Western countries, and there had been a shortfall of grain; 1927 produced only 70% of grain produced in 1926. Stalin's government feared attack from Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Poland, and Romania. Many Communists, including in Komsomol, OGPU, and the Red Army, were eager to be rid of the NEP and its market-oriented approach; they had concerns about those who profited from the policy: affluent peasants known as \"kulaks\" and the small business owners or \"Nepmen\". At this point, Stalin turned against the NEP, putting him on a course to the \"left\" even of Trotsky or Zinoviev.In early 1928 Stalin travelled to Novosibirsk, where he alleged that kulaks were hoarding their grain and ordered that the kulaks be arrested and their grain confiscated, with Stalin bringing much of the area's grain back to Moscow with him in February. At his command, grain procurement squads surfaced across Western Siberia and the Urals, with violence breaking out between these squads and the peasantry. Stalin announced that both kulaks and the \"middle peasants\" must be coerced into releasing their harvest. Bukharin and several other Central Committee members were angry that they had not been consulted about this measure, which they deemed rash. In January 1930, the Politburo approved the liquidation of the kulak class; accused kulaks were rounded up and exiled to other parts of the country or to concentration camps. Large numbers died during the journey. By July 1930, over 320,000 households had been affected by the de-kulakisation policy. According to Stalin biographer Dmitri Volkogonov, de-kulakisation was \"the first mass terror applied by Stalin in his own country\".\n\nIn 1929, the Politburo announced the mass collectivisation of agriculture, establishing both kolkhozy collective farms and sovkhoz state farms. Stalin barred kulaks from joining these collectives. Although officially voluntary, many peasants joined the collectives out of fear they would face the fate of the kulaks; others joined amid intimidation and violence from party loyalists.\nBy 1932, about 62% of households involved in agriculture were part of collectives, and by 1936 this had risen to 90%. Many of the collectivised peasants resented the loss of their private farmland, and productivity slumped. Famine broke out in many areas, with the Politburo frequently ordering the distribution of emergency food relief to these regions.Armed peasant uprisings against dekulakisation and collectivisation broke out in Ukraine, northern Caucasus, southern Russia, and central Asia, reaching their apex in March 1930; these were suppressed by the Red Army. Stalin responded to the uprisings with an article insisting that collectivisation was voluntary and blaming any violence and other excesses on local officials. Although he and Stalin had been close for many years, Bukharin expressed concerns about these policies; he regarded them as a return to Lenin's old \"war communism\" policy and believed that it would fail. By mid-1928 he was unable to rally sufficient support in the party to oppose the reforms. In November 1929 Stalin removed him from the Politburo.Officially, the Soviet Union had replaced the \"irrationality\" and \"wastefulness\" of a market economy with a planned economy organised along a long-term, precise, and scientific framework; in reality, Soviet economics were based on ad hoc commandments issued from the centre, often to make short-term targets. In 1928, the first five-year plan was launched, its main focus on boosting heavy industry; it was finished a year ahead of schedule, in 1932. The USSR underwent a massive economic transformation. New mines were opened, new cities like Magnitogorsk constructed, and work on the White Sea-Baltic Canal begun. Millions of peasants moved to the cities, although urban house building could not keep up with the demand. Large debts were accrued purchasing foreign-made machinery.Many of the major construction projects, including the White Sea-Baltic Canal and the Moscow Metro, were constructed largely through forced labour. The last elements of workers' control over industry were removed, with factory managers increasing their authority and receiving privileges and perks; Stalin defended wage disparity by pointing to Marx's argument that it was necessary during the lower stages of socialism. To promote the intensification of labour, a series of medals and awards as well as the Stakhanovite movement were introduced. Stalin's message was that socialism was being established in the USSR while capitalism was crumbling amid the Wall Street crash. His speeches and articles reflected his utopian vision of the Soviet Union rising to unparalleled heights of human development, creating a \"new Soviet person\".\n\n\n==== Cultural and foreign policy ====\nIn 1928, Stalin declared that class war between the proletariat and their enemies would intensify as socialism developed. He warned of a \"danger from the right\", including in the Communist Party itself. The first major show trial in the USSR was the Shakhty Trial of 1928, in which several middle-class \"industrial specialists\" were convicted of sabotage. From 1929 to 1930, further show trials were held to intimidate opposition: these included the Industrial Party Trial, Menshevik Trial, and Metro-Vickers Trial. Aware that the ethnic Russian majority may have concerns about being ruled by a Georgian, he promoted ethnic Russians throughout the state hierarchy and made the Russian language compulsory throughout schools and offices, albeit to be used in tandem with local languages in areas with non-Russian majorities. Nationalist sentiment among ethnic minorities was suppressed. Conservative social policies were promoted to enhance social discipline and boost population growth; this included a focus on strong family units and motherhood, the re-criminalisation of homosexuality, restrictions placed on abortion and divorce, and the abolition of the Zhenotdel women's department.\n\nStalin desired a \"cultural revolution\", entailing both the creation of a culture for the \"masses\" and the wider dissemination of previously elite culture. He oversaw the proliferation of schools, newspapers, and libraries, as well as the advancement of literacy and numeracy. \"Socialist realism\" was promoted throughout the arts, while Stalin personally wooed prominent writers, namely Maxim Gorky, Mikhail Sholokhov, and Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy. He also expressed patronage for scientists whose research fitted within his preconceived interpretation of Marxism; he for instance endorsed the research of agrobiologist Trofim Lysenko despite the fact that it was rejected by the majority of Lysenko's scientific peers as pseudo-scientific. The government's anti-religious campaign was re-intensified, with increased funding given to the League of Militant Atheists. Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist clergy faced persecution. Many religious buildings were demolished, most notably Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, destroyed in 1931 to make way for the (never completed) Palace of the Soviets. Religion retained an influence over much of the population; in the 1937 census, 57% of respondents identified as religious.Throughout the 1920s and beyond, Stalin placed a high priority on foreign policy. He personally met with a range of Western visitors, including George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, both of whom were impressed with him. Through the Communist International, Stalin's government exerted a strong influence over Marxist parties elsewhere in the world; initially, Stalin left the running of the organisation largely to Bukharin. At its 6th Congress in July 1928, Stalin informed delegates that the main threat to socialism came not from the right but from non-Marxist socialists and social democrats, whom he called \"social fascists\"; Stalin recognised that in many countries, the social democrats were the Marxist-Leninists' main rivals for working-class support. This preoccupation with opposing rival leftists concerned Bukharin, who regarded the growth of fascism and the far right across Europe as a far greater threat. After Bukharin's departure, Stalin placed the Communist International under the administration of Dmitry Manuilsky and Osip Piatnitsky.Stalin faced problems in his family life. In 1929, his son Yakov unsuccessfully attempted suicide; his failure earned Stalin's contempt. His relationship with Nadya was also strained amid their arguments and her mental health problems. In November 1932, after a group dinner in the Kremlin in which Stalin flirted with other women, Nadya shot herself.\nPublicly, the cause of death was given as appendicitis; Stalin also concealed the real cause of death from his children. Stalin's friends noted that he underwent a significant change following her suicide, becoming emotionally harder.\n\n\n=== Major crises: 1932\u20131939 ===\n\n\n==== Famine ====\n\nWithin the Soviet Union, there was widespread civic disgruntlement against Stalin's government. Social unrest, previously restricted largely to the countryside, was increasingly evident in urban areas, prompting Stalin to ease on some of his economic policies in 1932. In May 1932, he introduced a system of kolkhoz markets where peasants could trade their surplus produce. At the same time, penal sanctions became more severe; at Stalin's instigation, in August 1932 a decree was introduced meaning that the theft of even a handful of grain could be a capital offense. The second five-year plan had its production quotas reduced from that of the first, with the main emphasis now being on improving living conditions. It therefore emphasised the expansion of housing space and the production of consumer goods. Like its predecessor, this Plan was repeatedly amended to meet changing situations; there was for instance an increasing emphasis placed on armament production after Adolf Hitler became German Chancellor in 1933.The Soviet Union experienced a major famine which peaked in the winter of 1932\u201333; between five and seven million people died. Worst affected were Ukraine and the North Caucasus, although the famine also affected Kazakhstan and several Russian provinces. Historians have long debated whether Stalin's government had intended the famine to occur or not; there are no known documents in which Stalin or his government explicitly called for starvation to be used against the population. The 1931 and 1932 harvests had been poor ones due to weather conditions, and had followed several years in which lower productivity had resulted in a gradual decline in output. Government policies\u2014including the focus on rapid industrialisation, the socialisation of livestock, and the emphasis on sown areas over crop rotation\u2014exacerbated the problem; the state had also failed to build reserve grain stocks for such an emergency. Stalin blamed the famine on hostile elements and wreckers within the peasantry; his government provided small amounts of food to famine-struck rural areas, although this was wholly insufficient to deal with the levels of starvation. The Soviet government believed that food supplies should be prioritized for the urban workforce; for Stalin, the fate of Soviet industrialisation was far more important than the lives of the peasantry. Grain exports, which were a major means of Soviet payment for machinery, declined heavily. Stalin would not acknowledge that his policies had contributed to the famine, the existence of which was denied to foreign observers.\n\n\n==== Ideological and foreign affairs ====\nIn 1935\u201336, Stalin oversaw a new constitution; its dramatic liberal features were designed as propaganda weapons, for all power rested in the hands of Stalin and his Politburo. He declared that \"socialism, which is the first phase of communism, has basically been achieved in this country\". In 1938, The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), colloquially known as the Short Course, was released; Conquest later referred to it as the \"central text of Stalinism\". A number of authorised Stalin biographies were also published, although Stalin generally wanted to be portrayed as the embodiment of the Communist Party rather than have his life story explored. During the later 1930s, Stalin placed \"a few limits on the worship of his own greatness\". By 1938, Stalin's inner circle had gained a degree of stability, containing the personalities who would remain there until Stalin's death.\n\nSeeking improved international relations, in 1934 the Soviet Union secured membership of the League of Nations, of which it had previously been excluded. Stalin initiated confidential communications with Hitler in October 1933, shortly after the latter came to power in Germany. Stalin admired Hitler, particularly his manoeuvres to remove rivals within the Nazi Party in the Night of the Long Knives. Stalin nevertheless recognised the threat posed by fascism and sought to establish better links with the liberal democracies of Western Europe; in May 1935, the Soviets signed a treaty of mutual assistance with France and Czechoslovakia. At the Communist International's 7th Congress, held in July\u2013August 1935, the Soviet government encouraged Marxist-Leninists to unite with other leftists as part of a popular front against fascism. In turn, the anti-communist governments of Germany, Fascist Italy and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1936.When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936, the Soviets sent 648 aircraft and 407 tanks to the left-wing Republican faction; these were accompanied by 3000 Soviet troops and 42,000 members of the International Brigades set up by the Communist International. Stalin took a strong personal involvement in the Spanish situation. Germany and Italy backed the Nationalist faction, which was ultimately victorious in March 1939. With the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, the Soviet Union and China signed a non-aggression pact the following August. Stalin aided the Chinese as the KMT and the Communists had suspended their civil war and formed the desired United Front.\n\n\n==== The Great Terror ====\n\nStalin often gave conflicting signals regarding state repression. In May 1933, he released from prison many convicted of minor offenses, ordering the security services not to enact further mass arrests and deportations. In September 1934, he launched a commission to investigate false imprisonments; that same month he called for the execution of workers at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory accused of spying for Japan. This mixed approach began to change in December 1934, after prominent party member Sergey Kirov was murdered. After the murder, Stalin became increasingly concerned by the threat of assassination, improved his personal security, and rarely went out in public. State repression intensified after Kirov's death; Stalin instigated this, reflecting his prioritisation of security above other considerations. Stalin issued a decree establishing NKVD troikas which could mete out rulings without involving the courts. In 1935, he ordered the NKVD to expel suspected counter-revolutionaries from urban areas; in early 1935, over 11,000 were expelled from Leningrad. In 1936, Nikolai Yezhov became head of the NKVD.\nStalin orchestrated the arrest of many former opponents in the Communist Party as well as sitting members of the Central Committee: denounced as Western-backed mercenaries, many were imprisoned or exiled internally. The first Moscow Trial took place in August 1936; Kamenev and Zinoviev were among those accused of plotting assassinations, found guilty in a show trial, and executed. The second Moscow Show Trial took place in January 1937, and the third in March 1938, in which Bukharin and Rykov were accused of involvement in the alleged Trotskyite-Zinovievite terrorist plot and sentenced to death. By late 1937, all remnants of collective leadership were gone from the Politburo, which was controlled entirely by Stalin.\nThere were mass expulsions from the party, with Stalin commanding foreign communist parties to also purge anti-Stalinist elements.During the 1930s and 1940s, NKVD groups assassinated defectors and opponents abroad; in August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico, eliminating the last of Stalin's opponents among the former Party leadership. In May, this was followed by the arrest of most members of the military Supreme Command and mass arrests throughout the military, often on fabricated charges. These purges replaced most of the party's old guard with younger officials who did not remember a time before Stalin's leadership and who were regarded as more personally loyal to him. Party functionaries readily carried out their commands and sought to ingratiate themselves with Stalin to avoid becoming the victim of the purge. Such functionaries often carried out a greater number of arrests and executions than their quotas set by Stalin's central government.\n\nRepressions further intensified in December 1936 and remained at a high level until November 1938, a period known as the Great Purge. By the latter part of 1937, the purges had moved beyond the party and were affecting the wider population. In July 1937, the Politburo ordered a purge of \"anti-Soviet elements\" in society, targeting anti-Stalin Bolsheviks, former Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, priests, ex-White Army soldiers, and common criminals. That month, Stalin and Yezhov signed Order No. 00447, listing 268,950 people for arrest, of whom 75,950 were executed. He also initiated \"national operations\", the ethnic cleansing of non-Soviet ethnic groups\u2014among them Poles, Germans, Latvians, Finns, Greeks, Koreans, and Chinese\u2014through internal or external exile. During these years, approximately 1.6 million people were arrested, 700,000 were shot, and an unknown number died under NKVD torture.Stalin initiated all key decisions during the Terror, personally directing many of its operations and taking an interest in their implementation. His motives in doing so have been much debated by historians. His personal writings from the period were \u2014 according to Khlevniuk \u2014 \"unusually convoluted and incoherent\", filled with claims about enemies encircling him. He was particularly concerned at the success that right-wing forces had in overthrowing the leftist Spanish government, fearing a domestic fifth column in the event of future war with Japan and Germany. The Great Terror ended when Yezhov was removed as the head of the NKVD, to be replaced by Lavrentiy Beria, a man totally devoted to Stalin. Yezhov was arrested in April 1939 and executed in 1940. The Terror damaged the Soviet Union's reputation abroad, particularly among sympathetic leftists. As it wound down, Stalin sought to deflect responsibility from himself, blaming its \"excesses\" and \"violations of law\" on Yezhov. According to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research shows that the motivation behind the purges was not Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an over-exaggerated fear of counterrevolution.\n\n\n== World War II ==\n\n\n=== Pact with Nazi Germany: 1939\u20131941 ===\nAs a Marxist\u2013Leninist, Stalin expected an inevitable conflict between competing capitalist powers; after Nazi Germany annexed Austria and then part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, Stalin recognised a war was looming. He sought to maintain Soviet neutrality, hoping that a German war against France and Britain would lead to Soviet dominance in Europe. Militarily, the Soviets also faced a threat from the east, with Soviet troops clashing with the expansionist Japanese in the latter part of the 1930s. Stalin initiated a military build-up, with the Red Army more than doubling between January 1939 and June 1941, although in its haste to expand many of its officers were poorly trained. Between 1940 and 1941 he also purged the military, leaving it with a severe shortage of trained officers when war broke out.\n\nAs Britain and France seemed unwilling to commit to an alliance with the Soviet Union, Stalin saw a better deal with the Germans. On 3 May 1939, Stalin replaced his western-oriented foreign minister Maxim Litvinov with Vyacheslav Molotov. In May 1939, Germany began negotiations with the Soviets, proposing that Eastern Europe be divided between the two powers. Stalin saw this as an opportunity both for territorial expansion and temporary peace with Germany. In August 1939, the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with Germany, a non-aggression pact negotiated by Molotov and German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. A week later, Germany invaded Poland, sparking the UK and France to declare war on it. On 17 September, the Red Army entered eastern Poland, officially to restore order amid the collapse of the Polish state. On 28 September, Germany and the Soviet Union exchanged some of their newly conquered territories; Germany gained the linguistically Polish-dominated areas of Lublin Province and part of Warsaw Province while the Soviets gained Lithuania. A German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty was signed shortly after, in Stalin's presence. The two states continued trading, undermining the British blockade of Germany.The Soviets further demanded parts of eastern Finland, but the Finnish government refused. The Soviets invaded Finland in November 1939, yet despite numerical inferiority, the Finns kept the Red Army at bay. International opinion backed Finland, with the Soviets being expelled from the League of Nations. Embarrassed by their inability to defeat the Finns, the Soviets signed an interim peace treaty, in which they received territorial concessions from Finland. In June 1940, the Red Army occupied the Baltic states, which were forcibly merged into the Soviet Union in August; they also invaded and annexed Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, parts of Romania. The Soviets sought to forestall dissent in these new East European territories with mass repressions. One of the most noted instances was the Katyn massacre of April and May 1940, in which around 22,000 members of the Polish armed forces, police, and intelligentsia were executed.The speed of the German victory over and occupation of France in mid-1940 took Stalin by surprise. He increasingly focused on appeasement with the Germans to delay any conflict with them. After the Tripartite Pact was signed by Axis Powers Germany, Japan and Italy, in October 1940, Stalin proposed that the USSR also join the Axis alliance. To demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, in April 1941 the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Japan. Although de facto head of government for a decade and a half, Stalin concluded that relations with Germany had deteriorated to such an extent that he needed to deal with the problem as de jure head of government as well: on 6 May, Stalin replaced Molotov as Premier of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== German invasion: 1941\u20131942 ===\n\nIn June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, initiating the war on the Eastern Front. Although intelligence agencies had repeatedly warned him of Germany's intentions, Stalin was taken by surprise. He formed a State Defense Committee, which he headed as Supreme Commander, as well as a military Supreme Command (Stavka), with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff. The German tactic of blitzkrieg was initially highly effective; the Soviet air force in the western borderlands was destroyed within two days. The German Wehrmacht pushed deep into Soviet territory; soon, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and the Baltic states were under German occupation, and Leningrad was under siege; and Soviet refugees were flooding into Moscow and surrounding cities. By July, Germany's Luftwaffe was bombing Moscow, and by October the Wehrmacht was amassing for a full assault on the capital. Plans were made for the Soviet government to evacuate to Kuibyshev, although Stalin decided to remain in Moscow, believing his flight would damage troop morale. The German advance on Moscow was halted after two months of battle in increasingly harsh weather conditions.Going against the advice of Zhukov and other generals, Stalin emphasised attack over defence. In June 1941, he ordered a scorched earth policy of destroying infrastructure and food supplies before the Germans could seize them, also commanding the NKVD to kill around 100,000 political prisoners in areas the Wehrmacht approached. He purged the military command; several high-ranking figures were demoted or reassigned and others were arrested and executed. With Order No. 270, Stalin commanded soldiers risking capture to fight to the death describing the captured as traitors; among those taken as a prisoner of war by the Germans was Stalin's son Yakov, who died in their custody. Stalin issued Order No. 227 in July 1942, which directed that those retreating unauthorised would be placed in \"penal battalions\" used as cannon fodder on the front lines. Amid the fighting, both the German and Soviet armies disregarded the law of war set forth in the Geneva Conventions; the Soviets heavily publicised Nazi massacres of communists, Jews, and Romani. Stalin exploited Nazi anti-Semitism, and in April 1942 he sponsored the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC) to garner Jewish and foreign support for the Soviet war effort.\n\nThe Soviets allied with the United Kingdom and United States; although the US joined the war against Germany in 1941, little direct American assistance reached the Soviets until late 1942. Responding to the invasion, the Soviets intensified their industrial enterprises in central Russia, focusing almost entirely on production for the military. They achieved high levels of industrial productivity, outstripping that of Germany. During the war, Stalin was more tolerant of the Russian Orthodox Church, allowing it to resume some of its activities and meeting with Patriarch Sergius in September 1943. He also permitted a wider range of cultural expression, notably permitting formerly suppressed writers and artists like Anna Akhmatova and Dmitri Shostakovich to disperse their work more widely. The Internationale was dropped as the country's national anthem, to be replaced with a more patriotic song. The government increasingly promoted Pan-Slavist sentiment, while encouraging increased criticism of cosmopolitanism, particularly the idea of \"rootless cosmopolitanism\", an approach with particular repercussions for Soviet Jews. Comintern was dissolved in 1943, and Stalin encouraged foreign Marxist\u2013Leninist parties to emphasise nationalism over internationalism to broaden their domestic appeal.In April 1942, Stalin overrode Stavka by ordering the Soviets' first serious counter-attack, an attempt to seize German-held Kharkov in eastern Ukraine. This attack proved unsuccessful. That year, Hitler shifted his primary goal from an overall victory on the Eastern Front, to the goal of securing the oil fields in the southern Soviet Union crucial to a long-term German war effort. While Red Army generals saw evidence that Hitler would shift efforts south, Stalin considered this to be a flanking move in a renewed effort to take Moscow. In June 1942, the German Army began a major offensive in Southern Russia, threatening Stalingrad; Stalin ordered the Red Army to hold the city at all costs. This resulted in the protracted Battle of Stalingrad. In December 1942, he placed Konstantin Rokossovski in charge of holding the city. In February 1943, the German troops attacking Stalingrad surrendered. The Soviet victory there marked a major turning point in the war; in commemoration, Stalin declared himself Marshal of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Soviet counter-attack: 1942\u20131945 ===\n\nBy November 1942, the Soviets had begun to repulse the important German strategic southern campaign and, although there were 2.5 million Soviet casualties in that effort, it permitted the Soviets to take the offensive for most of the rest of the war on the Eastern Front. Germany attempted an encirclement attack at Kursk, which was successfully repulsed by the Soviets. By the end of 1943, the Soviets occupied half of the territory taken by the Germans from 1941 to 1942. Soviet military industrial output also had increased substantially from late 1941 to early 1943 after Stalin had moved factories well to the east of the front, safe from German invasion and aerial assault.In Allied countries, Stalin was increasingly depicted in a positive light over the course of the war. In 1941, the London Philharmonic Orchestra performed a concert to celebrate his birthday, and in 1942, Time magazine named him \"Man of the Year\". When Stalin learned that people in Western countries affectionately called him \"Uncle Joe\" he was initially offended, regarding it as undignified. There remained mutual suspicions between Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who were together known as the \"Big Three\". Churchill flew to Moscow to visit Stalin in August 1942 and again in October 1944. Stalin scarcely left Moscow throughout the war, with Roosevelt and Churchill frustrated with his reluctance to travel to meet them.In November 1943, Stalin met with Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, a location of Stalin's choosing. There, Stalin and Roosevelt got on well, with both desiring the post-war dismantling of the British Empire. At Tehran, the trio agreed that to prevent Germany rising to military prowess yet again, the German state should be broken up. Roosevelt and Churchill also agreed to Stalin's demand that the German city of K\u00f6nigsberg be declared Soviet territory. Stalin was impatient for the UK and US to open up a Western Front to take the pressure off of the East; they eventually did so in mid-1944. Stalin insisted that, after the war, the Soviet Union should incorporate the portions of Poland it occupied pursuant to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, which Churchill opposed. Discussing the fate of the Balkans, later in 1944 Churchill agreed to Stalin's suggestion that after the war, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia would come under the Soviet sphere of influence while Greece would come under that of the West.\n\nIn 1944, the Soviet Union made significant advances across Eastern Europe toward Germany, including Operation Bagration, a massive offensive in the Byelorussian SSR against the German Army Group Centre. In 1944 the German armies were pushed out of the Baltic states (with the execption of the Ostland), which were then re-annexed into the Soviet Union. As the Red Army reconquered the Caucasus and Crimea, various ethnic groups living in the region\u2014the Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingushi, Karachai, Balkars, and Crimean Tatars\u2014were accused of having collaborated with the Germans. Using the idea of collective responsibility as a basis, Stalin's government abolished their autonomous republics and between late 1943 and 1944 deported the majority of their populations to Central Asia and Siberia. Over one million people were deported as a result of the policy.In February 1945, the three leaders met at the Yalta Conference. Roosevelt and Churchill conceded to Stalin's demand that Germany pay the Soviet Union 20 billion dollars in reparations, and that his country be permitted to annex Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands in exchange for entering the war against Japan. An agreement was also made that a post-war Polish government should be a coalition consisting of both communist and conservative elements. Privately, Stalin sought to ensure that Poland would come fully under Soviet influence. The Red Army withheld assistance to Polish resistance fighters battling the Germans in the Warsaw Uprising, with Stalin believing that any victorious Polish militants could interfere with his aspirations to dominate Poland through a future Marxist government. Although concealing his desires from the other Allied leaders, Stalin placed great emphasis on capturing Berlin first, believing that this would enable him to bring more of Europe under long-term Soviet control. Churchill was concerned that this was the case, and unsuccessfully tried to convince the US that the Western Allies should pursue the same goal.\n\n\n=== Victory: 1945 ===\n\nIn April 1945, the Red Army seized Berlin, Hitler committed suicide, and Germany surrendered in May. Stalin had wanted Hitler captured alive; he had his remains brought to Moscow to prevent them becoming a relic for Nazi sympathisers. As the Red Army had conquered German territory, they discovered the extermination camps that the Nazi administration had run. Many Soviet soldiers engaged in looting, pillaging, and rape, both in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe. Stalin refused to punish the offenders. After receiving a complaint about this from Yugoslav communist Milovan Djilas, Stalin asked how after experiencing the traumas of war a soldier could \"react normally? And what is so awful in his having fun with a woman, after such horrors?\"With Germany defeated, Stalin switched focus to the war with Japan, transferring half a million troops to the Far East. Stalin was pressed by his allies to enter the war and wanted to cement the Soviet Union's strategic position in Asia. On 8 August, in between the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet army invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria and defeated the Kwantung Army. These events led to the Japanese surrender and the war's end. Soviet forces continued to expand until they occupied all their territorial concessions, but the U.S. rebuffed Stalin's desire for the Red Army to take a role in the Allied occupation of Japan.Stalin attended the Potsdam Conference in July\u2013August 1945, alongside his new British and U.S. counterparts, Prime Minister Clement Attlee and President Harry Truman. At the conference, Stalin repeated previous promises to Churchill that he would refrain from a \"Sovietization\" of Eastern Europe. Stalin pushed for reparations from Germany without regard to the base minimum supply for German citizens' survival, which worried Truman and Churchill who thought that Germany would become a financial burden for Western powers. He also pushed for \"war booty\", which would permit the Soviet Union to directly seize property from conquered nations without quantitative or qualitative limitation, and a clause was added permitting this to occur with some limitations. Germany was divided into four zones: Soviet, U.S., British, and French, with Berlin itself\u2014located within the Soviet area\u2014also subdivided thusly.\n\n\n== Post-war era ==\n\n\n=== Post-war reconstruction and famine: 1945\u20131947 ===\nAfter the war, Stalin was\u2014according to Service\u2014at the \"apex of his career\". Within the Soviet Union he was widely regarded as the embodiment of victory and patriotism. His armies controlled Central and Eastern Europe up to the River Elbe.\nIn June 1945, Stalin adopted the title of Generalissimus, and stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum to watch a celebratory parade led by Zhukov through Red Square. At a banquet held for army commanders, he described the Russian people as \"the outstanding nation\" and \"leading force\" within the Soviet Union, the first time that he had unequivocally endorsed the Russians over other Soviet nationalities. In 1946, the state published Stalin's Collected Works. In 1947, it brought out a second edition of his official biography, which eulogised him to a greater extent than its predecessor. He was quoted in Pravda on a daily basis and pictures of him remained pervasive on the walls of workplaces and homes.\n\nDespite his strengthened international position, Stalin was cautious about internal dissent and desire for change among the population. He was also concerned about his returning armies, who had been exposed to a wide range of consumer goods in Germany, much of which they had looted and brought back with them. In this he recalled the 1825 Decembrist Revolt by Russian soldiers returning from having defeated France in the Napoleonic Wars. He ensured that returning Soviet prisoners of war went through \"filtration\" camps as they arrived in the Soviet Union, in which 2,775,700 were interrogated to determine if they were traitors. About half were then imprisoned in labour camps. In the Baltic states, where there was much opposition to Soviet rule, de-kulakisation and de-clericalisation programs were initiated, resulting in 142,000 deportations between 1945 and 1949. The Gulag system of labour camps was expanded further. By January 1953, three percent of the Soviet population was imprisoned or in internal exile, with 2.8 million in \"special settlements\" in isolated areas and another 2.5 million in camps, penal colonies, and prisons.The NKVD were ordered to catalogue the scale of destruction during the war. It was established that 1,710 Soviet towns and 70,000 villages had been destroyed. The NKVD recorded that between 26 and 27 million Soviet citizens had been killed, with millions more being wounded, malnourished, or orphaned. In the war's aftermath, some of Stalin's associates suggested modifications to government policy. Post-war Soviet society was more tolerant than its pre-war phase in various respects. Stalin allowed the Russian Orthodox Church to retain the churches it had opened during the war. Academia and the arts were also allowed greater freedom than they had prior to 1941. Recognising the need for drastic steps to be taken to combat inflation and promote economic regeneration, in December 1947 Stalin's government devalued the ruble and abolished the ration-book system. Capital punishment was abolished in 1947 but reinstalled in 1950.Stalin's health was deteriorating, and heart problems forced a two-month vacation in the latter part of 1945.\nHe grew increasingly concerned that senior political and military figures might try to oust him; he prevented any of them from becoming powerful enough to rival him and had their apartments bugged with listening devices. He demoted Molotov, and increasingly favoured Beria and Malenkov for key positions. In 1949, he brought Nikita Khrushchev from Ukraine to Moscow, appointing him a Central Committee secretary and the head of the city's party branch. In the Leningrad Affair, the city's leadership was purged amid accusations of treachery; executions of many of the accused took place in 1950.In the post-war period there were often food shortages in Soviet cities, and the USSR experienced a major famine from 1946 to 1947. Sparked by a drought and ensuing bad harvest in 1946, it was exacerbated by government policy towards food procurement, including the state's decision to build up stocks and export food internationally rather than distributing it to famine hit areas. Current estimates indicate that between one million and 1.5 million people died from malnutrition or disease as a result. While agricultural production stagnated, Stalin focused on a series of major infrastructure projects, including the construction of hydroelectric plants, canals, and railway lines running to the polar north. Much of this was constructed by prison labour.\n\n\n=== Cold War policy: 1947\u20131950 ===\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War, the British Empire declined, leaving the U.S. and USSR as the dominant world powers. Tensions among these former Allies grew, resulting in the Cold War. Although Stalin publicly described the British and U.S. governments as aggressive, he thought it unlikely that a war with them would be imminent, believing that several decades of peace was likely. He nevertheless secretly intensified Soviet research into nuclear weaponry, intent on creating an atom bomb. Still, Stalin foresaw the undesirability of a nuclear conflict, saying in 1949 that \"atomic weapons can hardly be used without spelling the end of the world.\" He personally took a keen interest in the development of the weapon. In August 1949, the bomb was successfully tested in the deserts outside Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan. Stalin also initiated a new military build-up; the Soviet army was expanded from 2.9 million soldiers, as it stood in 1949, to 5.8 million by 1953.The US began pushing its interests on every continent, acquiring air force bases in Africa and Asia and ensuring pro-U.S. regimes took power across Latin America. It launched the Marshall Plan in June 1947, with which it sought to undermine Soviet hegemony in eastern Europe. The US also offered financial assistance as part of the Marshall Plan on the condition that they opened their markets to trade, aware that the Soviets would never agree.\nThe Allies demanded that Stalin withdraw the Red Army from northern Iran. He initially refused, leading to an international crisis in 1946, but one year later Stalin finally relented and moved the Soviet troops out.\nStalin also tried to maximise Soviet influence on the world stage, unsuccessfully pushing for Libya\u2014recently liberated from Italian occupation\u2014to become a Soviet protectorate. He sent Molotov as his representative to San Francisco to take part in negotiations to form the United Nations, insisting that the Soviets have a place on the Security Council. In April 1949, the Western powers established the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), an international military alliance of capitalist countries. Within Western countries, Stalin was increasingly portrayed as the \"most evil dictator alive\" and compared to Hitler.In 1948, Stalin edited and rewrote sections of Falsifiers of History, published as a series of Pravda articles in February 1948 and then in book form. Written in response to public revelations of the 1939 Soviet alliance with Germany, it focused on blaming Western powers for the war. He erroneously claimed that the initial German advance in the early part of the war was not a result of Soviet military weakness, but rather a deliberate Soviet strategic retreat. In 1949, celebrations took place to mark Stalin's seventieth birthday (albeit not the correct year) at which Stalin attended an event in the Bolshoi Theatre alongside Marxist\u2013Leninist leaders from across Europe and Asia.\n\n\n==== Eastern Bloc ====\n\nAfter the war, Stalin sought to retain Soviet dominance across Eastern Europe while expanding its influence in Asia. Cautiously regarding the responses from the Western Allies, Stalin avoided immediately installing Communist Party governments across Eastern Europe, instead initially ensuring that Marxist-Leninists were placed in coalition ministries. In contrast to his approach to the Baltic states, he rejected the proposal of merging the new communist states into the Soviet Union, rather recognising them as independent nation-states.\nHe was faced with the problem that there were few Marxists left in Eastern Europe, with most having been killed by the Nazis. He demanded that war reparations be paid by Germany and its Axis allies Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak Republic. Aware that these countries had been pushed toward socialism through invasion rather than by proletarian revolution, Stalin referred to them not as \"dictatorships of the proletariat\" but as \"people's democracies\", suggesting that in these countries there was a pro-socialist alliance combining the proletariat, peasantry, and lower middle-class.Churchill observed that an \"Iron Curtain\" had been drawn across Europe, separating the east from the west. In September 1947, a meeting of East European communist leaders was held in Szklarska Por\u0119ba, Poland, from which was formed Cominform to co-ordinate the Communist Parties across Eastern Europe and also in France and Italy. Stalin did not personally attend the meeting, sending Zhdanov in his place. Various East European communists also visited Stalin in Moscow. There, he offered advice on their ideas; for instance he cautioned against the Yugoslav idea for a Balkan federation incorporating Bulgaria and Albania. Stalin had a particularly strained relationship with Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito due to the latter's continued calls for Balkan federation and for Soviet aid for the communist forces in the ongoing Greek Civil War. In March 1948, Stalin launched an anti-Tito campaign, accusing the Yugoslav communists of adventurism and deviating from Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine. At the second Cominform conference, held in Bucharest in June 1948, East European communist leaders all denounced Tito's government, accusing them of being fascists and agents of Western capitalism. Stalin ordered several assassination attempts on Tito's life and contemplated invading Yugoslavia.Stalin suggested that a unified, but demilitarised, German state be established, hoping that it would either come under Soviet influence or remain neutral. When the US and UK remained opposed to this, Stalin sought to force their hand by blockading Berlin in June 1948. He gambled that the others would not risk war, but they airlifted supplies into West Berlin until May 1949, when Stalin relented and ended the blockade. In September 1949 the Western powers transformed Western Germany into an independent Federal Republic of Germany; in response the Soviets formed East Germany into the German Democratic Republic in October. In accordance with their earlier agreements, the Western powers expected Poland to become an independent state with free democratic elections. In Poland, the Soviets merged various socialist parties into the Polish United Workers' Party, and vote rigging was used to ensure that it secured office. The 1947 Hungarian elections were also rigged, with the Hungarian Working People's Party taking control. In Czechoslovakia, where the communists did have a level of popular support, they were elected the largest party in 1946. Monarchy was abolished in Bulgaria and Romania. Across Eastern Europe, the Soviet model was enforced, with a termination of political pluralism, agricultural collectivisation, and investment in heavy industry. It was aimed for economic autarky within the Eastern Bloc.\n\n\n==== Asia ====\nIn October 1949, Mao took power in China. With this accomplished, Marxist governments now controlled a third of the world's land mass. Privately, Stalin revealed that he had underestimated the Chinese Communists and their ability to win the civil war, instead encouraging them to make another peace with the KMT. In December 1949, Mao visited Stalin. Initially Stalin refused to repeal the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945, which significantly benefited the Soviet Union over China, although in January 1950 he relented and agreed to sign a new treaty between the two countries. Stalin was concerned that Mao might follow Tito's example by pursuing a course independent of Soviet influence, and made it known that if displeased he would withdraw assistance from China; the Chinese desperately needed said assistance after decades of civil war.At the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the United States divided up the Korean Peninsula, formerly a Japanese colonial possession, along the 38th parallel, setting up a communist government in the north and a pro-Western government in the south. North Korean leader Kim Il-sung visited Stalin in March 1949 and again in March 1950; he wanted to invade the south and although Stalin was initially reluctant to provide support, he eventually agreed by May 1950. The North Korean Army launched the Korean War by invading the south in June 1950, making swift gains and capturing Seoul. Both Stalin and Mao believed that a swift victory would ensue. The U.S. went to the UN Security Council\u2014which the Soviets were boycotting over its refusal to recognise Mao's government\u2014and secured military support for the South Koreans. U.S. led forces pushed the North Koreans back. Stalin wanted to avoid direct Soviet conflict with the U.S., convincing the Chinese to aid the North.The Soviet Union was one of the first nations to extend diplomatic recognition to the newly created state of Israel in 1948. When the Israeli ambassador Golda Meir arrived in the USSR, Stalin was angered by the Jewish crowds who gathered to greet her. He was further angered by Israel's growing alliance with the U.S. After Stalin fell out with Israel, he launched an anti-Jewish campaign within the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. In November 1948, he abolished the JAC, and show trials took place for some of its members. The Soviet press engaged in attacks on Zionism, Jewish culture, and \"rootless cosmopolitanism\", with growing levels of anti-Semitism being expressed across Soviet society. Stalin's increasing tolerance of anti-Semitism may have stemmed from his increasing Russian nationalism or from the recognition that anti-Semitism had proved a useful mobilising tool for Hitler and that he could do the same; he may have increasingly viewed the Jewish people as a \"counter-revolutionary\" nation whose members were loyal to the U.S. There were rumours, although they have never been substantiated, that Stalin was planning on deporting all Soviet Jews to the Jewish Autonomous Region in Birobidzhan, eastern Siberia.\n\n\n=== Final years: 1950\u20131953 ===\nIn his later years, Stalin was in poor health. He took increasingly long holidays; in 1950 and again in 1951 he spent almost five months vacationing at his Abkhazian dacha. Stalin nevertheless mistrusted his doctors; in January 1952 he had one imprisoned after they suggested that he should retire to improve his health. In September 1952, several Kremlin doctors were arrested for allegedly plotting to kill senior politicians in what came to be known as the Doctors' Plot; the majority of the accused were Jewish. He instructed the arrested doctors to be tortured to ensure confession. In November, the Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial took place in Czechoslovakia as 13 senior Communist Party figures, 11 of them Jewish, were accused and convicted of being part of a vast Zionist-American conspiracy to subvert Eastern Bloc governments. That same month, a much publicised trial of accused Jewish industrial wreckers took place in Ukraine. In 1951, he initiated the Mingrelian affair, a purge of the Georgian branch of the Communist Party which resulted in over 11,000 deportations.From 1946 until his death, Stalin only gave three public speeches, two of which lasted only a few minutes. The amount of written material that he produced also declined. In 1950, Stalin issued the article \"Marxism and Problems of Linguistics\", which reflected his interest in questions of Russian nationhood.\nIn 1952, Stalin's last book, Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR, was published. It sought to provide a guide to leading the country after his death. In October 1952, Stalin gave an hour and a half speech at the Central Committee plenum. There, he emphasised what he regarded as leadership qualities necessary in the future and highlighted the weaknesses of various potential successors, particularly Molotov and Mikoyan. In 1952, he also eliminated the Politburo and replaced it with a larger version which he called the Presidium.\n\n\n==== Death, funeral and aftermath ====\n\nOn 1 March 1953, Stalin's staff found him semi-conscious on the bedroom floor of his Volynskoe dacha. He had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. He was moved onto a couch and remained there for three days. He was hand-fed using a spoon, given various medicines and injections, and leeches were applied to him. Svetlana and Vasily were called to the dacha on 2 March; the latter was drunk and angrily shouted at the doctors, resulting in him being sent home. Stalin died on 5 March 1953. According to Svetlana, it had been \"a difficult and terrible death\". An autopsy revealed that he had died of a cerebral hemorrhage and that he also suffered from severe damage to his cerebral arteries due to atherosclerosis. It is possible that Stalin was murdered. Beria has been suspected of murder, although no firm evidence has ever appeared.Stalin's death was announced on 6 March. The body was embalmed, and then placed on display in Moscow's House of Unions for three days. Crowds were such that a crush killed around 100 people. The funeral involved the body being laid to rest in Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square on 9 March; hundreds of thousands attended. That month featured a surge in arrests for \"anti-Soviet agitation\" as those celebrating Stalin's death came to police attention. The Chinese government instituted a period of official mourning for Stalin's death.Stalin left no anointed successor nor a framework within which a transfer of power could take place. The Central Committee met on the day of his death, with Malenkov, Beria, and Khrushchev emerging as the party's key figures. The system of collective leadership was restored, and measures introduced to prevent any one member attaining autocratic domination again. The collective leadership included the following eight senior members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union listed according to the order of precedence presented formally on 5 March 1953: Georgy Malenkov, Lavrentiy Beria, Vyacheslav Molotov, Kliment Voroshilov, Nikita Khrushchev, Nikolai Bulganin, Lazar Kaganovich and Anastas Mikoyan. Reforms to the Soviet system were immediately implemented. Economic reform scaled back the mass construction projects, placed a new emphasis on house building, and eased the levels of taxation on the peasantry to stimulate production. The new leaders sought rapprochement with Yugoslavia and a less hostile relationship with the U.S., pursuing a negotiated end to the Korean War in July 1953. The doctors who had been imprisoned were released and the anti-Semitic purges ceased. A mass amnesty for those imprisoned for non-political crimes was issued, halving the country's inmate population, while the state security and Gulag systems were reformed, with torture being banned in April 1953.\n\n\n== Political ideology ==\n\nStalin claimed to have embraced Marxism at the age of fifteen, and it served as the guiding philosophy throughout his adult life; according to Kotkin, Stalin held \"zealous Marxist convictions\", while Montefiore suggested that Marxism held a \"quasi-religious\" value for Stalin. Although he never became a Georgian nationalist, during his early life elements from Georgian nationalist thought blended with Marxism in his outlook. The historian Alfred J. Rieber noted that he had been raised in \"a society where rebellion was deeply rooted in folklore and popular rituals\". Stalin believed in the need to adapt Marxism to changing circumstances; in 1917, he declared that \"there is dogmatic Marxism and there is creative Marxism. I stand on the ground of the latter\". Volkogonov believed that Stalin's Marxism was shaped by his \"dogmatic turn of mind\", suggesting that this had been instilled in the Soviet leader during his education in religious institutions. According to scholar Robert Service, Stalin's \"few innovations in ideology were crude, dubious developments of Marxism\". Some of these derived from political expediency rather than any sincere intellectual commitment; Stalin would often turn to ideology post hoc to justify his decisions. Stalin referred to himself as a praktik, meaning that he was more of a practical revolutionary than a theoretician.As a Marxist and an extreme anti-capitalist, Stalin believed in an inevitable \"class war\" between the world's proletariat and bourgeoise. He believed that the working classes would prove successful in this struggle and would establish a dictatorship of the proletariat, regarding the Soviet Union as an example of such a state. He also believed that this proletarian state would need to introduce repressive measures against foreign and domestic \"enemies\" to ensure the full crushing of the propertied classes, and thus the class war would intensify with the advance of socialism. As a propaganda tool, the shaming of \"enemies\" explained all inadequate economic and political outcomes, the hardships endured by the populace, and military failures. The new state would then be able to ensure that all citizens had access to work, food, shelter, healthcare, and education, with the wastefulness of capitalism eliminated by a new, standardised economic system. According to Sandle, Stalin was \"committed to the creation of a society that was industrialised, collectivised, centrally planned and technologically advanced.\"Stalin adhered to the Leninist variant of Marxism. In his book, Foundations of Leninism, he stated that \"Leninism is the Marxism of the epoch of imperialism and of the proletarian revolution\". He claimed to be a loyal Leninist, although was\u2014according to Service\u2014\"not a blindly obedient Leninist\". Stalin respected Lenin, but not uncritically, and spoke out when he believed that Lenin was wrong. During the period of his revolutionary activity, Stalin regarded some of Lenin's views and actions as being the self-indulgent activities of a spoiled \u00e9migr\u00e9, deeming them counterproductive for those Bolshevik activists based within the Russian Empire itself. After the October Revolution, they continued to have differences. Whereas Lenin believed that all countries across Europe and Asia would readily unite as a single state following proletariat revolution, Stalin argued that national pride would prevent this, and that different socialist states would have to be formed; in his view, a country like Germany would not readily submit to being part of a Russian-dominated federal state. Stalin biographer Oleg Khlevniuk nevertheless believed that the pair developed a \"strong bond\" over the years, while Kotkin suggested that Stalin's friendship with Lenin was \"the single most important relationship in Stalin's life\". After Lenin's death, Stalin relied heavily on Lenin's writings\u2014far more so than those of Marx and Engels\u2014to guide him in the affairs of state. Stalin adopted the Leninist view on the need for a revolutionary vanguard who could lead the proletariat rather than being led by them. Leading this vanguard, he believed that the Soviet peoples needed a strong, central figure\u2014akin to a Tsar\u2014whom they could rally around. In his words, \"the people need a Tsar, whom they can worship and for whom they can live and work\". He read about, and admired, two Tsars in particular: Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great. In the personality cult constructed around him, he was known as the vozhd, an equivalent to the Italian duce and German fuhrer.\n\nStalinism was a development of Leninism, and while Stalin avoided using the term \"Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism\", he allowed others to do so. Following Lenin's death, Stalin contributed to the theoretical debates within the Communist Party, namely by developing the idea of \"Socialism in One Country\". This concept was intricately linked to factional struggles within the party, particularly against Trotsky. He first developed the idea in December 1924 and elaborated upon in his writings of 1925\u201326. Stalin's doctrine held that socialism could be completed in Russia but that its final victory there could not be guaranteed because of the threat from capitalist intervention. For this reason, he retained the Leninist view that world revolution was still a necessity to ensure the ultimate victory of socialism. Although retaining the Marxist belief that the state would wither away as socialism transformed into pure communism, he believed that the Soviet state would remain until the final defeat of international capitalism. This concept synthesised Marxist and Leninist ideas with nationalist ideals, and served to discredit Trotsky\u2014who promoted the idea of \"permanent revolution\"\u2014by presenting the latter as a defeatist with little faith in Russian workers' abilities to construct socialism.Stalin viewed nations as contingent entities which were formed by capitalism and could merge into others. Ultimately he believed that all nations would merge into a single, global human community, and regarded all nations as inherently equal. In his work, he stated that \"the right of secession\" should be offered to the ethnic-minorities of the Russian Empire, but that they should not be encouraged to take that option. He was of the view that if they became fully autonomous, then they would end up being controlled by the most reactionary elements of their community; as an example he cited the largely illiterate Tatars, whom he claimed would end up dominated by their mullahs. Stalin argued that the Jews possessed a \"national character\" but were not a \"nation\" and were thus unassimilable. He argued that Jewish nationalism, particularly Zionism, was hostile to socialism. According to Khlevniuk, Stalin reconciled Marxism with great-power imperialism and therefore expansion of the empire makes him a worthy to the Russian tsars. Service argued that Stalin's Marxism was imbued with a great deal of Russian nationalism. According to Montefiore, Stalin's embrace of the Russian nation was pragmatic, as the Russians were the core of the population of the USSR; it was not a rejection of his Georgian origins. Stalin's push for Soviet westward expansion into eastern Europe resulted in accusations of Russian imperialism.\n\n\n== Personal life and characteristics ==\n\nEthnically Georgian, Stalin grew up speaking the Georgian language, and did not begin learning Russian until the age of eight or nine. He remained proud of his Georgian identity, and throughout his life retained a heavy Georgian accent when speaking Russian. According to Montefiore, despite Stalin's affinity for Russia and Russians, he remained profoundly Georgian in his lifestyle and personality. Stalin's colleagues described him as \"Asiatic\", and he told a Japanese journalist that \"I am not a European man, but an Asian, a Russified Georgian\". Service also noted that Stalin \"would never be Russian\", could not credibly pass as one, and never tried to pretend that he was. Montefiore was of the view that \"after 1917, [Stalin] became quadri-national: Georgian by nationality, Russian by loyalty, internationalist by ideology, Soviet by citizenship.\"Stalin had a soft voice, and when speaking Russian did so slowly, carefully choosing his phrasing. In private he used coarse language, although avoided doing so in public. Described as a poor orator, according to Volkogonov, Stalin's speaking style was \"simple and clear, without flights of fancy, catchy phrases or platform histrionics\". He rarely spoke before large audiences, and preferred to express himself in written form. His writing style was similar, being characterised by its simplicity, clarity, and conciseness. Throughout his life, he used various nicknames and pseudonyms, including \"Koba\", \"Soselo\", and \"Ivanov\", adopting \"Stalin\" in 1912; it was based on the Russian word for \"steel\" and has often been translated as \"Man of Steel\".\n\nIn adulthood, Stalin measured 5 feet 4 inches (1.63 m) tall. To appear taller, he wore stacked shoes, and stood on a small platform during parades. His mustached face was pock-marked from smallpox during childhood; this was airbrushed from published photographs. He was born with a webbed left foot, and his left arm had been permanently injured in childhood which left it shorter than his right and lacking in flexibility, which was probably the result of being hit, at the age of 12, by a horse-drawn carriage.During his youth, Stalin cultivated a scruffy appearance in rejection of middle-class aesthetic values. He grew his hair long and often wore a beard; for clothing, he often wore a traditional Georgian chokha or a red satin shirt with a grey coat and red fedora. From mid-1918 until his death he favoured military-style clothing, in particular long black boots, light-coloured collarless tunics, and a gun. He was a lifelong smoker, who smoked both a pipe and cigarettes. He had few material demands and lived plainly, with simple and inexpensive clothing and furniture; his interest was in power rather than wealth.As Soviet leader, Stalin typically awoke around 11 am, with lunch being served between 3 and 5 pm and dinner no earlier than 9 pm; he then worked late into the evening. He often dined with other Politburo members and their families. As leader, he rarely left Moscow unless to go to one of his dachas; he disliked travel, and refused to travel by plane. His choice of favoured holiday house changed over the years, although he holidayed in southern parts of the USSR every year from 1925 to 1936 and again from 1945 to 1951. Along with other senior figures, he had a dacha at Zubalova, 35 km outside Moscow, although ceased using it after Nadya's 1932 suicide. After 1932, he favoured holidays in Abkhazia, being a friend of its leader, Nestor Lakoba. In 1934, his new Kuntsevo Dacha was built; 9 km from the Kremlin, it became his primary residence. In 1935 he began using a new dacha provided for him by Lakoba at Novy Afon; in 1936, he had the Kholodnaya Rechka dacha built on the Abkhazian coast, designed by Miron Merzhanov.\n\n\n=== Personality ===\n\nTrotsky and several other Soviet figures promoted the idea that Stalin was a mediocrity. This gained widespread acceptance outside the Soviet Union during his lifetime but was misleading. According to Montefiore, \"it is clear from hostile and friendly witnesses alike that Stalin was always exceptional, even from childhood\". Stalin had a complex mind, great self-control, and an excellent memory. He was a hard worker, and displayed a keen desire to learn; when in power, he scrutinised many details of Soviet life, from film scripts to architectural plans and military hardware. According to Volkogonov, \"Stalin's private life and working life were one and the same\"; he did not take days off from political activities.Stalin could play different roles to different audiences, and was adept at deception, often deceiving others as to his true motives and aims. Several historians have seen it appropriate to follow Lazar Kaganovich's description of there being \"several Stalins\" as a means of understanding his multi-faceted personality. He was a good organiser, with a strategic mind, and judged others according to their inner strength, practicality, and cleverness. He acknowledged that he could be rude and insulting, although rarely raised his voice in anger; as his health deteriorated in later life he became increasingly unpredictable and bad tempered. Despite his tough-talking attitude, he could be very charming; when relaxed, he cracked jokes and mimicked others. Montefiore suggested that this charm was \"the foundation of Stalin's power in the Party\".Stalin was ruthless, temperamentally cruel, and had a propensity for violence high even among the Bolsheviks. He lacked compassion, something Volkogonov suggested might have been accentuated by his many years in prison and exile, although he was capable of acts of kindness to strangers, even amid the Great Terror. He was capable of self-righteous indignation, and was resentful, vindictive, and vengeful, holding onto grievances against others for many years. By the 1920s, he was also suspicious and conspiratorial, prone to believing that people were plotting against him and that there were vast international conspiracies behind acts of dissent. He never attended torture sessions or executions, although Service thought Stalin \"derived deep satisfaction\" from degrading and humiliating people and keeping even close associates in a state of \"unrelieved fear\". Montefiore thought Stalin's brutality marked him out as a \"natural extremist\"; Service suggested he had a paranoid or sociopathic personality disorder. Other historians linked his brutality not to any personality trait, but to his unwavering commitment to the survival of the Soviet Union and the international Marxist\u2013Leninist cause.\n\nKeenly interested in the arts, Stalin admired artistic talent. He protected several Soviet writers, such as Mikhail Bulgakov, even when their work was labelled harmful to his regime. He enjoyed music, owning around 2,700 albums, and frequently attending the Bolshoi Theatre during the 1930s and 1940s. His taste in music and theatre was conservative, favouring classical drama, opera, and ballet over what he dismissed as experimental \"formalism\". He also favoured classical forms in the visual arts, disliking avant-garde styles like cubism and futurism. He was a voracious reader, with a library of over 20,000 books. Little of this was fiction, although he could cite passages from Alexander Pushkin, Nikolay Nekrasov, and Walt Whitman by heart. He favoured historical studies, keeping up with debates in the study of Russian, Mesopotamian, ancient Roman, and Byzantine history. An autodidact, he claimed to read as many as 500 pages a day, with Montefiore regarding him as an intellectual. Stalin also enjoyed watching films late at night at cinemas installed in the Kremlin and his dachas. He favoured the Western genre; his favourite film was the 1938 picture Volga Volga.Stalin was a keen and accomplished billiards player, and collected watches. He also enjoyed practical jokes; he for instance would place a tomato on the seat of Politburo members and wait for them to sit on it. When at social events, he encouraged singing, as well as alcohol consumption; he hoped that others would drunkenly reveal their secrets to him. As an infant, Stalin displayed a love of flowers, and later in life he became a keen gardener. His Volynskoe suburb had a 20-hectare (50-acre) park, with Stalin devoting much attention to its agricultural activities.Stalin publicly condemned anti-Semitism, although was repeatedly accused of it. People who knew him, such as Khrushchev, suggested he long harbored negative sentiments toward Jews, and anti-Semitic trends in his policies were further fueled by Stalin's struggle against Trotsky. After Stalin's death, Khrushchev claimed that Stalin encouraged him to incite anti-Semitism in Ukraine, allegedly telling him that \"the good workers at the factory should be given clubs so they can beat the hell out of those Jews.\" In 1946, Stalin allegedly said privately that \"every Jew is a potential spy.\" Conquest stated that although Stalin had Jewish associates, he promoted anti-Semitism. Service cautioned that there was \"no irrefutable evidence\" of anti-Semitism in Stalin's published work, although his private statements and public actions were \"undeniably reminiscent of crude antagonism towards Jews\"; he added that throughout Stalin's lifetime, the Georgian \"would be the friend, associate or leader of countless individual Jews\". According to Beria, Stalin had affairs with several Jewish women.\n\n\n=== Relationships and family ===\n\nFriendship was important to Stalin, and he used it to gain and maintain power. Kotkin observed that Stalin \"generally gravitated to people like himself: parvenu intelligentsia of humble background\". He gave nicknames to his favourites, for instance referring to Yezhov as \"my blackberry\". Stalin was sociable and enjoyed a joke. According to Montefiore, Stalin's friendships \"meandered between love, admiration, and venomous jealousy\". While head of the Soviet Union he remained in contact with many of his old friends in Georgia, sending them letters and gifts of money.According to Montefiore, in his early life Stalin \"rarely seems to have been without a girlfriend\". He was sexually promiscuous, although rarely talked about his sex life. Montefiore noted that Stalin's favoured types were \"young, malleable teenagers or buxom peasant women\", who would be supportive and unchallenging toward him. According to Service, Stalin \"regarded women as a resource for sexual gratification and domestic comfort\". Stalin married twice and had several offspring.Stalin married his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, in 1906. According to Montefiore, theirs was \"a true love match\"; Volkogonov suggested that she was \"probably the one human being he had really loved\". When she died, Stalin said \"This creature softened my heart of stone.\" They had a son, Yakov, who often frustrated and annoyed Stalin. Yakov had a daughter, Galina, before fighting for the Red Army in the Second World War. He was captured by the German Army and then committed suicide.Stalin's second wife was Nadezhda Alliluyeva; theirs was not an easy relationship, and they often fought. They had two biological children\u2014a son, Vasily, and a daughter, Svetlana\u2014and adopted another son, Artyom Sergeev, in 1921. During his marriage to Nadezhda, Stalin had affairs with many other women, most of whom were fellow revolutionaries or their wives. Nadezdha suspected that this was the case, and committed suicide in 1932. Stalin regarded Vasily as spoiled and often chastised his behaviour; as Stalin's son, Vasily nevertheless was swiftly promoted through the ranks of the Red Army and allowed a lavish lifestyle. Conversely, Stalin had an affectionate relationship with Svetlana during her childhood, and was also very fond of Artyom. In later life, he disapproved of Svetlana's various suitors and husbands, putting a strain on his relationship with her. After the Second World War, he made little time for his children and his family played a decreasingly important role in his life. After Stalin's death, Svetlana changed her surname from Stalin to Allilueva, and defected to the U.S.After Nadezdha's death, Stalin became increasingly close to his sister-in-law Zhenya Alliluyeva; Montefiore believed that they were probably lovers. There are unproven rumours that from 1934 onward he had a relationship with his housekeeper Valentina Istomina. Stalin had at least two illegitimate children, although he never recognised them as being his. One of them, Konstantin Kuzakov, later taught philosophy at the Leningrad Military Mechanical Institute, but never met his father. The other, Alexander, was the son of Lidia Pereprygia; he was raised as the son of a peasant fisherman and the Soviet authorities made him swear never to reveal that Stalin was his biological father.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nThe historian Robert Conquest stated that Stalin, \"perhaps [...] determined the course of the twentieth century\" more than any other individual. Biographers like Service and Volkogonov have considered him an outstanding and exceptional politician; Montefiore labelled Stalin as \"that rare combination: both 'intellectual' and killer\", a man who was \"the ultimate politician\" and \"the most elusive and fascinating of the twentieth-century titans\". According to historian Kevin McDermott, interpretations of Stalin range from \"the sycophantic and adulatory to the vitriolic and condemnatory\". For most Westerners and anti-communist Russians, he is viewed overwhelmingly negatively as a mass murderer; for significant numbers of Russians and Georgians, he is regarded as a great statesman and state-builder.Stalin strengthened and stabilised the Soviet Union; Service suggested that without him the country might have collapsed long before 1991. In under three decades, Stalin transformed the Soviet Union into a major industrial world power, one which could \"claim impressive achievements\" in terms of urbanisation, military strength, education, and Soviet pride. Under his rule, the average Soviet life expectancy grew due to improved living conditions, nutrition, and medical care; mortality rates also declined. Although millions of Soviet citizens despised him, support for Stalin was nevertheless widespread throughout Soviet society. Yet Stalin's necessity for Soviet Union's economic development has been questioned, with it being argued that Stalin's policies from 1928 on may have only been a limiting factor.\n\nStalin's Soviet Union has been characterised as a totalitarian state, with Stalin its authoritarian leader. Various biographers have described him as a dictator, an autocrat, or accused him of practicing Caesarism. Montefiore argued that while Stalin initially ruled as part of a Communist Party oligarchy, in 1934 the Soviet government transformed from this oligarchy into a personal dictatorship, with Stalin only becoming \"absolute dictator\" between March and June 1937, when senior military and NKVD figures were eliminated. According to Kotkin, Stalin \"built a personal dictatorship within the Bolshevik dictatorship\". In both the Soviet Union and elsewhere he came to be portrayed as an \"Oriental despot\". The biographer Dmitri Volkogonov characterised him as \"one of the most powerful figures in human history\", while McDermott stated that Stalin had \"concentrated unprecedented political authority in his hands\", and Service noted that by the late 1930s, Stalin \"had come closer to personal despotism than almost any monarch in history\".\n\nMcDermott nevertheless cautioned against \"over-simplistic stereotypes\"\u2014promoted in the fiction of writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Vasily Grossman, and Anatoly Rybakov\u2014that portrayed Stalin as an omnipotent and omnipresent tyrant who controlled every aspect of Soviet life through repression and totalitarianism. Service similarly warned of the portrayal of Stalin as an \"unimpeded despot\", noting that \"powerful though he was, his powers were not limitless\", and his rule depended on his willingness to conserve the Soviet structure he had inherited. Kotkin observed that Stalin's ability to remain in power relied on him having a majority in the Politburo at all times. Khlevniuk noted that at various points, particularly when Stalin was old and frail, there were \"periodic manifestations\" in which the party oligarchy threatened his autocratic control. Stalin denied to foreign visitors that he was a dictator, stating that those who labelled him such did not understand the Soviet governance structure.A vast literature devoted to Stalin has been produced. During Stalin's lifetime, his approved biographies were largely hagiographic in content. Stalin ensured that these works gave very little attention to his early life, particularly because he did not wish to emphasise his Georgian origins in a state numerically dominated by Russians. Since his death many more biographies have been written, although until the 1980s these relied largely on the same sources of information. Under Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet administration various previously classified files on Stalin's life were made available to historians, at which point Stalin became \"one of the most urgent and vital issues on the public agenda\" in the Soviet Union. After the dissolution of the Union in 1991, the rest of the archives were opened to historians, resulting in much new information about Stalin coming to light, and producing a flood of new research.Leninists remain divided in their views on Stalin; some view him as Lenin's authentic successor, while others believe he betrayed Lenin's ideas by deviating from them. The socio-economic nature of Stalin's Soviet Union has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of state socialism, state capitalism, bureaucratic collectivism, or a totally unique mode of production. Socialist writers like Volkogonov have acknowledged that Stalin's actions damaged \"the enormous appeal of socialism generated by the October Revolution\".\n\n\n=== Death toll and allegations of genocide ===\n\nWith a high number of excess deaths occurring under his rule, Stalin has been labeled \"one of the most notorious figures in history\". These deaths occurred as a result of collectivisation, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to the regime.\n\nOfficial records reveal 799,455 documented executions in the Soviet Union between 1921 and 1953; 681,692 of these were carried out between 1937 and 1938, the years of the Great Purge. However, according to Michael Ellman, the best modern estimate for the number of repression deaths during the Great Purge is 950,000\u20131.2 million, which includes executions, deaths in detention, or soon after their release. In addition, while archival data shows that 1,053,829 perished in the Gulag from 1934 to 1953, the current historical consensus is that of the 18 million people who passed through the Gulag system from 1930 to 1953, between 1.5 and 1.7 million died as a result of their incarceration. The historian and archival researcher Stephen G. Wheatcroft and Michael Ellman attribute roughly 3 million deaths to the Stalinist regime, including executions and deaths from criminal negligence. Wheatcoft and historian R. W. Davies estimate famine deaths at 5.5\u20136.5 million while scholar Steven Rosefielde gives a number of 8.7 million. The American historian Timothy D. Snyder in 2011 summarised modern data, made after the opening of the Soviet archives in the 1990s, and concludes that Stalin's regime was responsible for 9 million deaths, with 6 million of these being deliberate killings. He notes that the estimate is far lower than the estimates of 20 million or above which were made before access to the archives.Historians continue to debate whether or not the 1932\u201333 Ukrainian famine\u2014known in Ukraine as the Holodomor\u2014should be called a genocide. Twenty six countries officially recognise it under the legal definition of genocide. In 2006, the Ukrainian Parliament declared it to be such, and in 2010 a Ukrainian court posthumously convicted Stalin, Lazar Kaganovich, Stanislav Kosior, and other Soviet leaders of genocide. Popular among some Ukrainian nationalists is the idea that Stalin consciously organised the famine to suppress national desires among the Ukrainian people. This interpretation has been rejected by more recent historical studies. These have articulated the view that\u2014while Stalin's policies contributed significantly to the high mortality rate\u2014there is no evidence that Stalin or the Soviet government consciously engineered the famine. The idea that this was a targeted attack on the Ukrainians is complicated by the widespread suffering that also affected other Soviet peoples in the famine, including the Russians. Within Ukraine, ethnic Poles and Bulgarians died in similar proportions to ethnic Ukrainians. Despite any lack of clear intent on Stalin's part, the historian Norman Naimark noted that although there may not be sufficient \"evidence to convict him in an international court of justice as a genocidaire [...] that does not mean that the event itself cannot be judged as genocide\".\n\n\n=== In the Soviet Union and its successor states ===\nShortly after his death, the Soviet Union went through a period of de-Stalinization. Malenkov denounced the Stalin personality cult, which was subsequently criticised in Pravda. In 1956, Khrushchev gave his \"Secret Speech\", titled \"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\", to a closed session of the Party's 20th Congress. There, Khrushchev denounced Stalin for both his mass repression and his personality cult. He repeated these denunciations at the 22nd Party Congress in October 1962. In October 1961, Stalin's body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis next to the Kremlin walls, the location marked only by a simple bust. Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd.Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation process in Soviet society ended when he was replaced as leader by Leonid Brezhnev in 1964; the latter introduced a level of re-Stalinisation within the Soviet Union. In 1969 and again in 1979, plans were proposed for a full rehabilitation of Stalin's legacy, but on both occasions were defeated by critics within the Soviet and international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement. Gorbachev saw the total denunciation of Stalin as necessary for the regeneration of Soviet society. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the first President of the new Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, continued Gorbachev's denunciation of Stalin but added to it a denunciation of Lenin. His successor, Vladimir Putin, did not seek to rehabilitate Stalin but emphasised the celebration of Soviet achievements under Stalin's leadership rather than the Stalinist repressions; however, in October 2017 Putin opened the Wall of Grief memorial in Moscow, noting that the \"terrible past\" would neither be \"justified by anything\" nor \"erased from the national memory\".\n\nAmid the social and economic turmoil of the post-Soviet period, many Russians viewed Stalin as having overseen an era of order, predictability, and pride. He remains a revered figure among many Russian nationalists, who feel nostalgic about the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, and he is regularly invoked approvingly within both Russia's far-left and far-right. In the 2008 Name of Russia television show, Stalin was voted as the third most notable personality in Russian history. Polling by the Levada Center suggest Stalin's popularity has grown since 2015, with 46% of Russians expressing a favourable view of him in 2017 and 51% in 2019. At the same time, there was a growth in pro-Stalinist literature in Russia, much relying upon the misrepresentation or fabrication of source material. In this literature, Stalin's repressions are regarded either as a necessary measure to defeat \"enemies of the people\" or the result of lower-level officials acting without Stalin's knowledge.The only part of the former Soviet Union where admiration for Stalin has remained consistently widespread is Georgia. Many Georgians resent criticism of Stalin, the most famous figure from their nation's modern history; a 2013 survey by Tbilisi University found 45% of Georgians expressing \"a positive attitude\" to him. Some positive sentiment can also be found elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. A 2012 survey commissioned by the Carnegie Endowment found 38% of Armenians concurring that their country \"will always have need of a leader like Stalin\". In early 2010 a new monument to Stalin was erected in Zaporizhia, Ukraine; in December unknown persons cut off its head and in 2011 it was destroyed in an explosion. In a 2016 Kiev International Institute of Sociology poll, 38% of respondents had a negative attitude to Stalin, 26% a neutral one and 17% a positive, with 19% refusing to answer.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBibliography of Stalinism and the Soviet Union\nForeign relations of the Soviet Union\nIndex of Soviet Union-related articles\nList of places named after Joseph Stalin\nStalin and the Scientists\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nApplebaum, Anne (2003).

          "Volgograd is huge, but for such a large city it has little to offer. However, these monuments are an absolute must. They're worth the trip alone. Having just a passing knowledge of history, I was aware of the siege of Stalingrad and the amazing efforts of the soldiers/residents",

          "Take the city metro (Tram) - three stops from city center and 30 rubles return (around 25 cents) There are many steps taking you to a corridor paved on both sides with high walls carved with depictions of war and brought to life by loudspeakers blaring out the noises of a live",

          "Never thought I would have the opportunity to visit such a place. An outstanding experience for anyone with any interest in WW2",
          "The layout and design of the memorial park is awesome. My favourite part was the two walls depicting the periods of the Battle of Stalingrad - 'Not one step back' and 'only forward'. Also fascinating to stand at the peak looking across the city imagining the battle from that",
          "This World War 2 monumental complex is one of the largest in a World. You need to go upstairs through a set of different monuments up to the top of Mamayev hill. On the top you see 'The Motherland Calls' Sculpture. Must see",
          "We were in Volgograd for a wedding and a trip to Mamayev Kurgen is a must. It is an enormous monument on a small hill in Volgograd, overlooking the Volga to the Battle of Stalingrad in WW2. The hill is one of the highest points in the area and was one of the most important",

          "Mother Russia truly is a sight to behold. She gets bigger and bigger as you climb further and further up her hill and finally reach her toes. By the time you've gotten that far, you've already passed statues of soldiers and seen the Tomb of the Unknown. You finally reach",
          "I recommend to see the moment, when guards of honor are changing-every 2 hour I think. Monument is great, also you can visit little but very interesting war historical monument Rossoshki - it is 35 km from airport by car.",
          "I have to admit I only knew there was a huge statue of Motherland in Volgograd. I didn't expect the whole ensemble being masterfully arranged on Mamayev Hill. The visit was amazing. Firstly you only see the statue and one set of stairs and as you walk along, many of the other",
          "What a breath-taking location packed with Russian sculptures which are so powerful and monumental in scale; I have never seen anything like it. The changing of the guard is well worth a visit in the hall of the eternal flame, a circular building at the top of the site.",
          "The enormity of this edifice has to be seen to be appreciated, to quote the old phrase \"photos do not do it justice\". Then near the base of it is the grave of the famed sniper Vassily Zaitsev whose dying wish to be buried there was finally granted. Walking down the hill, which",
          "The historical sights of Mamaev Hill, the monuments and the museum are all worth visiting to help understand the Battle of Stalingrad. For fun, visit the nearby canteen. The waitresses are dressed as Soviet soldiers, there are interesting wall decorations, and you can sample the",
          "It's so impressive, and so well done - I don't think any monument can properly reflect the gratitude the world owes to the heroes of Stalingrad but this is a good start",

          "Mother Russia you will never forget! Nice park and memorial place with soviet victims of the second world war. A must for visit in Volograd (ex Stalingrad).",
          "Mamaev Kurgan is a great tribute to a Hero City which is also a City of Heroes. Situated a few kms outside the main town & a few metro/tram , trolleybus stops from the main city it is easy to find the right stop as the statue of Mother Russia dominates the whole city. The steps",
          "First of all, I have been up the \"Hill\" numerous times and one of the best suggestions I can give you is to go early-early in the morning (if you are visiting in the summer time). It is a long walk up the stairs (200 of them) and it is directly in the sun and it gets warm, very",
          "This city is rich in history and the monuments are a testament to the city's importance to Russian culture and history. Beautiful monuments!",
          "You can read about and watch films about the Battle of Stalingrad, but nothing can match the impact of visiting Mamayev Hill. We went to Volgograd to sing (world premiere of a song for Volgograd) so visiting these monuments meant so much to us - how much more they mean to the",
          "Breathtaking and blood chilling at the same time. More then 2 mio people buried around. Hard to imagine what those who survived have gone thru... Must see at all costs!",
          "Yes, it is possibly the only place in Volgograd you must visit. Volgograd (Stalingrad) was completely destroyed during WW2. About 1 500 000 soldgiers from both side was dead in Stalingrad battle. 300 000 of them on Mamayev Hill. Try to imagine it and you'll feel the place. My",
          "Greatly moved by my visit and the dignity of what I saw. Go and take your time to walk up the hill. The eternal flame is the centrepiece but look at each statue too.",

          "Incredible historical significance. Awe-inspiring statue and genuinely moving and dignified 'eternal flame' and hall of memory.",
          "If you are reading about Volgograd/Stalingrad, you are going to know about this. It certainly is stupedous! Make sure you have a guide to translate everything - nothing is in Russian. Don't miss the changing of the guard - very eerie as young men goosestep quick/slow around the",
          "Nice monument, you could see the soldier changing every hour!",
          "The monument is huge and magnificent. You can walk around it 24 hours a day. Near the monument You will find bas-relief on the Second World War topic. Near the monument there is a building, where the eternal flame is. In the daytime in 10 minutes before every hour You are able",
          "Try to time your arrival for the hourly change of the guards during the day. Great memorial to such a tragic battle.",
          "This was a fantastic way to spend an afternoon. Impressive way to remember the world war 2 soldiers. If you visit during the warm months, make sure to watch the changing of the guards that happens every hour. Great views of the city too.",
          "Mamayev Kurgan is a very emotional place to visit because of the enormous causalities suffered in the area. It is especially worth visiting during the Russian May holidays, when you have the fresh green leaves, contrasting with the flags, veterans with families and friends",
          "This site if anywhere else would attract thousands but many will never see this wonder of the world.It is a truly wonderful monument and site and brings a lump to your throat when you think what it stands for,I will never forget these sights,fantastic.",
          "With 200 steps that symbolize the 200 days the Battle of Stalingrad lasted, this is one of the most remarkable monuments I have ever seen. The Mother Russia statue is the centerpiece of Mamayev, but the entire war memorial is simply mesmerizing. Don't miss it!",
          "This has to be the number one must-see in Volgograd for anyone who's got even the slightest awareness of the history of WW II. Russia's tribute to the battle of Stalingrad is a powerful series of sculpture, telling the story of the turning point of WW II as you climb up the"

        "wiki": "The culture of the ethnic Russian people (along with the cultures of many other ethnicities with which it has intertwined in the territory of the Russian Federation) has a long tradition of achievement in many fields, especially when it comes to literature, folk dancing, philosophy, classical music, traditional folk music, ballet, architecture, painting, cinema, animation and politics, which all have had considerable influence on world culture. Russia also has a rich material culture and a tradition in technology.\nRussian culture grew from that of the East Slavs, with their pagan beliefs and specific way of life in the wooded, steppe and forest-steppe areas of Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Early Russian culture and Slavic people in Russia were much influenced by nomadic Turkic people (Tatars, Kipchaks) and tribes of Iranian origin through intense cultural contacts in the Russian steppe and strongly by Finno-Ugric, Balts and Scandinavians (Germanic people) through the Russian North, as well as by the people of the Byzantine Empire (especially Greeks) with which Old Russia maintained strong cultural links. In the late 1st millennium AD the Nordic sea culture of the Varangians (Scandinavian Vikings) and in the middle of the second millennium the nomadic people of the Mongol Empire also influenced the Russian culture. Early Slavic tribes in European Russia were much shaped by the fusion of Nordic-European and Oriental-Asian cultures which formed Russian identity in the Volga region and in the states of Rus' Khaganate and Kievan Rus'. Orthodox Christian missionaries began arriving from the Eastern Roman Empire in the 9th century, and Kievan Rus' officially converted to Orthodox Christianity in 988. This largely defined the Russian culture of the next millennium as a synthesis of Slavic and Byzantine cultures. Russia or Rus' was formed, developed its culture and was influenced through its location by Western European and Asian cultures so that a Russian-Eurasian culture developed.After Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453, Russia remained the largest Orthodox nation in the world and eventually claimed succession to the Byzantine legacy in the form of the Third Rome idea. An important period in Russian history was the Tsardom of Russia from 1547 until 1721 where many Russian cultural peculiarities emerged and developed. At different periods in Russian history, the culture of Western Europe also exerted strong influences over Russian citizens. During the era of the Russian Empire which existed from 1721 to 1917, the Tsar's title was abolished and the rulers of Russia were called Emperors. Since the reforms of Peter the Great (reigned 1682\u20131725) in the Russian Empire, for two centuries Russian culture largely developed in the general context of European culture rather than pursuing its own unique ways. The situation changed in the 20th century, when the distinctive Communist ideology imported from Europe became a major factor in the culture of the Soviet Union, where Russia, in the form of the Russian SFSR, was the largest and leading part. The culture of the Soviet Union has decisively shaped the former Soviet Russian Republic and thus Russian culture.\nAlthough Russia has been influenced by Western Europe, the Eastern world, Northern cultures and the Byzantine Empire for more than 1000 years since ancient Rus' and is culturally connected with them, it is often argued that due to its history, geography and inhabitants which belong to different language families but were embedded in the Russian language and culture, the country has developed a character with many aspects of a unique Russian civilization which in many parts differs from both Western and Eastern cultures.Nowadays, the Nation Brands Index ranks Russian cultural heritage seventh, based on interviews of some 20,000 people mainly from Western countries and from the Far East. Due to the relatively late involvement of Russia in modern globalization and in international tourism, many aspects of Russian culture, like Russian jokes and Russian art, remain largely unknown to foreigners.\n\n\n== Language and literature ==\n\nRussia's 160 ethnic groups speak some 100 languages. According to the 2002 census, 142.6 million people speak Russian, followed by Tatar with 5.3 million and Ukrainian with 1.8 million speakers. Russian is the only official state language, but the Constitution gives the individual republics the right to make their native language co-official next to Russian. Despite its wide dispersal, the Russian language is homogeneous throughout Russia. Russian is the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia and the most widely spoken Slavic language. Russian belongs to the Indo-European language family and is one of the living members of the East Slavic languages; the others being Belarusian and Ukrainian (and possibly Rusyn). Written examples of Old East Slavic (Old Russian) are attested from the 10th century onwards.Over a quarter of the world's scientific literature is published in Russian. Russian is also applied as a means of coding and storage of universal knowledge\u201460\u201370% of all world information is published in the English and Russian languages. The language is one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\n\n\n=== Folklore ===\n\nNew Russian folklore takes its roots in the pagan beliefs of ancient Slavs, which is nowadays still represented in the Russian folklore. Epic Russian bylinas are also an important part of Slavic mythology. The oldest bylinas of Kievan cycle were actually recorded mostly in the Russian North, especially in Karelia, where most of the Finnish national epic Kalevala was recorded as well. \n\nMany Russian fairy tales and bylinas were adapted for Russian animations, or for feature movies by famous directors like Aleksandr Ptushko (Ilya Muromets, Sadko) and Aleksandr Rou (Morozko, Vasilisa the Beautiful). Some Russian poets, including Pyotr Yershov and Leonid Filatov, created a number of well-known poetical interpretations of classical Russian fairy tales, and in some cases, like that of Alexander Pushkin, also created fully original fairy tale poems that became very popular.\nFolklorists today consider the 1920s the Soviet Union's golden age of folklore. The struggling new government, which had to focus its efforts on establishing a new administrative system and building up the nation's backwards economy, could not be bothered with attempting to control literature, so studies of folklore thrived. There were two primary trends of folklore study during the decade: the formalist and Finnish schools. Formalism focused on the artistic form of ancient byliny and faerie tales, specifically their use of distinctive structures and poetic devices. The Finnish school was concerned with connections amongst related legends of various Eastern European regions. Finnish scholars collected comparable tales from multiple locales and analyzed their similarities and differences, hoping to trace these epic stories\u2019 migration paths.\n\nOnce Joseph Stalin came to power and put his first five-year plan into motion in 1928, the Soviet government began to criticize and censor folklore studies. Stalin and the Soviet regime repressed folklore, believing that it supported the old tsarist system and a capitalist economy. They saw it as a reminder of the backward Russian society that the Bolsheviks were working to surpass. To keep folklore studies in check and prevent \"inappropriate\" ideas from spreading amongst the masses, the government created the RAPP \u2013 the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers. The RAPP specifically focused on censoring fairy tales and children's literature, believing that fantasies and \"bourgeois nonsense\" harmed the development of upstanding Soviet citizens. Fairy tales were removed from bookshelves and children were encouraged to read books focusing on nature and science. RAPP eventually increased its levels of censorship and became the Union of Soviet Writers in 1932.\n\nIn order to continue researching and analyzing folklore, intellectuals needed to justify its worth to the Communist regime. Otherwise, collections of folklore, along with all other literature deemed useless for the purposes of Stalin's Five Year Plan, would be an unacceptable realm of study. In 1934, Maksim Gorky gave a speech to the Union of Soviet Writers arguing that folklore could, in fact, be consciously used to promote Communist values. Apart from expounding on the artistic value of folklore, he stressed that traditional legends and fairy tales showed ideal, community-oriented characters, which exemplified the model Soviet citizen. Folklore, with many of its conflicts based on the struggles of a labor-oriented lifestyle, was relevant to Communism as it could not have existed without the direct contribution of the working classes. Also, Gorky explained that folklore characters expressed high levels of optimism, and therefore could encourage readers to maintain a positive mindset, especially as their lives changed with the further development of Communism.Yuri Sokolov, the head of the folklore section of the Union of Soviet Writers also promoted the study of folklore by arguing that folklore had originally been the oral tradition of the working people, and consequently could be used to motivate and inspire collective projects amongst the present-day proletariat. Characters throughout traditional Russian folktales often found themselves on a journey of self-discovery, a process that led them to value themselves not as individuals, but rather as a necessary part of a common whole. The attitudes of such legendary characters paralleled the mindset that the Soviet government wished to instill in its citizens. He also pointed out the existence of many tales that showed members of the working class outsmarting their cruel masters, again working to prove folklore's value to Soviet ideology and the nation's society at large.\nConvinced by Gorky and Sokolov's arguments, the Soviet government and the Union of Soviet Writers began collecting and evaluating folklore from across the country. The Union handpicked and recorded particular stories that, in their eyes, sufficiently promoted the collectivist spirit and showed the Soviet regime's benefits and progress. It then proceeded to redistribute copies of approved stories throughout the population. Meanwhile, local folklore centers arose in all major cities. Responsible for advocating a sense of Soviet nationalism, these organizations ensured that the media published appropriate versions of Russian folktales in a systematic fashion.\n\nApart from circulating government-approved fairy tales and byliny that already existed, during Stalin's rule authors parroting appropriate Soviet ideologies wrote Communist folktales and introduced them to the population. These contemporary folktales combined the structures and motifs of the old byliny with contemporary life in the Soviet Union. Called noviny, these new tales were considered the renaissance of the Russian epic. Folklorists were called upon to teach modern folksingers the conventional style and structure of the traditional byliny. They also explained to the performers the appropriate types of Communist ideology that should be represented in the new stories and songs As the performers of the day were often poorly educated, they needed to obtain a thorough understanding of Marxist ideology before they could be expected to impart folktales to the public in a manner that suited the Soviet government. Besides undergoing extensive education, many folk performers traveled throughout the nation in order to gain insight into the lives of the working class, and thus communicate their stories more effectively. Due to their crucial role in spreading Communist ideals throughout the Soviet Union, eventually some of these performers became highly valued members of Soviet society. A number of them, despite their illiteracy, were even elected as members of the Union of Soviet Writers.These new Soviet fairy tales and folk songs primarily focused on the contrasts between a miserable life in old tsarist Russia and an improved one under Stalin's leadership. Their characters represented identities for which Soviet citizens should strive, exemplifying the traits of the \"New Soviet Man.\" The heroes of Soviet tales were meant to portray a transformed and improved version of the average citizen, giving the reader a clear goal for an ideal community-oriented self that the future he or she was meant to become. These new folktales replaced magic with technology, and supernatural forces with Stalin. Instead of receiving essential advice from a mythical being, the protagonist would be given advice from omniscient Stalin. If the character followed Stalin's divine advice, he could be assured success in all his endeavors and a complete transformation into the \"New Soviet Man.\" The villains of these contemporary fairy tales were the Whites and their leader Idolisce, \"the most monstrous idol,\" who was the equivalent of the tsar. Descriptions of the Whites in noviny mirrored those of the Tartars in byliny. In these new stories, the Whites were incompetent, stagnant capitalists, while the Soviet citizens became invincible heroes.Once Stalin died in March 1953, folklorists of the period quickly abandoned the new folktales. Written by individual authors and performers, noviny did not come from the oral traditions of the working class. Consequently, today they are considered pseudo-folklore, rather than genuine Soviet (or Russian) folklore. Without any true connection to the masses, there was no reason noviny should be considered anything other than contemporary literature. Specialists decided that attempts to represent contemporary life through the structure and artistry of the ancient epics could not be considered genuine folklore. Stalin's name has been omitted from the few surviving pseudo-folktales of the period. Instead of considering folklore under Stalin a renaissance of the traditional Russian epic, today it is generally regarded as a period of restraint and falsehood.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nRussian literature is considered to be among the most influential and developed in the world, with some of the most famous literary works belonging to it. Russia's literary history dates back to the 10th century; in the 18th century its development was boosted by the works of Mikhail Lomonosov and Denis Fonvizin, and by the early 19th century a modern native tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers of all time. This period and the Golden Age of Russian Poetry began with Alexander Pushkin, considered to be the founder of modern Russian literature and often described as the \"Russian Shakespeare\" or the \"Russian Goethe\". It continued in the 19th century with the poetry of Mikhail Lermontov and Nikolay Nekrasov, dramas of Aleksandr Ostrovsky and Anton Chekhov, and the prose of Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, Ivan Goncharov, Aleksey Pisemsky and Nikolai Leskov. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in particular were titanic figures, to the point that many literary critics have described one or the other as the greatest novelist ever.By the 1880s Russian literature had begun to change. The age of the great novelists was over and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres of Russian literature for the next several decades, which later became known as the Silver Age of Russian Poetry. Previously dominated by realism, Russian literature came under strong influence of symbolism in the years between 1893 and 1914. Leading writers of this age include Valery Bryusov, Andrei Bely, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Aleksandr Blok, Nikolay Gumilev, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Fyodor Sologub, Anna Akhmatova, Osip Mandelstam, Marina Tsvetaeva, Leonid Andreyev, Ivan Bunin, and Maxim Gorky.\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing civil war, Russian cultural life was left in chaos. Some prominent writers, like Ivan Bunin and Vladimir Nabokov left the country, while a new generation of talented writers joined together in different organizations with the aim of creating a new and distinctive working-class culture appropriate for the new state, the Soviet Union. Throughout the 1920s writers enjoyed broad tolerance. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with Joseph Stalin's policy of socialist realism. After his death the restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring official guidelines. The leading authors of the Soviet era included Yevgeny Zamiatin, Isaac Babel, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Ilf and Petrov, Yury Olesha, Mikhail Bulgakov, Boris Pasternak, Mikhail Sholokhov, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, and Andrey Voznesensky.\nThe Soviet era was also the golden age of Russian science fiction, that was initially inspired by western authors and enthusiastically developed with the success of Soviet space program. Authors like Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, Kir Bulychev, Ivan Yefremov, Alexander Belyaev enjoyed mainstream popularity at the time. An important theme of Russian literature has always been the Russian soul.\n\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n\nSome Russian writers, like Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, are known also as philosophers, while many more authors are known primarily for their philosophical works. Russian philosophy blossomed since the 19th century, when it was defined initially by the opposition of Westernizers, advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and Slavophiles, insisting on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group includes Nikolai Danilevsky and Konstantin Leontiev, the early founders of eurasianism.\nIn its further developments, Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, politics and nationalism; cosmos and religion were other primary subjects. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include Vladimir Solovyov, Sergei Bulgakov, Pavel Florensky, Nikolai Berdyaev, Vladimir Lossky and Vladimir Vernadsky. In the 20th century Russian philosophy became dominated by Marxism.\n\n\n=== Humour ===\n\nRussia owes much of its wit to the great flexibility and richness of the Russian language, allowing for puns and unexpected associations. As with any other nation, its vast scope ranges from lewd jokes and silly word play to political satire.\nRussian jokes, the most popular form of Russian humour, are short fictional stories or dialogues with a punch line. Russian joke culture features a series of categories with fixed and highly familiar settings and characters. Surprising effects are achieved by an endless variety of plots. Russians love jokes on topics found everywhere in the world, be it politics, spouse relations, or mothers-in-law.\nChastushka, a type of traditional Russian poetry, is a single quatrain in trochaic tetrameter with an \"abab\" or \"abcb\" rhyme scheme. Usually humorous, satirical, or ironic in nature, chastushkas are often put to music as well, usually with balalaika or accordion accompaniment. The rigid, short structure (and to a lesser degree, the type of humor these use) parallels limericks. The name originates from the Russian word \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0301\u0442\u044c, meaning \"to speak fast.\"\n\n\n== Visual arts ==\nRussian visual artworks are similar in style with the ones from other eastern Slavic countries, like Ukraine or Belarus.\nAs early as the 12th and 13th centuries Russia had its national masters who were free of all foreign influence, i. e. that of the Greeks on the one hand, and on the other hand that of the Lombard master-masons called in Andrei Georgievich to build the Uspensky (Assumption) Cathedral in the city of Vladimir. Russia's relations with the Greek world were hampered by the Mongol invasion, and it is to the isolation arising from this that we must attribute the originality of Slavo-Russian ornamentation, which has a character of its own, quite unlike the Byzantine style and its derivative, the Romanesque.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nRussian architecture began with the woodcraft buildings of ancient Slavs. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers. Since the Christianization of Kievan Rus', for several centuries Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the Byzantine architecture, until the Fall of Constantinople. Apart from fortifications (kremlins), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were Orthodox churches, with their many domes, often gilded or brightly painted. Aristotle Fioravanti and other Italian architects brought Renaissance trends into Russia. The 16th century saw the development of unique tent-like churches culminating in Saint Basil's Cathedral. By that time the onion dome design was also fully developed. In the 17th century, the \"fiery style\" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and Yaroslavl, gradually paving the way for the Naryshkin baroque of the 1690s. After Peter the Great reforms had made Russia much closer to Western culture, the change of the architectural styles in the country generally followed that of Western Europe.\nThe 18th-century taste for Rococo architecture led to the splendid works of Bartolomeo Rastrelli and his followers. During the reign of Catherine the Great and her grandson Alexander I, the city of Saint Petersburg was transformed into an outdoor museum of Neoclassical architecture. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the Byzantine and Russian Revival style (this corresponds to Gothic Revival in Western Europe). Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the Art Nouveau (Fyodor Shekhtel), Constructivism (Moisei Ginzburg and Victor Vesnin), and the Stalin Empire style (Boris Iofan). After Stalin's death a new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, condemned the \"excesses\" of the former architectural styles, and in the late Soviet era the architecture of the country was dominated by plain functionalism. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created the large massives of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright architecture. After the end of the Soviet Union the situation improved. Many churches demolished in the Soviet times were rebuilt, and this process continues along with the restoration of various historical buildings destroyed in World War II. As for the original architecture, there is no more any common style in modern Russia, though International style has a great influence.\nSome notable Russian buildings include:\n\nSaint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod | Golden Gate (Vladimir) | Cathedral of Christ the Saviour | Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir | Cathedral of the Annunciation | Cathedral of the Archangel | Cathedral of the Dormition | Church of the Savior on Blood | Saint Basil's Cathedral | Kazan Kremlin | Saint Isaac's Cathedral | Kazan Cathedral | Peter and Paul Cathedral | Sukharev Tower | Menshikov Tower | Moscow Manege | Narva Triumphal Gate | Kolomenskoye | Peterhof Palace | Gatchina | Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra | Solovetsky Monastery | Kunstkamera | Russian Museum | Catherine Palace | Grand Kremlin Palace | Winter Palace | Simonov Monastery | Novodevichy Convent | Lenin's Mausoleum | Tatlin's Tower | Palace of the Soviets | Seven Sisters (Moscow) | All-Soviet Exhibition Centre | Ostankino Tower | Triumph-Palace | White House of Russia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Handicraft ===\n\nMatryoshka doll is a Russian nesting doll. A set of Matryoshka dolls consist of a wooden figure which can be pulled apart to reveal another figure of the same sort but somewhat smaller inside. It has in turn another somewhat smaller figure inside, and so on. The number of nested figures is usually six or more. The shape is mostly cylindrical, rounded at the top for the head and tapered towards the bottom, but little else. The dolls have no extremities, (except those that are painted). The true artistry is in the painting of each doll, which can be extremely elaborate. The theme is usually peasant girls in traditional dress, but can be almost anything; for instance, fairy tales or Soviet leaders.\nOther forms of Russian handicraft include khokhloma, Dymkovo toy, gzhel, Zhostovo painting, Filimonov toys, pisanka, Pavlovo Posad shawl, Rushnyk, and palekh.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Icon painting ===\n\nRussian icons are typically paintings on wood, often small, though some in churches and monasteries may be as large as a table top. Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the krasny ugol, the \"red\" or \"beautiful\" corner (see Icon Corner). There is a rich history and elaborate religious symbolism associated with icons. In Russian churches, the nave is typically separated from the sanctuary by an iconostasis (Russian ikonost\u00e1s) a wall of icons. Icon paintings in Russia attempted to help people with their prayers without idolizing the figure in the painting. The most comprehensive collection of Icon art is found at the Tretyakov Gallery.The use and making of icons entered Kievan Rus' following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians\u2014notably Andrei Rublev and Dionisius\u2014widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when Simon Ushakov's painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, changes in liturgy and practice instituted by Patriarch Nikon resulted in a split in the Russian Orthodox Church. The traditionalists, the persecuted \"Old Ritualists\" or \"Old Believers\", continued the traditional stylization of icons, while the State Church modified its practice. From that time icons began to be painted not only in the traditional stylized and nonrealistic mode, but also in a mixture of Russian stylization and Western European realism, and in a Western European manner very much like that of Catholic religious art of the time. The Stroganov movement and the icons from Nevyansk rank among the last important schools of Russian icon-painting.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Lubok ===\n\nA lubok (plural Lubki, Cyrillic: Russian: \u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0301\u043a, \u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0301\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430) is a Russian popular print, characterized by simple graphics and narratives derived from literature, religious stories and popular tales. Lubki prints were used as decoration in houses and inns. Early examples from the late 17th and early 18th centuries were woodcuts, then engravings or etchings were typical, and from the mid-19th century lithography. They sometimes appeared in series, which might be regarded as predecessors of the modern comic strip. Cheap and simple books, similar to chapbooks, which mostly consisted of pictures, are called lubok literature or (Cyrillic: Russian: \u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430). Both pictures and literature are commonly referred to simply as lubki. The Russian word lubok derives from lub \u2013 a special type of board that pictures were printed on.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Classical painting ===\n\nThe Russian Academy of Arts was created in 1757 with the aim of giving Russian artists an international role and status. Notable portrait painters from the Academy include Ivan Argunov, Fyodor Rokotov, Dmitry Levitzky, and Vladimir Borovikovsky.\nIn the early 19th century, when neoclassicism and romantism flourished, famous academic artists focused on mythological and Biblical themes, like Karl Briullov and Alexander Ivanov.\n\n\n=== Realist painting ===\n\nRealism came into dominance in the 19th century. The realists captured Russian identity in landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and birch clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries. Other artists focused on social criticism, showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority; critical realism flourished under the reign of Alexander II, with some artists making the circle of human suffering their main theme. Others focused on depicting dramatic moments in Russian history. The Peredvizhniki (wanderers) group of artists broke with Russian Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from Academic restrictions. Leading realists include Ivan Shishkin, Arkhip Kuindzhi, Ivan Kramskoi, Vasily Polenov, Isaac Levitan, Vasily Surikov, Viktor Vasnetsov and Ilya Repin.\nBy the turn of the 20th century and on, many Russian artists developed their own unique styles, neither realist nor avante-garde. These include Boris Kustodiev, Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin, Mikhail Vrubel and Nicholas Roerich. Many works by the Peredvizhniki group of artists have been highly sought after by collectors in recent years. Russian art auctions during Russian Art Week in London have increased in demand and works have been sold for record breaking prices.\n\n\n=== Russian avant-garde ===\n\nThe Russian avant-garde is an umbrella term used to define the large, influential wave of modernist art that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related, art movements that occurred at the time; namely neo-primitivism, suprematism, constructivism, rayonism, and futurism. Notable artists from this era include El Lissitzky, Kazimir Malevich, Wassily Kandinsky, Vladimir Tatlin, Alexander Rodchenko, Pavel Filonov and Marc Chagall. The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the Russian Revolution of 1917 and 1932, at which point the revolutionary ideas of the avant-garde clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of socialist realism.\nIn the 20th century many Russian artists made their careers in Western Europe, forced to emigrate by the Revolution. Wassily Kandinsky, Marc Chagall, Naum Gabo and others spread their work, ideas, and the impact of Russian art globally.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet art ===\n\nDuring the Russian Revolution a movement was initiated to put all arts to service of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The instrument for this was created just days before the October Revolution, known as Proletkult, an abbreviation for \"Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii\" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was Alexander Bogdanov. Initially, Narkompros (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. Although Marxist in character, the Proletkult gained the disfavor of many party leaders, and by 1922 it had declined considerably. It was eventually disbanded by Stalin in 1932. De facto restrictions on what artists could paint were abandoned by the late 1980s.\nHowever, in the late Soviet era many artists combined innovation with socialist realism including Ernst Neizvestny, Ilya Kabakov, Mikhail Shemyakin, Igor Novikov, Erik Bulatov, and Vera Mukhina. They employed techniques as varied as primitivism, hyperrealism, grotesque, and abstraction. Soviet artists produced works that were furiously patriotic and anti-fascist in the 1940s. After the Great Patriotic War Soviet sculptors made multiple monuments to the war dead, marked by a great restrained solemnity.\n\n\n== Performance arts ==\n\n\n=== Russian folk music ===\n\nRussians have distinctive traditions of folk music. Typical ethnic Russian musical instruments are gusli, balalaika, zhaleika, balalaika contrabass, bayan accordion, Gypsy guitar and garmoshka. Folk music had great influence on the Russian classical composers, and in modern times it is a source of inspiration for a number of popular folk bands, most prominent being Golden Ring, Ural's Nation Choir, Lyudmila Zykina. Russian folk songs, as well as patriotic songs of the Soviet era, constitute the bulk of repertoire of the world-renowned Red Army choir and other popular Russian ensembles.\n\n\n=== Russian folk dance ===\n\nRussian folk dance (Russian: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446 ) can generally be broken up into two main types of dances Khorovod (Russian: \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434), a circular game type dance where the participants hold hands, sing, and the action generally happens in the middle of circle, and Plyaska (Russian: \u041f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043a\u0430 or \u041f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439), a circular dance for men and women that increases in diversity and tempo, according to Bob Renfield, considered to be the preeminent scholar on the topic. Other forms of Russian Folk Dance include Pereplyas (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043b\u044f\u0441), an all-male competitive dance, Mass Dance (Russian: \u041c\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u044f\u0441), an unpaired stage dance without restrictions on age or number of participants, Group Dance (Russian: \u0413\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043a\u0430) a type of mass dance employs simple round-dance passages, and improvisation, and types of Quadrilles (Russian: \u041a\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043b\u044c), originally a French dance brought to Russia in the 18th century.\n\nEthnic Russian dances include khorovod (Russian: \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434), barynya (Russian: \u0411\u0430\u0440\u044b\u043d\u044f), kamarinskaya (Russian: \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f), kazachok (Russian: \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0447\u043e\u043a) and chechotka (Russian: \u0427\u0435\u0447\u0451\u0442\u043a\u0430) (a tap dance in bast shoes and with a bayan). Troika (Russian: \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430) A dance with one man and two women, named after the traditional Russian carriage which is led by three horses. Bear Dance or dancing with bears (Russian: \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446 \u0421 \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043c) Dates back to 907 when Great Russian Prince Oleg, in celebration of his victory over the Greeks in Kiev, had as entertainment, 16 male dancers dress as bears and four bears dress as dancers . Dances with dancers dressed as bears are a recurring theme, as seen a recording of the Omsk Russian Folk Chorus. One of the main characteristics of Russian furious dances is the Russian squat dance elements.\n\n\n=== Classical music ===\n\nMusic in 19th-century Russia was defined by the tension between classical composer Mikhail Glinka along with the other members of The Mighty Handful, who embraced Russian national identity and added religious and folk elements to their compositions, and the Russian Musical Society led by composers Anton and Nikolay Rubinstein, which was musically conservative. The later Romantic tradition of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, one of the most popular composers of the Romantic era, whose music has come to be known and loved for its distinctly Russian character as well as its rich harmonies and stirring melodies, was brought into the 20th century by Sergei Rachmaninoff, one of the last great champions of the Romantic style of European classical music.World-renowned composers of the 20th century included Alexander Scriabin, Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich and Georgy Sviridov. During most of the Soviet Era, music was highly scrutinized and kept within a conservative, accessible idiom in conformity with the policy of socialist realism.\nSoviet and Russian conservatories have turned out generations of world-renowned soloists. Among the best known are violinists David Oistrakh and Gidon Kremer; cellist Mstislav Rostropovich; pianists Vladimir Horowitz, Sviatoslav Richter, and Emil Gilels; and vocalists Fyodor Shalyapin, Galina Vishnevskaya, Anna Netrebko and Dmitry Hvorostovsky.\n\n\n=== Ballet ===\n\nThe original purpose of the ballet in Russia was to entertain the imperial court. The first ballet company was the Imperial School of Ballet in St. Petersburg in the 1740s. The Ballets Russes was a ballet company founded in the 1909 by Sergey Diaghilev, an enormously important figure in the Russian ballet scene. Diaghilev and his Ballets Russes' travels abroad profoundly influenced the development of dance worldwide. The headquarters of his ballet company was located in Paris, France. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Diaghilev, George Balanchine, founded the New York City Ballet Company in 1948.\nDuring the early 20th century, Russian ballet dancers Anna Pavlova and Vaslav Nijinsky rose to fame. Soviet ballet preserved the perfected 19th century traditions, and the Soviet Union's choreography schools produced one internationally famous star after another, including Maya Plisetskaya, Rudolf Nureyev, and Mikhail Baryshnikov. The Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow and the Mariinsky in Saint Petersburg remain famous throughout the world.\n\n\n=== Opera ===\n\nThe first known opera made in Russia was A Life for the Tsar by Mikhail Glinka in 1836. This was followed by several operas such as Ruslan and Lyudmila in 1842. Russian opera was originally a combination of Russian folk music and Italian opera. After the October revolution many opera composers left Russia. Russia's most popular operas include Boris Godunov, Eugene Onegin, The Golden Cockerel, Prince Igor, and The Queen of Spades.\n\n\n=== Modern music ===\n\nSince the late Soviet times Russia has experienced another wave of Western cultural influence, which led to the development of many previously unknown phenomena in the Russian culture. The most vivid example, perhaps, is the Russian rock music, which takes its roots both in the Western rock and roll and heavy metal, and in traditions of the Russian bards of Soviet era, like Vladimir Vysotsky and Bulat Okudzhava. Saint-Petersburg (former Leningrad), Yekaterinburg (former Sverdlovsk) and Omsk became the main centers of development of the rock music. Popular Russian rock groups include Mashina Vremeni, Slot, DDT, Aquarium, Alisa, Kino, Nautilus Pompilius, Aria, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, Splean and Korol i Shut. At the same time Russian pop music developed from what was known in the Soviet times as estrada into full-fledged industry, with some performers gaining international recognition, like t.A.T.u. in the West, who have been said to be the most influential artists to ever come out of Russia, or Vitas in China. Another kind of music, Hardbass, has become an internet meme.\n\n\n=== Cinema of Russia ===\n\nWhile in the industrialized nations of the West, motion pictures had first been accepted as a form of cheap recreation and leisure for the working class, Russian filmmaking came to prominence following the 1917 revolution when it explored editing as the primary mode of cinematic expression. Russian and later Soviet cinema was a hotbed of invention in the period immediately following the 1917 revolution, resulting in world-renowned films such as Battleship Potemkin. Soviet-era filmmakers, most notably Sergei Eisenstein and Andrei Tarkovsky, would become some of the world's most innovative and influential directors.\n\nEisenstein was a student of filmmaker and theorist Lev Kuleshov, who developed the groundbreaking Soviet montage theory of film editing at the world's first film school, the All-Union Institute of Cinematography. Dziga Vertov, whose kino-glaz (\"film-eye\") theory\u2014that the camera, like the human eye, is best used to explore real life\u2014had a huge impact on the development of documentary film making and cinema realism. In 1932, Stalin made socialist realism the state policy; this somewhat limited creativity, however many Soviet films in this style were artistically successful, like Chapaev, The Cranes Are Flying, and Ballad of a Soldier.1960s and 1970s saw a greater variety of artistic styles in the Soviet cinema. Eldar Ryazanov's and Leonid Gaidai's comedies of that time were immensely popular, with many of the catch phrases still in use today. In 1961\u20131967 Sergey Bondarchuk directed an Oscar-winning film adaptation of Tolstoy's epic War and Peace, which was the most expensive Soviet film made. In 1969, Vladimir Motyl's White Sun of the Desert was released, a very popular film in a genre known as 'osterns'; the film is traditionally watched by cosmonauts before any trip into space.The late 1980s and 1990s were a period of crisis in Russian cinema and animation. Although Russian filmmakers became free to express themselves, state subsidies were drastically reduced, resulting in fewer films produced. The early years of the 21st century have brought increased viewership and subsequent prosperity to the industry on the back of the economy's rapid development, and production levels are already higher than in Britain and Germany. Russia's total box-office revenue in 2007 was $565 million, up 37% from the previous year (by comparison, in 1996 revenues stood at $6 million). Russian cinema continues to receive international recognition. Russian Ark (2002) was the first feature film ever to be shot in a single take.\n\n\n=== Animation ===\n\nRussia also has a long and rich tradition of animation, which started already in the late Russian Empire times. Most of Russia's cartoon production for cinema and television was created during Soviet times, when Soyuzmultfilm studio was the largest animation producer. Soviet animators developed a great and unmatched variety of pioneering techniques and aesthetic styles, with prominent directors including Ivan Ivanov-Vano, Fyodor Khitruk and Aleksandr Tatarskiy. Soviet cartoons are still a source for many popular catch phrases, while such cartoon heroes as Russian-style Winnie-the-Pooh, cute little Cheburashka, Wolf and Hare from Nu, Pogodi! being iconic images in Russia and many surrounding countries. The traditions of Soviet animation were developed in the past decade by such directors as Aleksandr Petrov and studios like Melnitsa, along with Ivan Maximov.\n\n\n== Media and technology ==\n\n\n=== Radio and TV ===\n\nRussia was among the first countries to introduce radio and television. Due to the enormous size of the country Russia leads in the number of TV broadcast stations and repeaters. There were few channels in the Soviet time, but in the past two decades many new state-run and private-owned radio stations and TV channels appeared. In 2005 a state-run English language Russia Today TV started broadcasting, and its Arabic version Rusiya Al-Yaum was launched in 2007.\n\n\n=== Internet ===\n\nOriginating from Russian scientific community and telecommunication industries, a specific Russian culture of using the Internet has been established since the early 1990s. In the second half of the 1990s, the term Runet was coined to call the segment of Internet written or understood in the Russian language. Whereas the Internet \"has no boundaries\", \"Russian Internet\" (online communications in the Russian language) can not be localized solely to the users residing in the Russian Federation as it includes Russian-speaking people from all around the world. This segment includes millions of users in other ex-USSR countries, Israel and others abroad diasporas.With the introduction of the Web, many social and cultural events found reflections within the Russian Internet society. Various online communities formed, and the most popular one grew out of the Russian-speaking users of the California-based blogging platform LiveJournal (which was completely bought out in December 2007 by Russian firm SUP Fabrik). In January 2008 a LiveJournal blog of the \"3rd statesman\" Sergey Mironov had appeared and he was shortly followed by the new President Dmitry Medvedev who opened a personal video blog which was later also expanded with a LiveJournal version.\nAs of late, there are scores of websites offering Russian language content including mass media, e-commerce, search engines and so on. Particularly notorious are the \"Russian Hackers\". Russian web design studios, software and web-hosting enterprises offer a variety of services, and the results form a sort of national digital culture. E-commerce giants such as Google and Microsoft have their Russian branches. In September 2007, the national domain .ru passed the milestone of a million domain names. By the end of the 2000s, VKontakte social network became the most populated in the Runet.\n\n\n=== Science and innovation ===\n\nAt the start of the 18th century the reforms of Peter the Great (the founder of Russian Academy of Sciences and Saint Petersburg State University) and the work of such champions as polymath Mikhail Lomonosov (the founder of Moscow State University) gave a great boost for development of science, engineering and innovation in Russia. In the 19th and 20th centuries Russia produced a large number of great scientists and inventors.\nNikolai Lobachevsky, a Copernicus of Geometry, developed the non-Euclidean geometry. Dmitry Mendeleev invented the Periodic table, the main framework of the modern chemistry. Nikolay Benardos introduced the arc welding, further developed by Nikolay Slavyanov, Konstantin Khrenov and other Russian engineers. Gleb Kotelnikov invented the knapsack parachute, while Evgeniy Chertovsky introduced the pressure suit. Pavel Yablochkov and Alexander Lodygin were great pioneers of electrical engineering and inventors of early electric lamps.\nAlexander Popov was among the inventors of radio, while Nikolai Basov and Alexander Prokhorov were co-inventors of lasers and masers. Igor Tamm, Andrei Sakharov and Lev Artsimovich developed the idea of tokamak for controlled nuclear fusion and created its first prototype, which finally led to the modern ITER project. Many famous Russian scientists and inventors were \u00e9migr\u00e9s, like Igor Sikorsky and Vladimir Zworykin, and many foreign ones worked in Russia for a long time, like Leonard Euler and Alfred Nobel.\n\nThe greatest Russian successes are in the field of space technology and space exploration. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky was the father of theoretical astronautics. His works had inspired leading Soviet rocket engineers such as Sergei Korolev, Valentin Glushko, and many others that contributed to the success of the Soviet space program at early stages of the Space Race and beyond.\nIn 1957 the first Earth-orbiting artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched; in 1961 on 12 April the first human trip into space was successfully made by Yury Gagarin; and many other Soviet and Russian space exploration records ensued, including the first spacewalk performed by Alexei Leonov, the first space exploration rover Lunokhod-1 and the first space station Salyut 1. Nowadays Russia is the largest satellite launcher and the only provider of transport for space tourism services.\n\nOther technologies, where Russia historically leads, include nuclear technology, aircraft production and arms industry. The creation of the first nuclear power plant along with the first nuclear reactors for submarines and surface ships was directed by Igor Kurchatov. NS Lenin was the world's first nuclear-powered surface ship as well as the first nuclear-powered civilian vessel, and NS Arktika became the first surface ship to reach the North Pole.\nA number of prominent Soviet aerospace engineers, inspired by the theoretical works of Nikolai Zhukovsky, supervised the creation of many dozens of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of KBs (Construction Bureaus) that now constitute the bulk of Russian United Aircraft Corporation. Famous Russian airplanes include the first supersonic passenger jet Tupolev Tu-144 by Alexei Tupolev, MiG fighter aircraft series by Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich, and Su series by Pavel Sukhoi and his followers. MiG-15 is the world's most produced jet aircraft in history, while MiG-21 is most produced supersonic aircraft. During World War II era Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1 was introduced as the first rocket-powered fighter aircraft, and Ilyushin Il-2 bomber became the most produced military aircraft in history. Polikarpov Po-2 Kukuruznik is the world's most produced biplane, and Mil Mi-8 is the most produced helicopter.\nFamous Russian battle tanks include T-34, the best tank design of World War II, and further tanks of T-series, including T-54/55, the most produced tank in history, first fully gas turbine tank T-80 and the most modern Russian tank T-90. The AK-47 and AK-74 by Mikhail Kalashnikov constitute the most widely used type of assault rifle throughout the world \u2013 so much so that more AK-type rifles have been produced than all other assault rifles combined. With these and other weapons Russia for a long time has been among the world's top suppliers of arms.\n\n\n== Lifestyle ==\n\n\n=== Ethnic dress of Russian people ===\n\nNot only the minorities in Russia but the Russian culture as a whole has in the different regions of the country like in Northwest Russia, Central Russia, Southern Russia, Siberian Russia, Volga Russia, Ural Russia, Far East Russia and the Russian North Caucasus and their Oblasts own local traditions and characteristics which were developed over a long period of time through strong ethno-cultural interactions within the various groups and communities, like Slavs, Tatars and Finno-Ugrics.Traditional Russian clothes include kaftan, a cloth which Old Russia had in common with similar robes in the Ottoman Empire, Scandinavia and Persia. Kosovorotka, which was over a long time of period a traditional holidays blouse worn by men. Ushanka for men, which design was influenced in 17th century when in central and northern Russia a hat with earflaps called treukh was worn. Sarafan which is connected to the Middle East region and were worn in Central- and Northern regions of Old Russia. In Southern Russia burka and papaha are connected to the Cossacks which, in turn, is culturally connected to the people of the Northern Caucaus. Kokoshnik for women was primarily worn in the northern regions of Russia in the 16th to 19th centuries. Lapti and similar shoes were mostly worn by poorer members in Old Russia and northern regions were Slavic, Baltic and Finno-Ugric people lived. Valenki are traditional Russian shoes from 18th century designs which originally originated in the Great steppe, from Asian nomads. Russian traditional cloths and its elements still have a high priority in today's Russia, especially in pagan Slavic communities, folk festivals, Cossack communities, in modern fashion and Russian music ensembles.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nRussian cuisine widely uses fish, poultry, mushrooms, berries, and honey. Crops of rye, wheat, barley, and millet provide the ingredients for a plethora of breads, pancakes, cereals, kvass, beer, and vodka. Black bread is relatively more popular in Russia compared to the rest of the world. Soups, stews and filled dumplings are very characteristic for Russian cuisine. The most popular soups include shchi, borsch, ukha, solyanka and okroshka. Smetana (a heavy sour cream) is often added to soups and salads. Most popular dumplings are pirozhki, pelmeni, varenyky and Turkic manti. One of the most popular are foods are blini, which are like syrniki native types of Russian pancakes. Furthermore, Cutlets (like Chicken Kiev) and shashlyk are popular meat dishes, the last one being of Tatar and Caucasus. origin respectively. Popular salads include Russian Salad, vinaigrette and Dressed Herring. One of the main characteristics of Russian food culture are Zakuski, which define a Russian-laid table.\n\n\n=== Traditions ===\n\n\n=== Holidays ===\n\nThere are eight public holidays in Russia. The New Year is the first in calendar and in popularity. Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with New Year Trees and gifts, and Ded Moroz (Father Frost) playing the same role as Santa Claus. Rozhdestvo (Orthodox Christmas) falls on 7 January, because Russian Orthodox Church still follows the Julian (old style) calendar and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Catholic ones. Another two major Christian holidays are Paskha (Easter) and Troitsa (Trinity), but there is no need to recognize them as public holidays since they are always celebrated on Sunday.\nFurther Russian public holidays include Defender of the Fatherland Day (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; International Women's Day (8 March), which combines the traditions of Mother's Day and Valentine's Day; International Workers' Day (1 May), now renamed Spring and Labor Day; Victory Day (9 May); Russia Day (12 June); and Unity Day (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the Polish-Lithuanian occupation force from Moscow in 1612. The latter is a replacement for the old Soviet holiday celebrating October Revolution of 1917 (again, it was falling on November because of the difference of calendars). Fireworks and outdoor concerts are common features of all Russian public holidays.\n\nVictory Day is the second popular holiday in Russia, it commemorates the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II and is widely celebrated throughout Russia. A huge military parade, hosted by the President of the Russian Federation, is annually organized in Moscow on Red Square. Similar parades are organized in all major Russian cities and the cities with the status Hero city or City of Military Glory.\nOther popular holidays, which are not public, include Old New Year (New Year according to Julian Calendar on 1 January), Tatiana Day (day of Russian students on 25 January), Maslenitsa (an old pagan holiday a week before the Great Lent), Cosmonautics Day (a day of Yury Gagarin's first ever human trip into space on 12 April), Ivan Kupala Day (another pagan Slavic holiday on 7 July) and Peter and Fevronia Day (taking place on 8 July and being the Russian analogue of Valentine's Day, which focuses, however, on the family love and fidelity). On different days in June there are major celebrations of the end of the school year, when graduates from schools and universities traditionally swim in the city fountains; the local varieties of these public events include Scarlet Sails tradition in Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nChristianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Judaism are Russia's traditional religions, deemed part of Russia's \"historical heritage\" in a law passed in 1997.\nEstimates of believers widely fluctuate among sources, and some reports put the number of non-believers in Russia as high as 16\u201348% of the population. Russian Orthodoxy is the dominant religion in Russia. 95% of the registered Orthodox parishes belong to the Russian Orthodox Church while there are a number of smaller Orthodox Churches. However, the vast majority of Orthodox believers do not attend church on a regular basis. Nonetheless, the church is widely respected by both believers and nonbelievers, who see it as a symbol of Russian heritage and culture. Smaller Christian denominations such as Roman Catholics, Armenian Gregorians, and various Protestants exist.\n\nThe ancestors of many of today's Russians adopted Orthodox Christianity in the 10th century. The 2007 International Religious Freedom Report published by the US Department of State said that approximately 100 million citizens consider themselves Russian Orthodox Christians. According to a poll by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 63% of respondents considered themselves Russian Orthodox, 6% of respondents considered themselves Muslim and less than 1% considered themselves either Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant or Jewish. Another 12% said they believe in God, but did not practice any religion, and 16% said they are non-believers.\n\n\n=== Cossack culture in Russia ===\n\nThe steppe culture of the Russian Cossacks originated from nomadic steppe people which merged with Eastern Slavic people groups into large communities. The early Cossack communities emerged in the 14th century, the first, among others, were the Don Cossacks. Other Cossack communities that have played an important role in Russia's history and culture are the Ural Cossacks, Terek Cossacks, Kuban Cossacks, Orenburg Cossacks, Volga Cossacks, Astrakhan Cossacks, Siberian Cossacks, Transbaikal Cossacks, Amur Cossacks, Ussuri Cossacks. Cossacks defended the Russian borders and expanded Russia's territory. The regions of the large Cossack communities enjoyed many freedoms in Tsarist Russia. The culture of the Cossacks became an important part of Russian culture, many Russian songs and various elements in dances and Russias culture in general were much shaped by the Cossack communities.\n\n\n=== Russian forest culture ===\nThe forest plays a very important role in Russia's more than 1000-year-old culture and history. The forest had a great influence on the characteristics of Russian people and their cultural creations. Many myths of Russian culture are closely intertwined with the forest. Various of the early Slavic and other tribes built their houses out of wood so that the forest influenced the style of Russian architecture significantly. The handcraft Hohloma which originated in the Volga region is made out of wood and depicts numerous plants of the forest, like the berry Viburnum opulus (Russian: \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430, Kalina), flowers and leaves. Many Russian fairy tales play in the forest and fictional characters like Baba Yaga are strongly connected to Russian wood culture. The forest is also an important subject of many Russian folk songs.\n\n\n=== More elements of Russian society and culture ===\nRussian walking culture\nStrolling or walking (Russian: \u0433\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c, gulyat') is very common in the Russian society. In contrast to many western countries strolling is very common among young people in Russia. Young people often arrange just to go for a walk. Besides the verb, the experience itself, which describes the time span of the walk, is called progulka (Russian: \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0430). Walking is so important in Russian culture that gulyat' is also a synonym for \"to party\".Mushroom hunting and berry picking\nActivities in the forest where people pick mushrooms and berries are very common in Russia.\nMushrooms (Russian: \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b, griby) are an important part of Russian folk culture at least since the 10th century and became an essential part of Russian meals. There exist more than 200 kinds of edible mushrooms in Russia. Mushromms were always considered as magical and so they play a prominent role in Russian fairy tales. The ability to identify and prepare edible mushrooms is often passed on from generation to generation. The mushroom hunting tradition is especially common in Slavic-speaking and Baltic countries. The berry (Russian: \u042f\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, Yagoda) also play an important role in Russian folk culture and is often part of Russian craftsmanship, folk songs and national costumes. The cranberry was known in Europe for centuries even as the \"Russian berry\". To pick mushrooms and berries in forests is a kind of meditation in Russia.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nRussians have been successful at a number of sports and consistently finish in the top rankings at the Olympic Games and in other international competitions. Combining the total medals of Soviet Union and Russia, the country is second among all nations by number of gold medals both at the Summer Olympics and at the Winter Olympics.\nDuring the Soviet era, the national Olympic team placed first in the total number of medals won at 14 of its 18 appearances; with these performances, the USSR was the dominant Olympic power of its era. Since the 1952 Olympic Games, Soviet and later Russian athletes have always been in the top three for the number of gold medals collected at the Summer Olympics.\nSoviet gymnasts, track-and-field athletes, weight lifters, wrestlers, boxers, fencers, shooters, chess players, cross country skiers, biathletes, speed skaters and figure skaters were consistently among the best in the world, along with Soviet basketball, handball, volleyball and ice hockey players. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian athletes have continued to dominate international competitions. The 1980 Summer Olympic Games were held in Moscow while the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics were hosted by Sochi.\n\nSoviet Union dominated the sport of gymnastics for many years, with such athletes as Larisa Latynina, who, until 2012, held a record of most Olympic medals won per person and most gold Olympic medals won by a woman. Today, Russia is leading in rhythmic gymnastics with such stars as Alina Kabaeva, Irina Tschaschina and Yevgeniya Kanayeva.\nRussian synchronized swimming is the best in the world, with almost all gold medals having been swept by Russians at Olympics and World Championships for more than a decade. Figure skating is another popular sport in Russia; in the 1960s, the Soviet Union rose to become a dominant power in figure skating, especially in pair skating and ice dancing, and at every Winter Olympics from 1964 until 2006, a Soviet or Russian pair has won gold, often considered the longest winning streak in modern sports history. Since the end of the Soviet era, tennis has grown in popularity and Russia has produced a number of famous tennis players. Chess is also a widely popular pastime; from 1927, Soviet and Russian chess grandmasters have held the world championship almost continuously.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nAs the Soviet Union, Russia was traditionally very strong in basketball, winning Olympic tournaments, World Championships and Eurobasket. As of 2009 they have various players in the NBA, notably Utah Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko, and are considered as a worldwide basketball force. In 2007, Russia defeated world champions Spain to win Eurobasket 2007. Russian basketball clubs such as PBC CSKA Moscow (numerous Euroleague Champions) have also had great success in European competitions such as the Euroleague and the ULEB Cup.\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nAlthough ice hockey was only introduced during the Soviet era, the national team soon dominated the sport internationally, winning gold at seven of the nine Olympics and 19 of the 30 World Championships they contested between 1954 and 1991. Russian players Valeri Kharlamov, Sergei Makarov, Viacheslav Fetisov and Vladislav Tretiak hold four of the six positions on the IIHF Team of the Century. As with some other sports, the Russian ice hockey programme suffered after the breakup of the Soviet Union, with Russia enduring a 15-year gold medal drought. At that time many prominent Russian players made their careers in the National Hockey League (NHL). In recent years Russia has reemerged as a hockey power, winning back to back gold medals in the 2008 and 2009 World Championships, and overtaking Team Canada as the top ranked ice hockey team in the world, but then lost to Canada in the quarter-finals of the 2010 Olympics and 2010 World Junior Championship. The Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) was founded in 2008 as a rival of the NHL.\n\n\n=== Bandy ===\nBandy, known in Russian as \"hockey with a ball\" and sometimes informally as \"Russian hockey\" (as opposed to \"Canadian hockey\", an informal name for ice hockey), is another traditionally popular ice sport, with national league games averaging around 3,500 spectators. It's considered a national sport. The Soviet Union national bandy team won all the Bandy World Championships from 1957 to 1979. The Russian team is the reigning world champion since the 2014 tournament, having defended the title in 2015.\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nDuring the Soviet period, Russia was also a competitive footballing nation. Despite having legendary players such as goalkeeper of the century Lev Yashin, the USSR never really managed to assert itself as one of the major forces of international football, although its teams won various championships (such as Euro 1960) and reached numerous finals (such as Euro 1988). Along with ice hockey and basketball, football is one of the most popular sports in modern Russia. In recent years, Russian football, which downgraded in 1990-s, has experienced a revival. Russian clubs (such as CSKA Moscow, Zenit St Petersburg, Lokomotiv Moscow, and Spartak Moscow) are becoming increasingly successful on the European stage (CSKA and Zenit winning the UEFA Cup in 2005 and 2008 respectively). The Russian national football team reached the semi-finals of Euro 2008, losing only to eventual champions Spain. The nation also hosted the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup as well as the 2018 FIFA World Cup at which the national team lost in the Quarterfinals 4\u20132 on penalty kicks to Croatia, their best ever finish as an independent nation.\n\n\n=== Martial arts ===\n\nRussia has an extensive history of martial arts. Some of its best-known forms include the fistfight, Sambo, and Systema with its derivatives Ryabko's Systema and Retuinskih's System ROSS. Undefeated lightweight UFC champion Khabib Nurmagomedov is from Makhachkala and was called by President Vladimir Putin following his victory over Conor McGregor.\n\n\n== National symbols ==\n\n\n=== State symbols ===\nState symbols of Russia include the Byzantine double-headed eagle, combined with St. George of Moscow in the Russian coat of arms; these symbols date from the time of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The Russian flag appeared in the late Tsardom of Russia period and became widely used during the era of the Russian Empire. The current Russian national anthem shares its music with the Soviet Anthem, though not the lyrics (many Russians of older generations don't know the new lyrics and sing the old ones). The Russian imperial motto God is with us and the Soviet motto Proletarians of all countries, unite! are now obsolete and no new motto has been officially introduced to replace them. The Hammer and sickle and the full Soviet coat of arms are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. Soviet Red Stars are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The Soviet Red Banner is still honored, especially the Banner of Victory of 1945.\n\n\n=== Unofficial symbols ===\nThe Matryoshka doll is a recognizable symbol of Russia, while the towers of Moscow Kremlin and Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow are main Russia's architectural symbols. Cheburashka is a mascot of Russian national Olympic team. Mary, Saint Nicholas, Saint Andrew, Saint George, Saint Alexander Nevsky, Saint Sergius of Radonezh, Saint Seraphim of Sarov are Russia's patron saints. Chamomile is a flower that Russians often associate with their Motherland, while birch is a national tree. The Russian bear is an animal often associated with Russia, though this image has Western origins and Russians themselves do not consider it as a special symbol. The native Russian national personification is \"\u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c\" Mother Motherland (the statue of it located on the Mamay hill \"\u041c\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0432 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\" in Volgograd /former Stalingrad/), called Mother Russia at the West.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet times, first inner tourism and then international tourism as well. Rich cultural heritage and great natural variety place Russia among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. The country contains 29 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, while many more are on UNESCO's tentative lists. Major tourist routes in Russia include a travel around the Golden Ring of ancient cities, cruises on the big rivers like Volga, and long journeys on the famous Trans-Siberian Railway. Diverse regions and ethnic cultures of Russia offer many different food and souvenirs, and show a great variety of traditions, like Russian banya, Tatar Sabantuy, or Siberian shamanist rituals.\n\n\n=== Cultural tourism ===\n\nMost popular tourist destinations in Russia are Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the current and the former capitals of the country and great cultural centers, recognized as World Cities. Moscow and Saint Petersburg feature such world-renowned museums as Tretyakov Gallery and Hermitage, famous theaters like Bolshoi and Mariinsky, ornate churches like Saint Basil's Cathedral, Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Saint Isaac's Cathedral and Church of the Savior on Blood, impressive fortifications like Moscow Kremlin and Peter and Paul Fortress, beautiful squares like Red Square and Palace Square, and streets like Tverskaya and Nevsky Prospect. Rich palaces and parks of extreme beauty are found in the former imperial residences in suburbs of Moscow (Kolomenskoye, Tsaritsyno) and Saint Petersburg (Peterhof, Strelna, Oranienbaum, Gatchina, Pavlovsk Palace, Tsarskoye Selo). Moscow contains a great variety of impressive Soviet-era buildings along with modern skyscrapers, while Saint Petersburg, nicknamed Venice of the North, boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, channels and bridges.\nKazan, the capital of Tatarstan, shows a unique mix of Christian Russian and Muslim Tatar cultures. The city has registered a brand The Third Capital of Russia, though a number of other major Russian cities compete for this status, like Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg and Nizhny Novgorod, all being major cultural centers with rich history and prominent architecture. Veliky Novgorod, Pskov and the cities of Golden Ring (Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Kostroma and others) have at best preserved the architecture and the spirit of ancient and medieval Rus', and also are among the main tourist destinations. Many old fortifications (typically Kremlins), monasteries and churches are scattered throughout Russia, forming its unique cultural landscape both in big cities and in remote areas.\n\n\n=== Resorts and nature tourism ===\n\nThe warm subtropical Black Sea coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea resorts, like Sochi, known for its beaches and wonderful nature. At the same time Sochi can boast a number of major ski resorts, like Krasnaya Polyana; the city is the host of 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics.

It was placed in Holford Square (briefly Lenin's home when he lived in London) and unveiled in 1942. It was a supposed focal point of a new housing development to be named 'Lenin Court' although the choice of Lenin proved unpopular with the local community and the bust was frequently daubed with anti-communist slogans. Lubetkin had the bust removed and when the housing development was completed in the late 1940s, it was renamed 'Bevin Court'. The bust was displayed in Islington Town Hall for many years and is now on permanent display in the museum.\nBelfast - The Kremlin Bar, a gay bar, has a statue of Lenin welcoming partygoers over the main entrance.\n\n\n=== Ukraine ===\n\nIn 1991 Ukraine had 5,500 Lenin monuments.In Ukraine more than 500 statues of Lenin were dismantled between February 2014 and mid-April 2015, after which nearly 1,700 remained standing. On 15 May 2015 President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a bill into law that set a six-month deadline for the removal of the country's communist monuments. By December 2015 Lenin monuments 1,300 were still standing (in Ukraine).Prior to Ukraine's Euromaidan, Lenin monuments and other Soviet-era monuments were already being removed. However, in 2008, the 139th anniversary of Lenin, two new Lenin monuments were erected in Luhansk Oblast.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of statues of Stalin\nList of places named after Lenin\nChiang Kai-shek statues\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nTumarkin, Nina.

The city lies on the western bank of the Volga River. Volgograd was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nThe Soviets' Battle of Stalingrad against invading German and its allied forces in World War II was one of the largest and bloodiest battles in the history of warfare. Known locally as the \"Hero City\", Volgograd today is the site of The Motherland Calls, an 85-metre high statue dedicated to the heroes of the battle. The city has many tourist attractions, such as museums, sandy beaches, and a self-propelled floating church. Its population was 1,021,215 at the 2010 Census, growing from 1,011,417 in the 2002 Census.   \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Tsaritsyn ===\nAlthough the city may have originated in 1555, documented evidence of Tsaritsyn at the confluence of the Tsaritsa and Volga rivers dates from 1589. Grigori Zasekin established the fortress Sary Su (the local Tatar-language name means \"yellow water\" or \"yellow river\") as part of the defences of the unstable southern border of the Tsardom of Russia. The structure stood slightly above the mouth of the Tsaritsa River on the right bank. It soon became the nucleus of a trading settlement.\nIn 1607 the fortress garrison rebelled for six months against the troops of Tsar Vasili Shuisky. In 1608 the first stone church was built in the city and was dedicated to St. John the Baptist. At the beginning of the 17th century, the garrison consisted of 350 to 400 people.\nIn 1670 troops of Stepan Razin captured the fortress; they left after a month. In 1708 the insurgent Cossack Kondraty Bulavin (died July 1708) held the fortress. In 1717 in the Kuban pogrom, raiders from the Kuban under the command of the Crimean Tatar Bakhti Gerai blockaded the town and enslaved thousands in the area. In August 1774 Yemelyan Pugachev unsuccessfully attempted to storm the city.\nIn 1691 Moscow established a customs-post at Tsaritsyn. In 1708 Tsaritsyn was assigned to the Kazan Governorate; in 1719 to the Astrakhan Governorate. According to the census in 1720, the city had a population of 408 people. In 1773 the settlement was designated as a provincial and district town. From 1779 it belonged to the Saratov Viceroyalty. In 1780 the city came under the newly established Saratov Governorate.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, Tsaritsyn became an important river-port and commercial centre. The population expanded rapidly, increasing from fewer than 3,000 people in 1807 to about 84,000 in 1900. The first railway reached the town in 1862. The first theatre opened in 1872, the first cinema in 1907. In 1913 Tsaritsyn got its first tram-line, and the city's first electric lights were installed in the city centre.\nDuring the Russian Civil War of 1917\u20131923, Tsaritsyn came under Soviet control from November 1917. In 1918 White Movement troops under Pyotr Krasnov, the Ataman of the Don Cossack Host, besieged Tsaritsyn. The Reds repulsed three assaults by the Whites. However, in June 1919 the White Armed Forces of South Russia, under the command of General Denikin, captured Tsaritsyn, and held it until January 1920. The fighting from July 1918 to January 1920 became known as the Battle for Tsaritsyn.\n\n\n=== Stalingrad ===\nOn April 10, 1925, the city was renamed Stalingrad, in honour of Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the Communist Party. This was officially to recognise the city and Stalin's role in its defence against the Whites between 1918 and 1920. In 1931, the German settlement-colony Old Sarepta (founded in 1765) became a district of Stalingrad. Renamed Krasnoarmeysky Rayon (or \"Red Army District\"), it was the largest area of the city.\nThe first higher education institute was opened in 1930. A year later, the Stalingrad Industrial Pedagogical Institute, now Volgograd State Pedagogical University, was opened.\nUnder Stalin, the city became a centre of heavy industry and transshipment by rail and river. During World War II, German and Axis forces attacked the city, and in 1942 it was the site of one of the pivotal battles of the war. The Battle of Stalingrad had perhaps the greatest casualty figures of any single battle in the history of warfare (estimates are between 1,250,000 and 1,798,619). \n\nThe battle began on August 23, 1942, and on the same day, the city suffered heavy aerial bombardment that reduced most of it to rubble. By September, the fighting reached the city centre. The fighting was of unprecedented intensity; the city's central railway station changed hands thirteen times, and the Mamayev Kurgan (one of the highest points of the city) was captured and recaptured eight times. \nBy early November, the German forces controlled 90 percent of the city and had cornered the Soviets in two narrow pockets, but they were unable to eliminate the last pockets of Soviet resistance before Soviet forces launched a huge counterattack on November 19. This resulted in the Soviet encirclement of the German Sixth Army and other Axis units. On January 31, 1943 the Sixth Army's commander, Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus, surrendered, and by February 2, with the elimination of straggling German troops, the Battle of Stalingrad was over.\nIn 1945 the Soviet Union awarded Stalingrad the title Hero City for its resistance. Great Britain's King George VI awarded the citizens of Stalingrad the jewelled \"Sword of Stalingrad\" in recognition of their bravery. \nA number of cities around the world (especially those that had suffered similar wartime devastation) established sister, friendship, and twinning links (see list below) in the spirit of solidarity or reconciliation. One of the first \"sister city\" projects was that established during World War II between Stalingrad and Coventry in the United Kingdom; both had suffered extensive devastation from aerial bombardment.\n\n\n=== Volgograd ===\n\nOn 10 November 1961, Nikita Khrushchev's administration changed the name of the city to Volgograd (\"Volga City\") as part of his programme of de-Stalinisation following Stalin's death. He was trying to reduce the \"cult of personality\". This action was and remains somewhat controversial, because Stalingrad has such importance as a symbol of resistance during World War II. \nDuring Konstantin Chernenko's brief administration in 1984, proposals were floated to revive the city's historic name for that reason. There is a strong degree of local support for a reversion, but  the Russian government has not accepted such proposals.\nOn May 21, 2007, the Communist Party obtained an important success in the Volgograd mayoral election. Communist candidate Roman Grebennikov was elected as mayor with 32.47% of the vote, a plurality. Grebennikov is Russia's youngest mayor of a federal subject administrative centre.\nIn 2010, Russian monarchists and leaders of the Orthodox organisations demanded that the city should take back its original name of Tsaritsyn, but the authorities rejected their proposal.\nOn January 30, 2013, the Volgograd City Council passed a measure to use the title \"Hero City Stalingrad\" in city statements on nine specific dates annually. On the following dates the title \"Hero City Stalingrad\" can officially be used in celebrations: \n\nFebruary 2 (end of the Battle of Stalingrad),\nFebruary 23 (Defender of the Fatherland Day),\nMay 9 (Victory Day),\nJune 22 (start of Operation Barbarossa),\nAugust 23 (start of the Battle of Stalingrad),\nSeptember 2 (Victory over Japan Day),\nNovember 19 (start of Operation Uranus),\nDecember 9 (Day of the Fatherland's Heroes)In addition, 50,000 people signed a petition to Vladimir Putin, asking that the city's name be permanently changed to Stalingrad. President Putin has replied that such a move should be preceded by a local referendum and that the Russian authorities will look into how to bring about such a referendum.\n\n\n=== Terrorist attacks ===\n\nOn August 24, 2004, the Volga-AviaExpress Flight 1353, a Tupolev Tu-134 aircraft flying from Moscow to Volgograd, exploded in mid-air and crashed as a result of a  suicide terrorist attack. 34 passengers and 9 crew members were on board the aircraft, all of whom died in the crash.  A Siberia Airlines flight bound for Sochi that day was also bombed, killing all 46 who were on board.\nAt approximately 2:00 p.m. on Monday 21 October 2013, Russian intelligence officers reported a bomb carried by a female suicide bomber exploded on a passenger bus carrying forty people, when it was stopped at the Lesobaza bus stop. Irina Gogolyeva, a spokesperson from the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry, reported that at least five people died in the blast and seventeen others were injured. On October 22, 2013, Vladimir Markin from Russia's investigative Committee reported that the suicide bomber had been identified as 30-year-old Naida Asiyalova of Dagestan.On December 29, 2013, a suicide bomb attack occurred at the Volgograd railway station, killing at least seventeen people. It is not clear how many bombers were involved or who they were. The following day a suicide bombing on a trolleybus killed at least fifteen people.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nIn 2011, the City Duma cancelled direct election of the mayor and confirmed the position of City Manager. This was short-lived, as in March 2012, Volgograd residents voted for relevant amendments to the city charter to reinstate the direct mayoral elections.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nVolgograd is the administrative center of Volgograd Oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Volgograd\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Volgograd is incorporated as Volgograd Urban Okrug.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nModern Volgograd remains an important industrial city. Industries include shipbuilding, oil refining, steel and aluminum production, manufacture of machinery and vehicles, and chemical production. The large Volgograd Hydroelectric Plant is a short distance to the north of Volgograd.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nVolgograd is a major railway junction served by the Privolzhskaya Railway. Rail links from the Volgograd railway station include Moscow; Saratov; Astrakhan; the Donbas region of Ukraine; the Caucasus  and Siberia. It stands at the east end of the Volga\u2013Don Canal, opened in 1952 to link the two great rivers of Southern Russia. European route E40, the longest European route connecting Calais in France with Ridder in Kazakhstan, passes through Volgograd. The M6 highway between Moscow and the Caspian Sea also passes through the city.  The Volgograd Bridge, under construction since 1995, was inaugurated in October 2009. The city river terminal is the centre for local passenger shipping along the Volga River.\nThe Volgograd International Airport provides air links to major Russian cities as well as Antalya, Yerevan and Aktau.\nVolgograd's public transport system includes a light rail service known as the Volgograd metrotram.  Local public transport is provided by buses, trolleybuses and trams.\nThe Volga River still is a very important communication channel.\nVolgograd hosts one of the few floating churches in the world: the floating church of Saint Vladimir of Volgograd.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Climate ==\nVolgograd has a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa). The city is only slightly warmer than Minneapolis (both in summer and winter, but transitional seasons are almost identical) at the same time that despite being taxed \"moist\" is drier than most of the climate of group D due to proximity to the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nA memorial complex commemorating the battle of Stalingrad, dominated by an immense allegorical sculpture The Motherland Calls, was erected on the Mamayev Kurgan, the hill that saw some of the most intense fighting during the battle.\nThe Panorama Museum sited on the Volga contains artifacts from World War II. These include a panoramic painting of the battlefield from the location of the monument on Mamayev Kurgan. A rifle of the famous sniper Vasily Zaytsev is also on display. \nThe Musical Instrument Museum is a branch of the Volgograd regional Museum of local lore.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHigher education facilities include:\n\nVolgograd State University\nVolgograd State Technical University (former Volgograd Polytechnical University)\nVolgograd State Agriculture University\nVolgograd State Medical University\nVolgograd State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering\nVolgograd Academy of Industry\nVolgograd Academy of Business Administration\nVolgograd State Pedagogical University\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nVolgograd was a host city to four matches of the FIFA World Cup in 2018. A new modern stadium, Volgograd Arena, was built for this occasion on the bank of the Volga River to serve as the venue. The stadium has a seating capacity for 45,000 people, including a press box, a VIP box and seats for people with limited mobility.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nVolgograd is twinned with:\n\nSeveral communities in France and Italy have streets or avenues named after Stalingrad, hence Place de Stalingrad in Paris and the eponymous Paris M\u00e9tro station of Stalingrad.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u211620/362 \u043e\u0442 29 \u0438\u044e\u043d\u044f 2005 \u0433. \u00ab\u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u00bb, \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u211632/1000 \u043e\u0442 15 \u0438\u044e\u043b\u044f 2015 \u0433. \u00ab\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u00bb. \u0412\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0432 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0443 10 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 2006 \u0433.

The city lies on two banks of the Volga River, close to where it discharges into the Caspian Sea at an altitude of 28 meters (92 ft) below sea level, makes it the lowest city in Russia. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 520,339; up from 504,501 recorded in the 2002 Census and 509,210 recorded in the 1989 Census.The oldest economic and cultural center of the Lower Volga, it is often called the southernmost outpost of Russia and the Caspian capital. The city is a member of the Eurasian Regional Office of the World Organization \"United Cities and Local Governments\" Its population is diverse and includes one hundred ethnicities and fourteen religious denominations.The city is located in the upper part of the Volga delta, on eleven islands of the Caspian Depression. The distance to Moscow by road is 1,411 kilometers (877 mi). The nearest big city is Volgograd.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name is a corruption of Hashtarkhan, itself a corruption of Haji Tarkhan (\u062d\u0627\u062c\u06cc\u200c \u062a\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0646)\u2014a name amply evidenced in the medieval writings. Tarkhan is possibly a Turco-Mongolian title standing for \"great khan,\" or \"king\", while haji or hajji is a title given to one who has made the Islamic requisite of pilgrimage to Mecca. Together, they denoted \"the king who has visited Mecca.\"\nThe city has given its name to the particular pelts from young karakul sheep, and in particular to the hats traditionally made from the pelts.\nColloquially, the city is known by the short form Astra. Another popular nickname is The Caspian Capital.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nAstrakhan is in the Volga Delta, which is rich in sturgeon and exotic plants. The fertile area formerly contained the capitals of Khazaria and the Golden Horde. Astrakhan was first mentioned by travelers in the early 13th century as Xacitarxan. Tamerlane burnt it to the ground in 1395 during his war with the Golden Horde. From 1459 to 1556, Xacitarxan was the capital of Astrakhan Khanate. The ruins of this medieval settlement were found by archaeologists 12 km upstream from the modern-day city.\nStarting in A.D. 1324, Ibn Battuta, the famous Berber Muslim traveler, began his pilgrimage from his native city of Tangier, present-day Morocco to Mecca. Along the 12,100-kilometer (7,500 mi) trek, which took nearly 29 years, Ibn Battuta came in contact with many new cultures which he writes about in his diaries. One specific country that he passed through on his journey was the Golden Horde ruled by the descendants of Genghis Khan, located on the Volga River in southern Russia; which Battuta refers to as the river Athal. He then claims the Athal is, \u201cone of the greatest rivers in the world.\u201d ( Battuta, 79). In the winter, when the weather is very cold, the Muslim ruler, or Sultan, stays in Astrakhan. Due to this cold water, the King [Sultan Mohammed \u00d6z Beg] orders the people of Astrakhan to lay many bundles of hay down on the frozen river. He does this to allow the people to travel over the ice. When Battuta and the King spoke about Battuta visiting Constantinople, which the King granted him permission to do, the King then gifted Battuta with fifteen hundred dinars, many horses and a dress of honor.In 1556, the khanate was conquered by Ivan the Terrible, who had a new fortress, or kremlin, built on a steep hill overlooking the Volga in 1558. This year is traditionally considered to be the foundation of the modern city.In 1569, during the Russo-Turkish War (1568\u20131570), Astrakhan was besieged by the Ottoman army, which had to retreat in disarray. A year later, the Ottoman sultan renounced his claims to Astrakhan, thus opening the entire Volga River to Russian traffic. The Ottoman Empire, though militarily defeated, insisted on safe passage for Muslim pilgrims and traders from Central Asia as well as the destruction of the Russian's fort on the Terek river. In the 17th century, the city was developed as a Russian gate to the Orient. Many merchants from Armenia, Safavid Persia, Mughal India and Khiva khanate settled in the town, giving it a cosmopolitan character.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nFor seventeen months in 1670\u20131671, Astrakhan was held by Stenka Razin and his Cossacks. Early in the following century, Peter the Great constructed a shipyard here and made Astrakhan the base for his hostilities against Persia, and later in the same century Catherine the Great accorded the city important industrial privileges.The city rebelled against the Tsar once again in 1705, when it was held by the Cossacks under Kondraty Bulavin. A Kalmuck khan laid an abortive siege to the kremlin several years before that.\nIn 1711, it became the seat of a governorate, whose first governors included Artemy Petrovich Volynsky and Vasily Nikitich Tatishchev. Six years later, Astrakhan served as a base for the first Russian venture into Central Asia. It was granted town status in 1717. In 1702, 1718 and 1767, it suffered severely from fires; in 1719 it was plundered by the Safavid Persians; and in 1830, cholera killed much of the populace.Astrakhan's kremlin was built from the 1580s to the 1620s from bricks taken from the site of Sarai Berke. Its two impressive cathedrals were consecrated in 1700 and 1710, respectively. Built by masters from Yaroslavl, they retain many traditional features of Russian church architecture, while their exterior decoration is definitely baroque.\nIn March 1919 after a failed workers' revolt against Bolshevik rule, 3,000 to 5,000 people were executed in less than a week by the Cheka under orders from Sergey Kirov. Some victims had stones tied around their necks and were thrown into the Volga.During Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the A-A line running from Astrakhan to Arkhangelsk was to be the eastern limit of German military operation and occupation. The plan was never carried out, as Germany captured neither the two cities nor Moscow. In the autumn of 1942, the region to the west of Astrakhan became one of the easternmost points in the Soviet Union reached by the invading German Wehrmacht, during Case Blue, the offensive which led to the Battle of Stalingrad. Light armored forces of German Army Group A made brief scouting missions as close as 100 km to Astrakhan before withdrawing. In the same period, elements of both the Luftwaffe's KG 4 and KG 100 bomber wings attacked Astrakhan, flying several air raids and bombing the city's oil terminals and harbor installations.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nIn 1943, Astrakhan was made the seat of a Soviet oblast with the RSFSR, which was maintained as a national province of the independent Russian Federation in the 1991 administrative reshuffle after the dismemberment of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the present day, Astrakhan is a large industrial centre of the Volga country, Russia, with a population of 100,000. Starting nearly 400 years ago and continuing to the present day, Astrakhan has been Russia's main center of fish processing. The market for fish is a large component of the economy in this city. \n\n\n==== Mayoral election of 2012 ====\nAfter fraud was alleged in the mayoral election of 2012 and the United Russia candidate was declared the winner, organizers of the 2011\u20132012 Russian protests supported the defeated candidate, Oleg V. Shein of Just Russia, in a hunger strike. Substantial evidence of fraud was cited by the protesters but an official investigation failed to find significant violations. The activists from Moscow found it difficult to gain traction over the issue with local residents who, like most Russians, accept political corruption as a given that is useless to protest. The emissaries from Moscow persisted, buoyed by celebrities who support the reform movement, drawing 5,000 to a rally on April 14.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\nAstrakhan is the administrative center of the oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Astrakhan\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Astrakhan is incorporated as Astrakhan Urban Okrug.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAstrakhan is the archiepiscopal see of one of the metropolitanates and (as Astrakhan and Yenotayevka) eparchies of the Russian Orthodox Church, its only other suffragan being Akhtubinsk. There is also a Catholic community, served by the Church of the Assumption of Mary (Astrakhan). The Muslim Bulgar population is now gone/assimilated.\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the results of the 2010 Census, the population of Astrakhan was 520,339.At the time of the official 2010 Census, the ethnic makeup of the city's population was:\nRussian: 339,853 (77.93%)\nTatar: 30,432 (6.98%)\nKazakh: 23,783 (5.45%)\nAzerbaijani: 5,737 (1.31%)\nArmenian: 4,195 (0.96%)\nUkrainian: 4,141 (0.95%)\nNogai: 3,777 (0.87%)\nAvar: 3,693 (0.85%)\nLezgin: 3,255 (0.75%)\nRomani: 2,141 (0.49%)\nOther: 11,080 (2.54%)\nThe nationality was not specified: 84,264\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAstrakhan features a temperate continental \"Aralian\" semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BSk) with cold winters and hot summers. Astrakhan is one of the driest cities in Europe. Rainfall is scarce but relatively evenly distributed throughout the course of the year with, however, more precipitation (58%) in the hot season (six hottest months of the year), which determines the \"Aralian\" type (as opposed to the \"Turkmenon\" type, with the wet season during the cold months).\nIt is this even distribution of rainfall and the relatively low annual temperature that causes the city to fall under this climate category as opposed to an arid climate.\nWinters tend to be cold in the city, though by Russian standards, Astrakhan features relatively balmy winters. Summers in the city can be hot, with high temperatures in excess of +40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The mean annual temperature amplitude (difference between the mean monthly temperatures of the hottest and coldest months) is thus equal to 29.2 \u00b0C (52.6 \u00b0F) (+25.6 \u00b0C (78.1 \u00b0F) in July and \u22123.6 \u00b0C (25.5 \u00b0F) in January), so the climate is truly continental (amplitudes superior or equal to 21 \u00b0C (38 \u00b0F) determines continental climates, while in semi-continental climates amplitudes vary between 18 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and 21 \u00b0C (38 \u00b0F)). Spring and fall are basically transitional seasons between summer and winter. The summers are much hotter than found further west on similar parallels in Europe and worldwide for the 46th parallel with the notable exception of the interior Pacific Northwest of the United States.\n\n\n== Education ==\nAstrakhan has five institutions of higher education. Most prominent among these are Astrakhan State Technical University and Astrakhan State University.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe city is served by Narimanovo Airport named after Soviet Azerbaijani politician Nariman Narimanov. It is managed by OAO Aeroport Astrakhan. After its reconstruction and the building of the international sector, opened in February 2011, Narimanovo Airport is one of the most modern regional airports in Russia. There are direct flights between Astrakhan and Aktau, Istanbul, St. Petersburg and Moscow.\nAstrakhan is linked by rail to the north (Volgograd and Moscow), the east (Atyrau and Kazakhstan) and the south (Makhachkala and Baku). There are direct trains to Moscow, Volgograd, Saint Petersburg, Baku, Kiev, Brest and other towns. Intercity and international buses are available as well. Public local transport is mainly provided by buses and minibuses called marshrutkas. Until 2005 there were also trams, and until 2017 trolleybuses.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Symbol of \"Azerbaijani-Russian Friendship\" ==\nDue to shared Caspian borders, Astrakhan recently has been playing a significant role in the relations of both countries. As the Azerbaijani government has been heavily investing into the wellbeing of the city, Astrakhan has recently begun to symbolize the friendship between both countries. In 2010 a bridge was constructed with donations from Azerbaijan, which was named \"Bridge of Friendship\". Moreover, Azerbaijani government sponsored secondary school number 11, which carries the name of the national leader Heydar Aliyev, as well as a children's entertainment center named \"Dream\". Apart from that, a park has been built in the center of Astrakhan which is dedicated to friendship between the two countries. In the last 5 years Astrakhan has been visited by top Azerbaijani delegations on several occasions.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nBoris Kustodiev, painter\nJoseph Deniker, naturalist and

Director of the Taganka Theater (since March 2015).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nApeksimova was the child of classical musicians, Victor Nikolaevich Apeksimov and Svetlana Yakivna Apeksimova (passed away in August 2015). Irina was the second child in the family; her older brother Valery later became a jazz composer and pianist in the United States.\nBecause her parents worked in the theater and music (her father taught at a music school and later taught piano at a conservatory, and her mother was choirmaster at the municipal Theater of Musical Comedy and later a choir conductor at a conservatory), Apeksimova was surrounded by talented and creative people. She often stayed backstage at the musical theater, where the child actors did their homework and played.\nApeksimova's parents divorced when she was in the eighth grade, and she moved with her mother to Odessa, where she studied acting. After high school Apeksimova went to Moscow to enter the Moscow Art Theater School, but was rejected because of her Odessa accent. Back in Odessa, she joined the Odessa Opera Theater and danced for a year in the corps de ballet. She then applied again to the Moscow Art Theater School but was again rejected. After this setback, Irina returned to Volgograd and joined the Theater of Musical Comedy, in the corps de ballet.\nAfter living in Volgograd for a year, Apeksimova had shed much of her Odessa accent, and applied for a third time to the Moscow Art Theater School. She was accepted and admitted in 1986 into Oleg Tabakov's class. At the school, Apeksimova became friends with fellow student Valery Nikolaev, and later married him. Her class, which also included Vladimir Mashkov and Yevgeny Mironov, was considered especially brilliant.\nApeksimova was graduated in 1990 and joined the studio at the Moscow Art Theatre, where she stayed until 2000. In 1994, she won the Best Actress Award at the Paris Film Festival for her role in the film October (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c).\nApeksimova is divorced and has a daughter, Dasha.\n\n\n== Credits ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical roles ===\nSkylark (\u0416\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043a).

        "wiki": "The Volgograd Metrotram (Skorostnoy Tramvay, ST) is a light rail system operating in Volgograd, Russia. It consists of 22 stations on one line, paralleling the Volga River from the northern suburbs of Volgograd to its city core for a total length of 17.3 kilometres (10.7 mi). The Volgograd Metrotram was inaugurated on 5 November 1984, and had served 50 million passengers per year at the time the 2011 extension was opened.\nMost of the Metrotram line shares a surface-level right of way with a previously constructed railway line for 10.2 kilometres (6.3 mi), in a manner similar to that of the south leg of the C-Train system in Calgary, for example. Five city center stations, on the other hand, were built underground in two sections (opened in 1984 and 2011), over a total length of 6.8 kilometres (4.2 mi), meeting design standards consistent with existing Russian metro systems.\n\n\n== Traffic ==\nThe Volgograd metrotram normally use right-hand running, with left-hand traffic on the underground section between TRK Europa City Mall and Pionerskaya. This was done to enable unidirectional vehicles to use island platforms. However, on the new underground section between Pionerskaya and Yel'shanka operate exclusively bidirectional vehicles, with right-handed traffic and doors on the both sides.\n\n\n== Stations ==\nList of stations north to south:\n\nTraktornyy Zavod (Tractor Factory)\nKhlebozavod (Bakery Works)\nVodootstoy (Water-sediment)\nBol\u2019nitsa Il\u2019icha (Ilich Hospital)\nZavod \"Barrikady\" (Barrikady Factory)\nChetyrnadcataya Gimnaziya (Gymnasium \u211614)\nStadion Monolit (Monolith Stadium)\nZavod \"Krasnyy Oktyabr\u2019\" (Red October Steel Factory)\nTridtsat' Devyataya Gvardeyskaya (39th Guards Rifle Division Street)\nPloshchad\u2019 Vozrozhdeniya (Revival Square)\nDvorets Sporta (Sports Palace)\nMamayev Kurgan (Mamayev Kurgan)\nTsentral\u2019nyy Stadion (Central Stadium)\nTsentral\u2019nyy Park Kul\u2019tury i Otdykha (Central Rest and Culture Park)\nYevropa (Europa City Mall)\nPloshchad\u2019 Lenina (Lenin Square)\nKomsomol\u2019skaya (Komsomol street)\nPionerskaya (Pioneers)\nPloshchad\u2019 Chekistov (Chekists Square)\nProfsoyuznaya (Labour Unions)\nTeatr Yunogo Zritelya (Theatre for Young Spectators)\nYel\u2019shankaPlanned stations:\n\nNovosibirskaya\nAgrarnyj Universitet (Agricultural University)\nTormosilovskaya\nPanfilovskaya\nKuporosnaya balka (Vitriol beams)\nGosuniversitet (State University)\n\n\n== External links ==\nVolgograd at UrbanRail.net\nVolgograd metrotram 3D \u2013 interactive Web3D model of metrotram\nVolgograd Rapid Tram Underground \u2013 photos of the metrotram (with texts in Russian)\nUnofficial site \u2013 site in Russian\nVolgograd Metrotram Track Map \u2013 site in Russian\nProfsoyuznaya (Labour Unions) station on YouTube video\nTeatr Yunogo Zritelya (Theatre for Young Spectators) station on YouTube video",

        "wiki": "The Illegals Program (so named by the United States Department of Justice) was a network of Russian sleeper agents under non-official cover. An investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) culminated in the arrest of ten agents on June 27, 2010, and a prisoner exchange between Russia and the United States on July 9, 2010.Canada was a common place for Soviet, and later Russian, illegal immigrants to go so they could create a \"legend\" of being Western citizens before their deployment to target countries, often the United States or the United Kingdom. The spies were planted in the U.S. by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (known by its Russian abbreviation, SVR). Posing as ordinary American citizens, they tried to build contacts with academics, industrialists, and policymakers to gain access to intelligence. They were the target of a multi-year investigation by the FBI. The investigation, called Operation Ghost Stories, culminated at the end of June 2010 with the arrest of ten people in the U.S. and an eleventh in Cyprus. The ten sleeper agents were charged with \"carrying out long-term, 'deep-cover' assignments in the United States on behalf of the Russian Federation.\"The suspect arrested in Cyprus skipped bail the day after his arrest. A twelfth person, a Russian national who worked for Microsoft, was also apprehended about the same time and deported on July 13, 2010. Moscow court documents made public on June 27, 2011, revealed that another two Russian agents managed to flee the U.S. without being arrested.Ten of the agents were flown to Vienna on July 9, 2010, soon after pleading guilty to charges of failing to register as representatives of a foreign government. The same day, the agents were exchanged for four Russian nationals, three of whom had been convicted and imprisoned by Russia on espionage (high treason) charges.On October 31, 2011, the FBI publicly released several dozen still images, clips from surveillance video, and documents related to its investigation in response to Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\n\n== FBI arrests and criminal charges ==\nUsing forged documents, some of the spies assumed stolen identities of Americans, enrolled at American universities and joined professional organizations as a means of further infiltrating spies into government circles. Two of the individuals used the names of Richard and Cynthia Murphy and resided in Hoboken, New Jersey, in the mid-1990s, before purchasing a nearby home in suburban Montclair. Another couple named in court documents were journalist Vicky Pel\u00e1ez and Mikhail Vasenkov (using the alias Juan Lazaro) in Yonkers, New York. The court filings allege that couples were arranged in Russia to \"co-habit in the country to which they are assigned,\" going as far as having children together to help maintain their deep covert status.The criminal complaints later filed in various federal district courts allege that the Russian agents in the U.S. passed information back to the SVR by messages hidden inside digital photographs, written in disappearing ink, ad hoc wireless networks, and shortwave radio transmissions, as well as by agents swapping identical bags while passing each other in the stairwell of a train station. Messages and materials were passed in such places as Grand Central Terminal and Central Park.The Russian agents were tasked by \"Moscow centre\" to report about U.S. policy in Central America, U.S. interpretation of Russian foreign policy, problems with US military policy, and \"United States policy with regard to the use of the Internet by terrorists.\"According to the media reports, planning by the FBI to have the \"illegals\" arrested began in mid-June 2010, but the action was hastened reportedly by some members of the group intending to travel outside the US as well as by Anna Chapman's growing concern about having been exposed. Vladimir Guriyev was planning to travel to France and possibly Russia, Bezrukov was planning to travel outside the US with his son, and Chapman, in a telephone call to her father the day before the arrest, said she suspected that she may have been discovered and planned to leave for Moscow in mid-July 2010.U.S. authorities arrested ten of the agents involved on June 27, 2010, in a series of raids in Boston, Montclair (New Jersey), Yonkers, and Northern Virginia. They charged the individuals with money laundering and failing to register as agents of a foreign government. No charges were made that the individuals involved gained access to classified material, though contacts were made with a former intelligence official and with a scientist involved in developing bunker buster bombs.One of the suspects using the name of Christopher R. Metsos was detained on June 29, 2010, while attempting to depart from Cyprus for Budapest, but was released on bail and then disappeared.There was no evidence that the convicted agents knew each other beyond their respective spouses; military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer believed that they consequently did not constitute a \"spy ring\".Shortly after the arrests, The Guardian commented: \"The FBI operation represents the biggest penetration of SVR communications in recent memory. The FBI read their emails, decrypted their intel, read the embedded coded texts on images posted on the net, bugged their mobile phones, videotaped the passing of bags of cash and messages in invisible ink from one agent to another, and hacked into their bogus expenses claims. [...] The tradecraft used by the alleged SVR ring was amateurish, and will send shivers down the spine of the rival intelligence organisations in Russia. This was bungling on a truly epic scale. No secrets about bunker-busting bombs were actually obtained, but the network was betrayed. [...] To have a spy ring uncovered before they could actually do any serious spying is doubly embarrassing.\"Coinciding with the day of the prisoners' swap, the death of the prominent Russian defector Sergei Tretyakov, who died in the US on June 13, 2010, was reported on July 9, 2010. A Florida medical examiner's report, released on September 20, 2010, cited an accident and a tumour as the cause of death. In response to allegations in the media that he might have tipped off the US authorities about some of the \"illegals\", Tretyakov's co-author Pete Earley, citing anonymous \"well-informed\" sources, said in July 2010 that Tretyakov had not been privy to the case of Russian \"illegals\".The November 11, 2010, issue of Kommersant, Russia's broadsheet, carried an article that, with reference to unnamed Russian government sources, contained allegations that the \"illegals\" were fingered by a senior SVR officer named \"Colonel Shcherbakov\" (according to an unnamed ex-CIA source, his full name may be \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0429\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432, Alexander Vasilievich Shcherbakov). The latter, according to the newspaper's sources, headed the \"American\" unit of the SVR department in charge of \"illegals\" and left Russia for the U.S. \"three days prior to Dmitry Medvedev's June visit to the U.S.\" According to other media outlets' sources, the name \"Shcherbakov\" was fictitious, and a number of experts and commentators judged many allegations in the article to be dubious or improbable. Nevertheless, some comments made the following day by Russian president Medvedev were interpreted as an indirect confirmation of a high-level defection in the Russian intelligence apparatus. On November 15, 2010, Interfax cited unnamed sources within Russian intelligence as alleging that the real name of the defector who was primarily responsible for uncovering the ten convicted agents was Aleksandr Poteyev (reportedly, his full name is \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432, Aleksandr Nikolayevich Poteyev), who was a colonel in the SVR and was deputy head of the American department within Directorate \"S\" of SVR (\"S\" oversees illegals). According to Interfax's unnamed source, a person called Shcherbakov had indeed held a senior position in the SVR and \"defected about two years ago.\"\n\n\n== Agents apprehended by FBI on June 27, 2010 ==\n\n\n=== Anna Chapman ===\n\nAnna Chapman\u2014maiden name Anna Vasil'evna Kushchenko (Russian: \u0410\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e)\u2014was arrested with nine others in 2010. According to U.S. authorities, her former name is Anya Kushchenko, and she is a Volgograd native. (According to some reports, she was born in Ukraine.) Her father was employed in the Russian embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. She received her master's in economics degree from the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia in Moscow. She later worked in London at NetJets, Barclays Bank, and allegedly at a few other companies for brief periods.\nIn 2001, at an underground rave party in London's Docklands, she met Alex Chapman, the son of a British business executive, whom she married shortly thereafter in Moscow. They divorced in 2006.On July 5, 2010, One India reported that Chapman may have been recruited to become an agent when she was in the United Kingdom, citing Oleg Gordievsky and Alex Chapman as sources, and that an urgent probe was underway in the UK to ascertain whether Chapman organized sleeper cells in the United Kingdom.Her LinkedIn social networking site profile identified herself as CEO of PropertyFinder Ltd, a website selling real estate internationally. Chapman posted photos of herself on the Odnoklassniki (\"Classmates\") social networking website in Russia where she stated \"Russia, Moscow. My favorite place on earth, my native capital!\" She also posted photos and profiles on the Facebook and LinkedIn social networking websites.Chapman's prior meetings with her Russian handlers were on Wednesdays, not face to face, solely to pass information via encrypted private computer networks at Barnes & Noble or at Starbucks. Thus her suspicion was aroused when an FBI informant, posing as a Russian consular officer named \"Roman\", on Saturday, June 26 asked her to come to New York from Connecticut, where she was spending the weekend. Her suspicions increased when \"Roman\" turned out to be a man she didn't know who asked her to deliver a fake United States passport to another sleeper agent in a face-to-face meeting. The task of transferring a fake US passport to another Russian agent in a face-to-face meeting was beyond anything that the Moscow Center had previously assigned to her.\nAfter the meeting with \"Roman,\" Chapman bought a new cell phone and two telephone cards. She called her father in Moscow and another individual in New York, both advising her not to transfer the passport. The FBI monitored the calls.Chapman turned in the passport to the 1st Precinct police station in New York but was questioned by the FBI and arrested.According to her American lawyer, Robert Baum, while in the US jail, she feared she would be deported. When her deportation became imminent, she said she would go to live in London on her UK passport, but it was subsequently revoked. After her deportation to Russia, in July 2010, Robert Baum reiterated that his client wished to stay in the U.S. He also said that she was \"particularly upset\" by the revocation of her UK citizenship and exclusion from the country.On August 8, 2010, the United Kingdom's tabloid Sunday Express cited an unidentified \"source close to MI6\" as saying, \"There was a deal on the table just before she caught her connecting flight to Moscow. The secret service intercepted her on her flight back from America to Vienna, where her plane landed to refuel. MI6 were keen to know about other \u2018illegals\u2019\u2014Russian spy cells\u2014hiding in the United Kingdom, so they made her an offer. In return they offered to give her back British citizenship and allow her to settle in London. Anna was having none of it though and told them in no uncertain terms that she wished to return to Russia.\"In September, German magazine Der Spiegel reported that Chapman said the SVR had forbidden her from saying anything about her activities in the US.\n\n\n=== Mikhail Anatolyevich Vasenkov (Juan Lazaro) and Vicky Pel\u00e1ez ===\n\nVicky Pel\u00e1ez, a Peruvian national and US citizen, and Mikhail Anatolyevich Vasenkov (Russian: \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432, alias Juan Lazaro), a Russian citizen, were arrested at their home in Yonkers, New York. Both admitted being Russian agents. The couple have a son together, and Pel\u00e1ez also has a son from a previous marriage.According to a report by The Wall Street Journal in early August 2010, the real Juan Lazaro died of respiratory failure in 1947 in Uruguay at age 3, with Vasenkov having presumably used the dead toddler's birth certificate to build a persona. According to a file kept by the Peruvian Interior Ministry that The Wall Street Journal cited, Vasenkov flew on March 13, 1976, from Madrid to Lima on a Uruguayan passport in the name of Juan Jose Lazaro Fuentes. He bore a letter on a Spanish tobacco company's stationery that said they had hired him for a market survey in Peru. Two years later, he submitted copies of the passport and a 1943 Uruguayan birth certificate with a letter asking Peru's military dictator Francisco Morales Berm\u00fadez (the country was then run by a US-friendly junta) for Peruvian citizenship, which Peru granted in 1979.In 1983, \"Juan Lazaro\" married Vicky Pel\u00e1ez. Pel\u00e1ez was a television reporter in Peru, and a columnist at El Diario La Prensa in New York City. In her writings, Pel\u00e1ez often criticized US policy in Latin America, and supported \"liberation\" movements in those countries. In 1985, Pel\u00e1ez and \"Lazaro\" moved to New York with her son from a previous relationship.\"Juan Lazaro\" wrote a 1990 article for a European publication that spoke \"glowingly\" of the Shining Path guerrilla movement. He was described as a \"journalist and anthropologist\" in the 1998 book Women and Revolution: Global Expression, for which he was a contributing author. Vasenkov studied at the New School for Social Research and taught a class on Latin American and Caribbean Politics at Baruch College for one semester during the 2008-2009 school year as an adjunct professor. According to The New York Times June 29, 2010, report, Vasenkov was a vocal opponent of American foreign policy in class: \"He maintained that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were a money-making ploy for corporate America. He praised President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela and disparaged President \u00c1lvaro Uribe of Colombia as a pawn for paramilitary groups that have broad control over drug trafficking.\" At least one student complained about Vasenkov's teaching and he was let go at the end of the semester. The department chairman reported that Vasenkov's instruction was not up to standard resulting in his teaching for only one semester but that he recalled no controversy over any anti-American views.US officials reported that on June 27, 2010, Vasenkov confessed to being a spy and that \"Juan Lazaro\" was not his real name, though he declined to give his true identity. He additionally stated he was not born in Uruguay, and that Pel\u00e1ez delivered letters to Russian authorities on his behalf. It was later reported that Lazaro's real name is Mikhail Vasenkov. In November 2010, Russian Kommersant published Russian anonymous sources' allegations that while in US custody, Vasenkov had three ribs and a leg broken by investigators trying to extract more information from him \u2013 a claim assessed by experts as highly improbable. The Kommersant article also cited unnamed RF government sources as saying that Vasenkov was presented with the SVR personal file on him obtained through a senior SVR defector (\"Colonel Shcherbakov\"), whereafter he was forced to own up to his real name.\nOn August 7, 2010, The Wall Street Journal cited Vasenkov's American lawyer, Genesis Peduto, as saying that his client indicated to him on the phone that he wanted to leave Moscow for Peru: \"He doesn't want to stay in Russia. He says he's Juan Lazaro and he's not from Russia and doesn't speak Russian. He wants to be where his wife is going, to her native country, where it will be easier for Juan Jr. to visit. His family comes first.\"\n\n\n=== Andrey Bezrukov and Yelena Vavilova (Donald Heathfield and Tracey Lee Ann Foley) ===\n\nAndrey Bezrukov (Russian: \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0411\u0435\u0437\u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432, alias Donald Howard Heathfield) and Yelena Vavilova (Russian: \u0415\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430, alias Tracey Lee Ann Foley) admitted being both Russian citizens and Russian agents. The agents have two sons, Alexander and Timothy, who were, at the time of their parents' arrest, aged 16 and 20. The sons are adamant that they had no inkling of their parents' real identities; unnamed US officials say, without providing evidence, that the parents had revealed their true identities to the elder son long before the arrest.Bezrukov and his cover wife Yelena Vavilova had a home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Heathfield earned an M.P.A. degree from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he was described as a \"joiner\". Heathfield claimed to have been the son of a Canadian diplomat and to have studied at a school in the Czech Republic. A fellow graduate of the Kennedy School noted that Heathfield kept careful track of his nearly 200 classmates, who included President of Mexico Felipe Calder\u00f3n. On July 16, 2010, after his arrest and deportation, Harvard revoked Heathfield's degree on grounds of his misrepresentation of his identity on his application.Bezrukov was a professional member of the World Future Society, described by the Boston Herald as \"a think tank on future technologies that holds conferences featuring top government scientists\". Former Al Gore National Security Advisor Leon Fuerth spoke at the World Future Society 2008 conference in Washington, D.C., along with George Washington University professor William Halal. In a July 2, 2010, Wall Street Journal article, Fuerth is quoted acknowledging he met Heathfield after a speech he gave. In the same article, Halal described his relationship to Heathfield as benign; \"I would bump into him at meetings of Federal agencies, think tanks, and the World Future Society. I have no information that's of any security value ... Everything I gave Don was published widely and readily available on the Internet\". Bezrukov was chief executive of Future Map, a consulting company involved in government and corporate preparedness systems.Bezrukov's cover wife, Yelena Vavilova, worked for Redfin, a real estate firm in Somerville, Massachusetts. She claimed she was from Canada, but also traveled on a British passport.In July 2012, referring to \"current and former U.S. officials,\" The Wall Street Journal reported that the couple had groomed their son, Tim Foley, for a future spy career. He was 20 when his parents were arrested, and had just finished his sophomore year at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. He and his younger brother traveled to Russia in July 2010 to meet their parents after their deportations. Both were unable to return to the US. The sons, while born in Canada and considering themselves Canadian, and not feeling at home in Moscow, were unable to regain their Canadian citizenship, have been denied visas for Canada, France, and the United Kingdom, and consequently been unable to take up university places they were offered. By 2018, both sons won court cases in the Federal Court of Appeal to affirm their Canadian citizenship; the ruling was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada on December 19, 2019. In March 2018, Alexander (going by his mother's surname Vavilov) received a Canadian passport and moved back to Canada, while awaiting the Supreme Court verdict.The FBI lead agent against the spy couple was Peter Strzok.\n\n\n=== Vladimir and Lidiya Guryev (Richard and Cynthia Murphy) ===\n\nVladimir Guryev (Russian: \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0413\u0443\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432, alias Richard Murphy) and Lidiya Guriyeva (Russian: \u041b\u0438\u0434\u0438\u044f \u0413\u0443\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0430, alias Cynthia Murphy) were Russian agents in New Jersey.Lidiya Guriyeva attended school in the United States, receiving two undergraduate degrees from New York University and an MBA from Columbia Business School. In 2009, Cynthia Murphy developed contacts in New York City financial circles as a means to obtain details about the global gold market. Lidiya was trying to cultivate a relationship with Alan Patricof, a venture capitalist who co-chaired Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid, with her handlers telling her to \"try to build up relations little by little.\" Lidiya Guriyeva was Vice President of Morea Financial Services in New York.Vladimir Guryev supplied money and equipment to Kutsik (see below) in a 2004 meeting in Columbus Circle, New York and 2009, where $150,000 and a flash drive were given. When the computer program was inoperative, Guryev supplied Kutsik with a laptop computer that Guryev brought from Moscow.Vladimir and Lidiya Guriyeva were arrested at their home at 31 Marquette Road in Montclair, New Jersey. The couple have two young daughters, aged 11 and 9 at the time of their parents' arrest. Vladimir Guriyev used a false birth certificate that claimed he was born in Philadelphia, while his wife said that she was born in New York City as \"Cynthia A. Hopkins.\" The two earlier lived in an apartment in Hoboken after arriving in the United States in the mid-1990s. They then purchased a suburban Montclair home for $481,000 in 2008. When they purchased it, the couple argued with their handlers as to who would officially own the house, with the ultimate decision being that it would be owned by \"Moscow Center.\"Professor Nina Khrushcheva, who served as Vladimir's faculty adviser at The New School for three years starting in 2002, said in July 2010 that she found it difficult to figure out the purported Philadelphia native: \"I was always puzzled by the inconsistency between a completely American name and completely Russian behaviour. [...] He had a thick Russian accent and an incredibly unhappy Russian personality.\"Vladimir Guryev was criticized by his wife for his poor information gathering; she suggested that he pursue individuals with connections to the White House. The couple was also tasked with obtaining information about US policy in Afghanistan, the nuclear program of Iran, and the latest Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty talks. Shortly after the couple's arrest, one of their neighbors quipped: \"They couldn't be spies. Look what she did with the hydrangeas.\"\n\n\n=== Mikhail Kutsik and Nataliya Pereverzeva (Michael Zottoli and Patricia Mills) ===\n\nMikhail Kutsik (Russian: \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u041a\u0443\u0446\u0438\u043a; cover name Michael Zottoli) and Natalya Pereverzeva (Russian: \u041d\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u044f \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0437\u0435\u0432\u0430; cover name Patricia Mills) were agents in Seattle, Washington, and, later, Arlington, Virginia. They appear to be in their 40s. Kutsik came to the US in 2001, and Pereverzeva came in 2003, according to the FBI. He claimed to be American but had a thick accent and she claimed to be Canadian but neighbors said she sounded Yugoslavian. They lived in the Seattle, Washington, area for about two years and both attended the University of Washington, Bothell, where they earned bachelor's degrees in business. Zottoli worked for several different jobs over the years including telecom company accountant, car salesman, and teleconference firm employee. Pereverzeva was a stay-at-home mom who cared for their toddler son named Kenny; a second son was born in late 2009. After Kutsik lost his job in 2009, they moved with their children to Arlington, Virginia, later that year. After their parents were arrested, arrangements were made to send the children to Russia.Kutsik and Pereverzeva pleaded guilty to \"conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of a foreign country.\" They appeared to be an ordinary married couple with two young children. However, US authorities allege that they had both been spying for Russia in the US since at least 2004. They received specially coded radio transmissions at their high-rise Seattle apartment, and the FBI secretly entered their home, where they found random numbers used to decode the \"radiograms\". Kutsik received money from Guriyev (Murphy) in Columbus Circle, New York in 2004 while Pereverzeva stood as lookout. In 2006, the FBI photographed them visiting the area of Wurtsboro, New York, where they dug up a bundle of cash in a field that Metsos placed there two years earlier. Kutsik visited New York again in 2009, where he evidently received $150,000 in cash and a flash drive from Murphy. Kutsik communicated with the SVR using a laptop that Guryev brought from Moscow after the computer program supplied to him did not function.Kutsik and Pereverzeva were arrested on June 27, 2010, at their Arlington, Virginia, home. Both had family living in Russia and prosecutors argued that bail be denied under the circumstances.On January 13, 2011, Russia's oil pipeline monopoly, Transneft, confirmed that Natalya Pereverzeva was appointed an adviser for foreign economic relations to the company's president, Nikolai Tokarev.\n\n\n=== Mikhail Semenko ===\n\nMikhail Semenko (Russian: \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e) was one of the two agents who \"operated under their true names.\" He is reported to have studied for one year at the Harbin Institute of Technology. He also attended school and received graduate degrees in the United States at Seton Hall University, one of the degrees being from the Whitehead School of Diplomacy. He is fluent in English, Mandarin, Russian, and Spanish. He later worked for the Conference Board in New York City in 2009, and for 2009\u20132010 reportedly worked at Travel All Russia, an Arlington, Virginia, travel agency, helping Chinese and Hispanic travelers plan trips. He appeared to be in his late 20s; his neighbors said that he was a stylish man who drove a Mercedes S500 car and spoke Russian to his girlfriend.Semenko was first noted by the FBI on June 5 when he used a computer in a restaurant to send encrypted messages, presumably to a car parked in the restaurant lot that had Russian diplomatic plates and was driven by a Russian official who was known to have transferred money to other Russian sleeper agents in 2004.On or about June 26, 2010, Semenko met with an undercover FBI agent purporting to be a Russian agent and accepted $5,000, which he delivered to a drop site in an Arlington, Virginia park. The drop was made at 11:06 am and Semenko was arrested at his residence in Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, DC, later that day.\n\n\n== Other presumed agents of the Illegals Program ==\n\n\n=== \"Christopher Metsos\" (Pavel Kapustin) ===\nThe man known by the name of \"Christopher Metsos\" was alleged to be the money man and main go-between behind the Illegals Program and the SVR. The real name of Metsos, who assumed the identity of a deceased boy, is unknown. On June 29, 2010, acting on an Interpol notice, police arrested the 55-year-old man at the Larnaca International Airport in Cyprus as he was about to board a jet for Budapest. He was released after posting \u20ac27,000 (equivalent to US$33,777) bail and told to report to a police station thereafter but skipped out and apparently fled the country.\nAccording to the information from US authorities shortly after his flight, \"Metsos,\" who traveled on a Canadian passport and claimed to be Canadian, regularly traveled to the US to deliver money to his fellow Russian spies; he would typically drop off money at New York City area locations including a coffee shop, restaurant and subway station. According to his Cypriot lawyer, \"Metsos\" had no discernible Russian accent and described himself as a Canadian resident who divorced 15 years prior and had a son living in Paris.On July 26, 2010, it was reported by the media that Passport Canada, upon conducting a review, revoked the travel document issued to Christopher Metsos.Late in July 2010, Russian political commentator Yulia Latynina voiced a theory that \"Christopher Metsos\" might have been a double agent and was probably now in the US; she did not cite any sources.In the court verdict read in Moscow on June 27, 2011, it was claimed that the real name of the man who posed as \"Christopher Metsos\" was Pavel Kapustin (\u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b \u041a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d), a Russian espionage professional, who was exfiltrated upon being released on bail in Cyprus.\n\n\n=== Alexey Karetnikov ===\nOn July 13, 2010, the US government disclosed that a 12th, previously undisclosed, person was being held in custody and was said by the media to be implicated in the same federal probe. Later that day, the person was identified as Alexey Karetnikov, a 23-year-old former entry-level software tester at Microsoft, who was apprehended on June 28, 2010, in Seattle. He was charged with immigration violations and consented to deportation in lieu of further court proceedings; he was sent to Russia on July 13, 2010. Law enforcement officials said on the day of his deportation that Karetnikov had no direct ties to the other deported persons, although his name came up in the broader investigation.On July 22, 2010, Newsweek published the comments of Karetnikov's fellow dormitory resident, who said that Karetnikov impressed him as \"very oily\" and \"very Russian\"; according to the anonymous source, Karetnikov spoke surprisingly poor English but was \"sophisticated\" and knew a lot about Microsoft.\n\n\n== Communication techniques ==\nThe Russian agents used private Wi-Fi networks, flash memory sticks and text messages concealed in graphical images to exchange information. Custom steganographic software developed in Moscow was used where concealed messages were inserted into otherwise innocuous files. This program was initiated by using the Control-Alt-E keys and entering a 27-character password, which the FBI found written down. Coded bursts of data sent by a shortwave radio transmitter were also used. Other methods included employing invisible ink and exchanging identical bags in public places.Chapman used her laptop at a New York coffee shop on 47th Street in January 2010 and electronically transferred data to a Russian official driving by. Two months later, Chapman used a private Wi-Fi network, possibly at a Barnes & Noble store on Greenwich Street in New York, to communicate with the same Russian official, who was nearby. Chapman used a range extender for her laptop.\n\n\n== Court proceedings ==\nOn June 27, 2010, FBI Special Agent Amit Kachhia-Patel submitted a sealed complaint alleging a violation of Title 18, United States Code, section 951 (conspiracy to act as unregistered agents of a foreign government). An arrest warrant was issued for Anna Chapman and Mikhail Semenko by Magistrate Judge Ronald L. Ellis.As of July 6, 2010, The New York Times reported that federal and local prosecutors were seeking a rapid conclusion to the case, to avoid a trial that might disclose sensitive information about information-gathering techniques. The proposed deal would have the defendants deported to Russia after pleading guilty to lesser charges.On the morning of July 7, Reuters Moscow correspondent Guy Faulconbridge broke the news of the spy swap. He reported that Igor Sutyagin\u2014jailed in 2004 for passing secrets to a British company that Russian prosecutors said was a front for the CIA\u2014was to be swapped as part of a deal with the United States to bring home the Russian agents.In a hearing held in federal court in Manhattan on July 8, 2010 before Judge Kimba Wood, all ten defendants pleaded guilty to a single charge each of secretly conspiring to act as agents of the Russian government. While the charge could carry up to five years in prison, The Washington Post described the pleas as a first step in what could be the largest prisoner swap between the United States and Russia since the days of the Cold War. Under the plea agreements, the defendants also disclosed their true identities and all except for Vicky Pel\u00e1ez admitted that they were Russian citizens.\nOn July 9, 2010, Attorney General Eric Holder said none of the ten defendants passed classified information and therefore none were charged with espionage.All the defendants were sentenced to time already served. According to the New York Times, political leaders of the two nations made the deal even before the indictment\u2014with U.S. prosecutors and the defendants' lawyers playing a minimal role.\n\n\n== Prisoner exchange ==\nReuters reported on July 7\u20138, 2010 that the U.S. and Russia reached a deal under which the ten individuals arrested in that country as part of the Illegals Program would be deported to Russia in exchange for individuals who were convicted of espionage by Russia. Igor Sutyagin, Alexander Zaporozhsky, Sergei Skripal and Gennadiy Vasilenko were included in the exchange. All four served a considerable time in Russian prisons; at least three of the jailed individuals in Russia were convicted of spying for either the United Kingdom or the U.S.\nWhite House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel reportedly said on July 8 that President Barack Obama approved the swap deal. An administration official was quoted as saying that Obama had not spoken to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev about the spy swap but was \"fully briefed and engaged in the matter.\" Broad agreement in the US was reported to exist that the agents were being deported swiftly as neither government wanted the case to damage attempts to reset their relationship.Shortly before the swap deal was reached, nuclear specialist Igor Sutyagin, one of the Russian prisoners included in the deal, was moved to a Moscow prison from a facility near the Arctic Circle and then flown to Vienna as part of the exchange.Under a U.S.\u2013Russian agreement, the Russian government agreed to release the Russian prisoners and their family members for resettlement. The Russian prisoners had served a number of years in prison and some were in poor health.On July 9, all ten suspects were deported. A government-chartered jet from Vision Airlines left New York's LaGuardia Airport and flew to Vienna International Airport via Bangor, Maine for refueling and then for the swap around midday of July 9 (local time). Returning from Vienna were the four Russian prisoners - Sutyagin, Zaporozhsky, Skripal, and Vasilenko. The aircraft landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, England, to drop two of the exchanged Russian nationals and proceeded to Washington Dulles International Airport on the afternoon of July 9. The Russian government Yakovlev Yak-42 jet returned to Moscow's Domodedovo airport where, after landing, the ten spies were kept away from local and international press.Later that day the Russian ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the exchange of four convicted people for ten Russian citizens citing \"humanitarian considerations and constructive partnership development.\"\n\n\n== Prisoners held by Russia involved in the exchange ==\n\n\n=== Igor Sutyagin ===\n\nIgor Sutyagin was an arms control researcher with the Institute for US and Canadian Studies (ISKAN) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He was arrested in 1999, and sentenced in April 2004 to 15 years hard labor on high treason charges. He collected open-source data on Russian nuclear submarines and missile warning systems, analysed and provided it to a British consulting firm. He steadfastly denied using any classified information and ISKAN is said to have no access to Russian classified materials. Sutyagin maintained his innocence throughout his trial and conviction, but had to plead guilty shortly before the swap to qualify for a Presidential pardon. The U.S. Department of State and Amnesty International classified Sutyagin as a political prisoner, not a spy. The Washington Post commented that Sutyagin's case differed from the other released prisoners, and that his original arrest might have been to warn Russians not to cooperate with Western companies and think tanks.According to his relatives, Sutyagin phoned home on his arrival in the UK, saying that he was placed in an undisclosed location in a London suburb and that British authorities were in the process of granting him a UK visa. Later his lawyer confirmed that Sutyagin was granted leave to remain in the UK.\n\n\n=== Sergei Skripal ===\nSergei Skripal was a colonel in Russia's Military Intelligence Service (GRU), who was convicted of high treason in 2006 and sentenced to 13 years in prison. According to the prosecution, he had spied for the United Kingdom's MI6 as a double agent.  In 2018 Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in Salisbury, England.  They both survived the poisoning, though three unrelated people were accidentally poisoned as well, one of them fatally.\n\n\n=== Aleksandr Zaporozhsky ===\nAlexander Zaporozhsky was an operative in Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service. He was sentenced in 2003 to 18 years for secret cooperation with the United States. He was released as part of the swap after serving seven years.\n\n\n=== Gennady Vasilenko ===\nGennady Semyonovich Vasilenko (Russian: \u0413\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0451\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e) is the only person swapped from the Russian side who was not convicted on espionage (high treason) charges. He was a KGB officer who worked for external intelligence and counter-intelligence departments during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1988, presumably having been fingered by a Russian mole in the FBI, Robert Hanssen, he fell under suspicion of being a double agent. Vasilenko was not convicted but instead sacked from the KGB. He was arrested in 2005 and charged with an attempted murder. Due to lack of evidence this charge was dropped. Instead, he was sentenced to three years on possession of illegal firearms and explosive materials. In 2009, Vasilenko was convicted and sentenced again for allegedly trying to bribe facility officials.According to media reports (which cite anonymous sources in Russian intelligence), Vasilenko was included in the list for the swap due to a personal request from a CIA officer who knew Vasilenko when he was posted in the U.S. under diplomatic cover from 1976 to 1981.\n\n\n=== Others held by Russia ===\nAlexander Sypachev (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0421\u044b\u043f\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432) was a colonel in the Russian intelligence service who was arrested after delivering a report to a secret location in 2002. He was sentenced to eight years for spying for the CIA. He was reported to have been considered for a swap but was not among the four Russians released.\nSix others were considered for exchange as an even 11:11 swap, but were not exchanged in Vienna.\n\n\n== Political ramifications ==\nWhile there was speculation that the arrests of the alleged spies, which occurred barely 72 hours after President Medvedev's White House visit, might cast a shadow over President Barack Obama's effort to improve relations between the US and Russia, on June 30, 2010, the US administration said that it would not expel Russian diplomats and it expressed no indignation that Russia had apparently been caught spying on it.On June 29, 2010, The Guardian's comment said: \"Revelations about spy rings are the last thing a politician like Medvedev, who presents himself as a moderniser, needs\"; in its July 1, 2010, issue, The Economist wrote: \"The revelations have caused embarrassment in Moscow, not so much because Russia was caught spying on America, but because it did it so clumsily. Old KGB spies this week lamented the decline in professional standards. But the scandal has rather more serious domestic implications too. It punctures the mystique that helped allow the security services to gain such clout under Vladimir Putin, Russia's former president and present prime minister and a former KGB spy. The story discredits him and his circle of siloviki, the former and present members of the security services. Being laughed at is worse than being feared.\"On February 1, 2011, Ireland's cabinet made a decision to expel a Russian diplomat from the country \u2013 the first time since 1983, after the Irish government, based on an investigation conducted by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Special Detective Unit (SDU), concluded that the Russian security agent based at the Russian embassy in Rathgar gathered details from six genuine Irish passports that were then effectively cloned in Russia for the US-based spies. Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said, \"The Government, by today's action, has once again made clear that it will not tolerate the fabrication and use of forged Irish passports by agents of a foreign State.\" On February 4, 2011, the Irish press identified the expelled diplomat as Alexander Smirnov, first secretary in the Russian embassy's consular section. On February 2, 2011, Russia threatened retaliation.\n\n\n== Aftermath of the swap ==\nAfter the Russian agents were returned to Russia, they were delivered to the SVR headquarters. They were not technically arrested, and relatives could visit them. However, they were not allowed to leave the facility until after the debriefing process, which took several weeks, as the Russian authorities appeared to suspect that betrayal\u2014by any of the agents themselves or not\u2014could be a plausible explanation for their exposure.According to her lawyer, Vicky Pel\u00e1ez was placed in a Moscow apartment provided by Russian authorities. She turned down a 2000 USD per month offer from the Russian government and planned to return to Peru.On June 28, 2010, the UK revoked Anna Chapman's UK citizenship.On July 13, 2010, Russian intelligence sources were quoted as saying that the deported Russian agents would undergo a rigorous series of tests, including a lie detector, to establish whether any of them acted as a double agent.The spy affair attracted media attention, including Chapman being described as \"glamorous\" and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden joking shortly after the swap on a television chat show to comedian Jay Leno when asked \"Do we have any spies that hot?\" by saying \"Let me be clear. It wasn't my idea to send her back.\" Joe Biden also said of the Russian agents: \"And the ten, they've been here a long time, but they hadn't done much.\"In July 2010, while visiting Crimea (Ukraine), Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin told reporters, without specifying the date, that he had had a meeting with the agents, specifically acknowledging that Chapman was among them; he said that they had had \"a tough life\" and been turned in as a result of \"betrayal\"; he also sang with the agents to live music some songs, including \"From Where the Motherland Begins\" (What the Motherland Begins With or What Does the Motherland Start With). Putin declined to evaluate their work saying that it was not up to him to evaluate but up to specialists and the \"ultimate consumers of the information of such type, the Supreme Commander \u2013 the president of the Russian Federation.\"The defector former GRU agent, Viktor Suvorov, was scornful of both the agents and the agencies that sent them.In mid-August 2010, Sir Stephen Lander, Director-General of MI5 (1996\u20132002) voiced an opinion that the very existence of a ring of Russian \"illegals\" was no laughing matter: \"The fact that they're nondescript or don't look serious is part of the charm of the business. That's why the Russians are so successful at some of this stuff. They're able to put people in those positions over time to build up their cover to be useful. They are part of a machine. ... And the machine is a very professional and serious one.\"In October 2010, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev recognized those \"Intelligence agents who worked in the United States and returned to Russia in July\" together with other members of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service for their service to the motherland in ceremonies held at the Kremlin.In November 2010, an unidentified Kremlin official told Kommersant that an assassination plan for the alleged defector \"Colonel Shcherbakov\" was already in the works: \"We know who he is and where he is.\" The source added that \"a Mercader\" was sent after Shcherbakov\u2014a reference to assassin Ram\u00f3n Mercader who murdered Leon Trotsky in Mexico with an ice axe in 1940. The newspaper article's author later said that the statement could have been made in jest (\"spy humour\"). On November 13, 2010, U.S. intelligence analyst David Wise suggested that, assuming Shcherbakov was in the US, he must be under FBI protection.In November 2010, the Interfax news agency cited an unidentified \"Russian intelligence source\" as saying that \"Colonel Alexander Poteyev, a former deputy head of the U.S. division of Directorate S (illegal intelligence) within the SVR\" was the subject of both internal and criminal investigations, with the criminal case likely to have been opened as per Article 275 of the RF Criminal Code (high treason). Poteyev's identity (full name: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432) was confirmed by other ex-KGB and ex-SVR sources. The revelations in the Russian media about the 'treachery' within the SVR were seen by commentators as a sign of an ongoing struggle within the RF top bureaucracy for control over the administratively autonomous agency that had been part of the USSR KGB.On December 1, 2010, commentator and researcher Bill Gertz quoted a \"former intelligence official close to the National Security Agency\" (NSA) as saying that the FBI and the NSA were conducting a counterintelligence probe at the NSA Fort Meade, Md., headquarters in a top-secret hunt for a Russian agent, believing that the spy ring was likely acting as conduits for information coming from \"one or more Russian spies that NSA is convinced reside at Fort Meade and possibly other DoD offices, like DIA\". Bill Gertz's report prompted the Russian intelligence expert Andrei Soldatov to question the quasi-official version about Poteyev's responsibility. In a Larry King Live interview, aired by CNN about the same time, Russian prime minister Putin maintained that the Russian agents \"deserved unconditional respect\"; according to him, no harm had been done to U.S. interests, and that they would only become operational \"in crisis periods, say, in case of a breakup of the diplomatic relations.\"On December 16, 2010, prime minister Putin, when answering the question during a televised call-in show about whether he ever signed assassination orders, said that hit squads had long been abolished in Russia; speaking specifically of the turncoat allegedly responsible for exposing the ten sleeper agents, he denounced him as a \"brute\" and a \"pig\" saying that \"the traitors will croak all by themselves\", adding that a traitor\u2032s life is miserable and regrettable.On May 3, 2011 in Moscow, Alexander Poteyev was indicted on high treason and desertion charges and later put on trial in absentia. On 27 June 2011, he was found guilty in absentia on both charges and sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment; the judge's verdict said that Poteyev was recruited to the CIA in 1999. His court-appointed advocate said that Poteyev's remuneration from the US government might have reached $55 million.In July 2012, new details about the agents' activities were revealed that suggested that some of them planned to recruit their children to become agents.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nRudolf Abel, Gary Powers, and Frederic Pryor \u2013 swapped in 1962\nRussian influence operations in the United States\nThe Americans \u2013 a 2013 period drama TV series about Soviet deep-cover agents inspired by the events of the Illegals Program\nAllegiance \u2013 a TV series\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Press Release from the United States Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs (includes copies of both indictments)\nOperation Ghost Stories: Inside the Russian Spy Case at the FBI\n\"Criminal Complaints From the Justice Department\" at The New York Times\nProfile: Russia's 'spies' in the suburbs, BBC News, July 2, 2010, includes related stories and video\nCollected news and commentary at The Guardian\nCollected news and commentary at The New York Times\nAnna Chapman, One Last Look at The Smoking Gun, July 28, 2010, includes mugshots of the other spies\nThe Illegals: Russia's Elite Spies",

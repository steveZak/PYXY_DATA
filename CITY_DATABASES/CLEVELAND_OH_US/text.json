        "wiki": "The Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA) is an art museum in Cleveland, Ohio, located in the Wade Park District, in the University Circle neighborhood on the city's east side. Internationally renowned for its substantial holdings of Asian and Egyptian art, the museum houses a diverse permanent collection of more than 61,000 works of art from around the world. The museum provides general admission free to the public. With a $755 million endowment, it is the fourth-wealthiest art museum in the United States. With about 770,000 visitors annually (2018), it is one of the most visited art museums in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art was founded as a trust in 1913 with an endowment from prominent Cleveland industrialists Hinman Hurlbut, John Huntington, and Horace Kelley. The neoclassical, white Georgian Marble, Beaux-Arts building was constructed on the southern edge of Wade Park, at the cost of $1.25 million. Wade Park and the museum were designed by the local architectural firm, Hubbell & Benes, with the museum planned as the park's centerpiece. The 75-acre (300,000 m2) green space takes its name from philanthropist Jeptha H. Wade, who donated part of his wooded estate to the city in 1881. The museum opened its doors to the public on June 6, 1916, with Wade's grandson, Jeptha H. Wade II, proclaiming it, \"for the benefit of all people, forever\". Wade, like his grandfather, had a great interest in art and served as the museum's first vice-president; in 1920 he became its president. Today, the park, with the museum still as its centerpiece, is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n=== Mid to late 20th century expansion ===\n\nIn March 1958, the first addition to the building opened, doubling the museum's floorspace. This addition, which was on the north side of the original building, was designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Hayes and Ruth. They designed new gallery space and a new art library.\nThe museum again expanded in 1971 with the opening of the North Wing. With its stepped, two-toned granite facade, the addition designed by modernist architect Marcel Breuer provided angular lines in distinct contrast with the flourishes of the 1916 building's neoclassical facade. The museum's main entrance was shifted to the North Wing. The auditorium, classrooms, and lecture halls were also moved into the North Wing, allowing their spaces in the Original Building to be renovated as gallery space.\nIn 1983, a West Wing, designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Dalton, van Dijk, Johnson, & Partners, was completed. This provided larger library space, as well as nine new galleries.\nBetween 2001 and 2012, the 1958 and 1983 additions were demolished. A new wrap-around building, and east and west wings were constructed. Designed by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, this $350 million project doubled the museum's size to 592,000 square feet (55,000 m2). To integrate the new east and west wings with the Breuer building to the north, a new structure was built along the south side of the 1971 addition, creating extensive new gallery space on two levels, as well as providing for a museum store and other amenities. Vi\u00f1oly covered the space created by the demolition of the 1958 and 1983 structures with a glass-roofed atrium. The east wing opened in 2009, and the north wing and atrium in 2012. The West Wing opened on January 2, 2014.\n\n\n=== Expansion in the 21st century ===\n\nThe museum's building and renovation project, \"Building for the Future\", began in 2005 and was originally targeted for completion in 2012 (though it was not completed until 2013) at projected costs of $258 million. The museum celebrated the official completion of the renovation and expansion project with a grand opening celebration held on December 31, 2013, and additional activities that continued through the first week of 2014. The $350 million project\u2014two-thirds of which was earmarked for the complete renovation of the original 1916 structure\u2014added two new wings, and was the largest cultural project in Ohio's history. The new east and west wings, as well as the enclosing of the atrium courtyard under a soaring glass canopy, have brought the museum's total floor space to 592,000 square feet (55,000 m2) (an increase of approximately 65%).\nThe first phase of the project had $9.3 million in cost overruns; the opening was delayed by 9 months. Museum director Timothy Rub assured the public that the increase in quality would be worth both the wait and expense. In June 2008, after being closed for nearly three years for the overhaul, the museum reopened 19 of its permanent galleries to the public in the renovated 1916 building main floor.\nOn June 27, 2009, the newly constructed East Wing (which contains the Impressionist, Contemporary, and Modern art collections) opened to the public.\n\nOn June 26, 2010, the ground level of the 1916 building reopened. It now houses the collections of Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Sub-Saharan African, Byzantine, and Medieval art.\nThe expanded museum includes enhanced visitor amenities, such as new restrooms, an expanded store and caf\u00e9, a sit-down gourmet restaurant, parking capacity increased to 620 spaces, and a 34,000 square feet (3,200 m2) glass-covered courtyard.\n\n\n== Wade Park ==\n\nWade Park includes an outdoor gallery displaying part of the museum's holdings in the Wade Park Fine Arts Garden. The bulk of this collection is located between the original 1916 main entrance to the building and the lagoon. Highlights of the public sculpture include the large cast of Chester Beach's 1927 Fountain of the Waters; a monument to the Polish expatriate and American Revolutionary War-hero Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko; and the 1928 bronze statuary sundial by Frank Jirouch, Night Passing the Earth to Day, which sits across Wade Lagoon from the museum, near the park's entrance on Euclid Avenue.\nAuguste Rodin's The Thinker is installed at the top of the museum's main staircase. After being partially destroyed in a 1970 bombing (allegedly by the Weathermen), the statue was never restored. Art historians knew that Rodin was involved in the original casting of this sculpture. The 1970 damage (noted on a plaque since mounted at the base of the statue's pedestal) is considered to have made this casting unique among the more than twenty original large castings of this work.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art divides its collections into 16 departments, including Chinese Art, Modern European Art, African Art, Drawings, Prints, European Art, Textiles and Islamic Art, American Painting and Sculpture, Greek and Roman Art, Contemporary Art, Medieval Art, Decorative Art and Design, Pre-Columbian and Native North American Art, Japanese and Korean Art, Indian and Southeast Asian Art, and Photography. Artists represented by significant works include Olivuccio di Ciccarello, Botticelli, Giambattista Pittoni, Caravaggio, El Greco, Poussin, Rubens, Frans Hals, Gerard David, Goya, J.M.W. Turner, Dal\u00ed, Matisse, Renoir, Gauguin (The Call), Frederic Edwin Church, Thomas Cole, Corot, Thomas Eakins, Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Picasso, and George Bellows. The Museum has been active recently in acquiring later 20th-century art, having added important works by Warhol, Jackson Pollock, Christo, Anselm Kiefer, Ronald Davis, Larry Poons, Leon Kossoff, Jack Whitten, Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Chuck Close, Robert Mangold, Ching Ho Cheng, Mark Tansey and Sol LeWitt, among others.\nThe museum's African art collection consists of 300 traditional, sub-Saharan works from the Bini, Congo, Senufo, and Yoruba peoples, mostly donated by Cleveland collector Katherine C. White. The museum is especially strong in the field of Asian art, possessing one of the best collections in the U.S.In June 2004, the museum acquired an ancient bronze sculpture of Apollo Sauroktonos, believed to be an original work by Praxiteles of Athens. Because the work has a contested provenance, the museum continues to study the dating and attribution of the sculpture. In 2011, Michael Bennet, the Greek and Roman arts curator, announced that he had dated the piece to 350 B.C. to 250 B.C. In 2013, the museum held a focus exhibition on the statue. It announced reattribution of the work as Apollo the Python-Slayer, and said that the statue was almost certainly an original work by Praxiteles himself, and that laboratory investigations and expert testimony conclusively show the bronze was neither a recent discovery nor recovered from the sea.In 2008, the United States Postal Service selected the Cleveland Museum's famed Botticelli painting entitled Virgin and Child with the Young John the Baptist as the Christmas stamp for that year.\n\n\n=== Modern European Painting and Sculpture ===\n\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art's Modern European Painting and Sculpture collection holds pieces dating from 1800 to 1960, and contains about 537 pieces. The collection contains Impressionism and Post-impressionism works, avant-garde art styles, and German Expressionism and Neuesachlichkeit art.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== European Painting and Sculpture ===\nThis collection holds pieces dating from 1500 to 1800, with major works representing Italian Baroque, Spanish Baroque, Italian Renaissance, as well as significant French, British, and Dutch paintings.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== American Painting and Sculpture ===\nThe collection is concise, containing about 300 paintings and 90 sculptures. Major attractions in the collection include William Sideny Mount's The Power of Music, Frederich Edwin Church's Twilight in the Wilderness, and Albert Pinkham Ryder's The Racetrack (Death on a Pale Horse). A number of Cleveland-based artists are also included in the museum's holdings, placing an emphasis on local art.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Photography ===\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art contains a small collection of fine art photography, dating back to 1893. What makes the collection are the pieces from photography's first contributors, particularly French, English, and American photographers. Other highlights of the collection are \"photography with complete sets of The North American Indian by Edward S. Curtis and Camera Work; surrealist photography created primarily between the two world wars; and Cleveland-specific subject matter produced by regional and national photographers\".\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Decorative Art and Design ===\nAn internationally renowned collection, the Decorative Art and Design collection \"consists of useful objects in which the form and decoration are the primary focus, not objects intended purely as sculpture\"\n\n\n=== Ingalls Library ===\nIn addition to its comprehensive collection of fine art, the Cleveland Museum of Art is also home to the Ingalls Library, one of the largest art libraries in the United States. As part of the initial 1913 plan by the museum's founders, a library of 10,000 volumes was to be assembled, to include photographs and archival works. By the 1950s, the collection of books alone had surpassed 37,000 and the photographic collection neared 47,000. By the 21st century, the library had more than 500,000 volumes (and 500,000 digitized slides); renovation of the library space was one of the focal points in the museum's $350 million expansion.\n\n\n=== ARTLENS Gallery ===\n\nThe ARTLENS Gallery is a series of interactive displays and a mobile app that allow visitors to view and interact with the museum's digitized collection. ARTLENS is divided into four components:\nThe ArtLens Wall is a 40-foot display that lets visitors browse and scale all works that are displayed in the museum, as well as some artworks that are not. The wall rotates through artworks in groups organized by criteria such as type, shape, and color.\nThe ArtLens Exhibition is a rotating selection of artworks that are showcased through digital gesture-based games and activities. Examples of these activities are automatically matching the shape of a user's hand gestures to an artwork, or having the user imitate poses found in various works, which are then scored for accuracy.\nThe ArtLens Studio is a series of digital studios for visitors to make their own artwork, such as creating digital pottery by mimicking a potter's movements, or creating collages from images provided by the museum.\nThe ArtLens mobile application provides information about the museum and lists of all its artworks. The app is able to communicate via Bluetooth to beacons located throughout the museum to determine the user's location, and allows the user to mark and save artworks they come across. The app connects to the previously mentioned ArtLens Exhibition and Wall.Following the launch of ARTLENS, the Cleveland Museum of Art conducted a two-year study to see how the gallery impacts visitor engagement. Surveys from November 2017 and January 2018 of 438 ARTLENS visitors found that 76% of viewers felt that the gallery \"enhanced their overall museum experience\"; 74% felt that it \"encouraged them to look closely at art and notice new things\"; and 73% said that it \"increased their interest in the museum's collection.\" Museum visitors born between 1981 and 1996 were 15% more likely to visit the gallery compared to older individuals. The ARTLENS system also gathers analytical data; the time patrons spent looking at artworks went from an average of two-to-three seconds to fifteen seconds.\n\n\n== Programs ==\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art also maintains a schedule of special exhibitions, lectures, films and musical programs. The department of performing arts, music and film hosts a film series and the museum's Performing Arts Series, which brings the creative energies of internationally renowned artists into Cleveland.\nThe department of education at CMA creates programs for lifelong learning from lectures, talks and studio classes to outreach programs and community events, such as Parade the Circle\", Chalk Festival and the \"Winter Lights Lantern Festival\". Educational programs include distance learning, \"Art to Go\", and the \"Educator's Academy\". The museum is also home to the Ingalls Library, one of the largest art museum libraries in the United States with over 500,000 volumes.\n\n\n=== Open Access collection materials ===\n\nIn January 2019, the Cleveland Museum of Art announced that it was waiving its rights to \"roughly 30,000 of the 61,328 objects in its permanent collection considered to be in the public domain\". They are using the Creative Commons \u2013 Zero license for high-resolution images and data about its collection. Additionally, metadata for more than 61,000 pieces in its collection have been made available. The Open Access material is available on a special section of the museum website.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== Attendance ===\nThe museum reported attendance of 597,715 during the period between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014, the highest total in more than a decade. In 2018, the museum had a record 769,435 visitors, replacing the previous record of 719,620 in 1987.\n\n\n=== Finance ===\nIn 1958, a $35-million bequest by industrialist Leonard C. Hanna Jr. vaulted the Cleveland Museum of Art into the ranks of the country's richest art museums. Today, the museum receives operating support from the Ohio Arts Council through state tax dollars. It is also funded by Cuyahoga County residents through Cuyahoga Arts and Culture. The museum derives around two thirds of its $36 million budget from interest on its endowment, which was reported as $750 million in 2014. The museum has an acquisition fund of $277 million, from which it draws about $13 million a year for purchase of works for its collections.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe museum has also taken an active role in presenting music concerts and lectures. These include performances by Chanticleer (ensemble), Roomful of Teeth, and John Luther Adams among others.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Directors ===\nWilliam M. Griswold (2014\u2013)\nFred Bidwell (2013\u20132014, interim director)\nDavid Franklin (2010\u20132013)\nDeborah Gribbon (2009\u20132010, interim director)\nTimothy Rub (2006\u20132009)\nKatharine Lee Reid (2000\u20132006)\nKate Sellars (1999\u20132000, interim director)\nRobert P. Bergman (1993\u20131999)\nEvan H. Turner (1983\u20131993)\nDr. Sherman E. Lee (1958\u20131982)\nWilliam M. Milliken (1930\u20131958)\nFrederic Allen Whiting (1913\u20131930)\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe museum is the stand-in for the fictional S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and can be extensively seen in several office and establishing shots of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). In several scenes, the museum's atrium can be seen as the \"lobby\" for the Washington, D.C.-based government organization. The outside of the museum and elevator tower are in other shots as well.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLandscape with a Windmill, 1646\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n(in Japanese) \u9580\u8107 \u8208\u6b21 (\u524d\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u88dc\u7fd2\u6821(Japanese Language School of Cleveland)\u6559\u8aed\u30fb\u5343\u8449\u770c\u7acb\u6210\u7530\u5e02\u7acb\u6771\u5c0f\u5b66\u6821\u6559\u8aed). \"\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u56fd\u969b\u7406\u89e3\u6559\u80b2\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5 : \u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u7f8e\u8853\u9928\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba\u30d5\u30a7\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30d0\u30eb\u3092\u901a\u3057\u3066.\" \u5728\u5916\u6559\u80b2\u65bd\u8a2d\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u6307\u5c0e\u5b9f\u8df5\u8a18\u9332 24, 111\u2013114, 2001.

          "This is a wonderful art museum. We were very impressed with the wide range of art and the beauty of the museum space. The permanent exhibits are free, but the temporary you have to pay to see. We paid to see the Georgia O\u2019Keefe and the Valois tapestries, and it was worth it. We",

          "We didn't realize how big this place was. We had parked at a meter and only put in for two hours. That should be plenty of time, right? Not at all! That barely got us started.",
          "I came to the Museum during a business trip and only had about 30 minutes before the museum closed. This is one of the most beautiful art museums with a very calming atmosphere and gorgeous art. I came across Gray and Gold and was so drawn to it I found an old lithograph online",

          "This place is big but it never seemed \u2018too much\u2019 like other large museums be where you just start wandering aimlessly towards an exit. Each space seemed to keep you engaged. The armor room is spectacular and there are a few others that offer big names all together.",

          "I recently toured the museum, it was definitely worth the time and I would recommend it. I particularly liked the suits of armor and the ancient weapons. The paintings on the second floor were magnificent. If you are in Cleveland this museum is a must see.",
          "I went there a year ago for the 1920's exhibit which was fabulous! The exhibit was so great that I did not get much time to see the rest of the museum because I was in there the entire time. I raced through a few rooms real quick before they closed and I will definitely go back.",

          "I've been to this museum before but it continues to impress. We went to see the Infinity Mirrors exhibit which was fantastic, hard to describe. The atrium is a grand space to eat or just hangout. The permanent collection is free only special exhibits have a fee. There is so",
          "Excellent museum with a wide range of art offerings. Free entry, except for special exhibits. Well worth a visit.",

          "It was suggested I go to the Art Museum by a friend. I was not really expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised to be in a museum that could easily challenge the likes of most Art museums. The museum was well laid out and the exhibits were wonderful.",
          "Was fortunate enough to have scored tickets to YAYOI KUSAMA'S Infinity Mirrors Exhibit at the CMA. While we absolutely love the museum, this was a chance to see and experience the unique works of this one of a kind artist 20-30 seconds in most rooms too me was not enough but",

          "This is a MUST SEE experience in Cleveland, OH. World class fabulous art museum with many nudes and other interesting images. Love the medieval art section. Perfect size Museum. You will be a better person having spent 3-4 hours here. Even the toilets are grand",
          "This place is just beautiful. It\u2019s in the middle of everything. The building and the property are just so incredibly taken care of. This is a place you want to take pictures. The lawn and the fountain are extraordinary. The pond is breathtaking. I can\u2019t say enough about this",
          "It's always great to return to one of Cleveland's greatest cultural assets. At 592,500 square feet (to give you some actual perspective, Milwaukee Museum Art is about half that at 341,000 square feet), the museum brims with collections deemed so world-class, you'll see them",
          "Those of us from the area visited on school trips and I hadn't been back for many years. My daughter was attending Cleveland State as a student of graphic design and I went with her for an assignment. i was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed our time. So much to see-take",
          "It's not fair to compare this museum with those in much larger cities, but it does come up short compared to similar sized Milwaukee. The art museum there always surprises me. Came to see the Kusama show which was delightful. The buildings are put together well and the staff is",

          "Too much to see! Our first visit here, and we were wonderfully surprised by the extensive collection. Use the handy guide \"Must CMA\" to see highlighted pieces but I guarantee you will get distracted by others as you wander the galleries. We particularly loved the J.M.W.Turner",
          "I had some time to kill while my daughter was doing a program at Case Western. I was able to walk to the museum from campus. Entrance was free which was amazing given the extraordinary amount of art. I spent most of my time in the European Impressionists and post impressionists",

          "Visited the CMA with ease as the crowds were queueing for the Yayoi Kusame exhibit for which we could not get tickets. Tried the ArtLens app without any expectations given my experience with museum apps in NYC. This app so enriches one's visit to CMA with art history text",
          "Great place and the admission is still free. My last visit was to see the incredible Yayoi Kusama exhibit. Kusama is crazy and a genius. You effectively become part of the exhibit and her use of lighting, space and color is remarkable. But, that ends in September. There is",

          "This exhibit was so worth the cost (I became a member) and the effort...but for all the attention to details, I think the museum could do better as far as being responsive and having better signage. For someone who is new to it all, the garage signage is basically non-existent,",

          "Great place to go. Helpful staff. Look on line to see what is the current exhibits. Great Interactive area for kids.",
          "This is a great place to stop at when making a day trip. My wife and I love it",

          "Beautiful exhibit, and an incredibly calming common area. The bean bags surrounded by speakers were very relaxing, and really helped me pass time waiting for the rest of my party to arrive. The cafe smelled delicious, with pizza sushi and curry, and every exhibit was interesting, and I felt it was worth the $10 parking fee.",
          "Grateful to have this Museum in my city. I visit a few times a year. You don't even need a membership or to pay to get in. Although it definitely does help because they have galleries that are Members Only. But the majority of the museum is free. There is also a nearby park that's absolutely beautiful.",
          "Wonderful, pleasant and educational. We dropped our house keys and was still able to go back after closing hours to retrieve it from Lost & Found! The staff was more than kind, and we thank you. Hope our return back is sooner rather than later.",
          "This place has an absolutely AMAZING art collection.  The galleries are well laid out, expansive, and thoughtfully accompanied by didactic information.  The gift shop is moderately priced with a wonderful selection of mementos complimented \u2026",

          "One of the more beautiful places to visit in Cleveland, and it is a must if you are on vacation here for some reason!  First off it's free, and the place is huge with so so many exhibits to view. You will need a a solid 3-4 hours if not as \u2026",
          "I LOVE this place. But just about every painting of a person does not have a person of color. For the time I spent I didn't see any person of color. I am going to go back and see some the other paintings.",
          "This museum is FREE every single day and the contents are extremely impressive and loaded with so many eras & regions of art",

          "Amazed at how expansive this museum has become.  Building seemed larger than life to me.  Only visited Michaelangelo exhibit.  Will definitely return to explore offerings.  Customer service was exceptional!",
          "A Cleveland treasure.  Great exhibits.  Plenty of space.  Exhibits aren't crammed which made things even nicer.  Just a great, great place.",
          "My son and I visit the museum every year on our birthdays. It's free to enter, but parking is about $13. It's worth every penny. How often are you going to be able to view a Jackson Pollock in your lifetime? When I leave here I'm sad to to, but rejuvenated creatively and spiritually. An amazing museum.",

          "What an incredible museum!  Who knew Cleveland had such a top tier museum - among the likes of the Guggenheim or the Met!  And it\u2019s free!  I was thoroughly impressed. Would definitely visit again if I\u2019m in Cleveland again!",

          "One of the best art museums in the United States! Truly a hidden treasure of Cleveland that should be getting more attention. Great for all ages and lovers of art!",
          "The building and grounds are beautiful. Works by many of the most famous artists in history provide a very enjoyable way to spend a day. It is easy to get to with plenty of parking nearby. Entrance fees at similar museums can be $20 so the fact that they have free admission makes this a must stop if you are in Cleveland.",
          "This place is unreal. Not only is it an amazingly large and fantastic museum, but it is free. Always. Awesome.",

          "Cant believe it's free admission!  Such great art here and love the different temporary shows they have. We've paid to see the Pompeii exhibit, Monet, Kusama, and Michaelangelo. Always great ticketed shows well worth the price!  Took our 4 year old for the first time this year and she loved it too.",
          "Free exhibits! Low cost souvenirs! This would have been beyond amazing for me when I was a child, as I grew up sub poverty and lived to enjoy free events with my family. So happy I got to see the exhibit the day before labor day. It was.my \u2026",
          "Huge collection of a wide variety of art. Beautiful building. Knowledgeable and helpful staff",

          "Another great place in the city of Cleveland. Phenomenal exhibits periodically on display.  Recently the Michaelangelo exhibit.",
          "One of the best art museums in the world. Even the buildings are a work of art, mixing old marble stone buildings with modern architecture under a large glass atrium.",
          "This is a wonderful museum in both the day time, and for their parties (MIX) which they host the first Friday of each month. It's a very well run event with typically a hands on experience, dancing, exhibits, and more.",
          "Visited for the Michaelangelo Exhibit. It was totally worth the $15. For some of us we may never get to experience traveling abroad so for something like this to come so close it was a must. It was informative, and the curator did a good \u2026",
          "It was a much-needed immersive and relaxing experience for me. There are lots of exhibits so I couldn't make it to all of them but I enjoyed all the ones that I did make it to. Highly recommend making a visit to this museum regardless of \u2026",

          "It was a very interesting place, I haven't been there in years I don't even recall the last time it was. But I was very intrigued of the artifacts that I saw and I was unable to cover the entire Museum and 2 hours so be prepared to spend \u2026",
          "Great art museum to go and check out ! Best part it\u2019s free !!!! (:",
          "One of few art museums that I would recommend for families with young children. They have an art lens exhibit that kids can play for hours in. On hot summer days you can walk through exhibits and let the kids explore art. Just right outside \u2026",
          "Beautiful, relaxing, experience.  Even if you know nothing about art, it's still worth a visit.  My entire family enjoyed the museum.  My kids may have accidentally learned something over summer vacation!",
          "Absolutely beautiful. Its huge with fun interactive activities for the kids too!",

          "Beautiful museum. Not crowded. A little bit of everything. Easy to navigate. Great neighborhood.",
          "Beautiful exhibits and friendly staff members. Parking is nearby and the Botanical Garden is right around the corner. Attendance is free if you\u2019re a student, and even if you\u2019re not, it\u2019s worth a visit!",
          "I had no idea that this was a famous place, or that it is second only to the Met in New York City (according to my art professor friend). All I can say is, I went in thinking, oh great another museum - I will be bored to tears. Instead I \u2026",
          "Outstanding collection and exhibits, the majority of which are free to the public. Great way to spend a morning or afternoon.",
          "Police refused to hear my plees that I was in sight while limping to my car as a handicap individual .. 2 minutes late they shrugged and just smiled .. Sorry?? No. The exhibition was great and so was lunch.",
          "Very interesting place. Learned alot about things. Little crowded but I am looking forward to going back and learning more. Excited!",
          "An absolutely lovely museum. They have everything here, and the recent modern atrium extension is amazingly done and overall great. Gallery one is much suggested for all those in the museum. Free as well. Overall, great experience.",
          "World class museum. I can only think of a few in the US that even compare. If you want to see the whole collection please allow for at least one full day but it will likely take more. Beautiful gardens as well. And btw it's free to all.",
          "Events were outstanding. Museum itself is beautiful, and had a wonderful experience looking at priceless pieces of artwork. However I feel as though there needs to be better communication between staff members. Had some issues with the \u2026",

          "Truly An Amazing Art Museum. \nEverything on display was well organized into time periods and styles of art, so the viewing experience was very pleasant as well as educational. The vastness of the building itself was breathtaking too.",
          "This was a beautiful exhibit very nice place can't say enough about it",
          "Saw a special exhibit of Michelangelo's sketches.  Signage fell short on directing us to the entrance so we went into the exit and missed most of the presentations.  We did get more time to examine each of the displays since we weren't following the speaker.",
          "Always a wonderful experience! And free for all..",
          "How lucky are we that we have this place in Cleveland! Great collection of works.",
          "Always a treat. Very much enjoyed the Michaelangelo exhibit and another chance of seeing the permanent collection again. Never gets old..(no pun intended)",
          "very few places where Aug exquisite art gallery is there. this is also one of the few places where such collection can be seen with free admission.",
          "This museum was phenomenal. And, except for special exhibits, was free of charge. We went specifically to see the \u201cMichelangelo: Mind of the Master\u201d exhibit, which in my opinion, was fantastic. The cost to view the exhibit was $15.00 which \u2026",
          "Adds flare to Cleveland's University Circle area. The exterior exemplifies Cleveland's rich history and architecture. CMOA has a plethora of open space, leaving room to reflect on the art (atrium, food, etc).  It is a sociable museum and is also free.",
          "Great place to spend the day. It's free to get but parking you will have to pay for. I think the max for parking is $16 which is not a bad price seeing you can spend at least 4 hours here and then just walking around the area.",

          "It's free and it's amazing. I spent a few hours walking around and looking at the great collection of art. They have many different styles from different regions as well. I recommend bringing a fully charged phone and some headphones so you can take advantage of their app that has audio on pieces throughout the museum. Must visit!",
          "Good peices. Good facility. Hope you grab a postcard :)",
          "I love every art piece in there and it was my first time being there so seeing different art pieces also they were very nice with check-in even when I purchased an item there was great service and I hope that everyone who visits this art museum get great service like I did.",
          "How is all this free!? Gorgeous! \nOur only negative was a few guards in a few galleries treated us like criminals since we had younger (very well behaved, 5&7 yrs) children with us. When I brought this to the attention of visitor services they were extremely solicitous and apologetic.",
          "Beautiful museum with a cafe! I love the lighting.",
          "There is so much to see. Got a membership. Helps with parking Costa and covers all the exhibits. The museum is free. Moved here from Columbus and this art museum is like a 10. It will take months to see all of the art. The cafe is very cool. Food , got a flatbread, and little bottle of wine for lunch. So much fun.",
          "I attended MIX at CMA and absolutely loved everything about the event. The music, people and activities made it a night to remember.",
          "Something for everyone to learn and appreciate art in its many forms...check out the interactive \"art lens\" area which also has activities for the children - use your body to make art come alive on the screen! Admission is always free so if \u2026",

          "Awesome place! A lot of thinks to learn, wonderful arts!",
          "The museum strives to cover almost everything and current management seems to focus on bringing younger audiences in with performances and mingle-events that have little to do with art. A good museum but not on par with the best in the \u2026",
          "Nice place to spend a weekend, learn history of pretty much all around the world",
          "I take my boys there often, and today was exceptional! The Michelangelo exhibit was truly wonderful and the museum spared no expense at showing it properly...truly a gem our CMA is, and today was truly awesome!",

          "My friend who knows nothing about art said you could easily make it through this gallery in less than two hours. I guess if you are practicing sprints for an upcoming race that is possible. This museum is huge and I barely made it through \u2026",
          "Great way to spend any day. Try the ArtLens app, it really enriches the experience.",
          "The Michaelangelo exhibit was amazing. There were also great works by Caravaggio, Van Gogh, Franz Hals, and many others, truly an inspirational experience.",
          "Wow!  I had no idea Cleveland was hiding this gem!  Fabulous museum, I can hardly believe it's free for all to see.  The medieval collection was breathtaking, the stargazer is a beautiful and ancient artifact.  11 out of 10.  I will visit again!",
          "Great museum. They have great visiting exhibits and lectures.",
          "Consistently rated among the top comprehensive art museums in the country. A wonderfully engaging space for people of all backgrounds and ages.",
          "Dope spot to check out free to the public some exhibits cost but a really cool place to vibe with a slew of art from all eras.",
          "Wow! Great place to slow down and learn something about the world's diverse cultures and creativity with expression. A must visit more often for me.",

          "Beautiful stuff. Not ideal for a 3yr old",
          "One of the best museums! Love coming here.",
          "LOVED IT!  It's new and different every time I go.  One of my favoprite places in CLE!  World class, and a place everyone should get to.  An absolute gem.",
          "Michangelo exhibit was beautiful but poorly exicuted. Turned what should have been awesome into a cattle herd experience",
          "I ve never been to an art museum before and this was my first experience. My jaw dropped many times as I was exploring the museum. Everything is well-maintained and the staffs were too kind and helpful. Art lovers will definitely enjoy this place. You can find arts from various countries, cultures and eras.",
          "Always amazing, the Cleveland Museum of Art  has such a great variety of beautiful and interesting art. The kids loved the armor exhibit and hanging out in the atrium for a pastry. I visit the museum almost every time I am in Cleveland to \u2026",
          "As special as any art museum I've visited in Europe and there is no admission cost except for special exibits. But don't let that stop you from stuffing a sawbuck or two in the donation box. It's well worth it.",
          "BEST place to visit time and again in Cleveland, Ohio for art & history....a true national treasure!",
          "Excellent museum with superior customer service at all levels, check in, tickets, membership, coat check, parking validation, information, gift store, exhibit personnel - everywhere, everyone.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is a 183-acre (74 ha) zoo in Cleveland, Ohio. The Zoo is divided into several areas: Australian Adventure; African Savanna; Northern Wilderness Trek, The Primate, Cat & Aquatics Building, Waterfowl Lake, The RainForest, and the newly added Asian Highlands. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has one of the largest collections of primates in North America, The Zoo is a part of the Cleveland Metroparks system.\nThe Cleveland Metroparks Zoo was founded in 1882. It is one of the most popular year-round attractions in Northeast Ohio by attendance with a 2% increase from the previous year to 1.2 million visitors in 2007, compared to the Cleveland Indians who were the most popular attraction in Northeast Ohio in 2007 with a total attendance of over 2.2 million.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Zoo, originally named the Cleveland Zoological Park, first opened in 1882 at Wade Park where the Cleveland Museum of Art now stands. During its early years, the Zoo only held animals of local origin. In 1907, the city of Cleveland moved the Zoo to its current location in Old Brooklyn, and the Zoo acquired its first elephant. Beginning in 1910, the Zoo constructed Monkey Island, sea lion pools, and a moated bear exhibit. By 1940, the Zoo was home to three elephants and its first (permanent) elephant resident since 1924. That same year, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History assumed control of the Zoo.\nBetween 1955 and the transfer of management to the Cleveland Metroparks in 1975, the Zoo experienced rapid expansion despite setbacks due to flooding: the Zoo's reptile collection and several other buildings were lost when Big Creek overflowed in January 1959. Although the Zoo had recovered by 1962, it would not have another permanent reptile collection until the opening of the RainForest thirty years later. Construction began on the Primate & Cat Building in 1975 (the Aquatics section would be added in 1985), later followed by the RainForest in 1992, Wolf Wilderness in 1997, Australian Adventure in 2000, and the Sarah Allison Steffee Center for Zoological Medicine in 2004. The Zoo's official website states that it currently has 3,000 animal residents representing more than 600 different species.\n\n\n=== Building/exhibit history ===\nThe following is a timeline of when selected buildings and exhibits were created:\n\n1882: Cleveland Zoological Park opens at Wade Park (now University Circle)\n1884: Wade Hall is built\n1907: Cleveland's City Council moves the Zoo to its current location; the Cleveland Museum of Art is built\n1934: Monkey Island is completed\n1956: Pachyderm Building is built\n1970: Wade Hall is moved to its current location on the shore of Waterfowl Lake\n1975: Construction began on the Primate & Cat Building\n1985: Aquatics portion of the Primate & Cat Building is added\n1992: The RainForest is completed\n1997: Wolf Wilderness is completed\n2000: Australian Adventure is completed\n2004: Sarah Allison Steffee Center for Zoological Medicine opens\n2008: Pachyderm building closes to make room for African elephant crossing\n2011: African Elephant Crossing opens\n2015: Ben Gogolick Giraffe Encounter opens\n2016: Rosebrough Tiger Passage opens\n2018: Asian Highlands opens\n2019: Monkey island is demolished to make way for expansion for the rhino exhibit\n2020: Rhino exhibit is expanded\n\n\n== Leadership Emeritus, Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (CMZ) ==\n\n\n=== Distinguished Emeritus Staff (CMZ) ===\n\n\n==== National Zoo Association Awarded Cleveland Metroparks Zoo Staff with Honorary Memberships ====\nRetired Cleveland Metroparks Zoo administrators and career zoo and aquarium professionals Daniel Moreno and Donald Kuenzer were recognized as Honorary Membership Winners by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Recipients of Honorary Membership are recognized as the most esteemed and distinguished zoo professionals in North America.\nAccording to the AZA website, Honorary Membership is conferred by the AZA Board of Directors upon those AZA members who have made \"significant contributions to the zoological profession during their careers.\"Moreno and Kuenzer are included in a list of other notable North American zoo and aquarium professionals. Other recipients include William G. Conway, Hon. PhD (Director General/President Emeritus, Bronx Zoo-based Wildlife Conservation Society), Lester Fisher, DVM (Veterinarian/Director Emeritus, Lincoln Park Zoo), Murray Fowler, DVM (Veterinarian/Professor, University of California), Jack Hanna, Hon.

Clarke (Director Emeritus, Topeka Zoo), Roger Conant, Hon ScD (Curator Emeritus, Toledo Zoo) and Ted A. Beattie (President/Director Emeritus, Shedd Aquarium).\n\n\n==== Daniel Moreno ====\nDan Moreno joined the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo after serving three decades at the helm of the Cleveland Aquarium as both its director and curator under the auspices of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. The Cleveland Aquarium's animal collection was \"absorbed\" by the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo in 1986 after structural elements of the aquarium building forced its closing.\nUntil his retirement in 1997, Moreno managed the aquatic animal collections at the Cleveland Zoo under General Curator Don Kuenzer. He supervised animal husbandry programs for the Rainforest and Aquatics exhibits. Moreno was a charter member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (originally the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums) and served on its Board of Directors from 1971 to 1976.In 2012, the Greater Cleveland Aquarium opened to the public as the only free standing aquarium in the state of Ohio.\n\n\n==== Donald Kuenzer ====\nDon Kuenzer retired after a 40-year career serving in multiple capacities, including senior curator, general curator and acting director. In 1961, Kuenzer began his career at the Cleveland Zoo's Petting Farm as an attendant animal care technician. After serving as an animal keeper, he was promoted to Assistant General Curator in 1975 by zoo director Dr. Leonard Goss.Kuenzer was credited with designing The Rainforest, a state-of-the art indoor naturalistic living exhibit dedicated to the display of tropical and subtropical species from multiple continents. He served on the Board of Regents for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n\n\n=== Past Directors/Directors Emeritus, Cleveland Metroparks Zoo ===\n\n\n==== Leonard Goss, DVM, PhD (7th Director) ====\nDr. Goss (1913-1999) was a veterinary pathologist and retired from the Cleveland Zoo (later renamed the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo) as its director in 1979. Prior to assuming the director position in Cleveland, he was the fourth chief veterinarian at the New York Zoological Society's Bronx Zoo as well as assistant director of the Bronx Zoo. Dr. Goss was President of the AZA and twice Vice-President.\nAt the Bronx Zoo, which is the headquarters for the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), Goss conducted clinical, epidemiological and pathological research in collaboration with eminent field zoologist George Schaller. Schaller was the Director of the Bronx Zoo's Animal Research and Conservation Center, which is now referred to as the Wildlife Conservation Society's Global Conservation Program.The Cleveland Zoo has since made efforts to replicate this type of collaborative research relationship as demonstrated by Drs. Goss and Schaller in the 1970s and more recently by Atlanta, Chicago (Lincoln Park & Brookfield), National, San Diego, and Saint Louis zoos.\nIn the mid and late 1990s General Curator Hugh Quinn hired Patricia McDaniels as the first of three successive curators for the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo's Science and Conservation section. The unit now has a veterinary epidemiologist on staff. Sharon Deem, DVM, PhD Dipl. ACZM (now with the Saint Louis Zoo), was the first formally trained epidemiologist on staff and was both a researcher and experienced clinician from the National Zoo.When Dr. Goss, a graduate of the Cornell University and The Ohio State University veterinary colleges returned to Ohio to assume the role as director of the Cleveland Zoo, he continued to conduct research in zoological medicine and related animal science disciplines. Goss was a president of the Board of Directors of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (previously the \"American Zoo and Aquarium Association\", and originally the \"American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums\").\n\n\n==== Michael Vitantonio (8th Director) ====\nMichael \"Mike\" Vitantonio was hired as the eighth director of the Cleveland Zoo in its 130 plus year history.\n\n\n==== Steve H. Taylor, BS (9th Director) ====\nInspired by the TV show Zoorama, Zoo Director Emeritus Steve H. Taylor began his zoo career in 1972 as an animal keeper at the Los Angeles Zoo.  According to his website, he is now a \"Zoo Consultant and Entertaining Speaker\".Taylor continues to advise zoos, including the Akron Zoo as both a professional consultant and member of its Board of Trustees. He also served on the Board of Directors of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Prior to moving to Ohio, Taylor was the director of the 5-hectare Sacramento Zoo.\nTaylor resigned as director of the 5-hectare zoo in Sacramento to accept the directorship of the 70-hectare zoo in Cleveland. In his memoirs, published in a newsletter, Taylor described the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo to be poorly managed and \"undistinguished\" when he assumed the position as its 9th director. He credits himself for improving the conditions for both animals and staff over his 24-year career in Cleveland.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\nThe Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is divided into several bio-thematic areas that house animals from different regions of the world. Each area is themed for the particular region of the world they represent, although the older areas (such as the Primate, Cat & Aquatics Building) are less thematic than those that were constructed more recently. Upon entering, visitors arrive in the Welcome Plaza which features administrative buildings, an amphitheater, food court, and the Zoo's largest souvenir shop. Numerous smaller concession/souvenir stands are located throughout the park.\nAside from walking, Zoo patrons may opt to ride the two \"ZooTram\" lines which shuttle visitors between the Welcome Plaza (near African Elephant Crossing) and the Primate, Cat & Aquatics Building; and between the Welcome Plaza (near the food court) and the Northern Trek.\n\n\n=== The RainForest ===\nThe RainForest, opened in 1992, is one of the most popular exhibits at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. It is contained in a large, two-story building with over 2 acres (8,100 m2) of floor space, making it one of the largest indoor tropical environments in the world. The RainForest boasts more than 10,000 plants and over 600 animals from the tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The opening of the RainForest also introduced the Metroparks Zoo's first permanent reptile collection since the flooding in 1959.\n\nThe RainForest is housed in a large glass and granite building, just outside the main entrance to the Zoo. The structure is divided into an outer ring\u2014featuring an assortment of tropical plants, exhibits containing small mammals, a cafeteria, and a gift shop\u2014and an inner area that contains the principal animal exhibits. Animal habitats are located on both floors of the RainForest. The exhibits contained on the ground floor are collectively known as the \"Lower Forest\", and those on the second floor are known as the \"Upper Forest\".\n\nUpon entering the RainForest, visitors are immediately greeted by a cascading, 25-foot (7.6 m) waterfall and a large tropical garden that soars upwards two stories. The wall behind the waterfall resembles Ancient Mayan ruins. Within the wall are a series of exhibits featuring small, New World mammals such as Pied tamarins, Geoffroy's tamarins, Goeldi's marmosets, White fronted marmosets and endangered golden lion tamarins. The outer ring of the RainForest is also home to a wide variety of tropical plants including lancepods, balsam apples, tropical almonds, lipstick trees, numerous varieties of orchid, a kapok tree, and the rare titan arum (corpse flower). The central exhibit, called \"Tropical Rain Storm\", is a lifelike recreation of a rainforest island where simulated tropical rainfall occurs periodically. The island is inhabited by several Indian porcupines.\nThe major animal of the Rainforest is the Bornean orangutan, of which the zoo has four: male Tiram and females Kera Wak, Kayla, and Merah. Merah is the most recent Orangutan baby at the zoo, born in 2014 to Tiram and Kera Wak.Animals contained in the RainForest include: Straw colored fruit bats, Rodrigues flying foxes, giant anteaters, capybaras, scarlet ibis, prehensile-tailed porcupines, White faced whistling ducks, two-toed sloths, Asian water monitors, Ocelots, Clouded leopards, Ringed teals, green and black poison arrow frogs, macaws, Mouse deer, a reticulated python, green vine snakes, Roseate spoonbills,  batagur turtles, Asian small-clawed otters, Fran\u00e7ois' langurs, extremely rare fishing cats, and several gharials as well as invertebrates, amphibians, turtles, and a Dwarf crocodile\n\n\n=== African Savanna ===\nThe African Savanna area is located near the park entrance. Visitors can observe African lions, flamingos, giraffes, zebras, bontebok, a variety of African birds, black rhinos, Slender horned gazzels, and colobus monkeys. the African elephant crossing contains elephants and meerkats. On February 7, 2018, a baby rhino, named Lulu, was born to parents Forrest and Kibbibi. On August 20 of the same year, another baby rhino, named Nia, was born to parents Forrest and Inge.\n\nThe Sarah Allison Steffee Center for Zoological Medicine\nAs part of Cleveland Metroparks Zoo's focus on conservation, the Zoo constructed the Steffee Center for Zoological Medicine in September 2004. The center hosts medical, laboratory and surgical suites, in addition to a ward and quarantine area. Its veterinary hospital is equipped with the first CT scanner for use in a zoo hospital. Located in a nearby pavilion is the Reinberger Learning Lab, where Zoo patrons can learn about veterinary care at every stage of an animal's life. The Learning Lab offers interactive, hands-on educational displays as well as views into surgical suites where visitors may observe treatment procedures in progress.\nMonkey Island\nCompleted in 1934, Monkey Island is a large, concrete island surrounded by water. When the exhibit first opened, Monkey Island housed a staggering population of 150 monkeys that had been donated to the Zoo by the May Company. Afterwards, the Zoo has reduced the number of monkeys to seven in order to reflect the changing standards of zoo animal care. The island structure is littered with numerous tree trunks, ropes,fand and shelters for both recreation and exercise. The exhibit served as a home to a Klipspringer and colobus monkeys, but, in 2019, the monkeys were moved to a nearby exhibit and construction began on the site.\nAfrican Savanna and Ben Gogolick Giraffe Encounter\nConsisting of several large yards, the African Savanna features a variety of mammals and birds. The exhibit houses animals such as Masai giraffes, Grant's zebras, bonteboks, ostriches, grey crowned cranes, Slender horned gazzels as well as several species of African storks and geese. In 2015, the Ben Gogolick Giraffe Encounter was completed, and visitors are now able to purchase leaves to feed the giraffes.\n\nAfrican Elephant Crossing\nIn 2011, the Zoo opened its new elephant exhibit, African Elephant Crossing. At a total cost of $25 million, the state of the art habitat quadrupled the elephants' living space, allowing the zoo to increase its number of African elephants from three, to a herd of eight to ten. The exhibit features two large ranges\u2014the Savanna and the Mopani\u2014spread out over several acres. The ranges include deep ponds so that the elephants can swim, as well as expanded sleeping quarters. Areas of the ranges are also heated to maximize the elephants' habitat during the winter months. Periodically throughout the day, the elephants are shepherded across the pathway between the ranges, allowing visitors an up-close view of the animals. In addition to expanding the number of African elephants, the African Elephant Crossing exhibit introduced meerkats, naked mole rats, an African rock python and several species of birds.\n\n\n=== Australian Adventure ===\n \nThe Australian Adventure area is an 8-acre (3.2 ha) exhibit designed to resemble the Australian outback. It is home to wallaroos, kangaroos, Emu and wallabies that roam freely throughout Wallaby Walkabout. Zoo patrons can learn how sheep are sheared at Kookaburra Station, and experience up-close encounters with Southdown sheep, goats, Alpacas and other farm animals in the adjoining Contact Yard. The Australian Adventure is also home to a 55-foot (17 m) Yagga Tree, which contains animal exhibits and a snake slide for younger visitors. Due to Northeast Ohio's inclement winters, Australian Adventure is weather dependent in the colder months.\nGum Leaf Hideout\nLocated in Koala Junction, Gum Leaf Hideout is home to the zoo's collection of bettongs, koalas, Matschie's tree-kangaroos, and short-beaked echidnas. The exhibit also features interactive displays that teach visitors about the devastating effects of deforestation on Australian ecosystems.\nReinberger Homestead\nModeled after a traditional 19th-century sheep station, the Reinberger Homestead offers Zoo visitors a look into Australian home life. The area contains animatronics of a koala and Kookaburra, who speak about the culture. They often break down and do not work.\nWallaby Walkabout and Boomerang Railway\nDesigned to replicate the Australian outback, Wallaby Walkabout features winding paths that visitors share with kangaroos, wallabies, and wallaroos during the months of April through October. The landscape includes vegetation intended to be consumed by the animals. Families can also take a train ride through the exhibit. In July 2007, the Zoo fell under scrutiny from PETA after a one-year-old kangaroo was struck and killed by the exhibit's \"Boomerang Railway\" train. In response, the Zoo quickly dismissed the employee who was operating the train, and installed a fence along the tracks to prevent future injuries from happening.Yagga Tree\nThe artificial, 55 foot tall Baobab known as the Yagga Tree is the star of Australian Adventure. It contains exhibits for a prehensile-tailed skink, a cane toad, and a sugar glider, as well as another animatronic, this time a crocodile named Wooly Bill.\n\n\n=== Wilderness Trek ===\nThe Wilderness Trek area is home to cold climate animals such as Siberian tigers,  grizzly bears, Tufted deer, Reindeer, the endangered Persian onager, and Red crowned cranes which remain active outdoors year-round. The California sea lion/harbor seal exhibits feature large pools for visitors to observe the animals at play. The Metroparks Zoo also contains one of the largest collections of bear species in North America, including grizzly bears, Andean bears, Malayan sun bears, North American black bears, and sloth bears. On January 14, 2019 a female sloth bear named Shive gave birth to a female cub named Shala. Shala was the first sloth bear cub born at the zoo in 30 years\nWolf Wilderness\nWolf Wilderness gives visitors a comprehensive look into the environment and wildlife of a northern temperate forest. Wolf Lodge, which anchors the exhibit, serves as an education and viewing center for gray wolves, beavers, and a variety of wetland species. Wolf Wilderness is one of the principal North American habitats at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. The exhibit consists of the Wolf Lodge, a large woodland enclosure for the wolves, a 65,000-gallon pond, and panoramic viewing rooms.\n\nVisitors access the exhibit through the Wolf Lodge, a 3,000-square-foot (280 m2) building that is modeled after a 19th-century fur trading post. Upon entering, visitors arrive in the welcome center, which offers information on the indigenous animals of North America's deciduous forests and wetlands; this room leads into the two main exhibit areas.\nThe first exhibit room is dedicated to the six Mexican gray wolves contained in a vast, wooded area directly behind the Wolf Lodge. Zoo patrons are able to observe the wolves through a large viewing room with floor-to-ceiling windows, which look out into the habitat. Surveillance cameras within the enclosure are linked to monitors in the viewing room, allowing visitors to see the wolves even when they are out of direct view.\nThe viewing room leads into the second exhibit area\u2014the wetlands and wolf display room. Here, visitors can observe both the wolves and several other North American animals through floor-to-ceiling windows, similar to the viewing room. Although visitors can also view the wolves from this room, the principal exhibits are the Canadian beaver habitat, the 65,000-US-gallon (250,000 l; 54,000 imp gal) freshwater pond, and the Zoo's collection of bald eagles. The Canadian beaver habitat features an artificial beaver dam with cross-sectional windows that grant visitors a chance to view the beavers' nest within. The freshwater pond is adjacent to the viewing windows, thereby creating an aquarium effect that allows visitors to see what a wetland pond looks like beneath the water's surface. The pond contains numerous fish indigenous to the North American wetlands.\nRosebrough Tiger Passage\nOpened June 3, 2016, this exhibit features \"four separate, interconnected habitat areas for the [zoo's] Amur tigers to roam\", and includes \"two overhead elevated pathways\".Asian Highlands\nAsian Highlands opened June 12, 2018. This exhibit features expanded habitats for snow leopards, Amur leopards, and red pandas, and also includes takins. on April 22, 2018 three snow leopard cubs were born.\n\n\n=== Primate, Cat & Aquatics ===\n Opened originally as the Primate & Cat Building in 1975, the Primate, Cat & Aquatics Building houses one of the largest collections of primate species in North America, including western lowland gorillas, New World monkeys, aye-ayes, and several species of lemur. However, the building does not house the Zoo's entire primate population; numerous primate species can also be found in the RainForest. In 1985, the Cleveland Aquarium permanently closed and donated its collection of exotic fishes and invertebrates to the Metroparks Zoo. A section of the Primate & Cat building was renovated to accommodate the new Aquatics section, which currently features 35 salt- and freshwater exhibits include piranhas, a giant Pacific octopus, electric eels, fish and hundreds of living coral.The Primate, Cat & Aquatics Building has also featured outdoor exhibits such as the outdoor section of the gorilla exhibit and fossas. The zoo's slowest resident, the Aldabra giant tortoise, can be found in the enclosure directly across from its fastest resident, the cheetah. Several of the tortoises are over one-hundred years old.\n\n\n=== Waterfowl Lake ===\nThe marshy shallows of Waterfowl Lake are home to Chilean flamingos, Black swan, and Canvasback ducks , trumpeter swans. During the summer months, M\u00fcller's gibbons and lemurs populate the lake's islands, and use ropes suspended above the water to navigate between them. Visitors can observe predatory birds such as Andean condors and Steller's sea eagles in-flight within towering, outdoor flight cages on the lake's eastern shore. The nearby Public Greenhouse contains hundreds of tropical plant species in addition to a seasonal butterfly exhibit. Waterfowl Lake is also the site of Wade Hall, one of the oldest zoo buildings in North America. Today, the hall serves as a Victorian ice cream parlor for Pierre's Ice Cream Company.\n\n\n== Notability and Recognition ==\n\n\n=== Recognition ===\n\n\n==== Cleveland Metroparks Zoo Recognized Among Five \"Best\" Zoos in Ohio ====\nThe Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is one of five city zoos in Ohio. The 'Buckeye State' has been referred to as a \"Zoo State\", as only California rivals Ohio in the sheer number of options zoogoers have for visiting reputable zoos.\nA 2014 \"Top Ten\" ranking of the nation's zoos by USA Today (based on data provided by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums) recognized the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo for being nominated for the USA Today award. Three other Ohio zoos were nominated and won awards for the 'Best US Zoo' contest: the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and the Toledo Zoo.\n\n\n=== Notable Animals ===\n\n\n==== Timmy (Gorilla) ====\nArguably the most famous animal resident in the Cleveland Metropark Zoo's history, Timmy attained greater fame as a very prolific sire at the Bronx Zoo. Although, he was known as the \"dud stud\" at the Cleveland zoo, he proved to be quite virile after he arrived at the Bronx Zoo on loan. Timmy was managed indoors in human care for 25 years before being sent on breeding loan to the Wildlife Conservation Society's main campus and headquarters at the Bronx Zoo.\nThe move was highly controversial. The consideration of separating Timmy from his companion Kate, was met with much protest by animal rights activists and was the subject of a federal court case. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo Director Emeritus Steve H. Taylor cites the lawsuit surrounding the breeding loan as one of the most significant in the history of moderns zoos.However, Timmy went on to sire more than 13 offspring in New York, many of whom were conceived in the Bronx Zoo's state-of-the-art Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit, which opened after his arrival in New York City.\n\n\n==== Okpara ====\nSired by Timmy and born to Pattycake (gorilla) at the Bronx Zoo, Okpara returned to Cleveland before moving on to another facility.\n\n\n==== Blackie ====\nIn 2014, the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo's Nile Hippopotamus \"Blackie\", was euthanized at approximately 60 years of age. Blackie may have been the longest-lived male Nile hippopotamus ever recorded in human care in North America. As far as hippos go, he had a gentle demeanor and weighed approximately 3700 lbs.\n\n\n==== Aldabra Tortoises ====\nThe Zoo cares for three tortoises, including a pair of animals both exceeding 100 years of age.\n\n\n== Services and special events ==\n\n\n=== Education and outreach ===\nCleveland Metroparks Zoo hosts day and overnight camps for children ages 5 to 14 during the summer months. The Summer Day Camp program teaches children about conservation and encourages understanding of the natural world. Overnight opportunities include stays in the Australian Adventure's Reinberger Homestead; stays in the Wolf Lodge, where guests can use the same tracking technology utilized by field scientists; and the African-themed \"Rising Waters Safari Camp\". Campers at Rising Waters stay in the zoo's African Savanna for an authentic safari experience complete with animal encounters. Each overnight program combines elements of Australian, Native American and African culture with an overarching theme of conservation.Other educational opportunities include the Zoo's \"Keeper for a Day\" program, which is open to middle school, high school, and college students who are interested in a career working with animals. Similar to a job shadowing program, program participants spend a day working with animal professionals in the Zoo's Conservation Education Division. Participants are tasked with preparing meals, cleaning enclosures, conducting training exercises, and providing animals with enrichment items to stimulate them both mentally and physically.\n\n\n=== Conservation support ===\nThe zoo also offers numerous grant opportunities which fund research and conservation projects around the world. In 2011, the zoo and Zoological Society awarded grants to more than 90 field conservation projects and programs in 39 countries. Some of these projects include elephant conservation in southern Africa, studying gorilla ecology and behavior in central Africa, and anti-poaching initiatives for Asiatic freshwater turtles. Over the past ten years, the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has supported more than 600 conservation projects in nearly 100 countries. Current initiatives include \"Quarters for Conservation\" and spreading awareness of the burgeoning Palm Oil Crisis in Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nBoo at the Zoo\nCleveland Metroparks Zoo's annual fall event, \"Boo at the Zoo\", takes place in October. Visitors can observe the various cold weather animals that still roam outside, and are encouraged to wear costumes to the park. The Boo at the Zoo event is a safe Halloween option that offers animal shows, live performances, and other fall-related activities.\nDINOSAURS!\nDuring the summer months, the Zoo features prehistoric animals along the wooded path around Waterfowl Lake. Younger visitors have the opportunity to dig for \"fossils\" and learn about the field of paleontology. The 2007 and 2010 \"DINOSAURS!\" exhibits showcased dinosaurs from around the world: Tyrannosaurus rex, Stegosaurus, Triceratops, Pteranodon, Omeisaurus,  Dilophosaurus, Baryonyx, Iguanodon, Styracosaurus, Apatosaurus, Kentrosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Suchomimus and more. The 2013 \"DINOSAURS!\" exhibit featured 20 animatronic dinosaurs, including Quetzalcoatlus and Troodon.\n\n\n=== Rentals ===\nStillwater Place\nIn Spring 2015, the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo opened a new reception event center, Stillwater Place. Offering scenic views of nearby Waterfowl Lake and a capacity of up to 300 guests, Stillwater Place is open year-round and caters to many occasions, such as weddings, birthdays, reunions and more.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nIn 2015, Mitchelle Schwab was charged after allegedly dropping her 2-year-old son into a cheetah exhibit. His parents were finally able to retrieve him from the exhibit and was taken to MetroHealth Medical Center.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cleveland Metroparks Zoo at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website\nCleveland Metroparks Zoo entry at the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History",

          "This looks to be a decent zoo and would probably be better to visit later in the season. We came on a really nice day in early March and apparently everyone else had the same idea because it was packed. Not many of the animals we visible during our visit and the ones that were,",

          "I visited the zoo in October. I knew that this was a very large zoo and I did not want to waste my time trying to figure out where I was going. I stopped to ask a young woman how to get to the tiger area and she offered to walk me there. She told me that she was a volunteer",
          "Don\u2019t miss the Asian exhibit and Tiger Crossing! Great job on these exhibits. Avoid visiting on Mondays, as the zoo is free for residents that day and can get crowded.",
          "As a former docent at this zoo, I was disappointed in the animal availability, and when they were out, seeing the animals in their exhibits is becoming increasingly more difficult due to the \u201cnatural surroundings\u201d ie:tall grasses which make viewing locations few and fewer. Also",
          "I try to go to the Cleveland zoo at least annually as I now live 99 miles from it. As a born Clevelander, I have seen the transformation of the zoo to it's spectacular current state. As much as I hate animals being out of their natural habitat, humans are destroying too many",
          "I like to make it a point to visit as many zoos as possible. Cleveland Zoo was not standing out to me as a \"great\" zoo (compared to some of the others I had visited) until I saw their elephant section. I absolutely loved the up close viewing available where the elephants feed.",
          "The Cleveland Zoo is one of the best zoos in Ohio. The children love it. They have renovated it several years ago and it is fabulous. The wolf house is wonderful as is the elephant house and the rain forest. This is a place your children will be talking about for quite some time.",
          "My family has been to a lot of zoos - this is probably the best zoo we've ever been to. Huge, clean, well-kept, spacious habitats for the animals, plenty of playgrounds for children to play on, misting stations. The animals all seemed happy and well cared for. We spent over",

          "We went on a Thursday and we were there when they opened and stayed until right before they closed. It was not busy at all, we got to see all of the animals. We rode the train and both trams, and covered the entire zoo with a 1 and 2 year old. All zoo staff members were very",

          "This was our 3rd family trip to this zoo. It\u2019s always a good time! Tickets prices are very reasonable. $50 for 3 Adult tickets. However, I wish they had a rainy day policy where they issued tickets for another day or a discount for another visit. It started heavily raining",
          "Rainforest exhibit was definitely my favorite part of this zoo. Many animals on exhibit that we have not previously seen. Enjoyed the rest of the zoo also, relatively well layed out. The only disappointment was that the deck walk to the primate, cat and aquatic area was",

          "We had a terrific time at the zoo! We really liked the layout of the zoo and the frequency of the shuttles to take us around the zoo. The rain forest and primate areas were terrific. Our only disappointment was that because we went towards closing time, not as many animals",

          "Some parts of this zoo were remodeled and lovely. Others were sorely needed of repair. The aquarium for instance was dark and damp with a lot of water stains. The parking is free so that makes up a little for the admission. The cost is depending on how much you want to do at",

          "A very nice zoo with some unique animals. The wolf and Amur tiger exhibits were especially well done. The primate house was also impressive with a wide variety of lemurs, monkeys, and gorillas. There were no penguins, polar bears, or lions so as long as they are not the reason",

          "We loved our trip to the zoo. This is a must see when in Cleveland. We got to the zoo early so got great parking and missed the long lines that built up later in the am. Most all the animals were visible and active when we visited. Overall, the zoo was very clean and well",
          "On our annual visit to Cleveland, my family makes sure to go to the Zoo. We have gone at different times of the year and appreciate the Rainforest building on a wet spring day. We love the variety of animals and beautiful grounds.",
          "Very nice for families with children. The acquariums could be cleaner to a sealife -standard . there are nice paths and the near contact to the animals is middle- high.",
          "Whenever we visit a city, their zoo is always on our must-see-list. I didn't realize the beauty of Cleveland Metroparks Zoo until years later after we moved to a Cleveland suburb. The first time I laid my feet in the zoo, I knew I should have been there more often. The indoor",
          "Our experience at the zoo was very positive. Although it was April 3, some of the attractions/exhibits were not open yet. But, the day we visited was a nice sunny day - in the low 50s. There were not many people visiting that day, so we did not have any issues with crowds!",
          "If you would like to have some good family time. The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is one of them. I've been quite a bit because it is one of my favorite places in Cleveland. I personally enjoy it and the kids always have a good time. We have season passes. You can even enjoy it",
          "I really can not say enough about the Cleveland Zoo. We make a point of visiting zoos wherever we are. We've seen many zoos in the U.S., the Toronto Zoo, and zoos, aquariums and animal parks in several countries around the world. Without a doubt, the Cleveland Zoo is one of my",
          "We took our annual visit to the zoo on Noon Year's Eve and it was enjoyable as ever. We would highly recommend this event to all our family and friends. We love the zoo!",
          "I've been to zoos in over 20 different cities and Cleveland is one of the best. Lots of exhibits and variety of species. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they tore down the aviary. Even though it was an older building, I just loved being among the free flying",
          "Myself my daughter and my 1 year old grandson went today (sunday) We only wanted the rainforest tickets but we were charged for both the zoo and the rainforest. My grandson first visit it wasn't too busy. We enjoyed it",
          "Cleveland has a beautiful zoo. It was a really hot day when we were there so many of the animals were not out. Be prepared to do a lot of walking because it is really spread out. Too much for little ones and older ones to walk and see it all.",
          "Wonderful zoo in Cleveland Ohio ,expect to walk a little to the ticket booth ,because in the summer the parking lot can get packed ,you can always find parking,but it will be a ways.I love that the zoo has elephants and other bigger species,plan to spend a good 3 hours exploring",
          "I've been the 30-something zoos in this country big fan of zoos. This is a pretty average Zoo though the scenery is kind of unique in the layout definitely unique. Lot of walking involved but very nice exhibits especially the giraffes and a few others. They have all the major",
          "Beautiful display of lights around the zoo! Lights started on the walk from the parking lot. There was a path to follow to see all the lights throughout the zoo. Did not go around the entire zoo, but you saw most of the animal exhibits. Truly enjoyed. Went at dusk. Would have",
          "Having grown up going to the Columbus Zoo my whole life, I thought nothing could compare. Cleveland Zoo blew me away in a great way though! The exhibits were beautiful and thoroughly decorated. I loved the Wolf Lodge-all the details were amazing and it was great to be able to",
          "We visited the zoo during a weekend getaway, and had a wonderful time! It was a very cold day, but almost all of the exhibits had buildings we could go inside of to get warm and see plenty of animals. During the winter months it seems like many of the African Savanna animals",
          "Always a fun Halloween adventure! Great to see the displays and all the zoo animals in their habitats. Rain or shine,for big and small kids, a very memorable experience!",
          "We were here on a cold weekday in January. The Amur (Siberian) tigers, snow leopards, grizzly bears, and reindeer - all the cold weather animals were active. The Rainforest exhibit was warm and beautiful. Just bundle up.",
          "I've been a zoo member for several years now and LOVE taking Saturday trips. It isn't the largest zoo that's for sure, but it's well put together and always clean. If you're a fan of elephants or giraffes this is definitely the place to go. The new exibits for both allow you to",
          "This zoo is not only spacious but very well kept. The animals all seem content and at ease. Great chances to observe them.. The habitats are very clean and suited to the animals.",
          "A very nice zoo, with snow lepoards, Australian marsupials, African mammals and what not. The exhibits are placed on the basis of the geographic location. You can feed the giraffes!",
          "There is so much to see and even more to learn about. The collection of animals is outstanding and the exhibits are very well done. The grounds themself give you the feeling that you are in a special world.",
          "Took my grandkids to the zoo while they were here in town. Even though it was cold we had a great time. The cost was reasonable, and they even had Santa! When the kids wanted to get out of the cold we went to the Rain Forest and it had a lot of animals. some other great things",
          "The displays were awsome and amazingly crafted. My family had a blast. It was on October 3rd and I believe they offer it yearly. They also had the acrobats proform and it was 3 or 4 shows before dusk.",
          "We took our grandkids to the zoo in December. It was cold and there were not a lot of people which was great. All the animals were out and with only a few visitors they were attentive to the few people that visited. The wolf winderness and the elephant house were great warm",
          "This zoo is super nice. Very beautiful surroundings and shows a diversity of animals. It was free in Thanksgiving, and the shows were not running as normal, but we loved it.",
          "I take my grands year round. In cooler weather animals are more alive but a fantastic zoo to visit any time of year.",
          "It was a very cold Northern Ohio day when we went to the zoo and it was fantastic!. Some animals were outside and some were in, but we had every exhibit to ourselves! Just remember to dress warm. We saved the rainforest for last so we could have something warm to look forward",
          "We visited the zoo on a Thursday, early November. Being late in the season, most food stands were closed throughout the zoo, which didn't bother us. We ate in the Rain Forest upon our arrival. There was one person preparing the food and one running the register. I am not sure",
          "I loved visiting the zoo and seeing all the beautiful animals but the Elephants \ud83d\udc18 and Hippopotamus were by far my favorites",
          "I am a Cleveland resident so my view is that of a local but having traveled and visited zoos all over the world I can say without a doubt the Cleveland Zoo is an amazing find. Lots of activities and with the rain forest and festivals it is a great deal. The people who volunteer",
          "We were at Cleveland Zoo to attend the Asian Lantern festival. It is one of a kind. Never seen anything like this before. Some of the lantern specialists came all the way from China for this. And the show at the end was phenomenal.",
          "This is a very large - and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it on a bad weather day. However you can\u2019t bet it on a beautiful fall day! We went during the week in the later part of October- had it mostly to our selves. We paid for the train ride/ 4d movie. The train ride is a bust 2 minutes",
          "Went to the zoo for our granddaughters birthday. October is not a great time to go. There were very few animals out at all. They even said some animals were in for training. In my opinion if all the animals can\u2019t be out then the it should be 1/2 price admission.",
          "People of all ages will remember this zoo experience as elephants walk along side guests and tigers lounge above as their human visitors pass underneath. Guests will enjoy a full day wandering the flower laden grounds (in season) between recently renovated open air animal",
          "Truly a must see when in Cleveland! So many improvements have been made over the years, not only for for the visitors, but for the comfort of the animals as well! The Zoo is divided into several areas: Australian Adventure; African Savanna; Northern Wilderness Trek, The Primate,",
          "Boo at the Zoo is a premier family event. Kids love it , adults love it too. Metro Parks does such a great job at special events. Bring the whole family.",
          "The layout was very good. Walking easy. Paths clean lined with lots of wonderful trees. Animals tended to be in two but often turned their backs! Pair of barn owls we face on. The orange oranagan baby entertained us. She was in constant motion.",
          "The Cleveland Zoo is an enjoyable outing for the whole family. The tiger and snow leopard exhibits were a particular highlight. The zoo is quite large, so wear a comfortable pair of shoes.",
          "This is a great place for families, couples and single. We have a membership and go three to four times a year. They have a shuttle that take you to the primate area year round and have one to the Tiger and bear area part of the year. They have special event Asian Festival, Boo",
          "What a beautiful zoo, so well taken care of, friendly and welcoming, well presented and laid out. Informative and fun, but exhausting. There is a lot of walking to do if you want to see it all. Get up close with African elephants, giraffes, tiger, snow leopards, primates of",
          "We always have a good time at this Zoo! Its really big and there are so many different animals to see! The food places inside the Zoo are kinda pricey though!",
          "The Cleveland Zoo was very impressive. They keep the zoo clean. Also, Zoo keeps making improvements. There was many changes since the last time I was there.",
          "This zoo was very nice and big. It took us all day to go through and see everything. Most of the animal exhibits are amazing. Along with admission to the zoo, you get admission to the rain forest with is also incredible. Feeding area for the giraffes, so they come right up to",
          "Cleveland has a first-rate zoo to be proud of. Comparing to other cities of the same size, Cleveland's Metro Zoo is top-notch and a gem in the city's crown. Great job!",
          "As a resident of the Cleveland area for half my life I was so surprised to see the updates and improvements on my recent visit. My family visited on the Labor Day weekend and had an awesome time other than the 90 degree heat. I was very happy to have available the tram service",
          "The Metroparks Zoo is a lovely way to spend a nice afternoon. It is quite large so be prepared to do a lot of walking. For the most part the exhibits are well laid out and well maintained. however we were a bit disappointed in the primate exhibits especially the gorillas they",
          "Is a really cool 45 minute experience for $35. Way pricey. (1 adult, 1 child) The lanterns needed a good dusting. Cobwebs were hanging off most of them. Don't go expecting to see any animals. My 4yr. Old was so disappointed. It's just a loop to follow with everything else",
          "We\u2019ve been zoo members for going on 7 years now - and we always enjoy our visits. Our latest was for their special engagement with the Asian Lights Festival - and it was just outstanding. Even without that special event - the Cleveland Zoo is one of my favorite places in",
          "I Went there last year on winter, it's true you don't see outside the animals only those that can tolerate the climate. But you can see them from indoors, I still love it, they have trolleys that goes around the zoo, but you can still walk if you want. I didn't found it really",
          "My husband and I visited the zoo because it\u2019s boasted the largest collection of primates. While I admire seeing animals in their natural habitats it was hard at times to see even one of the species. There was very little staff on the facility to give directions. It was a lot",
          "I have been to the zoo with my family.. we have a great time.. a like this zoo because they have money animals.. you need 3 hour or 2 to see all zoo",
          "I didn't know what to exect... just a few lanterns in the trees. I was wrong and blown away with the visual effects. Go if you have kids, but go if you are adults. Just go. Make sure you see the show with the face changing, contortions and juggling.",
          "Visited the Lantern festival at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo and it exceeded my expectations. Always like going to the zoo with the grandkids, but of late have been having some back & hip issues and I have trouble walking for extended periods, and trouble walking up hills or",
          "I've been to my share of Zoo's and having this one in my back yard is great. When my kids were younger, we spent at least 1 weekend a month there between the zoo and the rain forest. Lots of \"extra\" perks if you are a zoo family member. Still enjoy going even if my kids are",
          "We love to visit the Cleveland Zoo! They had a ton of new exhibits to see and your old favorites are still there too!",
          "I had a great time at the zoo! I loved the giraffe encounter, so up close and personal! Loved the animals over all. A lot of walking, Free parking was a plus. Plenty of places to grab a bite. The train ride was a waste in my option to pay an extra fee for. The tram only made 1",
          "The only comparable zoo in size and scope that I have been to is the one in Pittsburgh, so much of my opinions come from that context. Compared to Pittsburgh, I would say this zoo is a step up. It has an impressive number of exhibits and an impressive number of animals. You",
          "Their website says to allow 3 1/2 hours to tour the zoo. We spent 5 1/2 hours!!! I didn't know what to expect but the zoo was a lot larger then I thought it would would be. The staff was very helpful whenever we had questions. I would highly recommend going to the Cleveland",
          "So as the title says, this zoo is INCREDIBLY underrated. I was expecting to be there for 2, maybe 3 hours tops... it took almost 5 full hours to get through the zoo. Furthermore, the exhibits were top notch. There is definitely a ton of walking, but for those who may not be able",
          "We love this zoo and visit all year round! Favorite exhibits are the elephants, tigers and seals. And the kids really enjoy feeding the giraffes and taking a camel ride.",
          "I recently visited the Zoo for two events: Twilight at the Zoo and the Asian Lantern Festival. Loved how they offered a unique opportunity to visit after dark. The new Asian Highlands exhibit is great! I especially love the Red Pandas. In the tiger exhibit, make sure to look up",
          "I went to the zoo last week, worst time to go...very hot & humid & loaded with lots of people on a week day. I wanted to draw certain animals....& did draw a few pictures, but not as much as I would have liked to because of the heat. The zoo has had a number of changes in",
          "Absolutely beautiful and overwhelming! Larger than life size lanterns! We spent a magical night walking around the zoo and observing the spectacular displays.",
          "My husband and I love to visit zoos as we travel. This was our first zoo trip without children, ours are grown so we were able to take our time. We went on a Saturday and it was packed. We had to park at the Wilderness Trek entrance. Thank goodness someone let us know that we",
          "I have loved the zoo since I was a kid. Now I have the chance to share the zoo with my kids. We had a wonderful visit. The elephant crossing was great. We saw the giraffes in close. Be sure to bring your walking shoes because the zoo is large and hilly. Will continue to visit",
          "First of all, it\u2019s free on Mondays for Cleveland residents... that\u2019s pretty cool except it was fairly busy that day. It\u2019s also pretty cheap if you are not from Cleveland like me. The elephants were awesome as they are African (we only have Asian in Tampa). They have fun",
          "The Most amazing place in the world to go and keep going back, also once a year they have a open late night with bands and food and everything as is a amazing time to go, wide collection of animals and they are always expanding",
          "Great day at the zoo, except with how hot it was, why were concession stands near the Asian highlands closed at 3 on a Sunday when its 91*?",
          "Lots to see and do! Loved the little train ride! The day was very hot but the workers kept all animals sheltered and with plenty of water.",
          "The zoo is dferinitely bigger than what it looks like. Wouldn't recommend going right when opens as they are still in the process of getting animals out unless you circle back around to see those that are inside and you missed. The park was very clean, prices are your normal",
          "We had a lot of fun with young children and elderly grandparents. Restrooms were clean and the Chinese Lantern Festival was going on and there were lanterns and beautiful decorations everywhere. We especially enjoyed the baby rhino.",
          "Monday is a free day at the zoo. So I went to find out only if you are a resident in Ohio. Staff was so sweet they gave me a discount. Grounds were impeccable. Decorated beautifully for future event.Wear comfortable shoes as very spacious.",
          "What a lovely zoo. We had a wonderful afternoon outing. There was something for everyone. The kids had playgrounds throughout the zoo that they could run and play on. A key experience where they are given a plastic key and there are key boxes located all around the zoo. Those",
          "I love going to zoos. This zoo is my favorite. It's huge, is beautiful and has a large variety of animals. My brother and I went, we spent about 6 hours walking through the zoo. We even fed a giraffe!",
          "A clean, pleasant zoo with great diversity of species. The aquarium and primates are at the top of a large hill, but the walkway is manageable and there is a shuttle for those who want it. It is a bit spread out, which is nice if you like to hike, but wear very comfortable",
          "We had an awesome day trip to the Zoo. Monday's are very busy, but it didnt seem overwhelming. I recommend the Giraffe feeding what a great attraction. All of the exhibits were clean and well kept.",
          "If my 8 year old grandson could live there he would. This place is phenomenal. Soooooo much to see and do. My grandson is a proud zoo parent. Twice over. This is a place to go to if you have time, lots of it. This can't be seen in one day. So many animals, We enjoyed talking to",
          "I was very disappointed that the walkways were so rough! Very difficult too push a veteran in a wheelchair around! Also the doorways are hard too get in and out of, there are large humps too try and get over. We also broke off the foot rest bar going over a dip near the",
          "The Cleveland Zoo continues to be a pleasant surprise, and holds surprises and adventure for all ages. They are constantly upgrading their exhibits to enhance your experience. You can view many of the animals in a natural habitat situation rather than in cages. The area is vast",
          "The Zoo in Cleveland has a lot of space to walk around. There are so many attractions that you have to get there right when they open in order to get it all in on one day. The Elephants are the best in my opinion. I also like riding the Tram. Waterfowl lake is an interesting",
          "I am a full time nanny and we visit the zoo weekly. We are all members and couldn\u2019t be happier with what the zoo offers. We love seeing all the animals and interacting with the trainers to learn more. They are always adding new attractions! Definitely a great place to visit in",
          "The primate habitat was sad. They did not have anything stimulating in their living areas except for a sack that the baby chimp was using. They were bored and not being challenged. One of them had what appeared to be an oozy area on its chest. The windows were not cleaned.",
          "The parking lot section zoned Handicapped was full we drove around a few times and found none i stopped near the back of the office with the parking lot behind it and called there to ask if they provide services with a golf cart one who takes you place to place if you need it",
          "To start with, it was less than $40 for two adults and one kid. Be prepared to do a lot of uphill walking. The map is pointless. You can ride the tram for free and it will drop you off at various places throughout. But the lines are long. The giraffe feeding station wouldn\u2019t be",
          "One of the best zoo out there. Lots of things to see. It has so many exhibits you will probably won't be able to see everything on a single visit. They have plenty of outdoor and indoor exhibits.The worst part is the hills are huge, so be prepared to hike, but that's why the zoo",
          "A fantastic zoo with a lot of great exhibits. A little hilly but plenty of shuttles. Take your time and spend the day.",
          "Best thing about going to the zoo on the 4th of July is small crowds. The worst is it was HOT. I have been to many zoo's and loved the one in Cleveland. The elephants are amazing and the giraffe encounter is the best. The train ride is short and I was sad for the gorillas",
          "They also have trolley/train to back.of park. Excellent food court, many activities for the young and old, even camel rides....great way to spend a day or afternoon. Animals are less active on hot days just like us adults Enjoy...Kids days and Touch a Truck.were super fun even",
          "The zoo and the Rain Forest are two different places for one entrance price. Visit the zoo and then go across the road to the Rain Forest exhibit. Both places show many animals. They are clean and easy to view. I'm not able to walk long distances and electric chairs are",
          "The zoo has a new Asian exhibit for the value leopards, who just had 4 babies in April, the red pandas and the new Takins. There will be after asian lantern festivities after hours between July 19 and August 19, you must buy tickets ahead of time. They are putting up all the",
          "This is an amazing zoo. It's the Disneyland of zoos, which may explain the stroller invasion today. Lions, tigers, and bears, and much more. How about a snow leopard and newborns; orangutan family; giraffes with baby; lorikeets; meerkats; and a rainforest. We spent 6 hours,",
          "We love the Cleveland Zoo, and the Rainforest exhibit is a must see for anyone who is in the area. The elephant exhibit is also wonderful. The shuttle service is very helpful in visiting the big cats and aquarium. Very nice zoo.",
          "Lots to see.Lots of bathroom and Food areas. Many exhibits were being moved to new Asia Highland so, didn't see everything.Very impressed with what I did see.I just wished, we were able to see some of the animals blocked by bushes and stones which is understandable, but children",
          "We had a blast at the zoo when we we6nt last year only thing that sucked was the back part by the reindeer was all blocked off for the new exhibit that was coming but still was a real great day the animals were very active hoping to make it back again this year",
          "We were a group of 6 adults and 2 small children and we had a great time when we went this past Sunday. The weather was beautiful, most all of the animals were out and even though there were a lot of people there, it never felt crowded. Feeding the giraffes was fun, the",
          "Cleveland zoo is better than you might expect for a city with the less than stellar reputation of Cleveland. It is not \u201cworld class\u201d but very nice and reasonably priced. It also has a very nice sister venue at the sam location, the Rain Forest. Well worth a visit, especially",
          "All the animal areas are pretty far apart... there is a team to assist people with bridging the gaps... food staff was not helpful at all... but everyone else was nice.. kids had a great time 1-17yo",
          "My husband and I took our 2 1/2 year old granddaughter for a short trip to the zoo. We were pleasantly surprised that we were allowed to enter using her parents' family pass. We didn't plan to stay more than a couple of hours, so there was a lot we did not see. While we",
          "This Zoo is very nice! We enjoyed seeing all the different animals. My favorite is always the leopards!! The Rhinos were so cool though! Very well kept place, but prepare to walk as there is a lot of ground to cover.",
          "We decided to visit this zoo since we were in Cleveland anyway. Zoo was awesome! We spent over 5 hours there. There was so much to see. Especially loved seeing the elephants and feeding the giraffes. Zoo was very well kept and clean. Had a great time!",
          "Always a hit for families with children. Take advantage of free Mondays! Rainforest exhibit is exciting.",
          "We love visiting the Cleveland zoo. We have been members for a few years, and it is well worth it. It is always clean and has a great variety of animals to check out. If you are a fan of zoos, this one is a must visit while in the Cleveland area.",
          "We used to bring our children here and decided we would visit by ourselves. What happened? Did they put all monies into a new exhibit...Asia...and forgot about the rest. The flower beds were full of weeds Monkey Island was non existint. Very few animals left. The greenhouse is",
          "The Cleveland Metropark Zoo is one of the nicest zoos I have been to. The zoo is spread across many acres of land and contains many walkways. The Rain Forest is included in the admission price. Pros: 1. Several newly updated sections of the zoo 2. Spacious animal",
          "We love going to different zoos whenever we travel, and were pretty impressed with this zoo! We liked the diversity of animals and how they were grouped, as well as the condition of their enclosures. The Asian Highlands area was closed. My only complaint is that some of the",
          "My husband and I are great lovers of Zoos and Aquariums that are well run, promote conservation and education, and are pleasant for visitors. We\u2019ve been to MANY! Kudos to the Cleveland Zoo! The park is beautiful and the enclosures for the animals are generous. There are many",
          "Clean and interesting. Lots to see and do in a very nice setting. The price was more than fair at 14.95 for adults.",
          "Took the grandkids to see the new Asian exhibit. It is beautiful. We only saw two of the animals but it was late afternoon. We went to the cat area and saw the new baby snow leopards. It was so fun to watch them play. They will be moved to the new exhibit in a few weeks. I was",
          "We always enjoy our trip to the zoo. We went on an overcast Sunday morning and enjoyed the zoo without the large crowds. Our little one really enjoyed feeding the giraffes and seeing the tigers.",
          "All the animals seemed happy and well cared for except the the wolves were pacing back and forth by their back fence. I think they need more room! The beaver exhibit was really cool We've never seen beavers swimming before! The zoo was very clean and seemed to have a lot of",
          "We enjoyed a walk for a cause recently. Was nice to get able to roam about the facility prior to opening to the public. The staff is always nice and friendly. Growing with each year we visit. -enjoy",
          "We visited in late March when it was a little cooler, so naturally a view of the exhibits were not on display due to the season, but we still had a fun time touring the grounds & experience the many wonderful animals & exhibits throughout the zoo. Definitely a must check out for",
          "Indoor rainforest and primate house and wonderful outdoor walk. It\u2019s so fun to see the new animals. Young giraffes and the new baby rhino, Lulu. No matter the weather, there\u2019s always something here to do.",
          "We have been to zoos of all sizes across Midwest and South and this one is below average in comparison. Displays were small and dated. Not a lot animals and layout was not very good. Looks like a lot of new displays in progress. Would not be interested in going back.",
          "We had a great visit and loved our visit to the Cleveland Zoo. There is a lot of walking and two areas with steep walking. Extra money for use of the tram which is unfortunate as the only option otherwise is steep climb which not all would be able to do. Very clean. Great option",
          "The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is a wonderful day out for 'kids' of all ages! Everything is easily traversed and with the 'train' you can even take those that can't do a lot of walking. The animal areas, and park-like setting are clean and attractive. And... most importantly the",
          "Loved visiting the Zoo so much! The giraffes were definitely a highlight for me. You were able to purchase lettuce leafs and feed them. \ud83e\udd92\u2764\ufe0f",
          "The Rainforest is fantastic. A must see. This is a walking zoo, but does offer trams. I find the zoo relaxing and a place to take your time to explore the exhibits.",
          "We stopped here again as we had been to the Rainforest a while back an didn't have time to walk the zoo. Well I know it was a little early in the spring so all the animals wouldn't be out but there were a lot of empty cages. We enjoyed the walk (as we were in the car for a while",
          "Overall a good zoo. It is pretty spread out so leave plenty of time for walking. The have plenty of food areas and a kids area too. Several new exhibits and a few on the way. If you are a Cuyahoga county resident check the site for a free day. It used to be Monday but I haven't",
          "I know most of you like to visit zoos in the summer, but it's great to walk the ground when its' cold out too. You don't have to deal with a lot of people and the animals seem to be more active.",
          "Like Goldilocks and the 3 Bears, this zoo is just right! Lots to see & do, great staff, nice landscaping & not too big or small. Great place to visit!",
          "We visited the Cleveland Metropark Zoo on a cool April day. We visited late in the day and the zoo was not very crowded. We enjoyed the Rain Forest, Outback Exhibit and several other exhibits. Unfortunately because of the time of year and/or the poor weather many of the exhibits",
          "This was our second visit to this zoo, and we love it even more. The rainforest is a beautiful, relaxing, and a great way to learn about how impotant they are to the environment. Our second favorite part of the zoo is the wilderness trek. Which has an amazing tiger exhibit where",
          "The Cleveland Zoo is a wonderful place to visit with young children or with children of varying ages. The exhibits are representative of animals from all over the world. There also is a carousel in the zoo that the children enjoy. Overall, a great experience for families",
          "Spent a lovely saturday morning at this zoo. Quiet lovely trails lots of animals not too crowded . One long walk up hill to primate cat area Definitely worth the trip a nice zoo",
          "Attended the Cleveland Metroparks zoo in June. Lots of free parking. Smooth easy access for admission. Easy to follow map systems for zoo layout. Nice selection of animals to view and see in their habitat. Zoo property is compact which makes for easy accessibility to",
          "OMG we had so much fun...not only did we enjoy the animals, but our friend had his birthday party there, too !~! how exciting to be in that beautiful environment and to celebrate a birthday at the same time. never thought of that before !",
          "Zoo was nice but many animals not available as it was cold. Needs some serious updating. Lots of the exhibits were needing a little TLC. Not bad for a city that has had its ups and downs for over 50 years. Nice personell. Only took about 5 hours to see whole zoo when i was",
          "We really enjoyed Boo at the Zoo. My husband and I met our son, daughter in law, and grandson and we had so much fun watching the kids. It was a great visit, and the weather was nice so we were able to see most of the animals. I am looking forward to returning when the",
          "I love the zoo. Nicest on a not so very hot day. Love the elephant walk. You can feed the giraffes and ride the camels. The carousel is also very nice. All different animals. Very pretty.",
          "This is a very large zoo perfect for a family visit or a date! Very well cared for, easy parking access, and you can have a picnic or lunch areas available. The park has something for everyone as you visit Australian Adventure; African Savanna; Wilderness Trek; The Primate,",
          "It is a beautiful place. It was very warm Feb day, off to the zoo. We paid too much for what was there. I get it- it's February the exhibits and animals were not available. I feel the price should have been more affordable considering lack of attractions.",
          "I love the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. There's a lot of nice exhibits to see. It is a lot of walking, but worth it.",
          "Everyone;s biggest complaint is that you have to walk so much to get around this zoo - but I think that's part of what makes it great, Also the Elephant walk is pretty amazing and the Giraffe encounter is pretty special. Lots to see,",
          "Great value, we are yearly members so if you go often pays to join the society, mondays are free for all people, lots of improvements over last several years, always a great place to spend the day and do alot of walking.",
          "We enjoyed the zoo trip. It\u2019s nearby to our house. The exhibits are animal friendly especially the wolf\u2019s exhibit. However, the zoos layout requires a lot of walking",
          "Who doesnt have fun at a zoo! Theres so many animals to look at. Theres a lot of walking but they do have a shuttle that takes you around the zoo but theres a wait. The carousel is a nice addition. Live the giraffes and elephants. I love how theres sections so even if you dont",
          "Cleveland Zoo is one of the best zoos ever. I have visited at least 20 zoos and Cleveland is My favorite. Have a membership and go almost weekly!! I see something new every visit. The rainforest is a plus",
          "In my opinions its one of the better family venues in the Cleveland area. Having said that its a great place of animal loving adults as well. It was a pioneer in the open viewing concept and having animals in there natural habitat as much as possible.",
          "The Cleveland Zoo is free on Monday to residents of Cuyahoga County. Don\u2019t miss feeding the lettuce leaves to the giraffes. They come right up to you which is a highlight of the visit. The Zoo is spread out and the tram rides are free..",

          "If you're looking for a nice morning or afternoon activity the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is perfect. Though you won't see the whole zoo, that's fine. You see enough to feel like you've enjoyed the animals, AND got a good walk in. It is hilly, so wear tennis shoes and plan on",
          "I took my grandchildren for a fun day! They had so much fun and that includes one that said he really didn't,t want to go. He has asked several now to back again. So many things to do. One of my favorite things was feeding the giraffes. The kids loved the slide and",
          "We had a really great family day at this attractive zoo. Educational write ups on all the animals and pleasant grounds and cafe.",
          "This is a really really nice city zoo! The grounds are well maintained with good landscaping and accessibility. The animals all look healthy and active with some really nice enclosures that provide great viewings as the animals interact with their surroundings and each other.",
          "We love this zoo so much we are annual members. The staff are great! I just wish they had more and updated things around the area. But all in all it is a great spot for families with kids of all ages!",
          "CLE zoo is worth visiting in the summer / fall / spring. Nice outside venue gets you close to natural and its animals.",
          "We took our kids here last week & they absolutely loved it! Especially the elephant exhibit. Something that was frustrating is that a lot of the vendors were closed (I guess because it's not peak season?) & it took us a long time to find something to eat. We wish they would",
          "Grew up less than a mile from the Cleveland Metropark Zoo, beautiful hidden gem... don't be put off by some of the surroundings. We often give a membership to new parents as a gift (Christmas, Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc.) Great for families!",
          "We went on that Saturday and it was packed. There was some sort of Girl Scout event going on, and it was very very crowded and busy. Most of food vendors were out of everything we had trouble even getting a drink and couldn't get anything to eat. I would suggest going during the",
          "We went for Girl Scout Day. It wasn't as expected; we had hoped to see more active animals/exhibits. They changed up things over the years there; but not better for us- mostly for the little kids. We hiked end to end and overall for a Zoo, there really wasn't very much to see",
          "Beautiful Zo, and very clean. The animals were taken care of, and the exhibits were very educational. The shops have great gifts and the animals were very active.",
          "This Zoo has great potential however the condition of the property and exhibits are not what they once were. We have been members for many years and left today quite disappointed. Many animal exhibits empty, grounds and monkey/aquatic exhibit in need of refresh. Food",
          "Cleveland is a great city. First time visitors and we have already met some wonderful people; we were greeted at the zoo's entrance by a couple who were season members of the zoo. They explained that they each could bring a person into the zoo for free. So we did not have to",
          "Great zoo limited wheel chairs limited handicapped parking not much good food mostly fast food and pizza And McDonald's the zoo is large nice safe much walking and great trolley bus to get around nice gift shop lots animals the rainforest cost more and. Nice kids love it great",
          "When I was marathon training, we'd come to the zoo and run up the hill to the Monkeys, Fish and Cheetahs and go down the back way to repeat the exercise eight more times. So, I saw quite a lot of the zoo. As I became more interested in photography, the zoo became a great place",
          "This zoo has a lot to offer. It really is worth several trips there to see everything. One might not expect to see such exotic creatures in the middle of Cleveland, but it contains more variety that most zoos that I have been to. The animals are mostly in wide spaces and the",
          "We get family passes each year. There are plenty of great activities for kids. The zoo is spread out with some hills, so there is a lot of walking, especially for small children. They could use more places to sit. There are many food and gift shops scattered around. Always",
          "This zoo is beautifully landscaped and is very spacious. The animals all had ample space and were very healthy looking. The walkways are very wide and make it easy for you to go where you want to go even if there are a lot of people there. Many of the exhibits were closed when",
          "This is our second year with buying a membership to the zoo and let me tell you 100% worth the money as it pays for it self the second time around. With all the improvement the zoo is doing this place is starting to look amazing. Highly recommend going here with the family. This",
          "Even though a few exhibits were closed, the zoo was big enough that my 4 year old and I still didn't see it all in a span of 5 hours. It is a decent sized park with plenty of ways to spend your time, and is a great way to waste away a day",
          "First time visit to the zoo while visiting family. It is huge, clean and very walkable. Many trails were in the shade and there were benches on which to rest. Granddaughter age 2 loved feeding the giraffes and watching the elephants. The tiger were almost too close for",
          "The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo succeeds in placing many animals in habitats similar to their natural environment, which lends the visitor the feel of really being out on the African Serengeti or savanna, etc. Lots of room for animals to roam. Pretty environment for visitors to",
          "I hike in the Metroparks often as I belong to the Cleveland Hiking Club.The park is always well maintained.The grass is cut, the trails clear, bathrooms maintained, our tax levies are at work!!",
          "My son and I went to the zoo and were very impressed with all the animals they were so active the bears were out walking around.tigers came right down by you.very clean and easy to get around.",
          "Animals are pretty close in the exhibits. Park is nicely shaded. Alot of the smaller food stations are not open this time of year They do have rental electric scooters(not wheelchairs) and without those my partner and I couldn't do a zoo. One of our scooters lost a screw on the",
          "the elephant exhibit was really cool. Daughter lover the camel ride. Both daughters enjoyed feeding the giraffes.",
          "The zoo area is quite vast, so a back up stroller would likely be of benefit for those travelling with small kids..The Zoo is well organized and a worthwhile attraction. Some exhibits were closed for renovations. It seemed that there were not an abundance of animals in some",
          "This is a charming zoo that is celebrating its 100th year. All the animals were there in a very nice setting. Good for all ages.",
          "This simply is one of the best zoos I've ever been to. The rainforest is breathe taking. You truly can let your heart go loose and spend all day in there. I've been going to the Cleveland zoo since I was young and I'll be going as I grow old.",
          "What a difference a year makes! The tiger exhibit which was under construction is complete and opened in 2016. An interesting way to view the tigers. A lot of little road signs and tidbits about the tigers as you walk. But if you only have limited time, the giraffe encounter",
          "An excellent place to appreciate wildlife conservation. Of particular interest is the elephant habitat - the very best methods of treating the elephants are practiced here. Staff extremely knowledgeable.",

          "Me wife, baby and I were only able to spend 2.5 hours at the zoo & we were not able to cover even half of the entire zoo! Budget 4-5 hours for your visit as there is lots to see and do. We're from Toronto & we have a great zoo in our city but the Cleveland Zoo definitely",
          "This zoo is always a good family day. So Much to see, always looks like they take well care of the animal's. We make this trip at least once a year.",
          "Amazing zoo and always keep up and clean. Very proud of this zoo with gift shops and many snack shacks. They also have Rainforest and for this type of dining, it is pretty good. I had a wonderful mother's day brunch and then we got to go to the zoo all day and it was so",
          "This zoo is very large and takes a couple hours to get through. Most animals appeared to have nice enclosures and had an adequate amount of stimulation. However, the area with the bears was disappointing. There was no water in sight and only 1 ball for them to play with. In the",
          "TheCleveland Zoo is so much fun the children didn't want to leave and return home. I will have to bring them back for another visit, since we didn't have an opportunity to see everything the zoo has to offer. It's beautiful in all locations and the favorite part was feeding",
          "So I have not been to a ton of zoos, but I would definitely describe myself as someone who enjoys them greatly. Here is a list of the good and bad about Cleveland Zoo: Good: -Habitats were well done for some exhibits, specifically the giraffes, kangaroos, and elephants, who",
          "Large park so be prepared for lots of walking. They do have a tram to take you to some far out spots. Some concession stands close down before closing time. Can do this and the Aquarium on same day.",
          "We had a great time at the zoo. We spent three hours but could have spent a lot more time if we had it. The exhibits were clean and the animals seemed healthy and were out and about. The zoo is large and there is a lot of walking. The rainforest is wonderful as is the tiger and",
          "Had a wonderful time at the zoo. The tiger exhibit was incredible! The park was clean, the people were helpful. Enjoyed the day!",
          "the zoo is layed out over a huge plat of land.take your favorite walking shoes or the shuttle as a great deal of the park is located up a long hill.if you have a mobility scooter,don't go up the hill with it as it is a battery killer. the shuttle is equipted to haul it as well",
          "Great zoo. Tram available to eliminate the need to walk up and down the hills. Knowledgeable employees at the popular exhibits to explain things and answer questions. Animals had areas larger than most zoos have. Wolves had such a huge area that we saw them, then they",
          "The Cleveland Zoo was excellent. We were members from our local zoo which gave us a 50% discount. The parking was free. It is best to go on a cloudy day because the animals were more active. I recommend the tram ride because there are a lot of hills. Take the free tram ride",
          "I love Zoos, especially the Cleveland Zoo & Rainforest. It was our favorite place to visit from when I was a child. I still have the original green \"Zoo Key\" from when my children were small and is identical to the new red key we got for my grandchild. There have been many",
          "Took my children to the zoo I grew up visiting. I absolutely loved that parking is free. Also loved that my home zoo is in the reciprocity program and allowed me 1/2 off admission for up to 4 people. The exhibits were spread out nicely. Very hot day so some of rhe animals",
          "The Cleveland zoo is fun for all ages. A variety of animals. Go early to see some of the animals that are active then. Going around 11 most of the bears and wolves are napping. The tiger exhibit is neat to walk through.",
          "Every few years it's a must-see at the zoo They are always adding attractions and it's so fun to walk around the animals were great I specially love the giraffes that was my favorite part!",
          "Enjoyed our recent day at the Zoo here. Planned to spend 3-4 hours but stayed for 5 hours to see everything and take plenty of photos. You will need to check your map so you don't miss anything. Lots of walking but it was a pleasant day for it. Train ride was nice. So happy they",
          "I recently visited here with my 3 year old son, my aunt whom we were visiting, and my husband. We all had a really good time! There are trams and kiddie trains, A beautiful, unique Carousel, and a natural playground/play-space for the kids all in addition to some cool animal",
          "This is a pretty good zoo. We came in at 8:30 for the Andean Bears & Coffee educational event. As we walked from the education buolding to the Wolf Lodge, we got to see a few animals who were enjoying the brief cool morning, but who's be hiding from the hot sun later. At the",

          "The exhibits are really nice. The elephant crossing was cool. My wife got one thing off her bucket list, riding a camel. Giraffes and ostrich exhibit is very interesting. Food options are great. The only problem with the park, it's way too spaced out. Some exhibits are a long",
          "First, if you have a keybank debit card, if you show them you get BOGO on certain days... I'm not sure if it's during a certain time frame or always since Key is a big part of the zoo, but call and find out because it saves $$! So, once you get to the zoo, there are animals",
          "Be prepared to take make round about ways, especially if you're using a stroller. The map is also vague and the signs aren't that clear. Australia has nice places to interact with the animals though. I will highly suggest paying the extra money for the rainforest entrance.",

          "Today, we decided to go to Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. It is the best zoo I have ever seen. Since today was a Monday, we got in for free. We started out in the welcome plaza, where we got lunch, I got McDonald's and my mom and sister got Pizza Hut. The McDonald's leaves out free",
          "Just every area has something to offer. The tiger display is amazing. Also the camel rides and the tram to take you to different area. Home run",
          "I love visiting the animals and we went there on Running with the Missions group. I love that this was included in the price of admission. Animals are my passion!!!",
          "We went to the zoo with my 2, 5, and 13 year old and we all had a great time. We paid a little extra for the full experience and the kids loved the key banks, 4D movie and carousel.",
          "I always have a great time with everyone at the zoo. It is very clean and well kept in common areas. The animals are clearly the priority and that makes this zoo all the better! I love seeing animals from pregnancy, birth, adolescence through maturity.",
          "The zoo is always improving and has a great selection of animals and very clean. The elephant exhibit is amazing",
          "Kids love this place. And don't miss the rain forest. It's set in a river ravine, so the landscape is interesting and varied. Lots of good reserves for healthy animals. Great park",
          "Yes, Ohio seems to have its fair share of really good zoos and if you are so inclined, the second oldest zoo in the USA is in Cincinatti and of course Columbus is one of the best zoos in the country, but all in all, I would have to say that my experience at the Cleveland Zoo was",
          "We had a great time at the zoo today. It wasn't overly crowded and was beautiful out. I think most of the animals were out and available to see. The only negative part is that we thought feeding the giraffe and a couple other options were part of the price we paid for and it",
          "I always get a yearly membership for the Cleveland zoo which we can also use in Columbus and other zoos in Ohio. it helps fund and feed the animals and my children enjoy it every year! the rain forest is fantastic and it gives us a reason to go up to Cleveland and visit Lake",
          "Not only was more than half the zoo's animals unavailable (without notice online) but the signs around the zoo (or lack thereof) were terrible, accounted for a lot of doubling back and walking twice as much, alas, in vain, to hit another sorry area closed ! Skip it, go to the",
          "We love zoo's and happen to members of the nc aquarium society so we were able to get 50% our tickets here, so that was a bonus. Lots of animals to see. You can feed the giraffes. Little bit of variety of different places that the animals are from. They also have a rainforest",
          "I feel this is the best zoo in the USA. Memberships are very reasonable. I'm able to go as often as I want. Membershipso include Rain Forest admission. Going you the Rain Forest is great on a cold dreary winter day",
          "we had a great time! i heard the elephant area was improved and it was great! we saw all the animals. but you have to do a lot of walking. a lot. exhibits are not all together. a lot of walking. but the animals were great!!!!",

          "I have been to many zoos all over the country and CLE zoo still remains one of my favorite. It's so big and had so many animals to see. Most of the exhibits have been modernized to be more habitat like. I really think that this zoo could be in the top 10 in the country.",
          "A lot of animals to see, and some interesting exhibits, such as the rain forest, and the 4D film. We went for the highest price ticket because we were told it offered unlimited rides on the trolley and unlimited entrance to all the films, whereas the next cheaper one only gave",
          "I love to visit when I come into town. I feel good about the animals they are not all locked up in cages.We got to feed the giraffes Lettuce.Great place for families and adults to come.",
          "Zoo is one of the main attraction of Cleveland city. Various types of animals of different continent are there in the zoo. Tram is being operated in both sides for short distance. Wild animals (lion,tiger, bear etc), birds and other kinds of animals are there in the zoo. African",
          "I am from Baltimore, and I think this is the closest zoo that has a mandrill. I was delighted that they had 3 mandrills. Their primate house is lovely and has many species. Thankfully they have a train to take you up and back because it was very hot that day.",
          "Visited yesterday with my adult children and grandchildren. There is a lot of walking of course but you can take a break and ride the tram. There are 2 different locations for the tram to attractions near the back of the zoo and at the top of a hill. The exhibits were really",
          "This zoo is well laid-out, with a nice mix of shaded areas to get some relief from the heat. They also have a \"mist stand\" for folks to cool off. It is very clean and the staff is so friendly. Loved the volunteers who had carts set up with the animal skulls, hooves, etc., to",
          "We always find something different when we walk around the Cleveland metropolitan zoo. The. Meerkats and elephants are always a delight to observe. The kangaroos are fun to watch. This time the dingos were really active in the Australian outback area.",
          "We go every year and there always seems to be something new to see. The kids absolutely love it. The only disappointing this about this time is the tree was not open the first week of spring so we will be going back later this year the kids love it.",
          "My wife and I took our 2 kids (under 3 yrs old) and we all loved it. I highly recommend it. The giraffe area is amazing. Only issue was it was a little difficult to navigate around. There were not enough signs within the zoo to help guide you. But overall, a great afternoon!",
          "Huge speakers were blaring very close to animal enclosures, such as the elephants - NOT GOOD. The animals' well-being and peace should always come first - not parties or consumerism.",
          "We visited the zoo with a 1 and 3 year old. They seemed to enjoy it. My hubby and I thought it was very spread out with a lot of back tracking. The map they give you was not helpful at all. It was very vague and hard to tell exactly where you were or where you were going. We",
          "Finally decided to do a review of the zoo in Cleveland. My family has been going to this zoo several times a year, and its always a great time. The zoo is actually decently large for being in Cleveland. There is a large variety of animals, both indoor and out. The zoo also has",
          "The Metroparks Zoo is fabulous. They have really done a good job with upgrading and expanding many of the habitats and exhibits for the animals, and the keepers and staff are always willing to answer any and all questions. Lots of activities and special in-zoo events for kids,",
          "The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is a great place to visit for people of all ages and it is easy to get around even though it covers a fairly large area. I especially like the Australian kangaroo exhibit.",
          "We have a family membership and visit frequently. The rainforest exhibit is wonderful and makes a great rainy day afternoon activity all by itself - all indoors and heated. The exhibits are fairly spaced out, especially the hike to the \"Northern Trek\" area and the uphill climb",
          "We love the zoo. We have the benefit of seeing everything from elephants to hippos to even animals found in the Australian outback.",
          "Love this zoo. It is very clean and has a lot to see. Definitely plan on spending the day. Lots of walking cause it is quite spread out. Went with my daughter and friends and they had so much fun. Can't wait to go back.",

          "We were lucky to get there right at 10 and found great FREE parking and enjoyed the rainforest first. The first level had snakes and spiders but the second floor had other nice animals. The warm humid building would have been nicer on a cooler day. The elephants were wonderful,",
          "A lot of good healthy walking to see some great exhibits of animals, reptiles and birds. I think my favorite were the giraffes. They are so beautiful and you can feed them Romaine!",
          "While in town we decided to stop at the zoo. Weather was perfect. Zoo was neat & clean. Had lunch at the onsite McDonalds other eateries were not open this early in the season. We saw tigers napping in the sun, wolves, rhinos, elephants, beavers, birds of all sorts & the bears.",
          "They brought back zoo keys!!!!! A little magical key shaped like an elephant that instantly provides information about the animal exhibit you are viewing. So many different animals that all look healthy and well cared for. The zoo seems very committed to conservancy. Great",
          "We have visited many zoos throughout the years and know from experience that the Cleveland Zoo is one of the best.",

          "We have been to many zoo's but this one had very small areas for the animals. The outside enclosure seemed small for many of the active animals and the aquarium fish and mammals did not have enough space to swim or around. Not many staff around even to ask about anything.",

          "The zoo is laid out over a large area. This is wonderful as many of the animals have very large enclosures. However, it also means you should be prepared for a lot of walking. They do offer some free trams to several of the areas. The zoo itself is quite impressive. They",

          "I haven't been there in years. It was great. We got there late and didn't get to see everything but we will return.",
          "We went to the light show and were so impressed!  But silly us went to early that we had to walk through twice. \ud83d\ude00great exercise, great zoo.",
          "Very fun time. Will definitely go back. The entire zoo is very walkable, and the exhibits, and animals therein are just wonderful. \n\nStaff is incredibly kind and welcoming. Would absolutely recommend.",
          "Absolutely amazing the transformation this zoo has made over the years! Incredible new exhibits, increased space for the animals, and even making the enclosures more stimulating/entertaining for guests and the animals alike!",
          "A good zoo overall.  There are a good variety of animals to see, and exhibits are generally well designed.  One problem is that the zoo is super crowded in warm weather, and everything is shut down in the cold season.  Another issue is that the layout feels sprawling and unfocused. Overall a good zoo, but not quite top tier.",
          "I've been a member for years.  You can also thank my wife for getting them to charge extra for memberships to have the total experience package.  My kids always want to do that stuff and we hated that it couldn't just be included with a \u2026",
          "This place is beautiful.The zoo is set up in sections ( African Savannah,Northern Trek, Australia...) The elephant exhibit has a walkway that the elephant cross thru at specific times during the day. There are spots where you can get pretty \u2026",

          "Maybe not the best zoo in america, but it is a wonderful place to spend the day.",
          "Went to the zoo lights this weekend. Very nice! Especially enjoyed the waterfowl lake display set to music. Elephants were active inside their building. Seals, tiger and a leopard were out and active. $10 for a craft beer. $4.75 for a hot \u2026",
          "A fun place to visit, bring the family.  It's a great zoo and it's right here in Cleveland.  Go visit the place.",
          "Fun and educational! The kids loved it. Lots of animals off exhibit however",
          "Awesome experience, went for zoo lights the other night. Even though it was busy, the place is large enough and has a good flow, such that everything moves along and you don\u2019t feel as packed. The new rhino exhibit should be complete spring \u2026",
          "A awesome family place, lots to see but don\u2019t have to walk miles. Lots of hands on learning exhibits for the kids, and adults too! The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Parking is free and you can bring in your food for a picnic at any of the many eating areas. We always really enjoy this zoo!",
          "What a great place!  The care of the animals and exhibits is paramount for the staff.  In addition,  the staff is willing to share their knowledge with visitors.",
          "Had an absolutely wonderful experience at the zoo, getting access to nearly all exhibits for about $15. I also really loved that all enclosures looked very well put together and spacious- more than any zoo I've been to.",
          "I enjoyed myself with my family.... We had our picnic, our snacks for the go, enjoyed looking at the Lord's creation of animals. Now the zoo shop was high and nothing I really wanted but to each their own. I was looking for those pretty rocks but they didn't have it that day\u2639\ufe0f I still enjoyed the zoo.",
          "Wild lights was a nice experience.  A decent mixture of animals and light features.  Free parking and not terribly crowded for the weekend before Christmas.",
          "I've been a season pass holder for many years and love bringing my family here.   If you visit at least 3 times a year Get the season pass, it will save you money starting on the third visit.",
          "One of the nicest zoos I've seen, plenty of educational fun for the entire family, I recommend spending a day with the family here, you will be glad you did.",
          "A very good experience, even in winter. I wish I would have gotten the name of the woman who was working in the primate building Saturday 12/20. She was excellent at answering questions and explaining things to us. A+",
          "We went for a function at Stillwater (which was outstanding!) then walked the zoo and checked out the lights. It's always so clean and well kept. Truly a hidden jewel in Cleveland.",
          "Family and kid oriented to the max.  Lots of vendors and lights and music to keep it fascinating for little ones and elders as well.  Reccomend as a family tradition. Make sure you take time for the carousel ride. A treat for all ages.",
          "Went to the Annual Boo At The Zoo. It was a awesome time! So many fun things to do with your kids. Only down side is that it tends to get over crowded. But our Zoo is the best! I recommend you see the cute giraffes\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Always a cool animal doing something different!",
          "surprisingly good zoo. Last time I went was 10+ years ago and after going to many other zoos, this one is near the top of the list.  Got to see some big elephants and tall giraffes! the zookeepers were amazing and very happy to answer questions about the animals and their jobs.",
          "It was a perfect day cool but not wet. Not crowded and all animals were visible inside or out.  Highly recommend experiencing it in person to anyone who hasn't gone.",
          "It is our mission to visit a zoo in every vacation spot we go, and therefore...\nThis was a fabulous zoo with many exhibits and animals!  We spent to entire day here and probably could have stayed longer!\nVery clean zoo and large exhibit areas are just a couple reasons this is a must see zoo!",
          "Wild Zoo Lights was lovely! Being able to see the animals at night under great lighting displays was magical. Great job!",
          "Fantastic zoo dedicated to conservation and education.  Excellent partner to the community.  Lots of opportunities to get involved.",
          "Beautiful Zoo, you can spend lovely day with family there. I like Cleveland zoo its clean and organized",
          "Very fun zoo. I enjoy coming here, but some of the exhibits are so far away from each other that it's hard to make the trek with kids.",
          "As long as you're a Cleveland resident with valid ID Mondays are always free as long as it's not a holiday",
          "Asian lights was awesome. Great night. Crowd was happy and pleasant. So many people there. Lights were beautiful. Saw Tigers, Snow leopards, Elephants and other wonderful animals. Will definitely go again.",
          "Have a big outdoor zoo and a nice little rainforest area for days that it's too cold or janky to walk outside. Well maintained exhibits, good variety, animals appear to be treated well.",
          "I love this zoo! I bring my two young children on a regular basis. The zoo is committed to sustainability, conservation, and education. My children learn something new about an animal and how to protect the environment at every visit. A \u2026",
          "There was FREE admission on Thanksgiving. Very nice OUTDOOR exhibits for the winter. Bundle up tightly and wear good walking shoes. You can warm up by visiting the rainforest.",

          "Very clean and well designed park. We visited for Winter Wonderlights and enjoyed everything about it.\nThe carousel was great for the kids - all different animals.",
          "Nice exercise.  Love all the new projects and upgrades \ud83d\ude0a  The lions were surprisingly active and loud at this time of year .(February)",
          "It a great place to bring your family too on a weekend to enjoy watching the animals and spend time with them at.",
          "We spent a few hours at the Rain Forest, it was great! We will return in spring/summer to see the rest of the zoo!",
          "I love the zoo, I go a few times a year. The wolves and tigers and cheetahs are my favorite. It's a great environment to learn about wildlife.",
          "It's a pretty good zoo. I'm from Toledo so there's no comparison really. But you can get closer to some of the animals and the elephant crossing is pretty neat.  It was a long walk between areas so be sure to use a stroller if you have little ones. Parking is free so that's a plus.",
          "A great zoo! Seems as though the have managed to build it so you are always going up hill making it important to wear comfy shoes. Exhibits are worth the hike. Highly recommend the full experience",
          "Great zoo, needs more space for handicap access on trams though. Scooters are asked nicely to drive themselves (and actually beat the tram to the destination,) and separate from their families to allow mothers and strollers access to the \u2026",
          "The penguin was delicious!! 10/10 would eat here again.\nOn the down side it was exceedingly difficult, though possible, to pet the gorillas. What a thrill!!",
          "I loved this zoo. There's a lot of walking involved if you want to see the ehole zoo... Or you can take one of the trams. The zoo is beautiful and has a nice collection. It was interesting to see how they care for the animals during the winter. Make sure you visit the Asian Highlands with the red pandas and leopards.",
          "My wife and I visited the zoo to see the Asian Lanterns exhibit that spanned the park. As the sun started going down, the exhibits began to really pop.  This was an amazing walk through the park! I was able to get some really cool pics. I \u2026",
          "This is my favorite zoo. This zoo allows the guests to see the animals up close. This gives me the opportunity to teach my children about each one. They can see them and learn to love them. This is important so they will grow up to protect \u2026",
          "We were there for the Wild Winter Lights. Very cool! Lots of lights all over the place! My boys and I really enjoyed it. Didn't see many animals though but that wasn't what we were there for. Will be returning next summer to see the animals.",
          "Love the zoo! What a great place to visit in Cleveland and an easy way to tire out the kiddos.",

          "The zoo is really nice to walk around.  A great place to go with the kids for a few hours.  We went with the family membership pass to ensure that we can explore a part of the zoo on each visit, as it's a lot to walk through in one day. \u2026",
          "Most attractions are closed due to COVID-19 couldn't see some animals, petting closed etc.",
          "We went during the Asian Lantern festival and we had a great time! Awesome food awesome lights and some of the animals were still out. We got to see tigers leopards elephants rhinos and flamingos (they were in there heated room next to the \u2026",
          "Rain Forest is awesome. Zoo was great. Would love to see the lights at night",
          "Amazing zoo, always changing things up and worth revisiting. There's always so many things to see and do and the seasonal features are always great fun. It's a very affordable place to go and there's tiers too if you want to do more than \u2026",
          "Had a great family day today",
          "Great place to spend the day, and get your steps in too! Lots of new displays and attractions. Always special events that appeal to different interests. Lots of educational information packed into the exhibits. It is a fairly spread out \u2026",
          "Cle Met Zoo is one of the best zoos in the country and we\u2019ve visited zoos all over.",
          "That rainforest is a great way to spend an afternoon or all day, especially on a gloomy Cleveland day. It's like traveling to another country without the jet lag or a passport.",
          "Our favorite zoo. Lots of new enclosures. Live the tiger display.\nThe power went out today and some exhibits had to temporarily close for a few hours. The staff was walking all over and trying to help tell people what was still open and where to get water.",
          "The Cleveland Metropark Zoo is a wonderful facility and a true asset to Northeast Ohio. I have many fond memories of going annually as a child and have enjoyed witnessing it's growth and improvements in animal habitats.\nThat said, the Wild \u2026",
          "Great time with kids at the zoo. It always peaceful and the animals are up close. Very good for little ones",
          "A large zoo, lots of ground to cover. The exhibits are impressive and represent the animal's natural habitat. It may be difficult to traverse with small kids without a stroller or wagon. Lots of food options, parents will love that there is even a beer garden! I enjoyed my time there ~3.5hrs",
          "A lot of animals, and a lot of room to explore. There are open areas for certain animals (flamingos and non dangerous stuff) and then there are huge enclosed exhibits for the more dangerous animals. The animals have a lot of free room and \u2026",
          "Love this zoo! You gotta go there in the holiday time to see the pretty lights!",
          "What a great place to visit. We went to see the hippos. Baby Fiona is so cute.  But we enjoyed the entire zoo. Lots of animals, lots of shade and benches to sit upon. Most importantly,  so many smiling faces.",
          "Lights were really quite beautiful even on a very chilly night. Would love to go back again and see them in the snow.",
          "the lights were beautiful we had a great time and they had lots to do for the kids. The carousel was free and they had great snacks",
          "We love are local Cleveland Zoo.  With actives for all ages and events going on all year.  Always a great decision to go to the zoo and not to expensive.",
          "Stillwater Place at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo was the absolute best venue for our wedding! We were well taken care of there by the staff and everything turned out beautifully! We rented the carousel and had the small animal encounters during \u2026",
          "Ive never seen so many tattooed miserable looking mothers in one place that was a  Spectacle all on it's own.... but besides that It's just a super great place with so many amazing animals it's been awhile since I've been there so to see \u2026",
          "Love our zoo but it needs some updates on habitats. ie gorilla, lions, rhino",
          "Beautiful animals and helpful personnel. The snake slide is extremely fun for all ages!",
          "Great zoo. Definitely get your steps in when you go there\ud83d\ude03!",
          "The rainforest was a good place to spend a few hours on a chilly Saturday. The animals were pretty active. Not to busy.",
          "Great place to take children. Also fun place to visit with people who are from out of towm that enjoy zoos. Lots of animals and zoo is free for Cleveland residents on Mondays.",
          "I love everything about this zoo. There is quite a bit of walking but it is fun for adults and kids alike. Plan for it taking all day if you want to see everything. Also the food is extra pricey, but you can always pack a lunch.",
          "Couldn\u2019t say anything bad about this zoo. I\u2019ve spent years as a kid coming here for field trips to growing up and working here selling tickets experiencing the zoo from a different perspective back to being a typical patron with a \u2026",
          "Fantastic place, my wife and almost 3 year old love it! Family membership plan is a great value as well!",
          "Exceptional zoo! The layout and facilities are excellent with the visitor being very close to the animal being watched. Having five elephants is very special because there are none in the entire state of Illinois. A great place to spend a day!",
          "Very nice. Family friendly. My Kids love it",
          "This so was a world class zoo back in it's hay day. It really is depressing to see how far it has fallen into disarray. They still have a lot of as animals and exhibits, but things are becoming run down some exhibits are closed, the rainforest which used to be a key feature is deplorable and a joke.",
          "We had a really great experience. There is a lot of walking and the animals are spread out but it is great that they have a lot of space. They have a tram to go up the hill. It was beautiful.",
          "BOTTOM LINE : a great day for the family, so much to do that it usually takes multiple trips!\n\nPRO : the rain forest is great year-round (83F in the winter, yes please!), elephants are a lot of fun, and the new tiger exhibit is really nice. \u2026",
          "Great for out of towners and locals alike! They are constantly improving and developing new areas for both the guests and the safety and enjoyment of the animals.",
          "Kinda disappointed that they limit some of the exhibits to certain times but, I understand that they have the animals best interests in mind when they do it. Still a pleasant experience. Worth a trip from Akron.",
          "This is my all-time favorite place to take my kids when we want to get away from working, and school. I took my kids to the zoo for the first time last year and I've never seen their faces light up when they saw an elephant for the first \u2026",
          "Love it! It was a perfect, beautiful Sunday! It wasn't crazy busy, got a parking spot in the first parking lot. Was able to feed the giraffes without everyone fighting for a spot. Most of the animals were awake and playing! The seals, \u2026",
          "I've been going there since I was a little kid 50 years old I used to ride my dirt bike down there when I was a kid 15 years old I used to meet my friends down there I am 57 now it's better than the couch",
          "It was nice to see how things were different compared to how I am used to them back home in Brookfield and Lincoln Park. I liked that parking was free and I loved the Australia exhibit. I wish I could have seen the lanterns all lit up but \u2026",
          "Love Cleveland zoo. Changes, yes..do I like them all, no. But still enjoy our zoo.\nGot to watch elephant crossing..trainers helping animals go to new area.  Interesting!",
          "Not only do you get to see all the animals you get a nice walk outside. Beautiful place for everyone.",
          "Great zoo. Clean, animals are all well taken care of and every one of the exhibits had enrichment items and toys in the displays for the animals. The giraffe encounter was amazing!",
          "I'm a member because I love it!  Most exhibits have been redone since I was a kid or are in the process now.  I was just sad a couple places were closed today without notice at the gate.  And, I always feel bad for the seals. They need an updated exhibit next.",
          "This zoo has everything: Elephants, flamingos, giraffes you can feed (you have to buy special lettuce from the zoo keeper, but still a totally cool experience), tigers, gorillas, and delicious ICEEs to quench your thirst and your sweet tooth.",
          "it's okay, beautiful setting in the river valley, lots of open space and land, very well maintained with a natural environment.  However, there is a general lack of animals. So that's a problem for a zoo.  We've been to plenty of zoos, and \u2026",
          "Enjoyed my time at boo at the zoo.  It was great getting to see the animals at night.  I love the improvements they are doing to the enclosures.",
          "Always love seeing the  African plains  area, elephants,  flamingos  and, my favorite, the giraffes. The primate building was good because it showed, with maps, what each primate's natural habitats were located in the world. Makes a great \u2026",
          "Cleveland zoo was awesome I waited for light up night and it blew me away. I will certainly be coming back next year. Animals were so active in the light displays were so much fun to see!",
          "Great place for dates, famlies, or just 'lets chill' times. Get there at opening time and you get to see them feed the carnivores as well as, inside the elephant health center, you'll get to see all the naked mole rats wake up. Its great they all sleep in huge piles.",
          "So much to love about this zoo. Way better than Akron. Lots of walking, but all the better for fitness!",
          "Very clean and friendly staff! Enjoyed the zoo lights this year and are looking forward to making it a tradition.",
          "I love the variety and right now the lantern fest is going on so everything is extra beautiful. What would I love to see MORE STAFF TO EDUCATE. I LOVE HEARING THEM TELL MY KIDS INTRESTING FACTS HELPING THEM LEARN...... that's what the zoo \u2026",
          "It's ok. Not many animals out to see. Would have been nice to have been told that all food and drink vendors were closed throughout the park. All vending machines were empty as well. Only the main entry was open. What we did get to see was nice.",
          "The actual zoo was not laid out the best way. Even with the map, it was quite confusing when walking around. The animals were good. Most weren't there which happens, it's part of life. But they said they had certain animals on their \u2026",
          "Wonderful and friendly staff, happy and well-taken care of animals, and plenty to do!",
          "This zoo holds a special place in my heart. Originally from Cleveland, this is my \u201chometown\u201d zoo. I love that parking is FREE, I like any other zoo I have been to. The rainforest is a great place to take kids in rainy or cold weather, and \u2026",
          "We love the rainforest here! Always good info being taught.",
          "This zoo is amazing took a vacation here you cannot possibley get through the whole park in a day and actually enjoy seeing all the animals it's like a Disney land as a zoo. Prices were a little high but we'll.worth it",
          "The weather was a bit hot, but we were able to still enjoy our time there. Me, my daughter and fiance rode on the train through the Wallaby area. It was $2 per person, so very affordable. We also paid $5 for 3 pieces of lettuce to feed the \u2026",
          "We usually go to the zoo every monday free for Cuyahoga county,  & the food is so expensive.  Well being it snowed really bad we went to the rain forest & yes we paid to get in .  It was fun, but have a little secret I need to let you know \u2026",
          "Great zoo to spend time with family and friends. Wolf habitat is really cool",
          "The whole world has to go out and see how much the metroparks have done with the ZOO  .\nThe numerous attractions throughout the year include a variety of different seasons to appreciate the great work that is available  .\nLocated in the \u2026",
          "Let me start by saying that the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is my home zoo and I love this zoo. The exhibits are great and not so big that you cant see the animals as a matter of fact the zoo is one of the reasons I moved from Upstate NY to \u2026",
          "Great Day at the zoo, elephants were outside for our Christmas Eve visit, new tiger exhibit is wonderful and the Christmas lights show looks like it is fantastic.",
          "Very well managed zoo with very friendly staff .. experience forces me to go back regularly...",
          "One of my favorite places to take the kids. Small enough you can hit the whole zoo in a day, but large enough that you can spread it out over a weekend trip",
          "Feel lucky to have such a wonderful zoo so close! Love the seals and sea lions, elephants, big cats, primate house, and (my fave :) the Rainforest. The dinosaur exhibit is always a big hit.  I've heard the Asian lights Lantern exhibit is \u2026",
          "Absolutely wonderful zoo.  Tons of animals and a wide variety of them.  It is spread out so be prepared to walk a little but definitely worth a trip out to enjoy the day amongst animal's",
          "Asian lantern celebration.   The lanterns are beautiful at night. Night starts around 9pm.  This event is from 6:30-10:00. That equals 2.5 hours of looking at lighted displays in the sunshine.   By the time it looks amazing,  you have to \u2026",
          "Went on Thanksgiving. Free admission and all of the animals were awake! Love it here",
          "I went to the zoo today with an old friend. We had so much fun! Despite the heat, the animals were very active and/or eating. We saw grizzlies enjoying a swim which was pretty neat! I leveled up a few times on Wizards - Unite. Large park, very accommodating even on a busy Saturday.",
          "Went for the Christmas lights and was not disappointed. Wonderful way to enjoy the season.",
          "Buy the family membership and go for walks any time you can. You can\u2019t go wrong. If it is the coldest time of the winter head on to the Rainforest, you will feel teleported to another land for a short period of time. And if you have kids ... what are you waiting for?!?",
          "Beautiful grounds and amazing environments for a great selection of creatures. Lots of food options, many  convient clean restrooms. A super experience but we do not enjoy all the walking - grounds are very hilly and spread out. There is a free tram, but it does not go everywhere.",
          "We love the zoo so much and use our pass almost every other weekend! We do a little each time especially if it's hot but it's amazing; the elephant crossing is absolutely gorgeous",
          "Went for the Christmas light displays. Light shows were awesome! There were warming stations and hot cocoa.  They even had s'mores joes for sale complete with a fire to roast marshmallows on.",
          "Honestly, in quite a bit of disrepair. I admit we came on the office season, but was still expecting more. Rainforest looks like it was near abandoned years ago.",
          "Great zoo with many animals. Most animals look well cared for. The bears looked to be exhibiting stress related behaviors and their enclosures seem to contain the least amount of interactive items for the animals.  The gorillas also seemed to need some private space away from people.",
          "Loving all the new exhibits they have put in place the new Asian area is just amazing.  I think I could spend hours over there just so beautiful.",
          "This is a nice zoo. Coming from a conflicted opinion on the existence of zoos. What I saw was an immense effort to ameliorate the conditions of captivity and provide visitors an accurate impression of  the vast diversity of our planet's \u2026",
          "Great zoo and they are constantly updating and adding new exhibits.  Not to miss if you are in town and like zoos. If you can get a behind the scenes tour they are to die for. Don't forget to go to the giraffe exhibit. $5 to feed giraffes.",
          "Wonderful place to spend a day, even in winter the rainforest bis warm and they shuttle from building to building in the zoo if you like.",
          "AMAZING ZOO! Best one in the tri-state area for sure! So many animals and the exhibits are huge! Plan to be here awhile because there is so much to do and a whole lot to look at! Not usually too crazy but just look to see if there are any events the time you want to go.",
          "One of my favorite places! If you want some great advice though....Go on a weekday, while school is in session, and it's cooler out than 80 degrees. When you do this, your experience here is at it's absolute best. Great enclosures, wonderful selection of animals, and beautifully kept grounds.",
          "We had an excellent catered meal and birthday celebration. The lights were good.",
          "Nice zoo, I like the tiger exhibit and the special \"Asian Lantern Festival\" exhibit.\n\nI wish they would have had the blue Festival logo shirt available in short sleeve and that the parking lot was a little smoother to exit from; cars were merging at lots of intersections and it did not feel very efficient!",
          "Amazing Zoo, you can spend hours upon hours here, the animals seem very well taken care of and have great amounts of space for them to roam, definitely grab a map when you go, the set up of the zoo is a little confusing and many paths cross \u2026",
          "Cleveland Metroparks zoo has really made efforts to enhance the facility.  The tiger, wolf, Asian highland, elephant exhibits show their passion to make the zoo a more premium experience.  Bringing in the Chinese lantern exhibit this year \u2026",
          "My son loves going here. We usually go to the free Mondays. The workers are always nice and the lady showed us a great place to watch the elephant crossing yesterday and helped us figure out how to get to the bird show. My 9 year old is \u2026",
          "WENT YO SEE ASIAN LANTERNS LIGHTS DISPLAY\n LOVE IT. LOVE THE TIGER COMING OVERHEAD LOOKING UP KIDS EXCITED SEEING IT THERE. SO CROWDED RAN OUT OF HOVER ROUNDS MINE RAN DEAD BARELY MADE IT BACK GREAT ZOO",
          "Love the new Asia highlands exhibit. Lots of new things to see.",
          "The exhibits need to be a bit closer as the zoo seems to not have a lot of animals but tons of open space. The elephant exhibit seemed to be the biggest draw, but after that it's a lot of walking for little reward.",
          "Great Zoo. Only thing I would change or want is is more people giving more information on animals. Otherwise, enjoyed it. Will have to go on a weekday though to avoid the crowds for a deeper exploration",
          "We went to the Asian lantern festival and it was a lot of fun. I would have given it 4 and 1/2 Stars due to the fact that I think they oversold and it was extremely crowded. However I leaned towards five stars more because of the revenue \u2026",
          "Fun zoo for visiting with the family! Sprawling park with several newer exhibits. Food inside is terribly expensive though, so I'd recommend bringing your own.",
          "I grew up going to this zoo. As a child, it was fantastic. The zoo itself is massive with numerous exhibits and enclosures and animals. But over the years it\u2019s been somewhat rundown and dingy looking. They think by adding fancy new exhibits \u2026",
          "I think it is a over priced for the time of year we went. There was only 1 concession stand open in the entire park and some of the animals weren\u2019t on exhibit for some reason. It cost us about $45 for me, my wife, and 3 year old to enter \u2026",
          "Went with family to see the Asian lantern Festival  . We weren't disappointed . The displays were unique and beautiful especially at night .  The start of the trail is at the main entrance . The entrance labeled O near the bear exhibit was \u2026",
          "Went for the Asian Lantern Festival. It was great despite the extreme heat and humidity, which kept the crowd down. It is different than last year's festival, but just as good. Definitely something to see if you haven't seen it before. There's also Asian food and beer for purchase, and entertainment.",
          "This is an amazing zoo. We have been to quite a few in the North East and i was truly impressed. We spent the better part of 6 hours and still did not get to everything. They have a huge area for kangaroos and wallabies.",
          "If you enjoy a nice walk this the place for you, throw in lights and Christmas songs and it's perfect for the holidays",
          "Great zoo. Lots to see. Takes about 3 hours or so to do a full walk around to see everything. New babies and exhibits seem to arrive every year. Zoo has some  generous patrons that make this one of the best in the country.",
          "Good for a family outing. Just not the right spot to be at when its too hot as the animals tend to stay in the shade because of the heat. \nIn general a perfect way to spend a day close to nature and animals are right in the heart of the city.",
          "The whole family went after hours to an exhibit and were taken aback at the beauty within the zoo at night. This will always be a staple of fun and community when you arrive. The rainforest is gorgeous and the whole experience is breathtaking if you're into learning, exploring, and spending time with your loved ones.",
          "We had a great time visiting this zoo. It was educational and provided interaction with some of the animals. Most of the exhibits were structured so you could see the animals well.",
          "We really enjoyed the Asian Lantern Festival!  It was beautiful and such a lovely way for our family  and friends to spend time together.    It's  so much more than we imagined it would be.",
          "The zoo is great!  We went for the Christmas lights this time and had fun with it.",
          "The animals appear well cared for. They have choices to be inside or out in most cases. It's great for kids, but definitely bring a stroller or wagon. Get ready to do a lot of walking, because there is a lot to see!",
          "My wife and kids love this zoo but I feel that the animal exhibits are too far apart. Be prepared to do a ton of walking.\n\nThe new exhibits are great! \n\nYou can feed giraffes and birds which my daughter really enjoyed.",
          "Lots to see and do. Very easy to spend an entire day there. Only negative is the excessive amount of walking to get to reach exhibit. The kids needed carried a lot. Bring a wagon or stroller for sure \ud83d\udc4d",
          "You can not go wrong with the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. They have an indoor rainforest in a separate building before you enter the zoo.  The zoo itself is quite big. It's great exercise walking around, but if you have trouble walking far I \u2026",
          "I had the time of my life. This is a wonderful place to visit. This is a great zoo.",
          "Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is a great place to visit if you are in the area! If you buy tickets online, they are $2 cheaper than they are at the admission desk at the zoo. Additionally, parking is free, which is always an added bonus! I loved \u2026",
          "I love coming to this zoo! I even have a membership this year. With the additions of the asian area and the tiger area, the zoo is just amazing to explore. I wish the animals could have more activity sometimes. I look forward to watching this zoo grow.",
          "The lantern festival is a very nice outing. The show is quite spectacular. The lanterns look much nicer against the dark sky, so I recommend arriving close to 730.",
          "Awesome evening at the Zoo & it's Winter Wonder Land! But no zoo trams... Handicappers beware!",
          "Was a good zoo; not on par with the Columbus Zoo. Didn't like that it was divided and required so much walking. Zoo tram needs to think about dropping passengers off at multiple locations as opposed to just one; might increase of other great exhibits.",
          "This zoo is continually growing and making exhibits better for the animals. Animals always appear happy and well taken care of.  The Asian Lantern exhibit is beautiful to see even in the day.",
          "I absolutely love going! If you can, get a membership! Totally worth it :D",
          "Excellent place for a membership if you have young children. Always clean. Plenty of learning opportunities. Always a great experience.",
          "Animals are very bored, especially  the big cats and bears, they need interactive items in their enclosures, for example  treats frozen in large ice cubes, similar  to what Akron Zoo does.  I felt really bad for those animals.  If the zoo \u2026",
          "So much fun but your best bet is to go before 3 because they start their feeding around then so you'll end up missing out on a lot of cool animals. I made it through quite a few exhibits but I'll be back again to get the full experience.",
          "We went bought our tickets in advance and ended up not being able to do much of anything because the power was out and more than half of the exhibits were closed.  Really was a waist of time and money.",
          "For a rainy day, the Rainforest was the perfect place to take my granddaughter.  Nice way to see some animals, plants, birds, and warm environment.",
          "The Cleveland Zoo is always a lot of fun. It's a huge place, with a rain forest dome that takes a couple of hours to explore. The rest of the zoo has special areas that are must see including the elephant crossing, the tiger exhibit, the \u2026",
          "I love this zoo! We got the zoo membership every year and it\u2019s totally worth it. My favorite are the bears, the red pandas, the capybaras, and the snow leopards. I wish they still got the polar bear and the armadillo. Events like the Boo at the zoo and the Chinese lanterns display are also fun with or without kids:)",
          "Just came from the Wild Winter Lights. It was terrific! See it before it closes!",
          "The Cleveland zoo is better than the Columbus zoo in my opinion. You can get close to the giraffes without having to pay a fee to see them up close. The elephants have a nice area and you can see them cross the exhibit when they put them on \u2026",
          "It was so much fun to see all the exotic animals. I felt like they took good care of the animals, they had large habitat enclosures. It was neat to see elephants and lions. Go check it out with the kids for sure.",
          "Always a fun experience. Great place to take the kids for the day!! So much to see! Nicely set up. Everything was kept clean and people were friendly. Keep it up!",
          "Very nice today no kids running around and screaming like on Saturday parents don't know how to be parents by teaching their children stay off your phones",
          "Cleveland's zoo will never be internationally, or even nationally, famous the way the San Diego or Bronx Zoos will be. But don't let that fool you - it is a fantastic zoo with great animals fun stuff for kids and adults! The elephant \u2026",
          "Terrible Customer service! I will never visit this zoo again.",
          "Visited for the first time in quite a while with my 4 year old niece and it was definitely worth it. Between the Australian outback, African Safari, Wilderness Trek, the Primate House, and the Rainforest there is more to see than you can in \u2026",
          "Animals own the biggest place of my heart. The Zoo shows so much love and respect to these beautiful lives!\n~The Zoo is providing safe environments for them to continue the growth of their species. The ones that are listed as endangered \u2026",
          "Really great evening. Wr went with a few families for the Asian Lantern Festival. The entertainment was great. The exhibits were beautiful. Very well designed and placed. Plenty of refreshments available. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Neat to tour the zoo at night.",
          "Great place to take the whole family very fun feeding the giraffes.",
          "I probably took about 100 or more pictures. The zoo was amazing. My first time at an American zoo and I was not disappointed. We of course made a quick stop at McDonald's for some ice cream.",
          "Absolute favorite zoo. A good three hour walk, lots of animals to watch and can get real close to some. And there is always a keeper around willing to share info on someone.",
          "I love it.... So many new things to see//and do for you and your family an friends\ud83d\ude0a",
          "I saw a giraffe and a lion! \ud83e\udd81\ud83e\udd92",
          "Decent event for once a year with the family. Quite a few exhibits were empty (including indoors) maybe most outside were hiding or sleeping. Was a good time either way with the kid and woman. Occupied us for a good 3 hours at least.",
          "Wonderful place to walk around and enjoy the animals and some good food. I love this place. Great zoo! All the animals look very healthy and active. Very clean park, good job to all the staff.",
          "Love the variety of animals from Australian adventure to Asian highlands and in between. The elephants are amazing. Neat aquatics building. Walking up the huge hill or waiting and piling on the tram though are not so great but not impossible.",
          "A fantastic zoo to spend the day. The giraffe exhibit is top notch, being able to feed them is an extremely unique experience. My daughter loved the camel ride.  While the aquarium offerings are not quite as substantial as nearby Pittsburgh \u2026",
          "Wonderful, clean, educational, fun!  Do not leave until you have fed the giraffes!  So much fun, and memories for a lifetime.  There is a rather strange and sprawling layout, but very beautiful.  The walk is enjoyable, and there is a tram for those who prefer to ride.  Can't wait to go back!",
          "I like that they are updating the enclosures to allow the animals more room and to make them happier. There are still a few that need worked on though. The Asian Lantern fest was pretty neat. I definitely enjoyed it.",
          "They take good care of their animals and they are very clean and organized.",
          "Outstanting as always I appreciate all of you all do to keep us learning and growing in our animal kingdom!",
          "I love having such easy access to such a wonderful zoo... always a great place to get away for a few hours of exercise walking around or a day of seeing the animals.  I hope you can update the cat/primate house at some point soon (a little dated - and depressing - by more modern zoo standards but otherwise, top notch!!!",
          "I really like this zoo.\nSome of the exhibits seemed sparse and could use a revamping.\nLike seals and bears .They seemed bored on concrete pads and little water area.\nThere is all land available to make those enclosures a lot better. Wish \u2026",
          "Go all the time with my daughter and wife, always a great time.",
          "The Cleveland Zoo is a great place to take the kids or just stroll around on a nice day. When I last was there we were able to see just about every animal. My only reason for taking off a star is that even though they have awesome new \u2026",
          "A great zoo! We've spent several weekend afternoons here, the membership is definitely worth it, especially for families.",
          "Loved  the elephants! Best part.",
          "Lovely zoo in the heart of Cleveland! Set inside a valley, this zoo really surrounds you and draws you into the habitats. The paths are easily walkable, with plenty of room for strollers and scooters to not feel crowded. The animals seem \u2026",
          "One of my favorite zoo's in Ohio. Eith an indoor rain forest, to a free tram to take you to outer exhibits to interactive exhibits. To picnic tables and grills in the parking lot. A great place to spend a day.",

          "Good zoo. Nice place to spend a day.",
          "Nice little zoo as always. They take great care of their animals and keep it up pretty well.\nIts essentially your basic zoo, they're not super different than the other ones, but it's nice. I enjoy bringing the kids on calm days.",
          "Been here a few times and the family loves it! We love the new expansions and our favorite part is the Asian highlands.\n\nA little sad that every time we go it seems the restaurant in the Asian Highlands is not open, and the shuttles never seem to be running. But maybe they only run or are open on certain days and we aren't aware of it.",
          "This zoo has many volunteers who care about the world and contribute their knowledge to the work they do. Almost anyone you talk to here is happy to answer your questions or just chat with you about the animals they have. It's a great place to spend a day, though it can be pretty expensive.",
          "Its a Great place to see wild animals and love supporting the zoo",
          "The zoo was very nice. It had many animals to see such as elephants, giraffes, red pandas, camels, and more. The park is spacious and clean. There are teams to take you to different exhibits. It\u2019s very fun for kids with some playgrounds \u2026",
          "Great place for families. Has several indoor buildings and wooded areas. Lots of shade and misters throughout. Animals are well taken care of. Lots of helpful volenteers with great information. Zoos getting ready for another lander festival starting 20 June. So many great events. No trip is every the same.",
          "This splendid zoo is nestled in an extraordinarily beautiful and easily accessible Metropark.  The animals are well cared for and seem happy and  content.  Each and every volunteer and zoo employee endeavor to educate attendees about \u2026",
          "The animals seemed very well taken care of and staff was great. But most of the animals. Looked very bored in their surroundings. Enclosures were rather small . but the baby Giraffe was stunning.  I gave an fourth star because the zoo does a lot to help wild animals also.   I would return.",
          "I've grown up going here and it's still great",
          "The zoo was way cool. It had more to do than my local zoo, and I really enjoyed seeing the animals.",
          "I went with a couple of friends and we had an awesome time! The Cleveland Zoo is a great place for 3+! The staff is friendly and the food is good! Some animals you have to see are the monkeys, rhinos, and giraffes. Our favorite part was feeding the giraffes! If you go on a hot day make sure to bring lots of water!",
          "We always have a good time at the zoo! Its clean, workers are friendly & the animals seem happy & well taken care of. I enjoy all the educational information throughout the zoo too! A visit is a great opportunity to discuss extinction & why taking care of our planet is so important.",
          "We love the Cleveland zoo! Food can get pricey but your allowed to bring in your own! We visit at least once every couple months and they always have events going on all year long!",
          "It's not as good as the Colombus Zoo but still a nice one. I highly recommend the Asian Lantern Festival they have! It's very beautiful and worth the money.",
          "I've been to several zoos throughout the country and the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo ranks right up at the top! There are ton of interactive sites a plethora of beautiful and even endangered species of animals throughout the park. A true \u2026",
          "Whenever we visit a city, their zoo is always on our must-see-list. I didn't realize the beauty of Cleveland Metroparks Zoo until years later after we moved to a Cleveland suburb. The first time I laid my feet in the zoo, I knew I should \u2026",

          "Went to see zoo lights. Definitely well worth going",
          "By far the best zoo I've been to. Went right at opening 10 am and was able to see every animal! Not a single one hiding or not in view. I found it to be very clean and not overpriced.",

          "Always improving and doing good things for the animals they care for.",

          "Beautiful place! Well kept , clean and so many animals!",
          "Great place to take the kids. Mondays are always crazy packed so we aim for other days of the week. Food is a bit overpriced so we just buy a treat while there and pack our main meal. We love being members!",

          "It was monday, so it was free to get in. No animals.  I could count on two hands of how many animals I actually saw. Not like it was years ago, there were so many of each species. I know there were a lot of empty exhibits. Very sad",
          "The animals and most of the staff are very nice, but my problem is the food stands. I went to the McDonald's for lunch,  and my food was sub par and  drink didn't even come with a lid or straw! The food stands were also extremely slow and took their precious time. Extremely disappointed.",
          "They have warming stations throughout and lots of nice activities for everyone.",
          "There weren\u2019t very many animals available to see when we were there, it was a little disappointing. The reptile room was pretty cool though!",
          "A very nice zoo, had a nice selection of animals. It also has attractions like getting to feed a giraffe, and specialty events that happen depending on the time of year. There is also an aquarium, so you can see aquatic creatures, too.",
          "I love Boo at the zoo. Go every year. Always looks so nicely decorated.",
          "Out of the 7 or 8 zoos that I have been to this is by far my favorite. Most of the exhibits are in excellent condition and very nice. If you enjoy seeing animals of all kinds this is definitely a place to visit. Recently bought a membership and well worth the money.",
          "An amazing zoo. Perfect size for the kids.",

          "Went to see the Christmas lights at the zoo. Had a great time and enjoyed the displays.",

          "Zoo was okay. I\u2019ve definitely been to better. It seemed like the majority of the animals were hiding or not in view of the guest. There were a lot of small indoor exhibits that were nice but we didn\u2019t get to see a lot of animals in the bigger exhibits which was disappointing.",

          "First time here. Pancreatic cancer walk inspired but afterward I got a chance to enjoy the zoo. Loved it. So much to see and do. You definitely have to make a day of it.",
          "We can see various animals here, including reptiles, fish and invertebrates.\nKids friendly with camel ride, some feeding attractions, train, carousel and others.\nNow zoo light season (we need another ticket).\nWe can stay here the entire day.\nLet's come!  :)",
          "We have good zoo, however certain areas need updating for the enrichment of the animals. Marine life area and primate area need updating, did we lose a number of animals and fish? I know we now have Great Lakes Aquarium, however it's too expensive for what you see. The zoo is much more teasonable.",
          "Kinda disappointed . I was surprised to find that Akron zoo was much better",
          "Holiday lights were beautiful.  Nice displays",
          "Visiting the zoo in the early spring is amazing. It's cool enough to enjoy the Rain Forest building. The animals that were on display were active and alert, unlike hot summer days. We even got to hear the make lion roar, which was a first for me at a zoo. The zoo wasn't crowded which made the day very pleasant.",
          "We had such a blast! Its magical every time. The education and experience is life long. Best year yet!!!",
          "Loved this zoo so much we got a family membership and go all the time. They have added so many new exhibits. Fun for the whole family",
          "I have been to quite a few Zoos across the country. This one is hands down one is the most enjoyable Zoos I have been to. The animals are healthy and lively. The park is very clean. I am very impressed with this establishment.",
          "Always a good experience. I wish the bar by the elephant crossing was open more times. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a seasonal thing though.",

          "Easy to walk around.  Me and the kids had fun!",
          "The animals are clearly very well loved and taken care of. Their conservation efforts are incredible. The printed map is a bit confusing but it was mostly user error \ud83d\ude02 Prices are decent in the shops, typical gift shop prices but not outrageous.",
          "We have a membership to the zoo and it is so worth it. The membership pays for itself after only a few visits and the perks are nice. I've been visiting since I was a kid and it only gets better as they add more exhibits, animals, \u2026",

          "Went to the winter light show and it was amazing money well spent",

          "Absolutely love the Cleveland Zoo! We visit a couple times every year and each year it is such a fun trip. Very clean and well maintained. We love the elephants and walking up to see the aquarium animals and gorillas. It's spacious and very accessible.",
          "Asian lantern festival was beautiful. I suggest getting a bite to eat and then going to see lanterns. There is really nothing to see until it gets dark.",
          "Best local zoo around. Love taking my kids here try to go as much as possible and they never get enough",
          "Adorable zoo. Walked around for 4 hours and saw almost everything I could have asked for! \n\nTrolley is convenient but easily walked as well. Loved the Asian Highlands part and The Rainforest. Also got a killer good photo by one of the staff \u2026",
          "Ron and I love visiting the animals on Mondays at the zoo! We come here often....The animals love to have visitors, it seems....And the Cleveland Zoo seems to actually care for the animals....Wouldn't it be nicer though, if the animals were \u2026",
          "Went to see the Christmas lights and Santa Claus. Was a great experience",
          "The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo was an absolutely delightful experience for a Monday afternoon (free for Cuyahoga County residents)! I saw cats, fish, primates, elephants, lions, and all while others also checked out the animals from all over Earth! While the zoo season continues, visit the zoo!",
          "Have been a huge fan of the Cleveland Zoo my entire life. As a kid I loved the sheer number of animals but now realize that fewer animals in a more natural and comfortable setting is better for them. The changes over the years have been \u2026",
          "I went for the light show...fabulous animals & lighting....a giant real elephant...don't miss elephant...lots of real cats that seem to appear all around us n the bushes....giraffes also..so much...fabulous zoo here to be so proud to have!!!!",
          "This was a beautiful zoo. It was a better zoo than the Pittsburgh zoo in relation to the park layout. It was easy to maneuver and we made it through the entire park in 3 hours.",
          "Loved everything about it. There were two women that gave me and the children a cup of water without any issues. The stand was right as you come out of the enclosed eating area. We really appreciated it.",
          "Kids loved the train and carousel. Some of the food stops were dirty and seemed unable to handle the customers. Employees were all very kind and many of the a I'm exhibits are the best in the state. Some shade on hot days and can escape to the rain forest when it gets to be too hot.",
          "Loved it!! Out of the zoos we\u2019ve been to, this is my favorite. There\u2019s lots of walking, so where some comfy shoes, but it\u2019s worth every step.",
          "Zoo is fantastic and beautiful. The low rating is for the fact we where there on father's day and at 3pm the closed all food court places except McDonald's. They only had a few open to begin with but they closed all that where. If it wasn't for this it would be 5 stars",
          "So much to look at nice selection of food as well",
          "There was only 3 animals you could see.",
          "Went to the Asian lantern festival.  Food was horrible \ud83d\ude2d.  Supposedly some well-known local Asian restaurant.   Overpriced and lukewarm.\n\nI suggest packing food or eating beforehand.\n\nMany of the lanterns were old and worn   everything \u2026",
          "I like the zoo a lot! They continue to upgrade the amenities and exhibits. I went for the first time today since 2016, and it's clear the metroparks puts hard work into upgrading the zoo. The primate, cat, and aquatic building at the top of \u2026",
          "My wife and I had a wonderful time.It had been a lot of years since we had been there, and wow!  Lots of new things to see, staff was very nice and helpful, and the park was very clean and we'll kept, the same can also be said about the animals and their habitats.",
          "Great place for the kids to run around when it's cold outside!!!!",
          "Super fun time. I love watching movies he giraffes eat lettuce.  Those long purple tongues are just crazy! I also like that they have a McDonald's in the park.",
          "The zoo is always a great place to spend the day learning about conservation and see some awesome animals.  We get a membership every year and today was our second time this summer.  \n\nWe are excited to see the lights starting on June 20!!",
          "Get the season pass! You won't regret it!",
          "Always a good time at the Cleveland Zoo! . Nature lovers & animal lovers must visit. Fantastic Day with family...bring your wallets, it can cost ya but then again...its priceless.",
          "Great place to spend a day with your grand kids.  My daughter's 2 yr old knew the place well, and led me holding my hand or making me carry him the entire day.",
          "Great using it to exercise 10000 steps",
          "I love Elephants.  Girls in shop helped me find everything they had that had to do with ELEPHANTS \ud83d\ude0a",
          "The best part about this zoo is the ease of finding everything. They constantly have events going in making the zoo experience more fun. We went for the Asian light festival.",
          "Great place! Next things they try to incorporate. Animals are well cared for.",
          "This is a great place for a family day. On Monday's the zoo is free for cuyahoga County residents. Definitely a place the whole family can enjoy.",
          "great walking. tram is nice to use up to aquatics. 4d theater fun. great zoo.",
          "It doesn't make effective use of it's very large size and certain things (aquarium and primate area) are sorely in need of an upgrade but other stuff like the Australian adventure area and the rainforest are fantastic.",
          "Love the Zoo!  At night with xmas lights is great!",
          "We had an awesome time at the zoo. I had them hold a wheelchair for me and they misplaced my order.  Not only did they give me an emergency wheelchair they also gave me my stroller for free. I really appreciate what they did for me because I had been waiting 3 weeks to come. Thank you for giving me and my grandkids a wonderful day.",
          "Triple A for Cleveland Zoo. Good place for the family and friends. They really care for all the animals and the plants. Is very beautiful despite the fact that the animals are messy and smelly. What can we do. They are animals!  The employees are very friendly and polite. In other words, go to the Zoo!",
          "We love the zoo so much. Purchase the all inclusive wrist band, it's such a good deal. My kids love the train ride, carousel and theater with the bands you can enjoy as many times as you'd like.",
          "Very nice as I haven't been to the zoo in years. I took advantage of the free Monday. Spent 3hrs there with the kids. They weren't ready to go, but it started to get a little crowded and trying to maneuver with 2 kids and a Radio Flyer \u2026",
          "Winter lights are amazing and plenty of activities to keep the kids busy",
          "Went for fathers day with my husband and the kids. Despite a little rain it was a nice family outing. The zoo was very clean but not too many animals out today. The rainforest part is awesome. Given the choice though Columbus is way better but further away.",
          "We love the zoo, no matter the season.",
          "Well the Cleveland zoo.... it's a big zoo meaning that you have to do a lot of walking to see the different areas and species of animals. It does need a lot of maintenance, some of the animals enclosures are not clean or there is a lot of weeds and plants that make it look abandoned. You'll definitely get your steps in.",
          "This was a fun zoo to visit. The elephants were so beautiful and had their own personalities.",
          "The Cleveland Zoo is a great tourist attraction for the city. The Zoo is always well maintained and has plenty to offer from great food to collectibles in the gift shop. I had the pleasure of touring the Zoo during the Lantern Festival. It was a fantastic experience that I highly recommend to all.",
          "Love this zoo. If your in town check it out. You won't be disappointed.",
          "Every time we go I find some new area and a lot of the areas are pretty big. Lots to do but many of the attractions are kind of expensive (5 dollars to feed giraffes) but I suppose it's going to a good cause.",
          "I love the Cleveland Zoo. It's like everything that the Metropark's touches turns to gold! They have a great park and such a good way to spend a summer day with my kids! We try to go at least a couple times every year! I  love the monkeys and the elephants! If you haven't gone in awhile make it a point soon!",
          "I get kinda angry when man of the animals are not in their enclosures when I visit. But love the zoo!",
          "It was ok. Me and my friend got locked in the zoo for an hour. When it closed for the day, but we had a good time.",
          "Always love coming here! The rain forest is my favorite part along with the new tiger exhibit. I definitely recommend coming here when you are in Cleveland or surrounding cities!",
          "Right now they have the Asian Lantern Festival going on during the weekends only and at evening/night. Tried to go last year but unfortunately there was a power outage and did not have enough time to go again. Happy that they came back again with more lights too as well. Definitely worth the trip",
          "So much more here than I expected! Beautiful all around and the animals all seem really happy and well taken care of! I've never seen so many animals up and active at a zoo before! You won't be disappointed here!",
          "Nicely spread out with many mature trees.\n\nMore empty displays than I've ever seen in a zoo.\n\nThe train ride was very short and about as unscenic as imaginable.\n\nThe \"4D\" movies were interesting.",
          "I visited on beautiful fall day and the zoo wasn't busy and all the animals were out. It was like having the Zoo all to myself.",
          "Had a great time here. The customer service is amazing at this zoo. I live in Florida but I would literally travel to Cleveland just to visit this main attraction. Thanks Cleveland Zoo for making my Visit welcome .",
          "Best place to take my son on Fathers Day. It was raining on us all morning but not even that could ruin our day. Couple of umbrellas and we were good to go, if rain doesn't bother you, come when it's raining to have the place mostly to yourself!",
          "Good way to get some walking in.",
          "Awesome....both my husband and I had the best time.  It was beautiful. Only wished there were other variety restaurants opened.   If we wouldn't have gotten a snack from McDonald's at the entrance then we would have stayed hungry thru the whole visit.",
          "Really nice place. Had great time.",
          "Winter lights show was awesome!!!  Only complaint was food was over priced and hot chocolate was Hershey syrup and hot water.",
          "Please do this every year! What an amazing experience!!! So much fun! Great job CLE metroparks!!!",
          "We enjoyed seeing all of the animals and the employees were very nice and helpful.",
          "We always enjoy our trips to the zoo.",
          "Fun experience with the family and they're keeping up with the times with the Asian festival coming along with I believe three new animals at the zoo that were a month or so old.    They are strong advocates for protecting the environment \u2026",
          "Terrible!! Worse experience ever. Paid all that money just to ride thru! Saw 4 animals",
          "Very busy and crowded. Beautiful lantern festival but we could hardly move. We took 6 people and paid almost 100 dollars to look at lights. I would say skip the special events and just go to the zoo regular hours.",
          "I wish they had more animals out during the light festive but we still enjoyed ourselves.",
          "Dropped off my daughter and grandson tthey enjoyed the evening with her friend Farren and her son.",
          "The Cleveland Zoo is amazing in itself. All of the exhibits are easily accessible and make viewing the animals easy. They also host events like the Asian Lights Festival that appeal to young and old alike. The lights festival depicted both real and fanciful animals and characters.",
          "Perfect day with the family at the Zoo. Cleveland zoo was perfect size to walk through with little kids. Plenty of great animals to see and other amenities! Would recommend!",
          "What happened to monkey island? Didn't see any hippos either. It did have some nice changes, hope it's a work in progress. Thank you.",
          "I love our zoo! Elephants and gorillas are not to be missed. Always friendly staff. Do yourself a favor and take 2 days to really enjoy everything",
          "Zooe lights is worth the money.  Beautiful and yummy treats",
          "Put on your walking shoes but a great zoo to take young and old alike.",
          "We visited for the city mission 5k run and so we stayed and saw the exhibits afterwards.  They had the Asian festival decorations displayed and they were beautiful.",
          "The Asian Lantern Festival is amazing and worth the cost of admission. Fun for the entire family to enjoy. It's a cultural event that gives you a small glimpse into a civilization on the other side of the globe. Thank you, Cleveland Metroparks Zoo.",
          "Asian lantern festival was so-so. Such varied quality in exhibits. No transportation assistance for those who might need it. Could use later hours for adults. The display isn't as attractive at 6:30 PM when the sun is out in any case. Poor \u2026",
          "Love this place. Wish you could see more of the animals but hey I'd sleep all the time too. :)",
          "Nice zoo, but not a lot of animals. It was clean and the workers were friendly. I love all animals so it was a nice experience to go to a different zoo",
          "I love this place so much because if you love elephants you can get a good view and its great for taking pictures with your bestie like I did and there is a really cool place where you can ride a camel and go a tree house. You can also go to a buffet of restaurants to eat. I definitely recommend this place",
          "Love the elephants, and  feeding the giraffes. They have a nice variety of animals. Really wish they had more Holiday lights options in December.",
          "Great place to bring your little one",
          "Asian Lantern Festival was interesting & lovely displays!  Second time coming to see it. Can't imagine the time it takes to make & set up these displays.  Amazing!",
          "Not a lot of animals there on show and the ones that were were not \"amazing.\"",
          "Great place to spend a family weekend in Cleveland. They offer free parking and have a carousel and children play area.",
          "Fun place to take kids for new experience.",
          "We get a family membership every year. Hours of enjoyment",
          "The zoo is always a good time. The holiday events are cute and family friendly",
          "Lantern Festival is kind of a bust. It's like a zoo full of blowups you see in peoples' yards at Christmas. \n\nThe zoo itself is very good.",
          "It is a little far between exhibits.  The theory of seen one, seen em all applies here.  It's a great way to introduce kids...but there are better zoos.  There are worse.  Price is fair.  Feeding the giraffes was good, but you cant pet them like other zoos, i.e. Denver Zoo, Pittsburgh.",
          "One of the best zoo's. Love that it is in the neighborhood and gives us a worldly experience.",
          "I LOVE the Zoo. I've been there many times and was a member when my child was young. A lovely way to spend the day together with your family.",
          "The Zoo is GREAT every time that I go there but tonight was extra great with the Asian Lantern Festival going on.  Great job this year I won't miss the ALF again.",
          "Good people. Good events. Not the cleanest place.",
          "Great fun for the entire family! A lot of walking but a lot to see as well! Be sure to save time for the Rainforest when you come, and have a nice retreat from the sun or rain!",
          "Great rainy day at our zoo",
          "The light show was amazing! Highly recommend!",
          "I've always loved the Cleveland Metropark Zoo! It's a geat place to visit all year around, because they just about always have something going on. Can't wait to see what they do with the old Monkey's Island out door exhibit. Plus, the Asian Lantern Festival was spectacular this year! I look forward to many more visits to the Zoo.",
          "Even is a small zoo I feel relax every time visited. I love to visit the rain forest area.",
          "Great time here with my family!",
          "The Zoo is so well kept, so clean & ALL of the staff we met were friendly and super helpful. This was honestly one of the most beautiful zoos I have been to and I will definitely be back one day!",
          "Amazing place. Always fun. Animals are always doing something. The place is always clean. Food and drink are really expensive but you can bring your own. This is my second year with a zoo membership, it's really worth it. I love this place",
          "I think the zoo is pretty cool. It\u2019s very kid-friendly and there lots of cool events. I think that the Asian Lantern Festival is pretty good.",
          "The lights were great and the lines were short.",
          "It's a great place to go. If you have a zoo pass that is, the only food is McDonald's and pricey food at the rainforest, most of the exhibits are too small for some larger animals but they are expanding some exhibits so that could change, \u2026",
          "Seeing the animals, beautiful gardens and at every turn something else breathtaking to see. I love to toot around and enjoy the splendors of the Cleveland metropolitan zoo.",
          "Always a great place with my grandsons no matter how old they are.",
          "Wild Winter Lights were great fun!",
          "The Cleveland Metro Park Zoo in incredible. Ive had a membership pass since my son was born 3 years ago. My mom and I take my son almost every week for 3 years now. I grew up going to this zoo and the amount of work and love they continue \u2026",
          "Cleveland is very lucky to have such a great zoo. There are so many animals & exhibits to see & they do a great job of providing a unique experience",
          "Great programs and wonderful experience for kids.",
          "Amazing :)\nFriendly and very educated staff, they will explain the history of each animal..\nVariety of animals,  lovely trees and plants\nLovely place! Love the tigers place! My favourite \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Free Monday's for Cuyahoga County residents with valid ID to the zoo! What a Beautiful Zoo!",
          "The zoo is great. the crew at Wilderness Grill was absolutely terrible. They are more concerned about laughing and playing with each other rather than cooking or serving. Where are the managers when you need them.",
          "I love it, free on mondays for residents of Cuyahoga county. Good variety of animals, scenic area  Only  downside is how hilly it can be. Could possibly  difficult  to walk for those  with limited mobility.",
          "The Asian lantern festival is a spectacle to see. Prices are very high and the staffing seems to just be going through their routine, and not wanting to truly be there.  \n\nThey are willing to help you but the looks on their faces scream \u2026",
          "I love going to the Cleveland Zoo. The home run of the park is the giraffe area.You can feed the giraffes with some very expensive lettuce. They have an adorable baby giraffe there right now that will make you melt. The elephants are right there when you walk in and they are worth a long look.",
          "Surprisingly better to go when it's colder, less crowded and you can tram everywhere",
          "An Excellent zoo and one of the best I\u2019ve ever visited. Plenty of exhibits, a legit food court, and you can walk around with open beverages that can be purchased on site. You are also allowed to bring your own food, so that is an extra \u2026",
          "They have a great venue for weddings. Our kids loved it. The shuttle to the reception site was fast and easy. We had a great time. Dinner was ok, but the rest was fantastic.",
          "Small but intimate zoo. Spent 6 hours there and could have stayed longer. Everything was laid out perfectly. Got chance to see all the animals. The only downside was the deck walk to the primates was under construction.",
          "Having grown up going to the Columbus Zoo my whole life, I thought nothing could compare. Cleveland Zoo blew me away in a great way though! The exhibits were beautiful and thoroughly decorated. I loved the Wolf Lodge-all the details were \u2026",
          "I loved it. We will go again our next trip from Utah. All the animals look very healthy and active. Very clean park, good job to all the staff.",
          "I love this zoo & rainforest! The giraffe exhibit is the best! You can buy lettuce leaves and feed the giraffes by hand! It's an amazing experience! Some of the pics are of the Asian Lantern Festival at the zoo, it's an amazing show!",
          "Went for the holiday lights and it was worth every penny",
          "Wonderful  place to walk around and enjoy the animals and some good food.   When I was young, there was just McDonald's  and pizza hutt....now, they've  added a few options that are local favorites  like 808 and Jack Frost!        Go on a cool day!"

      "name": "Greater Cleveland Aquarium",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Greater Cleveland Aquarium is an aquarium in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Occupying the historic FirstEnergy Powerhouse building located on the west bank of the Cuyahoga River in the city's Flats district, the aquarium, which opened in January 2012, consists of approximately 70,000 square feet (6,500 m2) of exhibition space and features 55 exhibits over 9 thematic concentrations representing both local and exotic species of fish. The facility is the only independent, free-standing aquarium in the state of Ohio and ended a 26-year period that the city lacked a public aquarium.\n\n\n== History ==\nA former Cleveland Aquarium opened on February 6, 1954, and was located on the city's near-east side in Gordon Park. It was created by the Cleveland Aquarium Society, a group formed in the 1940s, the City of Cleveland and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, which operated the facility. The aquarium was housed in a building constructed in the 1930s that previously served as bath house. In 1943, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History converted it into a trailside museum, displaying local flora and fauna as well as exhibits of freshwater fish of Lake Erie. That museum closed in 1953 when the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway cut Gordon Park in two.\nIn the early 1950s, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, which had previously had aquatic exhibits on its second floor of former home, moved to its own new building and consolidated its aquatic collection into the Cleveland Aquarium. The old Gordon Park trailside museum was renovated by Cleveland Aquarium Society volunteers for about $25,000.The aquarium had 50 freshwater and marine exhibits including sharks, swordfish, sawfish, seahorses, eels, squid, octopus, and coral. It acquired a pair of Australian lungfish in 1966 and a school of red-bellied piranhas in 1970. Under the Natural History Museum's direction, the aquarium often drew more visitors than the building could handle. A $300,000 gift from the Leonard C. Hanna Foundation financed the construction of a new octagonal wing in 1967 that tripled the aquarium's size and increased its tank capacity from 8,000 to 82,000 US gallons (30,000\u2013310,000 l).\nDespite annual deficits experienced during the decade, a city council override of a mayoral veto to increase the admission charges and keep aquarium operations with the museum was performed in 1979.Structural problems with the building forced the closing of the aquarium to the public in June 1985. The former aquarium site then became a police dog training facility for the City of Cleveland. On April 1, 1986, fish and exhibits were moved to the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, where they remain today in the Primate, Cat & Aquatics Building.\n\n\n=== A New Aquarium in Cleveland ===\nA new aquarium was conceived in 2009. It was originally envisioned as a more ambitious 100,000\u2013125,000 square feet (9,300\u201311,600 m2) facility that would cost more than $50 million. However, planning of various forms occurred since the defunct Cleveland Aquarium closed in 1985. Although there were competing interests, the driving force behind the project was Jeffrey Jacobs, a local developer who envisioned it as being part of the Powerhouse, a complex he owned.\nThe eventual facility was a collaboration. It was financed by a $2 million loan from the City of Cleveland, a $1.25 million investment from Marinescape, and an $11.75 million investment from the Nautica Phase 2 Limited Partnership, an affiliate of Jacobs Entertainment. The facility also supported by FirstEnergy and AMPCO, the parking lot operator for the Nautica Complex.\nA ribbon-cutting ceremony was held for the aquarium January 19, 2012, with the aquarium opening to the general public on January 21.Jacobs Entertainment purchased the aquarium outright in 2014.\n\n\n== Facility ==\nThe total cost of the facility was roughly $33 million: $18 million for the building and its related infrastructure and $15 million for aquarium exhibits.\nAt the January 2012 opening, the aquarium 8 exhibition areas, including Ohio Lakes & Rivers, Lakes & Rivers of the World, Discovery Zone, Indo-Pacific, Northern Pacific, Coastal, Coral Reef and a main Shark SeaTube. It features a 230,000-US-gallon (870,000 l) tank with a 175-foot (53 m) acrylic shark tunnel offering panoramic views of marine life, including sharks of various species.In 2018, the Greater Cleveland Aquarium announced plans to upgrade much of its public space using internal resources and many upcycled materials. In addition to upgrading animal life support systems, the Aquarium enhanced gallery theming, welcomed more than a dozen new species including weedy seadragons and splitfin flashlight fish, and expanded its annual passholder program. Approximately 75% of the Aquarium\u2019s public spaces were part of the capital project. In the transformation, the Aquarium divided Lakes & Rivers of the World into two galleries\u2014Asia & Indonesia Gallery and Tropical Forest Gallery; created an Industry & Habitat Gallery to highlight the positive (biomimicry) and negative (habitat loss, pollution) intersections of nature and industry; added relevant conservation action opportunities in each gallery; created Imagiquarium, a toddler-friendly pretend-and-playspace; and expanded its Invasive Species Hut.\n\n\n== Experiences ==\nIn addition to a calendar of special events including Hauntaquarium, Fin Fest and Scuba Claus, the Greater Cleveland Aquarium offers daily interactive experiences including aquarist talks, animal encounters, SCUBA diver underwater talks and exhibit feedings. The aquarium also offers SCUBA-certified divers the opportunity to dive in its Shark Gallery through its Shark Dive CLE program.\n\n\n== Conservation Activities ==\nIn 2012, Greater Cleveland Aquarium General Manager Tami Brown established a non-profit Splash Fund \u201cto educate and encourage passion about aquatic life and participation in the conservation of fresh and saltwater habitats through sustainable human practices.\u201d In 2019, Splash Fund Board Members include new General Manager Stephanie White, Deborah Altman, Bruce Akers, Richard Dorman, Scot Rourke and Trevor Gile. Monies raised by this nonprofit fund have been used to conduct regular community Adopt-A-Beach cleanups at Edgewater Park, provide schools with demonstrated need access to life science-based educational programs and works to encourage a more robust Northeast Ohio spotted turtle population. The Splash Fund is one of more than a dozen partners dedicated to the Saving and Protecting Ohio Turtle Diversity (SPOTD) program working to boost the native but threatened spotted turtle population in Northeast Ohio.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "We took out grandchildren ages 4 & 6 to see the Cleveland Aquarium and enjoyed our time seeing all kinds of water creatures! Parking is $ 3.00 and a very short walk. We spent two hours seeing all the displays. The shark tube is very incredible as the shark pass directly over you",

          "The shark tube was full of people, and for good reason. We happened to visit on a Thursday afternoon around 3:30, which so happened to coincide with the feeding of the sharks. We revisited the tube later in our visit and enjoyed it even more as sharks and stingrays swam right",
          "My wife and I visited the Cleveland Aquarium when it first opened in about 2012, and were very disappointed. What a pleasant surprise to visit again this December and see all of the very well presented tanks and creatures. This is not an aquarium in the same league with",
          "I was so happy when this first opened. Extremely cool exhibits and the walk through eel and shark tank is quite the experience. Price is a bit expensive compared to larger aquariums in most other cities, but only major option in Cleveland, worth visiting once a year.",
          "The Cleveland Aquarium isn't on par with some of the bigger cities but it is getting better and better every year. It's a nice activity if you are downtown and the weather is not great. Take your time and enjoy what they do have.",
          "This is a wonderful mid-size aquarium. There are many rooms to roam through with variety of aquarium tanks with myriad types of fish and under-water creatures. One room has a large tank where you can pet the stingrays. Then you enter the area with the large shark tank, where",

          "I thought this was well worth the $20 admission. Went on a Sunday afternoon. There were scuba divers in the shark tank talking about sharks and answering people's questions. There were alot of interesting things to see if you don't rush through. Was there for about an hour.",

A little on the pricier side, considering how small the venue is. Great shark viewing area and it\u2019s awesome to",

          "The Aquarium is beautiful and easy to navigate. Walking thru the tunnel with fish and sharks all around was very cool. The suggested amount of time is 90 minutes but unless something completely enthralls you, it maxes out at about an hour. At $20, that's expensive. In",

          "I was not convinced about going to the aquarium after reading the reviews, however I am so glad that I went. The thing that swung it for me was the opportunity to touch and feed the rays, which is something I have never seen advertised before. Yes this was extra money to feed",

          "I went here with a friend on a whim while already in town and we thought it was great! It is definitely smaller than maybe Pittsburgh but it was the cleanest and nicest aquarium I\u2019ve been to. All the exhibits were clean and interesting with lots of interactive things. My only",
          "We were looking for something to do for my daughter's second birthday. We were extremely disappointed with the aquarium. After spending $45 for a less than two hour outing, we will not be going back. It's more valuable to go to the zoo.",
          "This is a great little aquarium. Lots of different exhibits and creatures to see. It may be small but it is laid out really well. We were there when a few camp groups came through. I have to comment that these were some of the best behaved kids I have ever been around on",
          "Love the factor they kept it in an old factory with history, lots to see, lots to look at, So relaxing and peaceful in spots just to stare at fish and turtles If we\u2019re back in Cleveland this is a must do",
          "Had a great time at the Cleveland Aquarium. Dove in their Shark Tank. Yes, you can scuba dive in their shark tank. Very knowledgeable staff was extremely helpful and courteous. They made us fell like royalty the entire day of our dive. Highly recommend stopping to check out",
          "This aquarium is packed full of spectacular exhibits. The Rays are magnificent and my kids spent an hour trying to touch one. The walk through tunnel allows for an up close view of the sharks feeding. A signifiant amount of information regarding conservation and care for our",
          "Pleasantly surprised by all there is to do & see in this small aquarium. Tortoises, sting ray petting, interactions with the diver in the shark tank. The individual aquariums were well kept & interesting! I see they do events for kids & adults, like beer tastings. We were also",
          "Small aquarium with plenty of interesting displays. Easy to navigate in 1-2 hours. Enjoyable for families. Great reuse of an old power plant.",
          "Pretty good aquarium. We were recently at the Clearwater Beach Aquarium, and I would say if you take the dolphins away from Clearwater, then Cleveland\u2019s is better. Saying that, It\u2019s a little overpriced. We were done in about an hour, so we went through again. My kids got to pet",
          "We took a day trip to Cleveland. They have a wide range of aquatic displays. The shark tunnel was cool. There happen to be a school group in there so we learned a lot about sharks. We also watched the dive show, it was informative. The other great part is they offer a discount",
          "We spent $70 and were there less than and hour. It was dim and uninviting. Many exhibits were closed due to construction. It is way too expensive considering how small it is and the limited exhibits. May favorite were the tortoises.",
          "We were here on a Friday 11am. $3 to park ; parking lot is in front of building. Several school buses here but crowd moving well. Fish exhibits extremely well done. Turtle exhibit nice. You can touch them. Plenty of places to sit if u get tired. Sting ray exhibit fabulous.",
          "45 mins to 1 hour and you're done. No shows of any kind, just walking by various tanks. Shark tunnel was nice though. Teenagers and adults were bored. Young kids had fun",
          "We decided to take a trip to the Greater Cleveland Aquarium with our 4 year old. We spend a little over 2 hours looking at all of the exhibits and displays. I like how they had everything set up to view around each area. It definitely helped with the busy crowds on the Saturday",
          "So we went because of the Dory octopus. I was expecting it to be grander. Spent just over an hour, not much to see. The shark tube was the best part.",
          "We loved all of our visit, but especially the shark tunnel and sting rays. The kids and adults alike enjoyed watching the shark feeding and the scuba divers cleaning the tanks. The workers were all very friendly and knowledgeable.",
          "I have been to few different aquariums lately and this one is by far the best. I loved walking around the old converted power plant. It was amazing to see!",
          "Very nice place to go with your little ones. The aquarium have a lot of kinds of fishes and turtles. And it is warm, what is nice in a place like Cleveland in the winter kkkk",
          "A large Aquarium spread over more than 70,000 square feet. Enjoyed the shark tunnel and seeing lots of local and exotic fish. A great day I took my grand son here he had a wonderful day.",
          "The old Cleveland Aquarium in Gordon Park was the first big public aquarium I ever visited. My grandparents would take me there sometimes when I came from Missouri to visit them for the summers, and I remember seeing an Australian lungfish and a school of piranhas. When I tried",
          "I received free tickets from my employer. I would not pay the admission prices here. It's not worth it. It took maybe 45 minutes to make our way through. It would be a better idea to go to the Cleveland MetroParks Zoo and look at the fish included in the admission there.",
          "This aquarium was quite small and kinda expensive . But we always go to the aquarium with our kids and we enjoyed this one . The exhibits are small and don\u2019t have a lot of information posted. It was still nice and only took about an hour, which can be disappointing given the",
          "Amazing aquarium and rich in variety while fairly small in size. Very impressed by the variety of species present. Highly recommend for families.",
          "Neat aquarium in an old re-purposed building but for what we paid we seemed to get through this aquarium awfully quickly. So quickly in fact that to get our money's worth we walked through it again. The shark tunnel was our favorite part.",
          "Very costly, the exhibits were very limited in comparison to other aquariums around the world. I do not recommend it at all. Save your money for something else.",

          "Nice Aquarium by the pier and Flat District in Cleveland. Not busy on a Monday morning and very informative. They have hands on galleries, Dive Show, Animal Encounter, Exhibit Feeding and many other activities. The shark exhibit is great. Very nice experience and will",
          "Nice aquarium, but rather small for the price. Plus, you must pay an extra $3 to park. It\u2019s a shame the price does not include parking. However, the facility is very clean, and there are some pretty big sharks. The building is quite interesting as well.",
          "The aquarium itself was small and didn't take us long to get through... Less than an hour. The shark tunnel was awesome, and the ray exhibit was pretty cool. Otherwise, though, nothing was that memorable. My biggest complaint with the aquarium was that it was impossible to find!",
          "I took my 2 thirteen-year-olds to the aquarium with a couple of friends and their 1 1/2-year-old. Admission was a little high, considering the relatively small size of the facility. It took us under 2 hours to complete the entire place. Getting off the highway to the side",
          "This aquarium is nice enough, it's just really small and pretty pricey for the size. If you have ever been to the Aquariums in Gatlinburg, Kentucky, or other large aquariums this won't seem like much.",
          "Been to a few aquariums and this was not one of the better ones. It was small and exhibits limited, only took us about an hour to get thru. The shark exhibit was by far the best. The building it was located in was really cool.",
          "This aquarium shows an interesting way to reuse a historic building. It isn't huge but is ingeniously done. Has some local aqua life as well as exotic. The touch pools are good although the stingrays are wise and make it hard to touch them. Price was reasonable at about $20 per",
          "What a great attraction for a city like Cleveland. We had a greta time and our grandson took hundreds of photos.",
          "This is not the biggest aquarium I have visited, but our 5-year-old daughter had plenty to see and do. She raced back and forth through the place 3 or 4 times. Her favorite thing was the shark tank, but she spent a lot of time at the touch pool. She also liked touching the",

          "I've been to a few aquariums around USA and this one doesn't disappoint. The large shark tank and tube is one of the best I've seen. Sharks come swimming right up to the glass and this makes for fantastic picture taking. So close you can see the sharks breathing, something I've",
          "Once you've been to the Aquarium in Baltimore, every other one has a high standard of comparison. Although this one is much smaller and doesn't have a dolphin area, it was a lot of fun! The layout is really neat and the glass tunnel was awesome. If you are in the Cleveland",
          "A fun way to spend an hour, they have done a good job retrofitting an industrial building to hold an aquarium and do a good job of explaining the local rivers and lakes (and do not shy away from how polluted they once were) Great education on this, and a nice logical flow of",
          "So my daughter and I were here for a soccer game. On our last day in town we had a choice, the aquarium it the zoo. The weather made our choice for us. So we drove the 15 min from our hotel to the aquarium and walked in. The first thing we noticed was the amazing picture behind",
          "One of the best memberships we had as a family. The shark feeding were very entertaining and upstairs they have play area and a restaurant",
          "Great visit! Staff was very friendly and informative about the species of fish and other creatures that live in the aquarium. The overhead tunnel was very cool and we were able to view the staff feeding the fish. The overall layout of the building was easy to get through and it",
          "This aquarium is small and a bit tight, but perfect for small children and their parents. Everything was at my daughter's eye level and the staff were friendly and willing to educate about what animals we were looking at. The animals look well taken care of and there was plenty",
          "The shark tunnel was awesome but other than that there didn't seem to be much to look at. If you have a chance to visit a bigger aquarium in another city that would be better. I saw the review that this place is in a bad area. I disagree with that. We were in the flats for",
          "Well done small aquarium, with plenty of fresh and salt water fish. The shark tube was awesome. A little disappointed with shark feeding, as I think the sharks are probably well fed. The stingray feeding was pretty cool. Really enjoyed learning about Ohio's natural fishl,",

          "We stopped here on our last day in town and I wish we would have did the zoo instead. This is they smallest aquarium I've ever been in! We paid $20 and we were done going through it in less than 45 minutes and that's with stopping and taking pictures. It's probably somewhere ok",
          "We were in the area for a family visit and decided to visit the aquarium. We looked at the website first and it seemed to have many different exhibits along with a feeding of the sting rays. We planned our visit so that we could feed the sting rays, however what we didn't know",
          "We thought the aquarium was nice, but it was too expensive. It cost $80 for our family of 4 and we finished the aquarium in 45 minutes - and we were taking our time! I would give a higher score if it were a more reasonable price.",
          "If you have been into an aquarium this will be exactly the same. layout very similar, activities as in other places, etc. What makes this aquarium spectacular, and it is the reason what i went, is because it has a 30 meter tunnel where you can see all types of fishes swimming",

          "Our nephew's wedding reception was held in one of their halls, and we had a great time. Made for a very family-friendly wedding as there were some kids there, so unlike most weddings where there is nothing for them from start to finish, this was different. Appetizer round was",
          "We decided to try this aquarium out as we have visited many around the country. First off, it is situated in an older building- a perfect fit though. There is plenty of easy parking too. We ended up eating a quick lunch-because it closes at 3:30. Not a big variety, but",
          "I would have to say it was definitely the more unusual aquarium that i have been to but I did love the shark (for lack of a better word) tunnel tank. I would go back again.",
          "I already knew going in, that this aquarium is small and expensive, so I wasn't shocked when I got there. I took my 10 year old son on a week day morning, so it wasn't crowded, which was very nice. You can see the whole place in about an hour or so. We had lunch and walked thru",

          "We love aquariums - grew up going to Shedd, later several trips to Chattanooga's and Atlanta's when we moved south and in various trips Audubon Aquarium of the Americas, the National Aquarium, the Newport Aquarium and others not that memorable. Before going here we read",
          "It was a little challenge to navigate the back streets to get there, but it was a fun way to spend a couple of hours while in Cleveland for a family event. Lots of interactive exhibits, and tanks of fish to look at. But the best part was difinitely the shark tunnel towards the",
          "I was really hoping for more honestly, other than the shark exhibit which was awesome, this place just felt like a building you'd find in a zoo. Don't get me wrong, it's well done but it's sort of underwhelming if you've been to the big aquarium like Georgia and the cost is",
          "The Greater Cleveland Aquarium is in the Powerhouse on the west bank of the flats. It has a gated parking lot (yes, it costs extra -- nice to support Cleveland). Don't expect the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the National Aquarium, the Newport Aquarium, or the Shedd Aquarium. Those are",
          "Contrary to some other reviews, I thought this place was a good value. I compared several activities before we chose this place, and this was one of the most affordable. I really enjoyed the round tanks, the jellyfish were beautiful. Of course the kids loved the stingrays, and",
          "We decided to spend a few hours at the aquarium, and the displays were fascinating for adults and children alike. The stingrays were interesting to watch and to touch, and the shark tunnel let us see some of the shark varieties close up. The touching pool was also a neat",
          "This cost 19 dollars for each person. I felt it was too expensive. Was in a crappy part of town with no obvious signs that you are entering the parking lot of it. A low budget aquarium compared to the Atlanta aquarium. Highlight of of it was the prawn touching tank and stingray",
          "What a wonderful way to spend Mother's Day! The exhibits are excellent. There are several interactive exhibits scheduled throughout the day. Interactive exhibits include touching the stingrays, the bearded dragon and the large turtles, just to name a few. Watching the sharks",
          "The aquarium is the old coal power plant of cleveland. The coal car corridors are still there. All of the brickwork is exposed giving the building a really cool look. It was a bit pricy when I went but it was a new attraction then. There are certain days that it is open for",
          "They had a lot of interesting fish and the tanks were set up differently than any other aquarium i have been to. A lot of them have a 360 view which is great. The best part was the shark tube and watching the diver Q&A. As stated above it was expensive but we did enjoy",
          "Costly, and small. Never should have been put in the location, away from everything. However, the staff were friendly.",
          "We took our kids here once (ages 2 and 3). It is pretty pricey to visit given how small the aquarium is. There were quite a few exhibits to see and the kids even got to touch stingrays. This is definitely more for younger kids as I think the older kids might not find it as",
          "Please DO NOT book a birthday party here. They charge $20 for every parent and up to $21 per child. I had booked a party with 3 activities and it was a party for special needs children so not everyone got there exactly at 1:30 so because you only have 2 hours in the room if",
          "Nice way to spend some time in rain. You cant go in expecting alot of exhibits as its mostly all on one floor. For a small local aquarium its nice and clean and the people that work there are very nice. You do pay for parking but its not alot and you can do a boat or trolly tour",
          "Took our senior citizens group from church. It is a neat, old building, well kept. The size of the aquarium was not overwhelming for a seniors group. Everyone on the staff was very helpful and willing to share their knowledge of the different fish. The group staff person was",
          "A nice place to visit if you are either waiting for the trolley or are complete with the trolley tour. Able to see many aquatic animals indigenous to the Ohio area. If we didnt have a coupon, I don't believe we would have went. Once inside, its nice. You do a self tour. Staff",
          "Spend an hour or two (if you have small kids) to enjoy this aquarium. There are many things to see, touch and do. The Sharks are pretty cool too. . . . . Have a great time . . . . .",

          "I'm torn.. I know that aquariums take a lot of money to keep them up and running so the cost to get in makes sense. At the same time I feel like it was a little pricey for the size and how long we were there. Everything was great and well kept. The staff was very nice and",
          "We visited with young children, so I don't think we were able to experience all the aquarium has to offer. The kids were interested in the interactive exhibits most and skipped through most of the other exhibits pretty quickly. I would have liked to have taken more time, but",
          "I am from near Chicago so I am probably a bit spoiled, but this Aquarium was pretty small and overpriced for what it was. We pretty much saw the whole thing in maybe 1.5 to 2 hours. Not many exciting exhibits. Nothing wrong with it really, just nothing special. The shark tube",
          "The very unique thing about this aquarium, which seems to have been glossed over in most of the comments, if that the aquarium displays are in and among, and often incorperated, with the old, restored architecture of the powerhouse. Its truely unique and IMO worth the visit for",
          "Took my two year old son to the aquarium and he had a ball! They have several floor to ceiling exhibits and he had several opportunities to get face to face with some huge sharks and stingray. I don't think it's a huge aquarium, but it's definitely worth the money!",
          "It was really like a big fish tank with some really big fish and sharks. I would not pay to spend time there...luckily we were there for a conference party and could leave.",

          "Our family decided to take a day trip to this aquarium. Some of the reviews we read made us hesitant but we are glad that we checked it out for ourselves. The Aquarium refurbished an old power plant and they made great use of the space. The fish displays and display areas",

          "Visited the Cleveland Aquarium and was truly amazed. They took an old building and turned it into something very educational. It's not the largest aquarium , but they did a very good job . It's a must see if you are visiting.",
          "Having gone to our share of aquariums, this is still a must see. Does not take long to walk through but still enjoyable. So take your time. I could have watched the octopus and rays forever. Nice variety of fresh and salt water. Pretty sure the biggest variety of turtles in one",
          "Awesome experience with the family. I had my adult child my husband (47), our 12 year old son and our 6 year old daughter. They loved it. Had a variety of fish, organized by geographic location, local lake fish first, south american fish and so forth. Plus side! Awesome shark",
          "I love aquariums with shark tubes. The aquarium was set up to start off with Ohio wildlife, and work up to the sharks. We went on a Monday morning, which was great because we had the place mostly to ourselves. It was very educational, with a great collection of fish.",

          "One of the nicer aquariums I've visited. There were a lot of interactive exhibits and some of the largest fish I've ever seen. The tortoise exhibit was cool. There were 5-6 tortoises that you could pet and there were some toys in the exhibit so you could watch them play.",

          "When planning a vacation, we always try to see if a city has a zoo or aquarium. Luckily, Cleveland has both. The building that houses the aquarium is deceptive, as once you get inside there is more to see than expected. The exhibits were well done, but our favorites were the",

          "I thought the admission price was high for what it is. Like other reviews say, it does have some catching up to do. Some of the exhibits look like they weren't finished making them. I actually think the aquatics exhibits at the Cleveland Zoo is almost as good as this aquarium.",
          "I don't like poor reviews, but the admission fee is high. It's not so easy to get there, and expectations are too high. Unlike Cleveland's world-class museums, the aquarium is just not comparable to other cities aquariums; Atlanta, Baltimore, New Orleans, Sidney.",
          "The Grandkids (13 and 9) chose the aquarium over the zoo and other possible attractions. Even the 13 year old seemed to have a good time (she took a lot of photos with her phone). Just the right size for a couple hour visit.",
          "Some people think that this aquarium is too small, but I think it's just the right size. Kids have a limited attention span and energy level, but this aquarium is just the right size for most kids to make it through without a melt-down. Though the ticket price is a bit high,",
          "Compared to a lot of the Aquariums around the US and the world, this one has some catching up to do.",
          "It's not very big, and it wasn't worth the money to walk around in. Nothing different you can't see at the zoo! It was disappointing.",
          "If you haven't been in any aquarium before, it will be very nice experience. Even if you did, still can be fun. The place is well designed. Especially I can mention the old chimney with meduzas. Also, walking in a tunnel beneath the water is nice, especially when the sharks are",
          "I love the aquarium! There's fish of course, turtles, a tank to touch sting rays, a touch pool, and a tube to walk through the shark exhibit. It's a great time, but it is small and takes 2 hours max to get through. At $19.95 for adults and $13.95 for kids, its really hard to",
          "I always loved aquariums since I was a kid and my dad used to take me to my brothers to them when we were kids and after thirty years I still enjoy them. They are great places to take small kids so they can learn about the oceans (which are 70% of the Earth's surface) at a small",

          "I went to the aquarium when it first opened up and left disgusted. I remember when the basement of the \"Powerhouse\" had a comedy club and \"Howling at the Moon\" tavern with dueling pianists...somehow making it into an aquarium by a private concern seemed ridiculous for Cleveland.",
          "This is a very nice aquarium to visit. Its a good experience and the shark tunnel is great. You wont see Shamu here but its definitely worth the visit",
          "We stopped here in June with my sister and my niece and we thought it was very nice. And yes, it IS a bit smaller than most Aquariums, but the Stingray exhibit and the Shark Tunnel were worth the trip. It's just a little pricey for what might take you maybe 90 minutes to",
          "The Aquarium was really a great place to take kids and adults. I was surprised that it was not all that large and pricey, but it was fun to see. The sharks were amazing. They had divers in with the sharks that interacted with the guests. That was fun. My kids are older and",
          "Fun for everyone, lots to learn if you stand and read every sign. Employees walking around with reptiles you can interact with. Definitely geared towards kids (but I'm a big kid a heart). And aim to be there for 3pm! Stingray feeding time was a spectacle, even if you're not",
          "Even though the exhibits are not as extensive as other aquariums that I've visited, they are well presented, with informative signage, and a nice selection of fish representing virtually all the regions in the world. There are quite a few \"hands on\" experiences that will appeal",
          "With a couple hours to kill, we stopped here to see the aquarium..It was definitely worth the stop. My Granddaughter got to feed the Rays (for an additional $2). They have a great shark tank with some really big ones.",
          "We visit aquariums whenever we can and this one was one of the better ones we have been to. Well organized and maintained. Big enough to warrant the price of admission.",
          "My family and I have gone here twice. They have a very unique assortment of marine life and the displays are interesting. It is kind of expensive for the size. It cost $50 for three people (two adults and a 3 year old). It only takes about an hour to get through, unless you",
          "The aquarium is located in a run-down area of town. It is also very difficult to find. However, it is worth the effort to find it. Great for kids as well as the entire family.",
          "Recently, we went back to the Cleveland Aquarium! I feel the tanks and information on the fish is limited! You wind through the aquarium to end up in the Gift Shop which is highly overpriced! Good elevelators to get up and down are limited to nil! Eating is available, however",
          "After hearing so many mixed reviews about the CLE aquairum I finally went. Pro: Extremely clean!!! I've never seen such clean water in a aquairum! Not too crowded. Easy to see all the animals. The shark tunnel is very cool! Con: Expensive for the size. Even though the",
          "I am a native Clevelander and this was my first time to the aquarium. The admission cost of $19.95 for adults ($14.95 children) seemed a little high but if you check the website there are different disocunts you could take advantage of (we got $4 off each ticket just for wearing",
          "Loved the exhibits. Really liked the planning of benches throughout for the public to rest and at same time really enjoy the exhibits. Noticed older couples resting and pointing out to each other something they noticed in tank, looked like they were really enjoying themselves",
          "It was more to get in than I would have though for an attraction of i's size. But the place is well laid out and the exhibits are nicely done. The tunnel through the tank is pretty awesome.",
          "The staff in the aquarium is very knowledgeable and friendly. They offered information about any animal or attraction we asked about as well as offering before we even asked. They were also very patient with my three year old nephew.",
          "We went and spent about hour and a half, very nice for a small aquarium, favorite part is the shark exhibit very cool! Hope the museum grows a bit , did think it was a bit pricey but realize how expensive it must be to maintain the habitats for living creatures. Nice for our",
          "This aquarium was just average. It was small and only took around an hour to walk through at most. The best thing was the tunnel at the end. The worst thing was actually trying to find the aquarium-got turned around and lost a few times. Plus you have to pay for parking.",
          "We went before school let out on a weekday zoo we were basically the only ones there. The staff was so friendly, even when my two year old was running around everywhere. They have a touch pool and I was able to touch the sting rays without having to wait. They seemed to come",
          "How wonderful that the old powerhouse by the Flats was transformed into a decent aquarium with a good variety of creatures, guaranteed to delight every child at heart. Even the original smokestack was creatively repurposed into a home for a host of moon jellyfish that magically",
          "I was like a kid in this place!! Very clean exhibits & well placed tanks. The price is a bit steep! Lots to see, live shark feeding was wow!! Hot dogs pizza type fare in above area. Elevator for those whom need it.. Gift shop in the space too I loved it Will go back!!!",
          "I was glad to see that Cleveland finally has an aquarium. That being said, it could be much better than it is. The aquarium is relatively small, but I have been to excellent small aquariums before, and thus size alone is not a major problem. The aquarium has a larger than",
          "I have not been to the aquarium for quite a while, but I was disappointed with the cost vs. the experience. We were through the whole thing in almost 40 minutes. I felt the cost was a bit too high for the amount of attractions in the building.",
          "We thought that this was pretty small for a big city aquarium. You did get to pet sting rays and a tortoise. We liked that it showcased fish that are native to Ohio.",
          "Spent a couple hours they have a few cool displays like touching stingrays, Jellyfish, and the shark tunnel. This aquarium is geared more to kids.",
          "Actually \"poor\" is too low and \"average\" is too high a rating. We found perhaps half the staff helpful, the other half completely ignored everyone or sometimes rude. Even though they weren't very busy, one staff suggested that my 5 y.o. granddaughter, who was enthralled with",
          "We needed to kill time before a family event, because who goes to Cleveland on vacation, right? After checking the aquarium's web site and noted it said visits average 90 minutes, we thought we would give it a shot. Our GPS had us on Fulton for 2 miles. Do not take this route if",

          "VERY nice aquarium. You can easily do this in a day. Very well maintained. The animals looked heathy and happy. I took my granddaughter - she had a great time. A GREAT place for kids. Thanks; we had fun. You can actually pet stingrays here!! And they are friendly and seem",
          "Went to the aquarium with our 3 year old grand daughter. She thought it was great, but my wife and I thought it left a lot to be desired. The exhibits were small and there weren't that many. Unless you're really into aquatic life and you read every description on every exhibit,",
          "The price was very high for what it was. You have to also pay for parking. It is in a very scary part of town, We were very disappointed by how small it was and the large amount of fish native to the area and not so much tropical. We went thru in less than one hour, and",
          "This Aquarium has a beautiful walk through aquarium. It is rarely crowed and a great trip for preschoolers. a little on the expensive side but I wouldn't miss a day trip if you are in Cleveland. It is a former power plant so it has old brick walls and wood floors. Great feel.",
          "I love aquariums. We were really looking forward to coming here after seeing all the press it received when it opened. In fairness it is still under construction but it only took us an hour to get through. There are not a lot of exhibits and the signage is average. The final",
          "The aquarium is like an aquarium building I have never seen before. It used to be a power plant, so that explains why it looks the way it does. We did two animal encounters, one w/ a baby alligator and then w/ an African turtle (forget what kind). The tortoise they had there was",
          "I've been to a lot of aquariums around the US (Monterey Bay is still the 5 star standard in our country), and Cleveland is a great aquarium. Unique tanks (many of which you can actually see in through the top if you are decently tall). A great selection of local and foreign",

          "Absolutely loved this little aquarium. It's Charming and the staff were amazing. Answering all our questions and chatting with us. We loved the old historical building and the repurposing of it. The fish are in beautiful tanks and you can tell they are well taken care of. I have",

          "When this first opened, was not impressed. Thought it was a lot of money to take our grandkids to for what you saw. But it is getting better & better. After visiting the Brooklyn Aquarium this month, we have a wonderful aquarium. Although it always feels dark in these",
          "This was a nice experience. The tanks are not just simply built into the walls. You can walk around some of the tanks. The tunnel with sharks swimming over your head was great! We got to pet giant turtles and stingray. It was a fun day.",
          "It was too cold to go sledding, so we took our 7 year old granddaughter to the Aquarium. She loved it! The staff was very friendly, and patient with all her questions. There were special activities also that were coordinated with the exhibits. Hoping to return again.",
          "The Aquarium is small, however, it has interesting things to see such as: Sea Horses, turtles, sting rays and shark tunnel. Its a good place to visit for a few hours. The Adult only parties are fun.",
          "Great place to visit anytime, but even better when it's so cold outside. Visited there with the grandkids. Don't miss it.",
          "This aquarium is on the smaller side but it is very well maintained and has some great things to see. The shark tank and tunnel is of course the main attraction but we also enjoyed the turtles and reef displays as well. You don't need a whole day to experience this aquarium",

          "I wish I could rate their membership policy separate from the aquarium. The aquarium itself is quite nice. No, it is not Shedd, Boston or Baltimore, but it was nice enough. Lots of species and lots of \"walk around\" exhibits vs just looking at a flat exhibit. This let you",

          "My review is similar to many others...the aquarium is nicely done, excellent staff, and perhaps a tad small. Yes, it only contains one of the super large tanks (the walk through shark tank) that are numerous at the larger aquariums, but that shouldn't take away what it does",
          "As long as you do not expect a Chicago-type huge aquarium, bringing the kids here for a morning or afternoon is a nice way to pass some time. The petting of the sting rays was a big hit with kids when I was there. Prices are not as high as when first opened now that the Jacobs",

          "This is an OK aquarium. I actually liked the interior design of this place, which seems to be reflecting the old powerhouse (it was converted into the current GCA). As for the actual exhibit... well... first of all, I think the presentation of the local Great Lakes fish fauna",
          "Took my husband on a trip downtown for his birthday. We got the ticket that allowed us to go \"behind the scenes\". Saw how they and what they feed the fish. Watched scuba divers and generally got to see how the daily work was done. It was so much fun to do that and worth the",
          "We went on a Monday and it was not crowded. The kids loved all the fish, while the adults had a chance to ask many questions about them. Carmen was a great encyclopedia of marine life and spent ten minutes answering our questions about the tortoises. I lived how the aquarium was",
          "Although it's not likely I will return, I will admit my boyfriend and I still had a nice time. Firstly, we had a hard time finding it. There didn't seem to be any signs leading to it and once we actually reached it, we were honestly a bit nervous to go inside, still unsure that",
          "My wife and I have never been to the Aquarium in Cleveland, so on a grey and cool day we decided to go there. We were there on Wed and the place was quiet, so we were able to wander and around and interact with the staff. The staff that we meet were all young and very interested",

          "It's $19.95 for adults and $17.95 if you are over 60. I didn't expect it to be that good but it was. Watching those sharks up close is amazing. It's a great place and well worth the money. We were there on a Saturday at 1:30 Pm and they had a couple of divers in the tanks. These",
          "Let me start off by saying, I hate giving bad reviews...but this one is necessary. I saw all these wonderful reviews and was looking forward to spending some time during our roadtrip at the aquarium with my boyfriend. First...this place is not in a nice area by any means...",
          "We have been meaning to get to the aquarium since it opened, and finally made it there despite hearing from others that it was small and not worth the entry price. While it was a bit pricey, we saved money by parking on the street and walking over. We were very pleasantly",
          "We love the aquarium. It isn't cheap, and it is small compared to those in Boston and Baltimore, but most of the tanks reach to the ground, and our 2 year old LOVES that he can see everything. The aquarium has a great diversity of fish, and it is extremely well laid out. The",
          "It's completely insane to me that this place only has ~3 stars (as of this writing). The exhibits are clean and give ample space to all the critters; the different rooms evoke the places you might find these creatures in the wild. In one particularly sneaky room, it doesn't seem",
          "We should have realized when there were no signs to find this place, or when the parking lot was empty. Or when there was no line to get in. But we purchased our tickets online (with memories of the Cincy Aquarium in our minds) so we were going in. It's just really, really",
          "This aquarium was one of the smallest we have visited, but what it lacks in size is made up in character. The building itself was great, and I loved the openness of the exhibits. Everything was very clean and pleasing. The shark feeding was a favorite! I would recommend a",
          "The GCA was a pleasant visit with my wife. The shark tube was really awesome and we enjoyed learning about the Great Lakes aquatic life. Not the biggest aquarium, but for the Cleveland area, it is nice...might be a nice visit during the cold winter months. Only compliant I have",
          "We visited on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Had a little trouble finding it, but what a cool way to reuse an old building! We loved that it wasn't torn down & a new building built. It was much neater in this historical building. What a surprise to read a sign that says: \"Look",

          "We are avid animal seekers and were very disappointed. The cost is probably twice what it should be considering you can tour the aquarium in an hour. Most of the fish are local to the Great Lakes. The touch tank area is okay but not natural as workers gathered the animals in",
          "My daughters and I truly enjoyed visiting the aquarium. Understand that this is the first of two aquariums that we have been to so my relativity may be a bit limited as a result. The pricing for the Cleveland aquarium seemed a bit high to me but I didn't mind paying it if it",
          "It's nice and new, but, needs more fish and sea animals in here. The best part is the Gift Shop, lots of items to choose from, and not very expensive for Gift Shop. The walk ways, which are tunnels are very nice, as overhead in the Shark section, is glass encased tanks, where",

          "Most Clevelander's are sorely disappointed that Cleveland didn't get the world class aquarium it had hoped for and that the Great Lakes deserves. Save your money and instead visit the Cleveland Zoo, Natural History and Art Museums and Cleveland Botanical Garden-these last 3 all",
          "We got lucky and parked nearby for free. I thought it was a bit pricey for what they had but my niece was working there as part of her schooling and she kind of gave us personal tour. They had some divers in wet suits in one tank trying to get some fish out to clean tank.",

          "Let me start by saying I have a 15 month old son. A little odd there were no street signs or directions. When we parked we paid $6, not the advertised $5... not a big deal I suppose... $19.something for entry per person, kids under 2 are free good amount of fish tanks, local",
          "Spent the day with my 8 year old grandson. It was affordable. There were many hands-on exhibits to keep him interested. There was plenty of parking. The view of Cleveland's lakefront is visible which is always nice to see.",
          "Many reviewers have commented that this aquarium is not big and that therefore it is not worthwhile. This is a misconception! It was lovely! It took us about an hour to tour it, which was fine. The GCA used the original brick powerhouse in the Flats neighborhood of Cleveland.",
          "It is definitely not worth the money they were charging for admittance. We took our 3 granddaughters and it took us less than 45 minutes to go through the entire place. Was highly disappointed to say the least. I was at the aquarium in Chattanooga, Tn years ago and at that",
          "It's a bit expensive for a fairly small aquarium but it is nicely done. Myy kids enjoyed it and we spent a coupe of fu ours there. The shark tank was the best part and where we spent most of the time.",

          "We have been to the aquarium a couple times & I am still not convinced it is worth the money spent. It is quite expensive for tickets. I will say that the second time I've gone, there was more there- so maybe it will get better over time. I do want to say that management is",
          "We took our grandkids there on a summer day that was extremely hot and threatening thunderstorms. Perfect thing to do on a day like that. Hate that area of Cleveland and would never have even considered going there with just the kids. Husband had a day off work and he knows",

          "The location is a bit rough to get to, but the building is nice. The actual aquarium, though, wasn't really worth the price of admission: Adults (13+): $19.95, Children (2-12): $13.95, Seniors (60+): $17.95. These prices have been reduced since the original opening, when an",
          "You call THIS an aquarium? I call it Pet Smart! This isn't a REAL aquarium -- I've been to those --this place is a wanna-be and an embarrassment to the city. Also, the amount they charge for admission is highway robbery. The best thing that could happen would be to shut it",
          "It took me a while to decide to actually go here as all I heard were complains about the price & how small it was. Except coming from a city with no attractions this place is great. I am 31 years old and loved it. All the exhibits are super easy for all children to see and be up",
          "With our 3 kids the cost to enter was $93 - which incl. 3 passes to feed the rays - and although it was nice it only took us barely 90 min to go through the entire place. The ray feeding was the highlight but could not help soften the blow of how much it cost.",

          "We have been to several aquariums across the country and this one does have some nice features. The big tank to pet the rays is great and a few of their displays are made really uniquely, it's just overpriced. It's $20 for adults and I think it's really worth about $12.95 to",

          "The Aquarium is a for-profit business that has a *few* more aquatics than they do at the Cleveland Metropark Zoo. The shark tube is pretty neat, but Zoo admission is 1/3 the price. It takes about 10 minutes to go through the Aquarium with a toddler. Overall, it is a nice space",
          "Okay, so they are trying. But they need to try harder. Its a decent aquarium, but for $20 a person, we were expecting something much more. The Cleveland museum has lots of good hype, but it didn't seem much different from the mall aquarium we visited here in Phoenix for a much",

          "Way more there than I expected!! The exhibits were beautiful, and very well taken care of,and the staff was wonderful, and knowledgable.  My favorite part was the octopus. It was very active and could see it very well.",
          "My grandson and I had a great time at the Aquarium! He really enjoyed the brightly-colored fish.",
          "Nice displays but not very large.  Good re-use of older industrial building",
          "Very neat but short, I wish the area's of exotic fish were bigger. Favorite part is the aquarium tunnel and the stingrays petting area.",
          "We had a great time here, my family and I. Pretty cool maze like set up, with a lot of marine life. Here, you can reach in and rub the sting rays as they swim by. Also, walking through the shark tunnel added a little suspense to this local adventure.",
          "Be sure to feed the sting rays! Really a great place to visit. Loved it.",
          "good for a cleveland aquarium. small but a nice place. a little expensive with 3 children really took our time and was done in about 2 hours. cafe needs help",
          "86 plus dollars for two adults n 3 kids... Very short time there but kids loved it... Touching sting rays. Was cool.. Sharks /tunnel was great... Kid playroom on second floor was horrible... Nothing to do... But overall good time.. Get there by 10:30...",
          "I would recommend this aquarium to anyone who is thinking of even remotely visiting the Cleveland, Ohio area. You may spend on average an hour or so going through here. There is a sting ray area as well where you can touch the sting rays. I \u2026",
          "My son and I did an overnight at the aquarium this weekend.  This was our first visit, and it did not disappoint.  My son loves sea creatures, and he was just over-the-moon at how close you could get to the sharks and stingrays, and we \u2026",
          "After finally finding the place,  the building was huge on the outside...plenty of parking,  fairly clean and nice overall...$40 for 2 adults, showed my veteran ID and not sure if I even got my discount...the display showing was so small \u2026",
          "Very helpful and friendly staff. The exhibits and atmosphere are excellent. Many great and beautiful fish to admirer. Very clean restrooms which is a must when kids are visiting.",
          "Fun place to visit with great exhibits. Great place for children of all ages.",
          "It was set up very nice,but without the two for 1 it was overpriced.It has a home with windows on the river,so could be added",
          "Some very cool exhibits here. Loved the underwater glass tunnel. Parking was easier than expected.",
          "Went some time back. Nice place and large area.",
          "We went with students from school. The tour guide was good at getting the students to express what they were observing since we are a inquiry school. So, getting them to observe and voice observations were a great lesson.",
          "Awesome place. The fish looked reasonably content and great employees. 10/10 would come again. Great variety of aquatic life.",
          "Kids can\u2019t tell the difference but its old and out dated. Large array of sharks and stingrays, nothing else is special for adults.",
          "Great place to see marine life. Great for families with short attention spans. You can get in and out in under an hour. Membership is worth it for locals!!!",
          "Decent for its size. Enjoyed the interactive exhibits (kid and adult friendly). Got to high five a stingray and touch a sea urchin!",
          "It's ok...kids enjoyed... but costly to me...Haven't seen the new renovations yet so could be worth it now. .",
          "Great place!! My 1 year old loved all the dishes and scuba divers",
          "Really great place to go on a rainy day! So many great exhibits and things to look at that you'll want to give a good chunk of your day to the Aquarium. They do feeding sessions, informational movies and talks throughout the day that you don't want to miss!",
          "Great place to take the kids you can let the sting Ray's and they have a little tank on the side to for the kids to put there hands in and touch sea urchans, star fish, get a manicure by the shrimp, and other little creatures!",
          "Really enjoyed there.\nAlthough I was alone but yet that was very excited experience full of interesting and interesting things.\nDozens of different ocean creatures, I never seen before.\nI wished my family would be with me. I will strongly recommend to every one to visit this place with family members specially children. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc90",
          "Kids loved it, they even fed the stingrays. Not bad to take the kids for an afternoon.",
          "The aquarium was pretty fun. Lots of customers during the holiday break and rhe eating facility was, as usual, horribly understaffed. Please sell the dining concession to someone who actually wants it. We left and ate elsewhere. You can't \u2026",
          "Nice place but not for the price.  And we went with a 2 for $20 special  and still don't think it was worth it!",
          "It's a great little aquarium, but I feel that the price for tickets plus parking are too high. It seems to have improved since I went when it first opened. But I said then that I would not pay to go again. I only went a second time because my company paid for tickets and parking.",
          "It's a great place to visit and the sharks and the tortoise were my favorites.",
          "Enjoyable small aquarium.  Nicely decorated.  My  9 year old wanted to go again as soon as we finished the first go round.",
          "While it isnt as large as some major aquariums, the exhibits are great and it was definitely worth the trip!",
          "My daughter sees something different everytime we go. Always have fun!",
          "The Cleveland Aquarium hosted a great overnight for my scout group. They taught us a lot about different species, and feeding the Stingrays was an amazing opportunity.",
          "Their freshwater aquariums are ok the discus fish have some bad rot on them it was sad to see and usually caused by poor water conditions in aquariums. The saltwater section ok at best until I got to the shark aquariums seeing the sharks \u2026",
          "Great use (or should I say \"re\"use) of this space.",
          "This is a great place... I love to bring my son",
          "My first time there I enjoyed it so much favorite exhibit was the stingrays",
          "Great exhibits in an historic building.  They have a wide variety of fish and reptiles from all over the world.  The building itself and the setting were interesting and the displays were set up so that guests could have close up access to \u2026",
          "I was blown away by the aquariums built within the original architecture! Amazing!",
          "Great time, a lot of exhibits. People were very nice too.",
          "Overpriced! It was great for the four year old but it\u2019s very small and doesn\u2019t have much to offer. I was disappointed and can\u2019t imagine ever going back.",
          "Great place, and they are kind enough to host a sensory boo at the aquarium \u2665\ufe0f",
          "I had a absolutely amazing time! The staff was so friendly and had so much info to give!",
          "Great time! The kids were blown away. Definitely a must see.",
          "I will say the beginning is slightly disappointing, as several of the fish were cut and looked injured. But then suddenly the place opens up really large! Highly surprised! The last several exhibits were great.  Just concerned about the poor fellas at the beginning sections :(",
          "A great experience for me and my family. The kids loved the \"Touch Pool\" with the Stingrays and letting the cleaner shrimp crawl on their hands. However, I was a little surprised at the amount of money the day added up to. The Cleveland Zoo \u2026",
          "First time going and my.son loved the sharks and sting rays\u2764\u2764 we will be back!!",
          "Amazing price for the lovely exploration aquarium! Loved the shark tunnel. Amazing selection of aquatic animals!",
          "Not quite what I expected. Nice shark tank, everything else low key.",
          "Wow!!! Great place to visit with the family. Beautiful exhibits, great atmosphere and lots to see.",
          "I must say that I enjoyed the aquarium much more then I thought I was going to. There are many different attractions. We loved the Stingrays and the walk through tunnel. We will go back",
          "Love it!  Got the annual pass and I recommend you get one too!  Winter's coming and the pass now provides something indoor and awesome to do with my son!",
          "Took my little guy for the first time for us and it was well worth it. It is so beautiful there and is so amazing seeing all the different types of sea animals they have. My son got to touch stingrays and see the sharks eat up close. Will definitely be back",
          "This place is awesome for kids. They can pet the stingrays and touch starfish and urchins. They had a blast. The shark tank tunnel was the really cool. Would give 5 stars but i was expecting a little more for the price. We saw everything in \u2026",
          "Awesome place, absolutely loved the sting ray touch exhibit!",
          "Interesting place to visit, particularly enjoyed the walk-thru tunnel where you could watch sharks swim over your head.",
          "Amazing place! Amazing people! Awesome experience.",
          "This was a nice aquarium for $20. They had some of the coolest freshwater displays I've seen at aquariums. Really cool shark tank as well. If they get corals they will go up to 5 stars. They probably had like 3 corals total only. Coral \u2026",
          "Had almost everything. Except live aquatic plants. I thought there would have an aquascape area. To show all the different ones. Maybe they could have a contest to pick who designs it. Like the top five or six get a 100 plus gallon tank to make there styles.",
          "I had a great experience here. It was surprisingly more extensive than I thought. The building itself holds a lot of rich history and the exhibits were great. There was an underwater ocean tunnel and a stingray exhibit as well.",
          "For a small aquarium it is really nice. We did an overnight trip with a group and our students loved it. They let them sleep in the sea tube and the students were thrilled to be able to do so. The staff was very friendly and informative. \u2026",
          "A great day with the kids a really of Majors aquarium night it's kind of hard to handle the smell because of all the in the reptile",
          "The Aquarium is in a converted warehouse and really takes advantage of the space. We went in the late afternoon and were able to observe most of the animals, including sharks, being fed, which was really exciting. There is a play area \u2026",
          "My first time visiting the aquarium, very nice. A nice variety, much bigger than I expected. Would recommend visiting even if you don't have kids.",
          "We felt the price was pretty high for what they offered for two adults and two children it came to about $65. The shark Xzibit was supposed to be feeding and diving with the sharks and answering questions and my family walked around the \u2026",
          "Was told not to bother because it wasn't worth the money but it really is. Great exhibits and informative. Lots of fun for kids too.",
          "Great experience!! Staff were professional and friendly. Family and I will definitely come back.",
          "I love the Greater Cleveland Aquarium my favorite part is the shark exhibit however the entire aquarium is very knowledgeable the staff is knowledgeable and teach the children about marine biology",
          "Took friends from out-of-state with their little ones. They enjoyed the aquarium and staff near the stingray tank were friendly and inviting.  Liked how they used the fresh water section to showcase our Lake inhabitants too.  Among the salt \u2026",
          "I was there for a meeting. It went well so im assuming the actual aquarium must me nice.",
          "I had 9 children l brought and there was a total of 21 they hada awesome time. After we left l had the pleasure of taking 11 children too Chuckie Cheese and they had a great time. One little came over hugged me and kissed my cheek and told me THANK YOU!!!! He started out giving me thw hardest time. I won \ud83d\ude03",
          "Smaller than I expected but still really nice!",
          "This is a very nice aquarium. The shark tank and tunnel were very well done. I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more to see for the price (it cost $52 for my family of 3 to get in and only an hour to see.) but I understand the \u2026",
          "Wonderful eye-catching displays every step of the way. The shark/stingray tunnel was a family favorite! Also truly appreciated the scuba presentation; the two divers were great to watch/listen to. UPDATE: The schedule for \"Sharks & Scuba\" \u2026",
          "Very fun atmosphere, excellent selection of fish! 10/10 recommend",
          "I like the aquarium, but I LOVE the staff! They are all excellent,  knowledgeable, and hardworking! Well worth the price of admission.",
          "A great little aquarium however the price is out of touch for normal families.",
          "Neat small aquarium, worth the drive from canton. Only other aquarium I have been to is Monterey bay aquarium which is a whole other ballpark. Neat exibits showing the native speicies. And others from around the world. Our little one \u2026",
          "Kinda small...but very informative and great shark tank.",
          "Awesome place. Grandson loved it",
          "Awesome experience! Loved the stingray feeding. We had a blast! Staff was knowledgeable and kind and prices were reasonable. Thank you!",
          "Not your typical aquarium but it was still worth the money. They've renovated a historical building and put an aquarium inside. Sharks, native species, reptiles, and you can touch a ray if you wish. A really nice tunnel is definitely the highlight!",
          "Awesome shark tank with a walk-through tunnel",
          "What an amazing experience! Well worth it!",
          "Nice for the kids. The touching section is a huge hit for young kids. I wish they'd add more tanks every year.",
          "Small place but nice. The touch tanks and the large shark exhibit are the best parts. Be sure to find a coupon to save $5 per ticket, we got ours at the Cleveland visitors center. Maybe an hour worth of content.",
          "Went diving with the sharks. What a great experience. The staff is the best!  Thanks so much from Diane and Carl!!",
          "It is a nice aquarium, but is very small. That would be my only complaint.",
          "Awkward but not impossible for wheelchairs.  Ask for help\n  Love the mant feeding",
          "Worth the trip! Not your average acquarium at all!! For those reviews complaining it's not as big as a normal aquarium place yes it's not massive but I've never seen one built like this before. The entire place starts as a jungle then goes \u2026",
          "The kids love a good aquarium. This one is clean, vibrant, friendly... We learned a lot and saw many animals we've never seen before. Spend a couple of hours here before  moving on with our day.",
          "Cool little aquarium with lots of interesting fish and a nice walk through shark tank. You can also pet the sting rays. Not too big and not too crowded which made it perfect for my niece who is 7 and my daughter who is 3. \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Wonderful place for family. Beautiful creatures and will designed location.",
          "The Cleveland Aquarium is well worth the price! Which was not bad. We had a awesome time very  Family friendly",
          "Dang nature, you scary with sharks and stuff! They also have frogs, like, what? Frogs in an aquarium, bro? But it's cool. Way better than the little one at my house.",
          "This was the 1st aquarium I have ever been to, and my partner and I had an absolute blast. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. Had the opportunity to watch the sharks feed and they had a dive team in the shark tank talking about all the different species in the shark tank and such. Wonderful place!",
          "Great place to visit. Beautiful exhibits.",

          "A beautiful aquarium right in the heart of Cleveland! Lots of great restaurants and other sites right around the area. Parking is great too! It's a bit on the pricey side is the only drawback.",
          "Loved the way they repurposed the empty factory building.",
          "Wow, impressive aquarium! It's not huge by any means, but it's nice, natural looking, and not over crowed.  Worth the money, great location, and good way to spend an afternoon.",
          "This place is a very interesting thing to go to if your from Florida and moved to Ohio. They have a lot of creature you've never seen before. They weren't strict like most aquariums. They even let you touch and feed the stingrays, along \u2026",
          "Took a group from summer camp. Our guide miss Elise was very patient and informative. The children enjoyed the whole place. And especially liked the stingrays and sharks",
          "Adult Swim beer and wine tastings are sooo much fun!!!",
          "Hands down one of the best aquariums I have ever been to. Plenty of very nice tanks and nicely laid out. The interactive touch pools are very cool!! The shark tank is probably the best one I've ever seen.",
          "We visited the Greater Cleveland Aquarium with our 3 young children for the first time last week. First, I loved the transformation of an old building into something wonderful and so informational for our children. I was also very impressed \u2026",
          "Small but nice. A little pricey.",
          "Located on the west bank of the flats, the Greater Cleveland Aquarium provides a family friendly venue among the decidedly adult fare of the flats. The aquarium houses a wide variety of fish and marine invertebrates, with an emphasis on \u2026",
          "Had a great time, just wish it was bigger.",
          "Fun place.  A little smaller than I expected.  The tortoises and the octopus were entertaining.  Shark tank was large enough to enjoy the variety of animals inside. \n\nIn response to comments from the aquarium and to clarify, we felt the \u2026",

          "They have a lot more than aquatic life than expected and my grandchildren has a blast..",
          "Wasnt as big as I thought It was gonna be. Definitely not worth $20 a person",
          "I had a wonderful time and I enjoyed the aquarium.",
          "Never knew that there was an aquarium in Cleveland. Enjoyed the visit. I liked the tunnel because you were able see the sharks from underneath. Questions were answered by the staff and they were super friendly.",
          "The sharks were awesome!! & being able to touch the sting rays and starfish/sea urchins but feel that it's a little over priced. I usually pay less to go to the Zoo and there is much more to see at the Zoo. Overall was nice but we were in and out in less than an hour.",
          "For me the overall experience was quite okay. If you love aquatic animals and enjoy looking at various species of fish or amphibians then this might be the place for you. Kids might enjoy as over 60% of the guests present were kids and \u2026",
          "This was awesome touching the stingray was so cool.",
          "Compact aquarium compared other US aquariums.  It's in a renovated building of past Cleveland probably.  Exhibition explanation is very simple and filled with energetic families. \nBehind the aquarium, there are a ruined Rolling bascule \u2026",

          "2 for 20 deals made it busy but we still got to see everything",
          "I first visited the aquarium in 2011, now 8 years and 2 kids later the Cleveland Aquarium has gotten better. Had my sons birthday here and he along with my family enjoyed ourselves tremendously. Still kind of expensive for a family of four \u2026",
          "Went there to board Lolly the Trolly. Best tour of Cleveland.  Great tour guide and so many unknown facts about Cleveland revealed . Will do the tour again as too much to take in.",
          "Good experience for me and my family.",
          "Great aquarium! Very clean. Just the right amount of info about each animal. Felt like it was smaller than I expected it would be but still a great time.",
          "A great variety of fish! Very cool scapes in the tanks and plenty of Information and fish facts. Only issue was that some of the signs next to the tanks that showed pictures and names of the stockings were missing some of the fish. But that's all! Love it very much!",

          "Small aquarium but layout & experiences were awesome.",

          "Was nice..  My family enjoyed.  I would go back again.  Was a little expensive.  My great grand baby only 2 and cost me 13$",
          "This is a nice aquarium. Yes you won\u2019t be exhausted and tired as it\u2019s relatively small but I really did like the layout. Now please don\u2019t expect to be blown away. Try Chicago or Baltimore aquarium, but this does hold a dear spot in my memories.",
          "Not the biggest Aquarium or one next to a beach, but the feel of Cleveland's Aquarium is amazing. It is an underwater experience like no other you will find. The largest underwater shark tunnel in America proces that we truly have it here \u2026",
          "I truly enjoyed the aquarium with my three year old grandson. I hope they have future plans to expand in this large building because it did feel a bit small. However, it is beautiful & the employees are very friendly. A good indoor activity \u2026",

          "Very diverse species of fish from all around the world. I loved walking through the shark tunnel, definitely made me feel like a kid again! I thought that the aquarium included a lot of cool information to learn about the sea animals.",
          "Was fun for mothers day but very packed and not as big as I would've thought. Does have a nice shark exhibit and can dive with sharks if certified but it does cost a pretty penny! Expensive fir what it was!",
          "Small but beautifully designed aquarium with a wide variety of fish and - my personal favorite - a shark tunnel! You can walk through and see the sharks and stingrays swim overhead. There's also a section dedicated to the fish of Lake Erie \u2026",
          "Awesome exhibits! The shark feeding and stingray petting are really cool. I think $20 per person is bit much for 45 minutes of content though.",

          "The kids wanted something fun to do and the price was right so we drove the few hours here from Marion Ohio and it did not disappoint us! The time is flying by because we are having so much fun and learning new things about aquatic animals and marine life I would recommend this place to anyone",

          "I was very skeptical and had heard not bad things before I went, so I took my good old time.  My son's wanted to go here so we did and I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a tad on the pricey end but it sis take us about an hour and a half to \u2026",
          "Seems small but awesome! Love the tunnel!!!",

          "The aquarium exhibits are pretty cool. The sharks are awesome, and the best part is touching the stingrays. However, the price is absolutely ridiculous for how small the aquarium is, and you have to pay for parking. You will see everything \u2026",

          "This place was great! I went here when I was a kid and it was an arcade. It's a little bit out of the way and hard to find if you're not looking for it. But it was great! I took my 13 year-old sister here and we had a blast! They have a lot \u2026",
          "Saw fish here I've never seen before at other places. Good fun and relaxing atmosphere.",
          "We love this place! We have a season pass and have had one almost every year since our first trip. It never gets old. They have so many exhibits and an interactive play area for children. They also have events throughout the day. If you go, make sure to look for the dog faced puffer fish!!",
          "Great place to spend the afternoon for a date. Seems like a great place to bring children. You can pay $2 to feed the stingrays which was fun. The place has a shark tunnel where you can walk through and the sharks/fish can swim all around \u2026",
          "Super fun and would be great for kids",
          "Not the biggest aquarium, but very distinct. The venue is very \"retro industrial\" in its use of a repurposed building. Have the big shark tank/tunnel and stringray petting, exhibits are nice. Location is cool, take the ferry to the other side of the water and have lunch. Overall a fun experience!",
          "Small but mighty.  Great tanks and exhibits. Very clean. Staff was knowledgeable and friendly",
          "Very cool aquarium with amazing exhibits of local and exotic animals. Stingrays pool is very cool, you'll he able to touch one if you're lucky enough. Shark tunnel is worth the price.of admission alone, very cool and immersive.",
          "Great place to visit with kids",
          "Loved it! Wish the plaques had more facts about the different species but it was a great way to spend a couple hours. The shark tunnel is awesome. The octopus is definitely my favorite though!",
          "Fun little aquarium with some pretty amazing fish. Always good to go when the divers are in the tank cleaning. What a show!",
          "All aquariums are good aguariums",
          "Tickets on sale all weekend but I got to work",
          "Kind of pricey for such a short exhibit but great for the kids",
          "I love it here! First of all, the Manta Ray touch tank is so cool! The shark tank is awesome. The idea that the sharks are swimming all around you (and above!) Is awesome! It feels like you are swimming with them! The gift shop is very \u2026",
          "Beautiful aquarium, love the sharks and have so many cool open tanks. I especially love that the building shows the history and educates others on how to help the environment. The gifts shop has a latge selection of cool items as well! Have been here twice and have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly as well.",
          "Ok selection of fish. Overpriced for all that's there.",
          "A Must See in the Cleveland area.  This aquarium is clean, the animals are well cared for, and the collection is very good.  My favorite part was the shark tunnel, where you feel as if you are under the water, and massive sharks are swimming by you and over your head.  I will be back when I return to this area.",
          "Got engaged here! Wonderful place to plan a proposal :) Lots to see, a little hard to get to the building, but not bad. Would recommend!",
          "Large aquarium with good variety of local and international fish and other wildlife. Wonderful staff! The shark feeding was cool to watch.",
          "Isnt what I expected for an aquarium but was a nice place.",
          "Great time! Shark exhibit was excellent!",
          "Nice little aquarium for kids, but it's not very large. Will take between an hour or two to get through the whole thing in most cases.",
          "Having been to many aquariums around the world, Cleveland Aquariums is not as large as others but for a very reasonable admission fee,  it has more than you would expect. Staff is friendly,  tanks are clean and many varieties of fresh and salt water aquatic species to see.",
          "Great to take the kids to, I've been with my family several times. Really well done in a cool location.",
          "The aquarium was a lot of fun with kids. The shark tunnel was my sons favorite. We also enjoyed the easter egg hunt.",
          "Cute and fun for your family but dont think its aquarium like big cities it has it's own take on aquarium that I think it's cool and artsy in a way",
          "Had a great time very informative.",
          "Great place to take the children they had a blast",
          "We loved the aquarium! We are a family of five and for us it's better to get the family pass. If we go twice it pays for itself. Anyway, it's not the biggest aquarium but it is really nice. Can get crowded but it's still worth it. The \u2026",
          "This is a surprisingly excellent aquarium! We went in expecting something similar to a Sea Life or Ripley's but this aquarium offers a bit more. It seemed about the same size as one of those but the layout, atmosphere and species on display \u2026",
          "This was a great day to spend with my family and everyone enjoyed going there so much!! It is pricey, but worth every penny with all the great displays to look at. The shark tank and the various others are so much worth looking at and \u2026",
          "This aquarium is awesome!! We have been to many and this one takes the cake. Make sure and ask for the behind the scenes tour.",
          "So much fun. Kids can touch some of the aquatic animals. Very nice.",
          "Great place! Was here for my husband's work party, he catered food was delicious, staff friendly and helpful and exhibits large and well maintained.",
          "Great place to go with the family. I loved the variety of fish and other aquatic creatures. My toddler especially loved the shark tank tunnel. While a bit pricey, definitely worth a visit.",
          "Dark, steep stairs, very small for cost. But my nephew had a good time. Exhibits were clean and animal appeared well taken care of.",
          "Good variety of aquatic life. It has sharks (plural).",
          "Interesting & well maintained aquarium with diverse sea life exhibits. Good place to take young children. Ticket price is a bit high; however, considering the cost to caring for these gorgeous creatures, feels like more of a bargain. Cafe \u2026",
          "Great place for children not too expensive either everyone should check it out if you live in Cleveland.",
          "It's nice, but rather small. Can be completely toured in 2 hours.",
          "Was alright, but mostly fresh water fish and plant life. Was hoping for more salt water stuff. Hardly had any coral or invertebrates. Your local pet store probably has more coral than the aquarium.",
          "I'm a Greater Cleveland resident so I'm sorry to say that the Cleveland Aquarium pales in comparison to a zoo aquarium exhibit at the Columbus Zoo!  Too much fake coral.  Take a page from what they're doing in Columbus instead of making excuses about damaging the Coral Reefs by not bringing in live coral.",
          "It wasn't bad of a place I really liked it. It's a lot smaller then I thought it would be for the price. I don't think it's worth the money for the tickets and having to pay for parking as well. I understand it costs money for up keep and feed the fishes and animals. But still.",
          "Great aquarium! Just the right size to hold your attention for ~ 3 hours. The octopus and shark tunnel were highlights, but all exhibits were well designed and kept you flowing through at the right place. The building is very neat, historic \u2026",
          "If you want to go to a nice aquarium drive down to Gatlinburg, TN and go to Ripley\u2019s Aquarium. The Cleveland aquarium is nice, but for the price there isn\u2019t nearly enough exhibits. If you stand and admire each exhibit you\u2019ll get through in \u2026",
          "Very cool seeing sharks swim above and beside you",
          "This was a pretty cool place, although it was a little difficult to get to because the bridge was closed. Once we found the detour, it was easy to find.\n\nWhen you first walk in, there are stairs, but there is also an elevator if you need \u2026",
          "Our family enjoyed the aquarium! From us adults, teenage boys and young girls. Everyone had a blast! Took about an hour to walk through.",
          "One of our favorite go to places in the winter.",
          "We had a fantastic time !",
          "Always a great time here. Animals are very well taken care of.",
          "Kind of small but excellent for kids. Well cared for!",
          "The kids enjoyed it but the price is not enjoyable.   A boat ride on the lake may have achieved the same level of kid excitement. \ud83d\ude09",
          "Really liked the shark tunnel tank.",
          "So fun! Great place to stop for a little adventure while in the area. Interesting exhibits and it is awesome to interact with the stingrays!",
          "Awesome place to go very nice",
          "Beautiful and educational. They have retained some features of the former power building and turned them into educational tools.",
          "Great little aquarium!",
          "Very fun. Lots of interesting displays. Displays are clean with many interesting fish and wildlife. Sting Ray touch tank. Giant shark tank with walk through tunnel inside, so you can see the fish swimming over you. We did an overnight with the cub scouts, and got to sleep in the shark tank tunnel.",
          "Very nice,wonderful location on the water downtown...great staff very friendly!!",
          "Excellent family outing..!!",
          "This was a great place to spend the day.  Very cool that it's in a repurposed power plant!",
          "Enjoyed our visit, especially the shark tank!",
          "It was a lot of amazing fish and other beautiful fish \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b",
          "17$ for couple fishes..meh. The octopus was pretty cool.",
          "Kind of small for the price but we just went through it twice. Don't expect anything like Atlanta or Chicago's aquarium and if you do your kid(s) will probably enjoy themselves and you might too! Good for a rainy day. Parking is confusing \u2026",
          "Expected so much more",
          "Excellent way to spend your afternoon! It\u2019s a bit smaller than I would have liked but they have a lot to see and do. Enjoy",
          "Even tho small,always fun for the kids!!!!",
          "Love this place!, Always a good time and a really great place to take the kids. I'm always amazed at the giant shark tank. Protip: Bring some cash to feed the rays; it's super fun!",
          "My family and i loved everything about The Aquarium.",
          "First things first... I couldn't believe how small this Aquarium was, and finally the main kicker it's not worth the money at all for what this establishment charges. The whole experience/tour/walk-thru literally was no longer than about a \u2026",
          "Awesome time, took about an hour to walk through. Cool way to burn some time in downtown Cleveland.",
          "So many exhibits and very friendly and informative staff",
          "Wish it was bigger still great place",
          "Lots of fun! The kids I loved the search and find for a chance to win a membership! Such a cool experience and many memories made including but not limited to feeding the stingrays. I would definitely go back. I wish the price wasn't so \u2026",
          "Awesome so much fun",
          "Absolutely loved this place!",
          "Amazing experience! Fun for the whole family \u263a\ufe0f",
          "Attended a small wedding. Room was a bit dark, however, enough light to see and take photos. Chairs were next to large window tank full of predatory fish. Ceremony was perfect performed by Rev. James Hary.",
          "Pretty small and already feels out dated.",
          "Good for kids but admission is so expensive for what you get to see. In and out in less than an hour.",
          "Such a fun and educational place! The manta rays were beyond adorable!!",
          "Took my girl friend and her mom and had a great time. Keep up the good work.",
          "Good for kids under 10..",
          "Very nice but pricey, I've been to Newport Aquarium near Cincinatti and it much bigger and has more to see and I don't remember complaining about the price. That's the only thing I frowned upon besides paying to park AND spending over $50 for 2 adults and a 3 yr old for admission...Staff was nice and very knowledgable.",
          "Cool fish, nice aquarium. Had a good time here with my neices.",
          "Very nice place. Great for kids. A lot of different animals.",
          "Love the aquarium...took my grandson and he loved it too...we looked at every last specimen ....and fed the stingrays from our hands...handy parking (not free)...the walk through tube with all the fish is cool and educational...",
          "It's a bit pricey, especially if you have a family. The kids enjoyed it. The staff is friendly and helpful. The tunnel is a major highlight for the kids. The hands on experience was sensational.",
          "Not cheap but very good aquarium, similar to cincinatti aquarium in size and features. Only negative is no nearby good food options.",
          "Great place to take kids",
          "I love the aquarium! My favorite part is the stingray touch tank. It's thrilling to be able to feel the fish and gets hands on with them. The entire location is a fun adventure from start to finish. The octopus and sharks are also a sight to marvel at. Definitely recommend visiting.",
          "This place blew my mind. I didn't expect to see such amazing things inside this place. There are massive fish here, sharks, stingrays that come up and you may touch them if you choose. A little tide pool petting zoo thing, and my favorite \u2026",
          "I'll be honest, it's underwhelming and a little over priced. \n\nI understand that the structure that this aquarium is built upon was already an existing structure but perhaps that's the worst part. It severely limits that capabilities that \u2026",
          "The problem with this aquarium is that for such a big price tag, it is very small. Not a very good aquarium.",
          "Was there with my family.  Lots of different fish. Had a great time.",
          "We did have a great time but it was $60 for 3 (plus a 1yo who was free). I just wish there was more bc it only took 2 hours to get through and that was with 15-20 min of trying to touch a songs ray. But the kids found it interesting. I \u2026",
          "Would definitely go again",
          "Wish it was bigger, but they do a good job",
          "A bit pricey for what's included but not bad",
          "Loved it! Great place to visit and learn all about the different kind of fish from different countries. Nice food court and a playroom for children. Lots of things to explore here. Definitely recommending to family and friends! We also \u2026",
          "Never been there before. Advertisement made it seem much larger than it was. Reserved whole day for family to go but only took a few hours to see entire aquarium. Was still nice for family but small",
          "Fantastic variety of aquatic species! Amazing displays. Very friendly staff and educational and informative!",
          "We were visiting CLE for a wedding. I volunteer at the SC Aqarium and always visit an aquarium whenever possible. I was pleasantly surprised as I had been told by several people that it was a quick walk thru - NOT SO!\nIt's intimate and \u2026",
          "We have a family membership. My whole family and grandchildren love it. Everyone is helpful. We Will Probably Be Coming Every Weekend. Coming From Mansfield. :)",
          "Interesting aquarium. Lots of local species plus good variety of tropical fish. The shark tube was very cool.",
          "Was a nice set up but I feel like it cost a little bit too much for what you got. I was very underwhelmed.",
          "Shark tank is fascinating. Each exhibit area has different background music.",
          "Perfect size for small children",
          "Nice small but nice",
          "The aquarium is amazing and very different than the one in Chicago(in a positive way). The walk in tube was a unique experience. The sting ray touching tank was epic. It seems like the stingrays were trained to tease people. They would swim by closely then glide away as soon as you attempted to touch them. Entertaining.",
          "Very nice place to take your family! It is a smaller aquarium however it is clean and nice! We loved it! Will return.",
          "Fun, but our aquarium here in Chicago is free for residents one day of the week.",
          "My 15 month old loved the mostly low aqyarium walls, though the giant bullshark appropriately scared her. Clean tanks, fun fish, and the tunnel is outstanding.",
          "The displays are well lit with easy to read descriptions. They have feeding times with a docent to give mini lectures. Best part is that they have sharks! Plus a tunnel where the fish go over your head. My fav exhibit was the pale pink octopus.",
          "Not impressed. My husband and I love visiting aquariums. So of course we couldn\u2019t wait to go to one in our hometown. This is small and expensive. The price would be fine if it was an all day affair but we walked through in less than an \u2026",
          "Small, but really well laid out, very well lit, and an awesome collection of fish. The tanks are big, the fish are fun, and the atmosphere is immersive. Would absolutely go again, as they were under construction the last time I was there and so there's likely to be some new fish next time!",
          "The fish were cool but the place was very small and very dirty. The glass exhibits were not clean, too many people crammed in one space.",
          "Kids had a blast all the different types of fish and love the learning experience",
          "Pleasant place to bring your family for a day trip; it was quite awesome to be up close to the sting rays and be able to touch them. They offer a military discount!",
          "Take your time when walking through really enjoy, and look at the exhibits.  Aquariums have a tendency of being fairly short.  However, when I took my kids we were there for about 2 hours.  I made sure to point out the things they were \u2026",
          "Great  for a little family time",
          "I was at a wedding reception on the 3rd floor, a beautiful place. It was nice over looking the river",
          "The best are the sharks.",
          "A wonderful, friendly aquarium with extraordinary exhibits and great staff members.",
          "Cool place old power house turned into an awesome aquarium. Must visit when in Cleveland.",
          "Had fun there and took a lot pictures and videos. The place is good but it\u2019s not big enough to explore it.",
          "The best part is the tunnel walk thru where you can view the sand tiger sharks and cow-nosed Ray's swimming overhead. The other area is the touch tank area with lots of small sharks and rays swimming around for kids. Other than that the \u2026",
          "Pretty nice aquarium.",
          "This place was so cool. My favorite part was when scuba divers fed the sharks.",
          "It was super cool and the fish tanks were super well done it is short in comparison to other aquarium places.",
          "Small and the aquariums seem too small and boring for some of the fish.  Give them enrichment materials.",
          "Good place for kids...",
          "Great fun, petting tortoises & stingrays also a hoot!",
          "Nice aquarium just wish it were bigger.",
          "This was great place for a 2 hour visit. Smaller than some of the aquarium I have been too, however they have one the best fish tunnels you can find. Shark tank is a must stop and would be willing to catch the diving act that allows you to \u2026",
          "This place is great for the family and amazing go fo too!",
          "Great Aquarium! Love the big tank with the shark's!",
          "Great place to bring kids. Adult ticket prices could be slightly reduced, but they do give you coupons for free next visit for kids and food coupons for cafe. Exhibits are interactive and varied. My kids love it there and we have been back multiple times. Staff is helpful and great at educating.",
          "Awesome . got to feed the sting rays",
          "It's definitely cool having an aquarium in Cleveland, but it is SUPER over-priced for what it is. I feel like they should have a partnership with the zoo, to where if you have a membership to the zoo, you get a discounted rate to the \u2026",
          "Small aquarium, about average displays, stingray  fish pond stinks",
          "Expensive. The shark tunnel is fun and petting sting rays.",
          "They have added so much! The decorations are amazing. All the tanks are clean and there are tons of fish and lots of educational activities. We gotto touch and feed stingrays and touch some other sea life. The sharks and the octopus are \u2026",
          "Loved the aquarium! Not overly crowded and many animals to see. Loved touching the stingrays and seeing the sharks",
          "Really cool industrial setting - exhibits were also interesting! Glad we made time to visit.",
          "Great place to spend an hour or two with the sharks.",
          "Not worth the price. $40 for something you can walk through in under 15 minutes is not worth it. Not only that they took away the giant open area that had the tortoises... and they have had the same large construction area for over 2 \u2026",
          "Nice little aquarium.  Really neat building.  Felt a little over prived.",
          "Went through the shark tunnel AT LEAST 10 times. We loved it.",
          "We had a wonderful time at the aquarium. Scuba diving santa was such a fun thing for my son! Also there is a wonderful aquarium themed play space on the floor above the aquarium.",
          "This is such a memorable place for us. I proposed to my (now) wife here, and we have such a fond connection to this place.",
          "A lot of people complain about the cost. Not sure why. It is so expensive to maintain an aquarium so the prices are pretty nominal. Matter of fact our family of 5 got in for 70 bucks. If you think that's expensive check out the cost for \u2026",
          "Nice to visit if you've never been, but on the small side",
          "This place is wonderful however i struggled to find the restroom when i girst got there and im pregnant but over all a great time! And wonderful for kids! Definitely plan on going again! Priced around $20/adult parking today was $6.00 not bad considering it was $10 the 1st time we visited. Very neat",
          "Not as big as we thought but well informed staff was great",
          "Too crowded, in my opinion not worth $20 a person.",
          "My son loves sharks! We always have a great time but i cannot give 5 stars because its 60+ dollars for the 3 of us . Which for the size and whats here isnt worth it. We've gone to other aquariums for lower and gotten more out of it.",
          "Helpful staff and learning experience.",
          "It was an great experience, their were plenty of different fish to see, plus very well crafted scenery. The workers were all very nice and helpful and everything was very well kept and clean, the only problem I have is that it is alittle short for the price, but you do see alot and that does make it worth it.",
          "It's small but nice. They need more see animals.",
          "Really nice. I grew up going to the Aquarium on E. 72nd St. The new one downtown is amazing.",
          "We expected there to be much more to the aquarium. What they do have was very fascinating and enjoyable but for the price it wasn't enough.",
          "Great experience for the whole family.  We enjoy every visit.",
          "Boring very bland no color not even friendly",
          "Highly recommend!! It's a fanatic place!! Sharks are great!!",
          "Amazing aquarium! Well worth the entry price.",
          "labs? Go there late in the afternoon and sit by an aquarium or an hour. Very relaxing.",
          "An okay experience, but seemed like it was an expensive ticket for not a lot to see. The shark tunnel is definitely the best part of the aquarium. Decent place if you're in the city during a rainy day or in the winter. Make sure to bring money for parking as well as your ticket.",
          "Great staff. Veteran friendly",
          "Really nice place, decent parking, plenty to look at, nice gift shop",
          "Amazing collection of aquatic wildlife with knowledgeable staff that were willing to answer questions!",
          "Love how they set up the entire aquarium. Such a great place!!",
          "Had a great time!",
          "Fun atmosphere!  My daughter loved the sharks!! Expensive though,  seeing that it only takes about an hour to walk through.",
          "Decent aquarium, especially if you dig turtles. It'd be a nice place to take kids to during the winter months. But you'll have to work to make it more than about a 45 minute experience. The building is gorgeous and the staff is friendly and \u2026",
          "Super clean and a nice selection of fish. Especially the sharks!",
          "Nice place but pretty pricey  expected more",

          "Great day with the kids",
          "Love seeing all types of fish and learning where they live and how to help to protect them..",
          "Delightful place. Not huge like Georgia aquarium or Shedd's in Chicago, but perfectly sized for our 4 and 7 year old grandkids. I've heard complaints about the price, but I know keeping aquariums like this is expensive, so thought it was \u2026",
          "Awesome aquarium! Huge selection of fish, both freshwater and saltwater. Great walkthrough that really gives you full exposure to the fish. Only complaint I have is that there wasn't more! Awesome way to spend the day.",
          "Very nice aquarium, perfect for very small kids.",
          "The nursing sharks are my favorite of all time. If you get there early enough, you can watch the scobadivers interact with the sharks. I love the sea tube, feels like you are under water. They also have a huge octopus you can watch move \u2026",
          "Very nice place to visit. Shark exhibit is really cool.",
          "For a small building , it's very well planned. The place is clean and the staff friendly. A good place to spend an hour and a half and relax.",
          "Smaller than expected but still a nice aquarium",
          "I love going there. The staff is awesome. Very friendly and knowledgeable. The place is clean.",
          "A bit on the small side, but still decent.",
          "Nice place to see a lot of fish. They have a tank to pet sting rays, a display for sharks, and a lot of turtles.",
          "Stunning place. Love the building history. \"Lost\" my wallet here and they made sure it was locked securely away until i called to arrange to get it back.  Thanks!!!",
          "This is a nice small aquarium.  This does not take long to get through the entire thing. Not as exciting as the Cinncinati one; lots of freshwater fish.",
          "Lots of fun! It is a small space, but it ever felt crowded. We really enjoyed how the exhibits were immersive and accessible- especially for children!",
          "A little on the expensive side but I enjoyed it",
          "It's a nice place .overall u can finish the tour in 2hr.there is a parking fee for 5dollar+u pay a ticket fee for 20dollar.Theres a bridge if a cruise is coming you are trapped for 30 mins as the bridge will get open.best time to hit by 10.30am finish by 12.30pm and go downtown for some lunch nd drinks ...",
          "Fun place to spend an afternoon...fun interactive exhibits like petting manta rays... can watch shark feedings at certain times and the clear tunnel through the large aquarium is soo cool.  Plus it's at the powerhouse and that building is just cool.",
          "Nice..thought it would be bigger and have sea otters",
          "Very clean location. Very helpful staff and really nice gift shop. Will be back!",
          "Great place to take your children",
          "Self guided tour with toddler took us about an hour. Good blend of local aquatic wildlife and from around the world. Large tank with a tunnel at the end with big sharks was cool. There is a touch pool area for kids and they can pet/feef \u2026",
          "Very small aquarium, kinda located in a very sketchy place I couldn't tell where the aquarium was when I got there. Price is slightly high for the little they do offer",
          "Great place. Great selection for the room and the transition of the building.",
          "Great family fun",
          "Always a great trip to the aquarium.  Layout works well, and they are always adding new animals and exhibits.  Getting there can be tricky, but Google maps directions worked well.  Parking costs 6 dollars.  The sting Ray feeding is very cool and interactive.  Enjoy your visit.",
          "I would give it 5 stars but there just isn't enough for the price. The staff was nice. Having question and answer time with the scuba divers while they were in the tank with the sharks and other fish was neat, and the one scuba diver was very interactive with the kids. Ultimately a fun experience, just a little pricey.",
          "It's small but it well makes up for it by the uniqueness of the tanks. Make sure to check the feeding times to get the most out of the trip. I went at 2:30 in Sunday and got to view the Ray's and sharks feeding.",
          "Great place. Hidden gem! Fun family time",
          "A nice aquarium that lets you get up close and personal with the fish! You can touch some invertebrates, which was cool. It's a little small and will only take you about 90 minutes to walk through. A bit pricey for what it is, but overall a nice experience",
          "The aquarium is under some remodel, still a decent small aquarium. They honor first responders, which is amazing, but need to add Power Lineman to the list.",
          "Nice little aquarium,  excellent staff!! Highly recommend!!",
          "This place was awesome! Its divided up into the various ecosystems and we did the scavenger hunt which made it that much more interesting as adults. There's a lot of exhibits and different fish. The tanks are all very clean and the layout \u2026",
          "Really cool and got to see them feed the sharks!",
          "I enjoyed the aquarium.   Unfortunately the price was higher than what was offered.",
          "Love petting the manarays and the shrimp crawl up your arm!",
          "This place was so much fun. Mysekf, my woman and my stepson loved it. This is someting i would highly recommend to both people who live in the area or are just visiting. The tunnel where you walk through and have sharks swimming above, and all around you is so cool. Kids and big kids like myself will just have an absolute blast.",
          "I love aquariums, and this one doesn't disappoint. They have a great shark tunnel, stingray touch tank, and separate touch tank with some other creatures. The only downside when I visited was the jellyfish were off exhibit. It's about $20 for an adult, but they do offer discounts.",
          "Loved it! Nice small aquarium with thoughtfull exhibits. Definitely worth ro go with a family.",
          "Nice with my two grandchildren",
          "Love this place. We are pass holders and it is a great aquarium to visit and not spend all day walking. We make sure we stop every time we are in the Cleveland area",
          "Price is high for what It is seen multiple fish with ailments such as fin rot and such but family enjoyed it",
          "Kind of pricey, but definitely worth checking out at least once.",
          "Small and so informative.",
          "Great place to take the kids.",
          "Great place to stop in Cleveland. The Aquarium is inside the Historic Powerhouse, it's a must see!",
          "Excellent. Great time, I'll be back.",
          "It was a very interesting Crusade only way I can describe it is, it is not for a large family its not that's its expensive its that it took us 25 minutes to go through the entire facility or maybe extremely young kids it is worth it.",
          "I really enjoyed it. Nice to see phios fish plus others",
          "Love it!!! Kind of small, but still VERY cool.  Touching the rays and feeding them are a big part of it's draw, with the walk-through shark tank tunnel coming in as a runner-up.  Be prepared to pay for parking, but it's still worth it.",
          "A beautiful and interesting place to visit.  Great for the kids and adults alike.  It's not the largest aquarium you'll ever visit, but good for a few hours of enjoyment.  The quality and attention to detail they put into this place is \u2026",
          "Shark exhibit was the best part. Very small but cute.",
          "The staff was nice and could be heard giving plenty of good information on the exhibits. But honestly (and I swear I'm not a mean or rude person) everything else about it was a let down. We drove over an hour to get there paid our parking, \u2026",
          "Nice aquarium. Only takes an hour if you really take your time.  The building is as nice as the aquarium. From the parking lot you can see 5 drawbridges.",
          "Only thing I want to say is they have to extend the size, bigger, more ocean animals, more activities. Other then that, the theme are beautiful, the overall idea is nice.",
          "Looks very good but they were closing I couldn't get in",
          "I don't know if it is worth the money. If you look at it as an opportunity to help fund the future of the aquarium and conservation, then maybe it is. I did, however, enjoy that there was an area for people to touch some of the underwater creatures, the unique fish I hadn't seen before and the glass fish tank tunnel walk through.",
          "Had a wonderful first experience with my grandson here for his second birthday..",
          "Took our children here and it was one of the best experiences I could have share with them. They learned so much while having the time of their lives!",
          "We really liked the Shark Tank, it was clean, and was very well organized we also liked getting to touch the Stingrays",
          "Very nice atmosphere",
          "This was a fantastic visit. The price is steep, higher than the much larger Cleveland Zoo, but this entire aquarium is beautiful. All of the exhibits are amazing, clean and well kept.",
          "Great place to see fish",
          "It was nice. Just very small and I hope the expansion is done soon. The fish on display are great and I took a bunch of good photos",
          "There was alot of different fish to see. I enjoy it.",
          "So we went with our two kids to the Cleveland Aquarium two summers ago for a day trip. The place was a bit difficult to find due to the construction that was going on in the area. Once inside, the place was adorable. There were a lot of \u2026",
          "Great day trip for the whole family.",
          "Really love it. The under sea tunnel was amazing.",
          "Small Aquarium for High Price. Went to Shedd Aquarium in Chicago a few years ago, paid about the same price and it is  a lot bigger and better!",
          "Over priced for what's there. What they have is cool, but was sold as something bigger than it was.",
          "Cool aquarium with good customer support services",
          "Little pricey but fun",
          "Great staff! Support our local aquarium!",
          "Nice aquarium with great staff, but it's a bit on the small side.",
          "Aww! Cute fishes!",
          "It's in a old brick building which makes it even cooler",
          "Hard to find, simply because it doesn't look like an aquarium from the outside. The entire lower level was full of tanks, and an entire walk through tunnel filled with sharks, fish, and stingrays. Well worth it to take your time and explore. They have hands on experiences every hour or so, and the entire staff was knowledgeable.",
          "It's just ok - the stingray tank and the shark area underwater tunnel are the best parts. The rest is meh. Lots of dark fish in various tanks with a few cool ones scattered around. The kids area isn't that great although the hands on \u2026",
          "Never knew there was an aquarium in Cleveland it was nice busy the staff was informative",
          "Not that much to see . Once is enough . Loved pet the sting Ray's . Should be half the cost . They have to keep fish up .",
          "The staff was helpful on any questions and friendly. Took my three year old niece and she absolutely had a ball. Its very very child friendly. The underwater tunnel was forsure the coolest thing ever. The stingray tank was really cool too.",
          "Such a wonderful place. My husband and i took our wedding party (most of which were from PA, non-clevelanders) here the day after our wedding 5 years ago. Today we took our 3 year old son and he loved it. The touch pools are fun, the shark tunnel is a great photo op spot and the gift shop has many cute items.",
          "Needs upgrading...too pricey for a short walk through.",
          "Was visiting Cleveland and stopped by.\nVery informative about pollution and how to help.  Unfortunately they were under construction and weren't looking their best. My favourite parts were the lumpsucker fish-bc they're so darn cute. We \u2026",
          "Well maintained place - 1 - 2 hour is sufficient to cover. Reserve your energy for the last stop - shark gallery.",
          "Interactive displays are great especially for young children. Space is small and crowded. But the use of existing architecture is genius.",
          "We had a great time here perfect for younger children",
          "We enjoyed our visit. Nicely laid out and creativity lit.  I liked the cylindrical tanks that magnify the fish for a better view.  I also enjoyed seeing the local fish in addition to the exotic ones. \n\nThe highlight is of course the large \u2026",
          "I loved it the food was good and the fish was cool even the glow in the dark fish"

        "wiki": "The Cleveland Botanical Garden, located in the University Circle neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States, was founded in 1930 as the Garden Center of Greater Cleveland. It was the first such organization in an American city. Originally housed in a converted boathouse on Wade Park Lagoon, the center served as a horticultural library, offering classes and workshops for gardeners and spearheading beautification projects in the community. In 1966, having outgrown its original home, the Garden Center moved to its present location in University Circle, the site of the old Cleveland Zoo. Remnants of the old bear pit still remain in the Ohio Woodland Garden. In 1994, the organization's Board of Trustees changed the name to Cleveland Botanical Garden to reflect a dramatically expanded mission and launched an ambitious capital campaign to develop a facility that would support the enhanced program agenda. The expanded and renovated building, designed by Graham Gund Architects of Cambridge, Massachusetts, opened to the public in July 2003.\n\nThe centerpiece of the $50 million 2003 expansion is The Eleanor Armstrong Smith Glasshouse, a 17,000 square foot (1,700 m\u00b2) conservatory home to plant and animal life from two separate biomes, the spiny desert of Madagascar and the cloud forest of Costa Rica. They feature over  350 species of plants and 50 species of animals, including hundreds of butterflies.\nThere are also 10 acres (40,000 m2) of gardens, including the award-winning Hershey Children's Garden (the first children's garden in Ohio), the Elizabeth and Nona Evans Restorative Garden, the David and Paula Swetland Topiary Garden, the Western Reserve Herb Society Garden, the Japanese Garden, the Sears-Swetland Rose Garden, the Ohio Woodland, the C.K. \"Pat\" Patrick Perennial Border, and the public Campsey-Stauffer Gateway Garden.\nThe gardens were featured in a fifth-season episode of Supernatural, titled \"Dark Side of the Moon\".\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe Vail Medal is awarded for \"significant national contributions to the field of horticulture\" Past winners include Lynden B. Miller\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCleveland Botanical Garden\nCleveland Botanical Gardens 3D Model",

          "Each year the Orchid Show gets worse. Of course, the show is sponsored by a commercial enterprise interested in selling its Just Add Ice orchids. In years past there were many exotic orchids on display. The trend at CBG continues to have less \"exotic\" orchids and many more",
          "went in January, expecting much less to see considering the season, but was fairly shocked to see just how little they displayed, especially since it was during a special orchid mania. The varieties of orchids were paltry and there was very little else to see. Taking our sweet",
          "What a beautiful, peaceful experience during a cold and snowy Cleveland day. The orchid display was incredibly beautiful, and the rainforest and butterfly garden gave a delughtful respite to a cold winter day with a tease of what was in store in a few months hence.",
          "I have visited Orchid Mania at The Botanical gardens since it's inception at this facility...and every year it is less and less exciting to view. One could assume that the local grocery store has supplied the vast majority of blossoms that are on exhibit. The lack of exciting",
          "I visited the botanical garden with my boyfriend and his dad on a really frigid Cleveland day. Visiting the two glass house rooms (one with Madagascar forest, the other with Costa Rican rainforest) was a lovely and warm experience. We especially loved that both rooms featured",
          "Whether you go in the winter for GLOW, in the spring for the blooms, summer for the lushness, or fall for the leaves changing it is a truly amazing place. The greenhouses are like walking into another country and the outdoor gardens make for a very nice walk when the weather is",
          "This is the most beautiful and peaceful place in the City. Glow was just amazing for 2019, the well engineered gingerbread houses, they beautifully designed holiday themes.",
          "Basically went there to see the Krampus event and we\u2019ve never been there before so kill two birds with one stone. I realize it\u2019d be far better in the summertime with the outdoor displays, but overall I was fairly disappointed with the venue altho the event was fun. The indoor",
          "Very disappointed with our visit today. Firstly, we purchased adult tickets online at $15 each as we thought that would speed things up on arrival. What we didn\u2019t know was that the same ticket purchased at the ticket office just inside the entrance would have only cost us $5",
          "Best kept secret in Cleveland. Great location,. Easy access. Plenty to do and see for all ages. Very clean and well maintained.",
          "I only rated it average because it was a nice place in the fall, but I didn't think there was anything that made it very different from other gardens. I would visit again in a different season.",
          "My husband and I had a few hours to kill before an appointment so thought we\u2019d visit the botanical gardens. What a good decision! Since it was early November, we had no expectations that we\u2019d enjoy much on the outside but we were wrong. There were still mums, marigolds, and",
          "If you have the time and enjoy botanical gardens, the CBG is a gem. Also visit the culturally themed gardens.",
          "We took a leisurely stroll through this nicely cared for, thoughtful garden. Despite trails blocked for construction, we saw most of it. The \u201crain forest\u201d in the steel house was grand, full of butterflies.",
          "I arrived in Cleveland by cycling fully loaded along the E&O Towpath from Zoar, Ohio. When touring by bike, I love to visit botanical gardens and take in the natural beauty of my destination. Cleveland did not disappoint! These gardens are lovely!",
          "I went with my mom and sister and we were expecting more than what we experienced. We were surprised at the many plants that were dried up and just looking uncared for, there were many paths that were in need of repairs. The Glasshouse was very nice we really enjoyed walking",
          "My wife and I recently toured the gardens. The outside gardens were labeled making them quite interesting. The indoor butterfly release was quite a treat. A butterfly that had recently emerged from its chrysalis landed on my arm and stayed for about fifteen minutes as it",
          "One of my new favorite stops in CLE. The outside gardens were nice but the inside was AWESOME. From the chameleon to the plants to 100s of butterflies just wow. We went with 6 people (43, 35, 20, 18, 9 and 6) and we all enjoyed it. The kids definitely liked the inside better",
          "I enjoyed both the indoor and outdoor areas. The outdoor has winding paths filled with well labelled flower and herb gardens. The enclosed glass area had beautiful displays of butterflies and a desert area. The cafe and gift shop have reasonably priced items.",

          "There are two parts of the Botanical Garden; two greenhouses inside, and a winding path taking you through many different gardens outside. I loved looking at the wide variety of beautiful plants, and was pleased that nearly all of them were well labeled. During the summer,",
          "Went there 1 year ago in the Autumn. Really beautiful gardens outside and lovely inside too with lots of information for visitors. The staff is wonderful",
          "We had a tour of the outside gardens that gave us information to help appreciate and enjoy the exhibits. The inside butterfly room was a lot of fun as the beautiful creatures are fluttering all around you.",

          "Visited during son\u2019s surgery at the clinic. The display of orchids was very good. The butterfly area was nice to see. Thought the garage parking was pricey for our 45 minute stay. They do have a variety of guided tours but we did know that and missed them. Unless you\u2019re a real",
          "Wonderful attraction to visit in Cleveland. In the vicinity of Cleveland Art Museum, Cleveland History Muesum and Western Reserve Historical Society. Check with each website for special exhibits. The Orchard Mania until mid March. The Garden also has a Butterfly conservatory.",

          "I've been to Orchid Fest several times, and it never disappoints. The orchids are brilliantly displayed from the moment you walk in. Hard to believe there are so many varieties! What a beautiful and marvelous creation!! Look for the chocolate one. It really smells like chocolate!",
          "I have taken my granddaughter the past few years. In the past there were so many gingerbread houses all over. This year maybe 30? The large tree when you first enter was barely decorated. It had a few garden gloves and tools thrown on. I could go on and on , but it is not",
          "We had a wonderful time. The poinsettias and decorated trees were beautiful. We really enjoyed the music-a senior choir that had a Carroll singalong and watching children sing with a piano player and a vocalist. We also enjoyed our hot chocolate with Baileys-delicious. Perhaps",
          "What a delightful way to spend 2-3 hours. The temporary Christmas tree display was charming. The Glass House and Butterfly display were beautiful. We are headed to Costa Rica this summer and feel as though we had a taste of it\u2019s natural fauna.",
          "First year to visit the Garden during the winter GLOW display and I have mixed comments. The good: The interior trees and gingerbread houses were very nicely done. There is one large room filled with a large assortment of decorated trees where you could spend probably about 15",
          "I'm surprised anybody reviewed the Glow experience as \"excellent\" no matter what age group of children they have. I went last night, and it was a HUGE disappointment. The gardens were hardly lit up. There were a few spot lights shining on trees and bushes, and a few Christmas",
          "The Botanical Gardens is located in such a beautiful area. It has two main features a rain forest and a dessert terrain inside. Both need a cleaning and updating. Just one of the animal viewing areas was visible with frogs; everything else was clogged. Nothing new has been added",
          "Mom and I came by on our last day in Cleveland since we also wanted to visit the Museum of Art and you can park in the same garage. It was easier to get to than I thought using our GPS. The roads over there do seem a bit twisty/turny but I went around the block once and found my",

          "Madagascar biome is small but very well done and interesting. We enjoyed watching the keeper feed a chameleon.  Small but quiet and enjoyable lunch room.\n\nOn our visit Costa Rica biome was closed, and we choose to skip the outside gardens as it was raining",

          "Take your time and enjoy all the exhibits.  The rose garden is amazing",
          "Lovely, absolutely lovely. I felt it was well worth the time (several hours) and money ($12 for adults). The two biodomes in and of themselves were worth the price of admission in my opinion. While botanical gardens are mostly for adults \u2026",

          "It's good, but the ticket prices are a bit steep for what it is.",
          "I've been to Orchid Fest several times, and it never disappoints. The orchids are brilliantly displayed from the moment you walk in. Hard to believe there are so many varieties. What a beautiful and marvelous creation. Look for the chocolate one. It really smells like chocolate.",
          "Wonderful time, beautiful flowers.  Was a bit rainy, but we walked between the drops and also enjoyed the glasshouse.    Tortoise friends were eating lunch.",

          "Great feel good place!",

          "Incredible experience both indoors and out.",
          "Lovely gardens with a lot of variety and informational displays. We went in the winter, and even though it was cold we could still easily walk through the gardens. They have a really cool library and gift shop there as well. If you go near \u2026",
          "It's smaller than I thought. The butterflies were nice. I just don't know if it's really worth it if you are only in Cleveland for a couple days.",
          "We love the botanical garden! We went recently while they had their orchid displays there. It's always a great experience and in the summer there is a really neat kids area outside. They make learning about nature and plant life fun.",
          "Even though most of the outdoor gardens were in bloom, it was still a very fun time. The butterfly garden was stole the show with many different species fling around. They had interesting interactive activities for the Littles ones to learn about several different subjects.",

          "This is perfect for beating the winter blues which is why I went during the orchid show.  The fresh green smell of the plants, the vibrant orchids, and multiple butterflies took those blues right away. Besides butterflies there is a handful \u2026",
          "There are two very different greenhouses and a big outdoor garden as well as some art exhibits, animals, etc. Cool experience to go see. Bring a water bottle tho because like a lot of places their food and drinks are stadium prices.",
          "Maybe it's because I visited in March but there's not too too much to see here. I suspect the outdoor gardens would be really nice though. Glasshouse was very cool. Would be awesome to visit again in the summer but that would mean coming back to Ohio..",
          "It is right next to the Cleveland Museum. There is a outdoor garden to walk around, two inside garadens (one with birds and butterflies, the other with plants from the Mediterranean).",
          "If you have extra time while in Cleveland, take a few hours to visit this lovely attraction. The Greenhouse is wonderfully a flight with butterflies and we even hD the opportunity to launch serval into the habitat. The Hershey Children\u2019s \u2026",

          "Stunning, beautiful experience. I couldn't get enough of the butterflies.",

          "The orchids were beautiful breathtaking and amazing!!!! And the butterfly release was highly anticipated... I'd suggest waiting on the lower level as all the great showmen(ladies) orinthilogically speaking only come up top rarely and are camera teases!",
          "Beautiful greenhouse and gardens, lots of flowers, butterflies, bees. Great kids area. A couple little ponds.",

          "Orchidmania is a great trip for any orchid enthusiast and a great way to spend some time getting in touch with nature during the winter months. As my birth month is during when they host orchidmania, I tend to make the pilgrimage to CBG and never regret the sights or smells",
          "Went to the orchid mania show, it was fabulous! The botanical gardens are now on my list to check out what's going on in Cleveland. It's great for kids, groups, dates, or all by yourself! Definitely check it out!",
          "What a lovely establishment. Great for families and adults. Definitely worth the $12 admission fee in my opinion. The children's garden outside is an especially good time for the little ones. Plenty of good photo ops as well! The cafe \u2026",
          "The botanical gardens are beautiful but expensive (see pictures). There is also limited parking in that area. If possible, try to get there while it's earlier in the day before everyone gets off work. Once you leave, go around the corner to \u2026",
          "Lovely place to stroll around in the gardens outside. Especially enjoyed the Costa Rica glasshouse!",
          "Beautiful grounds and children's area is magical.  Whomever is in charge of the Hoppy Hours is the worst.  This past one they ran out of beer in just over an hour.  15 minutes to buy beer tickets and another 10 minutes to get a beer.  Not \u2026",
          "While small compared to many other botanical gardens, it still managed to have a wide breadth of gardens and plant species. There are rose, herb, children's, and Japanese gardens just to name a few. The two greenhouse biomes, Madagascar \u2026",

          "One word. Breathtaking. Also it's free for Veterans. I just paid for parking.",
          "Great place. They have a green roof that isn't talked about enough. Butterfly sanctuary and the gardens are beautiful.",
          "Very nice! A little over priced for what it is. It's beautiful but it only takes about an hr to see everything. Overall good experience though but I would have been happier if it had cost less especially in the winter.",
          "Even in the winter, the Botanical Garden is a fun destination! I went to the Christmas time event with gingerbread houses and Christmas trees decorated by different local groups. I can't wait to come back during the spring to see the different blooms in the outside gardens.",
          "I recommend coming to see the orchids. Our group had a wonderful time. The flowers were amazing. Good for a family outing.",
          "Always impressed by the Botanical Gardens in Cleveland! I would recommend going to the gardens when they have a particular exhibit being featured, but it is still a good time even when they don't. There is a nice mix of things that are \u2026",

          "What an amazing military/veteran discount! We had a great time with the indoor activities and look forward to experiencing everything in the summer. A nice family atmosphere with a kids corner and family restrooms.",
          "This is a great place to visit once or twice a year. They have sent great events like orchid mania and their Christmas displays. Not much else changes there buts it's still a neat place to visit.",
          "A decent indoor area, and some outside gardens. Unfortunately stuck in a parking desert, so their garage is often full. Not a fan of their fencing off public lands gifted to the city beyond their walls and charging admission.",
          "It's a very nice place. Highly recommend going there.",
          "Having gone in a weather which was neither exactly winter nor spring, the outdoor garden was a total mess. I regretted paying $8 for what I saw outdoors, thank God for the student discount (appreciate the ticket seller to have asked me if I \u2026",
          "Beautiful display, need to see.",

          "Not at all what it used to be. We drove a hour to see gingerbread houses and decorated trees. We stayed 34 min and paid $64 to get in and $10 to park. We went a couple years ago and the place was packed with gingerbread houses, professional \u2026",
          "I have seen one of the best botanical gardens. I really like animal exhibitions with plants. The butterflies and birds in the rainforest are amazing. I even saw a bird's nest in a place with a tall pineapple tree. The mother of the bird and \u2026",
          "Great place for the family and children to spend an hour or so. The birds and the butterflies and various trees and plants this for an awe-inspiring experience. Great time and I will definitely visit again",
          "I always enjoy walking around here. They always have something interesting on display. This time was orchids. Hope to return for the butterflies soon.",
          "Very nice garden. Was disappointed the Topiary garden didn't actually have any shaped topiaries. Favorite garden was actually the apice/herb gardens.",
          "Beautiful displays even outside and in the nearby walking park",
          "What a wonderful place. The herb garden was great and the best we have ever seen so far. Many other plants and rose bushes. The tropical forest glass house with all it's birds and butterflies was great fun and my family really enjoyed it. Cleveland continues to be a pleasant surprise for us.",

          "Orchid Mania was amazing!",
          "Visited during the holiday \"Glow\" display and had a great time.  Volunteers were very friendly and knowledgeable.  Spent about three hours and saw everything.  A 10 yo had a blast taking pictures and doing a scavenger hunt provided on their map (and he even learned some things too!) Make sure you stay for the butterfly release!",
          "Nice place, too many kids attractions for my tastes though considering i wanted to go (with no kids)",

          "I went for Orchidmania. The flowers were pretty.  It was not crowded. $24.00 for tickets & $10.00 for parking to be in and out in less than an hour is a bit steep. It was a nice experience though.",
          "Delightful botanical museum close to the Cleveland Museum of Art.",

          "We went there during Orchid Mania, they had hundreds of Orchids.  Very beautiful gardens inside, Costa Rica Rainforest and Madagascar Desert.  They do a butterfly release at 2:00 everyday I believe and I think they have a guided tour at \u2026",
          "We visited in winter, so unfortunately we missed out on how pretty the gardens outside are supposed to be but it was still a beautiful experience! Wonderful cafe with some vegetarian options (very appreciated), beautiful facility, and a great experience to see exotic animals and plants.",

          "Stunning! Every season has a must see theme.",
          "I grew up coming here and to see it grow is amazing! I am only giving a one star due to my experience with Allison Ingle in facility rentals and the lack of informed provided and turned me completely off which ruined my hope of having maternity pictures. I will however always continue to supposed CBG as a non profit",

          "Great family fun!",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "A Christmas Story House is an attraction and museum in Cleveland, Ohio's Tremont neighborhood. The 19th-century Victorian, which was used in the exterior and some interior scenes of Ralphie Parker's house in the 1983 film A Christmas Story, was purchased by a private developer in 2004 and has been restored and renovated to appear as it did both inside and outside in the film. The museum is part of a complex of four buildings devoted to the film, and is open to the public year-round.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Production ===\nThe screenplay for A Christmas Story is based on material from author Jean Shepherd's collection of short stories, In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash. The house that appears in the film is located at 3159 W 11th Street, Cleveland, Ohio. For the film adaptation of these stories, director Bob Clark reportedly sent scouts to twenty cities before selecting Cleveland for exterior filming. Cleveland was chosen because of Higbee's Department Store. Vice-President Bruce Campbell took on the project hoping to get a boost in sales from the attention the filming would create.  Higbee's is ultimately featured in three scenes in the film. Appropriately, the fictional boyhood home of Ralphie Parker is on Cleveland Street, the name of the actual street where Shepherd grew up. The exterior shots and some interior shots of the house and neighborhood where Ralphie lives were filmed in the Tremont section of Cleveland's West Side.  Producers chose the home because of its proximity to downtown and it bordered the Cuyahoga River Valley offering views of the steel mills in the valley.\n\n\n=== Restoration and reconfiguration ===\nIn December 2004, Brian Jones, a San Diego entrepreneur and fan of the film since childhood, bought the house on eBay for $150,000. Jones used revenue from his business, the Red Rider Leg Lamp Company, which manufactures replicas of the \"major award\" Ralphie's father won in the film, for the down payment. The previous owners had reconfigured the house, installing modern windows and covering the original wood siding with blue vinyl. Watching the movie frame by frame, Jones drew detailed plans of the interiors, which had originally been filmed on a Toronto sound stage, and spent $240,000 to gut the structure, reconfigure it to a single-family dwelling, transform it into a near-replica of the movie set, and restore the exterior to its appearance in the film.\n\n\n==== A Christmas Story House Museum ====\nJones also purchased the house across the street from the Christmas Story House and converted it into A Christmas Story House Museum, which contains some of the props from the movie, including Randy's snow suit, the Higbee's window toys, the chalk board from Miss Shields classroom, an original Red Ryder bb-gun used in the filming and hundreds of behind-the-scenes photos. In addition, the house to the left of the museum features a gift shop with movie memorabilia and souvenirs.\nThe house and museum opened to the public on November 25, 2006, with original cast members attending the grand opening, and the site drew 4,300 visitors during its opening weekend.Both the house and the recently renovated Bumpus house next door are available for overnight stays.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nRed Rider Leg Lamps\nA Christmas Story House Photo Gallery\nA Christmas Story on IMDb",

          "It been quite a while since I have visited here, but a friend was in town so I thought I\u2019d take her and I\u2019m so glad I did. So much has changed from the last time I visited when this first opened. The staff are all friendly and very knowledgeable. If you are looking for a",
          "I have been there on 3 visits taking friends and family there. It is a neat experience and a nice attraction for the Cleveland area. On our last visit in Dec 2019 I took family to see the house, sadly the line was extremely long and there was a light rain that day so we left",
          "My mom and dad and grandparents grew up and lived a few blocks away. We drove by the area included this house. Nostalgic site. No time to tour, but my brother has and e joyed",
          "We were lucky that there was snow on the ground and \"all was right with the world\". We enjoyed the fact that there were no real 'no touching' rules. It was truly interactive and fun.",
          "I really loved how they completely embraced the entire movie in the house, gift shop and museum across the street from the house. Parking was adequate when I was there although I suspect in the summer months it would be near full all the time. Pricing is slightly high at $14 for",
          "Growing up as a kid watching this movie every year, this was a really cool tour that allows you to get a behind the scenes look at the filming of this holiday classic. We enjoyed touring the home and getting insight into life during that time period. Would definitely recommend",
          "Go back in time visiting the Christmas Story House. You can touch and investigate anything in the house. It is fun to note items from the movie. There is a museum and large gift shop. Our guide was great and the tours started on time",
          "So worth the visit even in February. No wait time! No crowds. Great souvenirs. Ernie was our guide and did a great job!",
          "If you love the movie, you will want to visit. The tour is fun. Our tour guide, Isiah, was fun and engaging and full of interesting trivia about the movie. The museum has many of the original movie props and costumes along with many behind the scenes photos. Great gift shop as",
          "Visited the House where this hilarious movie was partially filmed, it was a lot of fun and interesting. Go have fun!",
          "Went with some work friends while in Cleveland. We all LOVE this cult classic movie! Start out in the gift shop across the street to buy your tickets. The guide will walk you across to the house to begin the tour. She explained that all outside shots or shots looking out the",
          "Have wanted to visit for years, and so glad we finally did! The movie is a Christmas tradition and so glad we visited the home together this past holiday season, So much fun!",
          "The original house from the Christmas Story movie. Visitors can also spend the night here as well as the next door neighbors house in the movie, for an additional price. Also a museum a short walk away.",
          "Loved it. It was everything I hoped for and more. They did such a great job restoring. It was fun! Go",
          "Just like in the movie. You are able to actually touch props used in the movie!! The tour guide was very funny and kept us laughing the entire time. Definitely the best stop on our visit to Cleveland.",
          "First time in Cleveland and was looking for things to do. This popped up. I knew it had to be a tourist trap, but this movie comes on every year. It's an American classic, and I thought it would be cool to say for years to come that I had been to that place. I was there the",
          "We aren\u2019t super fans but lots of people are and that was part of the fun. This attraction is very well done, time was taken to make sure your visit goes smoothly and they are very efficient. They also own the property across the street which has memorabilia, then next door to",
          "For Christmas story fans this is like a Mecca. Enjoyed the history around the movie and facts from behind the scenes",
          "This is a fun and interesting tour even if you haven't seen the movie. It takes you back to another era gone by. And, if you have seen the movie, there are many items from the movie in the house to see. There is a vacation home next door if your from out of town and can",
          "Super cool. House tour, museum with original good. Super cool visit. Worth the $13 fee. When in cleveland its a must see. Roughly 1hr",
          "We had maybe a 5 min wait for the tour. I didn't catch our tour guides name but we went on 1-11-2020 at 11:15. She was very informative and very nice! She was happy to answer any questions. This tour was a lot of fun for our family! Our kids are 3 and 5 and had a good time",
          "I have been wanting to visit here for several years and was not disappointed. The house is located in mostly a middle to lower income area with some houses obviously in need of repair, however, the area is safe. There is on street parking only, but not metered and when busy, as",
          "Very cool to be able to go into the house and actually touch everything! Not as many artifacts in the house as the museum but if you are a fan of the movie you'll love it. Museum has lots of info and items from the movie but all hands-off.",
          "If you are a fan of the movie Christmas Story, then plan a visit. Just kinda neat to see. You will find some great memorabilia at the retail shop across the street . \u201cDon\u2019t shoot your eye out\u201d.",
          "The house is fantastic and the museum also. We were not given the opportunity for a tour. I would have liked to hear the commentary and history of the house and objects from a host. I talked to someone who previously toured and they were escorted through the house and given",
          "I was completely delighted by my visit to the Christmas Story House and the museum across the street. It wasn't just the movie memorabilia, although that was great, but it was also stepping back in time. It was like revisiting my childhood home. Lots of wonderful memories here.",
          "This is definitely a unique experience. You must enjoy or love the movie. The house and museum take you into the movie as if you\u2019re a part of it. My wife loves this movie so it was well worth it. It was a neat experience.",
          "Such a fun trip and many memories while visiting AChristmasStory House. We went with our 16, 11, and 10 year old boys and each of us had a great time. Even though we went Thanksgiving weekend it wasn't overly crowded and we were able to do the tour and had tons of fun in the",
          "We ended up coming to Cleveland at the last minute and I\u2019ve always wanted to see the Christmas story house. It was great. But a bit pricey for so small of a museum which is thank goodness included in your house ticket. The store was nice but the parking was horrific. Tiny one",
          "Not sure what to expect when we went. I was surprised, it was interesting and a bit nostalgic. i would recommend this stop, it was worth it.",
          "Finally got to see and stay beside this wonderful place. If you are ever in Cleveland take the time to tour this landmark !",
          "I'm so glad I finally made the pilgrimage! Make the trip, tour the house, take lots of pictures, and pick up some trinkets and souvenirs at the gift shop before you go. It'll only take a little over an hour of your time (maybe less than that if they're not busy), and you can",
          "I read all the reviews that said it was so busy and parking was hard and that it was hard to get on the street. Therefore, I went during the week on the very first tour. Got there 20 minutes early. No wait to pick up my will call tickets. Also my friends went right up to the",
          "Great trip. Excellent tour guide. Very easy to get to and gift shop was great. Highly reccomend for a day trip",
          "If you love the movie it\u2019s a must see! Very interactive. You can touch everything in the house and take pictures with the flash if you want to! The museum was very informative. It was cool to see the costumes and props from the movie. No flash photography in the museum. The",
          "My husband and I visited on a Friday in December. We were there early, so only had to wait 20 minutes or so for the tour. They really could use 2 lines-1 for tours, 1 for merchandise as others have suggested. Yes, the tour was crowded, but it is December after all. There was",
          "Okay, I know you think if I go on this tour I will be labeled a tourist. Do it anyway. This was really fun because it is everything you saw in the movie that you enjoyed and while you are there with all the olther tourists, you can almost hear the Bumpuses dogs - at least I",
          "We stopped by for a quick photo stop. It is smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood so be sure to park in the small lot next to the house.",
          "We bought our tickets at the shop, not ahead of time and had a 45 minute wait. Not much to do but look around the store. No places to sit. I'm sure it will only get busier with the holidays coming up. The house was fun, because you got to touch and pose with replicas from the",
          "This has been my favorite Christmas movie since I was a little girl, and this place did not disappoint! It\u2019s quaint, charming, well-preserved/restored and the staff was friendly and informative. One even spent several minutes with us taking our pictures in the living room. You",
          "We arrived thirty minutes early and told the girl as we were picking up our will-call tickets that we needed to make the first you. She failed to tell us that they were only doing self-guided tours on the day we visited. So, while we waited fifteen minutes, the line outside",
          "Was a very nice experience.Loved the tour. Very interesting facts that we would of never know. Would like to do the tour again, but in snow weather.",
          "Pretty cool. Made me want to watch the movie again! Lol if you drive know that there is limited parking. Tour guide was hreat!",
          "To surprise my husband for his 50th birthday we took a trip to The Christmas Story House. I did not anticipate long lines or the waits. I recommend purchasing your tickets a few days in advance. In the fine print it states online purchases for the will-call window have a 48 hour",
          "This was a great tour. Loved our tour guide as he was super energetic and engaging. He made the tour so much fun! Great job!",
          "I was out here with some buddies and mentioned that there was a tour. We Ubered over. There is limited parking in the residential neighborhood. You go into the huge gift shop across the street to buy tickets for the tour. The tours are pretty frequent so you won\u2019t have long",
          "If you are a fan of the movies then this is a MUST! You get to explore the house for a bit and see some of the real props used in the movie at the museum. There is a huge gift shop to browse as well.",
          "It was fun to see this house and visit the museum. I enjoyed seeing costumes and some memorabilia from the movie.",
          "We made a stop in Cleveand on our way to Chicago just to see this house. It was very informative and interesting to take the tour of the home and the museum. You have to really be in the cult for this holiday movie to enjoy every aspect. Our tour guide was great.",
          "I found the cost to see inside not worth it so I just viewed it from the street. You can go into the gift shop for free naturally.",
          "Great tour guide and gift shop!! The artifacts were pretty cool too. Highly recommend!! We also enjoyed the authentic car and firetruck used in the film. A nice addition to the museum.",
          "We did not realize there are hourly tours. If you miss one, you have to wait till the next. Luckily, we were only seven minutes late for the first so we were able to join in. I loved it. The guide was so friendly. Must do if you like the movie.",
          "Our Senior Center sponsored a trip to the Story House during the Christmas Holidays last year. We were fortunate that we had nice weather and we really enjoyed our visit. Loved all the unigue things in the gift shop. Liked it so much we are going again this year,",
          "I've been a huge fan of \"A Christmas Story\" since I was a kid, so it was a lot of fun to visit the house where the movie was (mostly) filmed. We didn't book tickets in advance and our group was about 20 people. Our tour guide, Isiah (I think), was so much fun! Someone rented a",
          "Our family enjoyed our tour of the Christmas Story House. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic...the highlight of our weekend.",
          "This is a must do for anyone that is a fan of the Christmas Story. Our tour was led by a friendly and knowledgeable docent. I found the story of the founding of the museum to be quite interesting as well.",
          "Couldn't wait to go to the Christmas house sure was disappointed. The house looked like it was abandoned not many props the museum wasn't too bad but tour wasn't cheap so felt like paid a lot for so little.The gift shop was geared mostly for children and items were costly.",
          "I was working in the area and found out the house was in Cleveland. I stopped by after everything was shut down. it was still a sight with the leg lamp in the window. There were people in the house and I find out afterwards that you can possibly rent the house for the night.",
          "Very cool place to visit ! Our tour guide was amazing. Well worth the stop if you are in the area. Nice to be able to handle the replicas yet see the real pieces in the museum.",
          "Well worth the stop at this house. Loads of info on this tour! Make sure to go to the gift shop, first, to get your tickets.",
          "What a fun time! Ernie was the best guide! He explained everything with a sense of knowledge and humor. HGTV was filming the day we were there, so we may be on TV! Ernie explained a lot of things that happened in the film that I will have to look for when I watch the movie. Not",
          "Long lines to visit the famous attraction and see the leg lamp...but it was cool and nostalgic to stroll through the house",
          "Took the tour. Started in gift shop which has a variety of souvenirs based on the movie. The actual house has several rooms that recreate what was seen in the movie. The museum has photos and clothing used during the filming.",
          "We had been by the outside once before, but decided to pay the admission price of $13 each for the tour. Our tour guide was superb! He engaged the entire group, made jokes, and kept it fun and lively the whole time. If you are a fan of the movie, then this is well worth",
          "We had the best time pretending and recreating scenes, seeing our favorite movie come to life, and learning interesting behind the scenes facts",
          "My son and husband are huge fans of the movie and absolutely enjoyed this tour. Tour was inexpensive and you got to have hand on experience with the props. My husband said this was the highlight of our entire Ohio vacation.",
          "For years we have loved the movie and wanted to come visit here. My nephew surprised us with a wonderful gift and even included an overnight stay at The Bumpus house. We can\u2019t say enough about our wonderful experience, it met all our expectations. Isaiah our tour guide was",
          "We had London as our tour guide, he was great. Unfortunately, there were more than 40 people in our tour group, that made for a crowded rushed experience. With less people I'm sure it would have been fantastic. Once again, all the makings of a great experience, but too many at",
          "We went to the Christmas Story House and did a tour of the house and museum. They have free parking right next to the house. The tour cost $13 per adult. The tour included the house, museum, and car/fire truck seen in the movie. The tour took around 40 minutes. Our tour was",
          "My family visited oh a whim to kill time while visiting Cleveland. We love A Christmas Story and watch is every year at Christmas. Ernie (not Ernest) was a wonderful, knowledgable, and entertaining guide. The museum is very interactive and is beautifully maintained inside and",
          "If you are a fan of the movie, you have to go. Tradition to watch the movie on the Friday after Thanksgiving. It is almost eerie to be stand in front of the actual house after seeing it in the movie so many times. The museum is really neat as well. Worth while trip!!!",
          "When you come to Cleveland for a long weekend you have to take some time to see the Christmas Story House Right?! Hubby and I had to. And I\u2019m glad we did Yes it is cheesy but it was fun. It was a little confusing because the tour had just started so we needed to either",
          "took very enjoyable 45 minute tour which included lots of time for viewing sites on your own; this is one of my husband's favourite movies and i enjoyed just watching the many smiles he had.",
          "Very cute! It was located in the middle of a neighborhood... not what we expected but very cool. We loved the gift shop (so many fun Christmas things from not only A Christmas Story movie, but Elf, and others). We also enjoyed looking at the different antique vehicles as",
          "If you've seen the movie or year after year this is a fun place! A place where you can see the Major Award and the Red Ryder BB gun. Thee are steps to get in and steps to get upstairs. The house has furniture similar to the movie and has been restored to that condition. Both",
          "We did the tour with 5 kids while spending a weekend in Cleveland. EVERYONE, from the 8 yr old, to the 16 yr old, to us adults all enjoyed the experience! Our guide was London, and he was such an informative and fun guide!",
          "I loved the movie, but not enough to pay the entrance fee to this small museum in the house used in the movie. My friend was more gung ho about the visit than me. I did see the leg-lamp in the window and that was enough. The neighborhood was not out of our way as we followed",
          "I am a great fan of this movie so visiting here was a no brainer for me. It was interesting and fun. The tour was not expensive and our tour guide very knowledgable. Of course everything starts at the obligatory gift shop. But the souvenirs were fun to look through. The",
          "It was an unexpected part of our trip and it was the best part of our trip. We loved the house and the museum. We loved the tour guides and their knowledge as well as their interaction with the patrons. A must see if you love The Christmas Story Move. But a warning don't go",
          "Fans of the iconic movie A Christmas Story should stop in for a visit at Ralphie\u2019s place in Ohio City. There are a lot of props from the movie set furnishing the house, including the \u201cleg lamp\u201d. Be careful-it\u2019s \u201cfragile\u201d! There\u2019s also a museum and a large gift shop for all your",

          "My wife and I decided to visit the Christmas Story house on a trip to Cleveland. We love the movie so we really enjoyed the home and museum. The tour guides are informative and entertaining. For the price it\u2019s worth the visit.",
          "Everything about this takes you back to seeing the movie! Our tour guide Isiah was phenomenal and made the experience that much more enjoyable.",
          "Awesome find while scrolling what to do during my downtime. Tour was well worth it and enjoyed hearing all the trivia behind the making is the film.",
          "We came in August, and booked the house to spend the night. It isn't cheap to book the house, but we figured it was a once in a lifetime treat. When we arrived, we decided to take the tour right away, but had about a half hour to wait. We walked around the huge gift shop and",
          "Fun place. Spend hour there then walk across street to Rowley Inn. Neighborhood dive bar with great food and best happy hour in Cleveland.",
          "Very nicely done. Guides were extremely knowledgeable about the movie. You can take pictures with props in house which makes for great pictures. Very nice gift shop. You can stay overnight in house. Fun visit. Figure 1 hour for tour plus gift shop time.",
          "A delightful tour, informative tour guide, good value for the price of admission. Saw the house, back yard, and museum for one price, plus a large gift shop. Free parking on the street. everyone in our group enjoyed this immensely.",
          "Staying at the Bumpus' house was a great experience. The upstairs easily accommodated our family of 6. All furnishings were top of the line even though they were circa-1920. The house and museum were a great walk through. Only caution is that parking is sparse unless you stay",
          "My family and I went to see a Christmas Story when the movie was in its first run at the theater! My wife and I were delighted with our visit to the Christmas Story House today was. The tour was well worth the time. Thanks, Isiah, you made it most enjoyable. We learned so much",
          "If you love the movie like my family does than this is a fun stop. We called ahead and they told us not to drive our RV there since the roads are narrow and one way. So we parked at Home Depot and took the car over. It\u2019s a really cute neighborhood. We paid the $13 each to tour",
          "If your a fan of A Christmas Story and who isn't this is a must do when in Cleveland. The Christmas Story Store is fantastic and has so much that you can take a piece of the movie home with you and so much more. Tour the house or book a night to stay in the house and relive the",
          "We visited here and a great time.The house is set up inside just like it was in the movie.There lots of props you can put on for photos.Your guide will tell you stories on how the movie came to be and stories of the making of the film.Across the street you can see actual props",
          "WE visited and went on the tour, I really liked that it provided a lot of photo ops in the house, we bought lots of souvenirs, the tour was somewhat informative but the museum was not very big but had some cool artifacts, a definite place to stop.",
          "My wife and son loved it here, and it was fun to recreate some of the scenes and reminisce about the movie. However, $13 per adult is steep, especially when you consider most interior shots were in fact not shot at this location. I thought the tour was rushed, especially in the",
          "This place was fun even for 2 adults. You have to get tickets at the gift shop and if you miss a tour, hanging out in the gift shop gets boring. House was cool along with the museum. Learned interesting facts about the movie.",
          "Was so glad I went. Tour took an hour. Learned a lot about this movie they had no faith in. The costumes and the settings were great.",
          "If you like this movie, you will enjoy this activity. They do a great job marketing everything around this move, as you will see in the gift shop. Had fun, but for me personally....as a museum....not sure I would spend my time doing this.",
          "Bucket list stop! This was a fun stop. Smack in the middle of a small neighborhood. You could imagine the old man in the cellar with the boiler! One person in the tour got in the cabinet under the sink! Daddy\u2019s gonna kill Ralphie! Included in the admission is a museum",
          "It's not to far out of Cleveland, and worth a stop if you have ever seen A Christmas Story. And who hasn't? It's a neighborhood home, so parking is tricky. We didn't do the tour, just took some photos and visited the gift shop across the street.",
          "It's not worth seeing, the price is too steep and the parking is terrible. It only takes a few minutes to see and is a real let down",
          "We drove by at night and then went back the next day. There is limited parking between the Bumpus house and Christmas Story house. Also, there is some parking by the gift shop across the street. There is also a museum across the street as well as a neighborhood bar, the Rowley",
          "Yes, you can stay in this and the Bumpus house..... it was a neat experience to know the movie, do the tour and then you have the run of the place after 5pm....we hope we didnt ruin anyones pictures of the leglamp in the window as we sat on the couch talking and drinking a beer.",
          "If you are visiting Cleveland and a fan of this movie, don\u2019t miss A Christmas Story house. The tour through the house that was featured in the movie is lots of fun. The tour guide offer lots of interesting information about the making of the movie. You then you get to roam",
          "The house is off on a quiet side street. A small parking lot, but you can probably find street parking. The tour was fun. You get to see the leg lamp, the Red Ryder BB gun, the back yard. They invite you to crawl under the kitchen cabinet where Ralphie's brother hides in the",
          "My family- husband and three kids 13, 11 & 7 had a fun time. We are fans of the movie and enjoyed all three stops. We came late in the day so we started at the gift shop (since it would be closed when we finished our tour & that\u2019s where the tour starts from anyway). So many",
          "This was surprisingly a great stop, I didn't expect much, a few photos maybe, but man was I impressed with the tour guide and it was a stop where kids could touch and play with things which is great with a 3 year old. I was so impressed with the depth of information and what I",

          "I love the movie a Christmas story. And was so cool to see where it was filmed our tour guide Ernie was awesome. He Had a lot of info on the house. The movie and everything. I really enjoyed it and hope to go back again soon. Was cool cause u can see the set and touch stuff",
          "As a fan of the movie, we decided to see where it was made. The house isn't far from downtown so if you have a free moment, it's easy to reach. The house itself is nestled in a pretty run-down neighborhood but they do offer 10 or so spots of free off-street parking. The complex",
          "Visiting the Christmas House was so much fun! I absolutely loved touring, touching and reliving this piece of movie history. The house is decorated with the actual movie set furniture and decorations. You can sit on the couch, take a picture with the Leg Lamp, hide in the",
          "My friend and I made a pilgrimage to see the Christmas Story House. We really enjoyed the tour of the house and the museum. Also, we made sure to get a souvenir to remember our trip by. I enjoyed the tour of the house and getting to see everything as it was in the movie. I",
          "Tioured this authentic A Christmas Story house while vacationing in the Cleveland area. It was well worth the admission price of $13 as you not only got to tour the house where a lot of the movie's scenes were filned but also the mouseum across the street and gift shop. Our tour",
          "I live in Cleveland and had not made it to this attraction until last week. I was pleasantly surprised by the professional quality of the experience. The gift shop was much nicer than I expected.",

          "I had not been to the Christmas Story House in over 6 years. I was pleasantly surprised with all the really nice updates. The land next to the house is now nicely paved and there is now a \u201cBumpus\u201d house that can be rented. The gift shop is HUGE. It is the movie on steroids. If",
          "This was a fun tour through the house from the movie. My family enjoyed seeing the memorabilia and reading the new articles etc about the movie.",
          "Very fun museum. You can walk around in the house, sit on the furniture, and sit at the kitchen table and read the paper. I loved hearing the story of how the house was found to be in the movie. We lived in Cleveland when the movie was being filmed and I remember seeing an ad in",

          "While we didn\u2019t take the tour, we did go to the house and the gift shop. I was so excited to get to see this house. It is preserved so well, it\u2019s like stepping into the movie. The gift shop was very cute, and I love that they have merchandise from other Christmas films as",
          "Over 50,000 people each year visit the house 10am to 5pm A half hour tour is $11. A house once occupied by the Hells Angels became the house used in the movie. The house was restored to the movie decor wgen a man from California purchased the house for $90,000 and did a $200,000",
          "Isaiah, our tour guide, was informative but so funny too. We had a blast, took lots of pictures and learned fun facts about the movie. The gift shop is s hoot as well; you can buy almost anything with the show\u2019s themes. I bought s bracelet with s leg lamp that goes with my Alex",

          "Okay I must admit I am a big fan of this moving so it was easy for me to love this place. For non-fans it may not be the first thing they do in Cleveland. We had tickets for the 10:15am tour (not cheap but...) which made it easy to find parking in this residential",
          "Don\u2019t know the movie? Don\u2019t bother. Serious fans of the movie, though, will have a great time.

          "While in the area traveling on vacation we had to stop at A Christmas Story House! We loved our visit here! It was very neat to learn so much about the movie, especially to learn that in the beginning the movie was a flop and then became one of the best Christmas movies of all",
          "It was fun and interactive, although our tour guide chastised someone for recording her talk.- I beleive they should inform you at time of ticketing if you cannot record. Learned interesting facts about the making of the movie and you could touch things in the house as they are",
          "First of all, I can't wait till every Christmas to watch 24 hours of A Christmas Story. It's my all time favorite movie. I was very excited to get there and tour the house and museum but was disappointed to find out you had be on a guided tour to walk through both. The guided",

          "The actual house. Inside there isn't any actual movie props but similar products. They let you touch everything and relive the scenes throughout the whole house. You are able to stay overnight there as a hotel if you'd like. Very cool experience for a fan of the movie.",
          "We've seen the movie way too many times, so we had to finally break down and take the ride over there. They've done a nice job and actually quite a bit to do and see as well as the surrounding area has plenty to do (and eat)",
          "Awesome visit. Have been watching the 24hrs of the movie since it's inception! Love that there is a museum across the street. Make sure you stop by the Rowley Inn for a drink. This is where the \"old man\" hung out during filming!",
          "Really fun place to visit for movie fans. Going through the house itself doesn't take very long, and it was pretty crowded, but the museum set up is really neat and the gift shop is nice as well.",
          "We paid the admission to tour the house and the museum. The tour moved extremely slow and the docent kept forgetting his words. He kept apologizing and it was not good. If you have seen the movie it is fun to see all the props, rooms, and the leg lamp. The museum was much",
          "Went here on Sunday the 2nd with friends. Some of us went on the tour and the rest went to the bar on the corner and had drinks while they waited. I am extremely glad that I went on the tour as I got to reanact scenes from the movie for my photos and I learned soo many",
          "I was surprised by the $15 a head fee. It was a very short tour for that price. I think our tour guide was on his first week. His jokes fell flat and some were offensive. They have a few memorabilia there it was worth the trip to say I\u2019ve been but I think kids would be bored",

          "The experience was really neat, but our tour was really overcrowded. It seemed like everyone was bumping into each other trying to take pictures. I would not do this again. I saw it once, that\u2019s enough.",
          "Tour guide was excellent! Learned a lot about the making of the movie. Tour starts in the gift shop, continues in the house and ends in the museum. I highly recommend this!! Worth the Uber trip.",

          "After zig-zagging our way through downtown, we went to the Tremont neighborhood where the house is located. They have several properties besides the actual house - a gift shop, a museum and a garage that has a replica of the car and fire engine from the movie. Our tour guide",
          "My kids (12 & 14) said this was the part of our trip to Cleveland they enjoyed most. They are fans of the movie & watch it every Christmas. We arrived early for the first tour of the day and had no problem with parking. They do have a small free parking lot. Street parking is",

          "If this place doesn't bring a smile to your face, then something's wrong. Take the tour of Ralphie's home. Walking thru the front door is like going back in time. You can almost smell the turkey. The tour guide was wonderful and full of movie trivia. You can craw under the",
          "A nice one hour tour of the house where Ralphie lived and a ton of information on filming and how they did certain scenes. You can go right where they filmed the movie scenes in each room. They also have a program where you can sleep there overnight. Super gift shop with all",
          "Ok so I have seen the movie dozens upon dozens of times. We all have. My one recommendation is to watch it one more time a couple of days before going here just to put everything in perspective. Pay attention to the scenes inside and outside the home. Go you will have",

          "A fun experience to see! Arrived early for the first tour of the day, there was plenty of parking available in the parking lot as well as on the street. Gift shop has a good variety of generic Christmas story items for sale as well as things specific to the actual museum. We had",
          "I grew up watching this movie on VHS before it was on TNT 24 hours a day during Christmas. It is bar none one of my top 5 favorite films. I absolutely love it. This house is obviously the house where all exteriors and any interior shots including windows were filmed. They",

          "Tour is good. Fun to visit the house, however guide was not over friendly to give out information on house unless you ask questions. It was mmore of a self guided tour. I thought over priced for what you saw in the house and museum",
          "We loved the tour guide, he gave fun facts and he was fun too. The house itself was fun to see, being that we watch the movie every year for Christmas it gave us a bit of an insight into the movie/the set/people. It was a bit rushed, we were still taking pictures when the tour",
          "The tour is a must-see if you're a Christmas Story fan, and still entertaining if you aren't. See iconic props like the leg lamp and Red Ryder BB Gun at the Christmas Story House, Museum, and Gift Shop in a short 45-minute tour. Our tour guide was friendly, informative, and",

          "It is a bit costly to take the tour of the Christmas Story house, but it was well worth it. The guides knew all about the movie, and could tell us what was filmed there, what was filmed on a soundstage in Toronto, and why they picked the house. You can even buy a replica of",

          "Our first trip to Cleveland we had to check out the Christmas Story House right outside the city. The tour took us through the house, gift shop and the museum. The house was amazing with tons of props that you can take pictures with! The gift shop was loaded with anything you",
          "My expectations were pretty low. It was fun too see the house and the Museum had some of the props and costumes. The coolest part was being allowed to wander around the house. On the negative side, a ton of old people with zero manners were on the tour with us.",
          "It was really neat to be in the house where 40% of the movie was filmed. Museum was nice with tons of movie memorabilia. Huge giftshop with anything Christmas Story you could think of.",

          "Visiting this house was probably the best thing I\u2019ve ever done. It\u2019s full of nostalgia and child-like play that turns you into a kid at heart. The props that can be touched and used as mock scenes from the movie put the white glove touch on this classic experience. One of my",
          "It's like stepping back in time. We loved that you could actually touch everything in the house. It was fun. The tour itself was informative, but short. It is still worth the ticket price. The memorabilia in the museum was cool to see.",
          "If you love the movie, tour this house. It was a very fun listening to the tour guide tell stories about the movie, like how the fragile box had to be cut to fit through the door, and how the house was obtained, all kinds of fun things. Fun museum to tour with props from the",

          "Apparently lots of people! Pretty fun to see this house exactly as it seems in the movie! Brought two ten year old boys with me, who thought it was equally fun. The gift store was a hoot with all the highlights from the movie. This is a relatively quick stop that will leave",

          "Fun to visit around Christmas. The tour is quite short and priced right. The guide interacts with you and was fun and very knowledgeable. You can reenact the scenes and take pictures inside the house. You don\u2019t have very long to look around / take pictures. By the time we",
          "We visited the gift shop and it had something for everyone. My friends and I spent a lot of money making pennies with the penny machine for the grandkids. The clerk was super awesome. I bought a post card and stamp and he mailed it for me. It made my whole trip.",
          "Stopped here before going to the Rock Hall. Was well worth the trip. The whole family enjoyed taking pictures in front of the house and the house really looked as it does in the movie. The museum with all of the artifacts from the movie was very interesting as well. We had a",

          "It was a quaint and good time to see where the movie took place. It\u2019s a movie that doesn\u2019t go Un-watched during the Christmas Season.

          "My Christmas present was a visit to Ralphie's house. I'm older and lived at the end of the generation/period the movie takes place and brings back fond memories from my childhood. If you have a gps, it's easy to find. I'd say the neighborhood hasn't changed much since the",
          "We have visited multiple times. We do the Christmas story run every year. Kids enjoy the house and museum. Only downfall is parking. It\u2019s right in a residential area. Best to visit during off holiday times.",

          "If you like the movie, you will love the house and museum . Found out very few scenes were actually filmed here , but still fun. They let you touch and play with everything . Take all the pics you want . Museum has lots of original props and gift shop is good too ! Tour",
          "We stopped by and took some pictures from the outside. Not much parking. We did not take the house tour due to having to wait an hour for the next tour to begin.",
          "This is the first time visiting this museum and the overall experience was very good! The tour guide was very good and helpful. The whole tour takes approximately 80-90 minutes. Worth the visit!",
          "Of course if you're visiting Cleveland, you have to stop at the Christmas Story House. It was a fun place to visit and take pictures with the \"Major Award\" aka the leg lamp and other props in and around the house. We got there at noon, asked for tickets for the 1215 tour and was",
          "Excellent tour - and guide - thanks Jess ! reasonable price and great gift shop - tours run either every half hour or hour - if you are in a schedule - call before you go to check their tour schedule times for that day . Recommend to go to rock n roll hall of fame on same trip",
          "I randomly found this spot in a tripadvisor search and knew that I had to go. It is a must see for anyone who has seen the movie. I loved the tour and the house and the museum. It just made me happy. As everyone else has said, it is so much fun to be able to take pictures in the",
          "If you have seen the Christmas Story Movie, you have to visit the Christmas Story Move house where they filmed the outside scenes. You will see everything from the \"Old Man's Car, to Randy's Snow Suit. This is a \"must see\" which includes a gift shop and museum with movie",
          "A very informative tour with lots of information about the Christmas Story movie and how it was made. A must see if you like the movie!",
          "I grew up in Ohio not knowing my favorite movie was filmed in this house.....they redid everything exactly has the movie. This is a must see!",
          "The tour was very informational about the movie. Was able to see everything in the house. Love to be able to pick up some of things in the house so that you can take a picture with it. I would diffenetly recommend it.",
          "For best parking, get there a little before opening in the morning, as space on the surrounding streets is limited and there is no designated parking. Street parking is free, but neighbors may try to convince you to pay them for it or to park in their yard for a fee. We parked",
          "Have seen the movie multiple times and therefore very interesting. Thought the tour was lousy. Guide could\u2019ve been more informative. He answered tons of questions but did not offer much. He pretty much said look around the house and museum and let me know if have questions.",
          "Childhood memories come to life! Such a great movie, neat to get to visit the house and museum in person and take pics with the BB gun, lamp, bar of soap, etc. the gift shop is amazing great place to pick up some souvenirs. If you haven\u2019t seen the movie I don\u2019t know that you",
          "I visited A Christmas Story House. The gift shop is large. The house and museum are interesting. The staff was friendly. Parking is limited. I would suggest Uber. It is definitely worth seeing if you are a fan!!!",
          "If you are in Cleveland you have to go. I wouldn\u2019t go to Cleveland just to see the house. It\u2019s nicely done. Lots of fun things in the gift shop. The tour last about 45 minutes and could be done better. It\u2019s in the middle of a real neighborhood with people next door cutting",
          "This was so much to see. The tour was nice. There were a few things that I didn't already know, since I'm already a huge fan, I've read a lot about the movie. It was really great to see the house and look through all of the props from the movie. The house is fully interactive,",
          "We were on a road trip with no particular destination and were passing through Cleveland and decided to stop. So glad we did! We did the tour, well worth it. Great guide, gave us little bits of history we weren\u2019t aware of. We had access to the entire house, and were not only",
          "The House Tour is $11 well spent! The house has replica props so you can pick them up and pose with them. Think along the lines of you can bite a bar of soap in the bathroom or use the decoder ring! Re-create your favorite movie scenes. You can hide under the sink in the",
          "if in the area this is a must see easy to find just look for the leg can't miss it it's right where it's supposed to be.",
          "Fun visit for a couple of true fans of the movie. Was neat to see the home and some of the props/costumes etc., A must for fans, but probably a pass if not",
          "Who hasn't seen this movie yet? If you have then you will want to take this tour through the actual house and take pictures with the not actual props from the movie. The owners have done a fantastic job getting all the details right. It is a lot of fun. Our tour guide Gary was",
          "Very interesting tour. Provided a lot of information and history of how this location came to be and the filming. Would have liked more time to poked around the museum which was separate from the house. Giftshop was great place and had a good variety of reasonably priced items.",
          "Great experience for any fan of the movie (and even if you're not like my wife). Great information from employees about tidbits of trivia too (e.g if you can see the outside in the movie scene then it was definitely filmed here). Make sure to visit the museum and gift shop too.",
          "I\u2019ve been here twice and would return! It\u2019s great to see all the movie props and set as well as hear the interesting stories about it too!",
          "It is kind of different because you are actually going to a real neighborhood. The house is not isolated, people are living in the neighborhood quite close. We did not park in the house parking lot that the guy was flagging us to. We instead parked down the road and walked.",
          "The annual tradition has come to life. My family watches A Christmas Story every year--multiple times, over and over. When we found this treasure on a travel website we had to go. Luckily we did. We toured the house, the museum and the gift shop--now they are expanding into",
          "Being a BIG Christmas Story movie fan I truly enjoyed touring both the house and the museum. It really is a magical experience and I felt like I had stepped into the movie itself. It brought back a lot of warm memories. The house itself is absolutely perfect. The color is right,",
          "This is the home that the movie, The Christmas Story, was filmed. We had so much fun touring the home and recreating scenes from the movie. Our tour guide was outstanding and he even allowed us to touch the props and take all the pictures we wanted. The gift shop was",
          "This museum will have much more meaning if you have seen the movie, but they also show it in the gift shop. The tour was very enjoyable and our guide, Michelle, was very enthusiastic! You learn a lot of backstory about the film but it is also a stroll down Memory Lane for those",
          "Stumbled on this gem and so glad we did! We almost didn\u2019t pay for the tour but so glad we did. I think the visit to the house would have been a bust without the tour. Tour guide was full of information and lots of tidbits about the movie. Can\u2019t wait to watch the movie again.",
          "My husband and I have been wanting to come here for years, and we are so happy we finally made it! The tour starts in the gift shop and was fun and very interactive. We were encouraged to touch and pose with all the props and were able to see the entire inside and outside areas",
          "What can I say, Christmas icon. Really neat to see and touch and imagine yourself in the movie playing Ralphie. Now you can even book an overnight stay. Didn\u2019t get to do that but definitely on my bucket list.",
          "If you grew up in the 80s and are a parent or grand parents then you know this movie is not only a classic but one for the ages. Being able to see the set, listen to the stories, and learn about how it all came to life is priceless....",
          "Our whole family loves the movie and this was a big hit with all ages! Great tour guide and fun gift shop. Nice change of pace for an afternoon of sightseeing. Delicious lunch at Rowley\u2019s after.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit the Christmas Story House. They have done an amazing job putting it back to it's original state and keeping it up. We enjoy the movie even more now that we've been there and can place ourselves in the setting.",
          "Im sure glad we found out about this place. I loved the movie, so seeing the house was fantastic! Awesome gift shop as well, and you sure can buy and have shipped an authentic BB gun. The tour was awesome and the guide did a great job. Highly recommend this place if you're",
          "Had to go while in Cleveland because we love the movie Expected it to be real cheesy. It was a little, but it was a great surprise how neat it really is. Nicely restored house with props so you can touch and interact with for fun and photos. The across to the museum where",
          "Went cause of movie and it was amazing. It's a museum of artifacts and the house from movie and the tour guide was great. Really enjoyed",
          "We love The Christmas Story movie and watch it every December. This was an item on our bucket list. Our older gentleman tour guide shared so much trivia and knowledge about the making of this movie! So fun! I wish there was a pamphlet listing all he shared, so I could",
          "We stopped here since it was only about 5 miles from the Rock Hall. If you are a fan of the movie you should really stop and see the house and museum. The gift shop prices are on the high side but it's the same thing at every museum. You pay for the tour at the gift shop and go",
          "In my opinion you couldn't really tell it was the house from the movie except for the plaque outside. We did not go in because they were not yet open. It is in an industrial neighborhood with plenty of pot holes.",
          "We made a quick stop just to see the house and where it is located in Cleveland. It was easy to get to, but parking can be challenging. We were there on a Thursday in April so it was too busy. We didn't pay for the tour which will take you into the house and the museum. We",
          "Be sure to get in line early, we went and stood in line over and hour at it was sooooo cold. So get there early. The house itself is rather small, but it was really cool. Across the street is a mini museum that I found more interesting that the house itself. There was a tour",
          "During a brief visit to Cleveland we wanted to see this house and get a tour. We hung out in the gift shop before our tour and there were a lot of cool things to look at and take photos with. We had a great tour guide that took us through the house and encouraged us to look",
          "Sometimes you just need to do something silly. Some reviewers complained that the tour was too expensive - if you think so then just take a picture of the house and drive on. Others said the neighborhood was run down and dangerous- it\u2019s NOT. It\u2019s a very traditional",
          "What a fun tour. I remember this movie as a kid. Our tour guide shared so many things I didn't know. It was so fun to share a piece of my childhood with my 10 and 13 year old. I bought the movie at the gift shop and can't wait to watch it as a family.",
          "We recently went to Niagara Falls. On our way back to Cincinnati, we stopped at the Christmas Story House since it was halfway home. What a great time for me and my 12 year old who love this movie! For $10 adult/$8 child, we were able to take a tour through the home and the",
          "I have to admit I went with very low expectations thinking it would be a tourist trap that took your money with little to offer in return. But for $11 per person it is well worth the 60-90 minutes of the tour and the museum across the street. You get to touch, see and feel the",
          "SO FUN. Not only do you get to be in the Parker's house, you get to experience it! Hold the leg lamp, take a pic with the BB gun by the Christmas tree, get underneath the kitchen cabinet, and so much more!",
          "I never liked the movie when I was younger but now that I'm a mom of boys I really love it. We watched it again the night before we went on the tour and since it was literally snowing in April, it didn't seem at all seasonally inappropriate. The 12:15 tour was sold out but they",
          "Definitely a major tourist attraction/trap, you can see the outside of the house and get a few selfies taken without laying out any money. If you want to see inside the house you need to book a tour from the gift shop. The gift shop is everything Christmas Story, a little",
          "We went here because snowing in april and looking for another activity for family. I was excited but wife and kids were not. Whole family had great time. Kids were amazed as house looks like in movie. Learned a lot of facts about movie and tour guide was awesome. Our tour was",
          "My mom and I really enjoyed touring and visiting A Christmas Story house and museum. Our tour guide was awesome and you are allowed to touch the items and make all the pictures you would like. There are many artifacts that were used in the movie that were on display. I highly",
          "I gr8 up watching this movie, I know all the lines, and even if listening I see the scenes in my mind....a TRUE fan. I loved all the attention to detail that was taken in bringing my favorite movie back to life. The tour provided so much information that I didn't know about",
          "This place was great....so glad we went! The house was hands on....you could sit on and touch everything....they actually encourage it! The tour guide was superb. He was so knowledgeable, and filled our heads with some really interesting facts. The museum across the street is",
          "Tickets and the tour begin at the museum across the street from the Parker house. The leg lamp is in the window, just like in the movie. Inside the house, the guide tells about the filming of the movie, how it was chosen, and other facts about the movie. Visitors are allowed",
          "Just the best to see and remember the movie and also the memories have many Christmases. It\u2019s like a constant Flashbacks of fun and memories. A must see then have a Fun Meal in Coventry. Enjoy",
          "This was everything and more for me! Tour guide was awesome and knowledgable. Fun stories about the movie and the man who bought the home. The house is adorable. Gift shop is fabulous. I could have stayed much longer. It is a good 2 hrs that you could stay there and do it all.",
          "Tour is only $11.00 and plenty of things to check out. The gift shop is huge. The house is very easy to navigate and kinda neat to reminisce about.",
          "I am not a fan of this movie but the rest of my family is so I grudgingly went along. It turned out to be pretty interesting! The tour is only about an hour and the guide was really good. The house has been restored and is like stepping back into 1941. There are lots of photo",
          "I thought this would be a cute side trip to add on with our trip to the Rick and Roll Hall of Fame. I have to say this was way more entertaining. Could have been because my expectations were lower. The tour guide had loads of interesting trivia he shared with us. If you are a",
          "We went on a Monday afternoon in March. Just our family of 4. We were the only ones on the tour. So we were able to take our time. I read the reviews of people waiting for hours to see the house. I'm glad that wasn't us. We were in town for a Cavs game so we said, 'what the",
          "I am a big fan of the movie, so I am biased. Rebuilt to look as it was at the time of the movie shoot. This is the original house where several scenes were shot (inside and out). They paid a lot of attention to detail, including items from the movie and other items giving",
          "What a cute place to visit if you are in the Cleveland area. It has the original props from the Christmas movie. There are tours available and they even have overnight stays, which I would love to experience someday! I love this movie and my kids loved seeing this house just",
          "This is the home used for the exterior shots of \"A Christmas Story\". The owner of the building recreated the interior sets from the movie very nicely inside this house. Neighboring homes are have been turned into a museum and gift shop. Tremont is a up and coming neighborhood",
          "This place is great , I love the movie , our cab driver suggested we should do this while we were in Cleveland. No regrets probably one of the biggest surprises was the over stacked outlet by the Christmas tree. The tour guide was a real gem, she had all the facts and really",
          "Since the summer of 2017 the Christmas Story House has been available to anyone who wants to spend the night! If you are a huge fan of the movie, this is a must! We had done the tour in the past so just being able to take your time and walk through the entire house, sitting on",
          "My sister, brother, and I grew up with this movie. My sister and I were extras during the filming as most kids in our school back in the early 80's. Now grown up and moved far away, we all came back for Chistmas and visited the house and museum 12/26. We thoroughly enjoyed",
          "We usually steer clear of touristy venues, but we found this to be a real hoot. It was a trip down memory lane to revisit a family favorite holiday movie locale, and recite memorable quotes in their original location. We arrived in time for the first tour (10:15 am), found free",
          "Although I am not the biggest fan of this movie, the tour through the house and adjacent sites led by a knowledgeable guide full of trivia made it shoot to the top of my list! We couldn't wait to see it again and look for some of the things we'd learned. We can't wait to go back",
          "We extended our road trip to Cleveland so we could visit the Christmas Story House and museum. They were closed for renovations during the week so we were the first ones to see it when everything was done Saturday morning. I\u2019m so glad we went! The tour guide was an older",
          "We took our kids age 7, 9, 11 to this museum during our one day trip to Cleveland. All of us enjoyed the tour. What's great about the Christmas Story House is that it is 100% hands-on. It was SO nice to be there with the kids and not have to stay on top of them every second",
          "This was the best tour. They do tours every hour and we had to wait about 20 minutes for the tour to start but that gave us time to walk around in the gift shop and look at all the The Christmas Story things to buy. The guide for the tour said for us to have fun and that is what",
          "Maybe if it were christmas, this would've excited me more but it really is just a house. The store across the street has everything christmas story if you're a super fan so might be worth the stop to jump in there for a few.",
          "The staff doing the renovations were friendly and said we could walk around the exterior and take photos because it was closed this week. The website didn't show this though.",
          "Drove from New York and this was our first stop on our trip to Cleveland. I was a little disappointed that we had to wait 45 minutes for the next tour even though there was no one on the current tour but that was our fault for not checking ahead of time the tour times. The tour",
          "The tour is done in blocked times. Not a come and go type of tour. Smaller groups, able to ask questions of the tour guide and focus on the memorabilia. Surprised to find out you can reserve the whole house Christmas Eve for 6 people and have it all to yourself Christmas",
          "I was invited by friends to visit the Christmas Story House. Not being a huge fan of the movie, I couldn't understand what the fuss was all about, but I enjoy spending time with my friends so I agreed to come along with them. Once I stepped inside, I was hooked. I quickly",
          "The tour for the museum is pretty short, only about 90s minutes, but part of that time, you get the run of the house. You get to go through the bedrooms, listen to the phone conversation between Mrs. Parker and Mrs. Schwarz on the phone upstairs, even climb under the sink like",
          "What can you say about THE house where a Christmas story was shot - if you liked the movie you\u2019ll love the tour! Grab a full sized leg lamp on the way out! Parking is a challenge but do-able. Not wheelchair accessible (don\u2019t expect to see the furnace in the basement)",
          "If you are a fan of this movie, this is a very fun and interesting place to visit while in Cleveland. The house brings back memories of the movie and the museum has very interesting facts and props used in the movie. We were there the day of the 5K race and many people were",
          "Great spot to see for all The Christmas Story fans out there. House right in a neighborhood. Porch and outside, just as you would envision from the movie.",
          "If you're a fan of the movie, the house is a must when you're in the Cleveland Area. This is not your typical walk through tour. You're allowed to have fun there. Hid under the sink like Randy did, pick up the upstair phone and hear Schwartz's mom screaming. The tour guides know",
          "I vacillated between an \"Average\" and \"Very Good\" rating for this attraction. Living in NE Ohio, I want to see things like the Christmas Story House be a success. However, one should try to maintain some impartiality when writing a review on Trip Advisor. That said, I did",
          "We stopped here on a recent trip to Cleveland. It was just after New Year\u2019s so not as busy as I\u2019ve heard it can get. We didn\u2019t wait at all for a tour and got right into the house. The tour guide was great, though I do wish he had spent less time talking and allowed us more time",
          "My husband and I ran the 10k that raises money for the house and visited it afterwards. It's pretty cool to see all the stuff that is in the movie. The outside is exactly like it. The inside is a little different. We also saw the museum and went to the gift shop.",
          "Definitely worthy of a trip. Short drive/ride from downtown. You'll learn some things that you will appreciate next time you watch the movie.",
          "This tour was so much fun I have to share all the photos for everyone to see! It\u2019s the original A Christmas Story house in Cleveland and is a must see! You can even stay overnight! Learned a bunch of fun facts and of course you\u2019ll want everything in their gift shop! They totally",
          "I have watched the movie for years! It was great to see the house and the neighborhood. Very interesting and informative. They also have a gift shop and museum near by also.",
          "Visited in November 2018. You learn a lot of behind the scenes information when you take the tour, The house itself is quite small but true to the movie and the time period, They encourage pictures and insist that you touch the Leg Lamp!",
          "I wanted to spend my 40th birthday at A Christmas Story house after having such an amazing experience when visiting. My husband and I called many times over several days to make a reservation. It was during business hours but no one ever answered the phone. My husband left two",
          "My family and I made a special trip here to kick off our Christmas Season celebrations, and boy was it worth it! Growing up, we sat and watched this movie countless times since it used to show for 24hrs on TNT for Christmas, so it was great to actually be where they shot some of",
          "This ended up being much better than I thought it would be. In addition to the house they have a museum with props and trivia about the movie. Cost to get in was $11. So if you love the Christmas Story movie its a must see.",
          "Visited this house with my wife and two daughters on December 22. My oldest daughter, a senior in college, my youngest , a senior. This is not just for younger children, we have watched the movie annually, and couldn't wait to check this out. We were very pleased, there was an",
          "Remember the Christmas Story, This Veteran owned business brings back the Christmas Story to your memory. The car, firetruck, museum and the house are so well maintained and reminds you of the movie. I took the whole family who enjoyed everything. A must see",
          "The visit is sooo much fun in a well-run operation that doesn't miss a trick (in a good way). This morning I took the whole family, aged 7 to 77 including two teen-agers. Everyone had fun in the interactive house where one can touch and fool around with anything there and in",
          "Definitely take the tour...the tour guide is fun and informational giving you the interesting history of the house/neighborhood and movie filming details. A lot of props throughout the house that can be used for photo ops which is a lot of fun (recreating movie scenes). The",
          "We made a stop in December and it was rather busy. The house was neat to see, just keep in mind that many of the indoor movie scenes were not filmed in the house. My kids appreciated that everything in the house was hands-on. The museum across the street had a great deal of",
          "Took my mother in law for an afternoon and it was pretty fun. The price is a little high, but I guess you expect that for an attraction like this. The house itself is fun because it\u2019s interactive. Be sure to pick up the phone in the upstairs hall!!! The museum has some fun",
          "any fan of the show needs to go. You are not felt rushed at any point. It is a self guided tour through the original house. There are flashbacks galore as you walk where Ralphie walked. So many things will bring back memories. Across the street is a museum and a gift shop. Both",
          "The prices in the gift shop were affordable. The museum is full of items from the movie. The house is neat where you can touch everything. Have to try the bar across the street the food is so good but not sure about the drinks. Also Lake Erie isn\u2019t far from here worth the drive",
          "We visited the Christmas Story House and Museum on our way home from North Carolina. If you are a fan of the movie it was very well done and our guide was really entertaining. There is a gift store, the original movie house and museum that holds a number of the costumes and",
          "If you are a fan of A Christmas Story and are in the Cleveland area, you must go here. The tour of the house is affordable, and the best part is you get to touch everything in the house. We had a great time re-creating our favorite scenes from the movie for pictures. The gift",
          "We drove from central Indiana and it was worth it. It's worth noting that if you go in December be prepared to wait in line. The line stretched all the way to Terra Haute (LOL). Actually, it was probably about a block long. You get to wander through the house on your own and",
          "We drove all the way from Chicago just to see the Christmas Story House and we were not disappointed. We had our 3 year old with us and were very happy that everything was child friendly and the tour was interactive, where you could touch or sit on anything (hold the leg lamp",
          "If you love \"A Christmas Story,\" this will certainly enhance that feeling. The house is filled with obvious and subtle reminders from the film. With only a few exceptions, the house is interactive. Be Ralphie with the leg lamp, or sit on the toilet in dismay over the \"crummy",
          "What a fun treasure in Cleveland! Staff was very friendly. The house was incredible. The owners did a remarkable job recreating the movie to real life! Everything in the house is child friendly. The items in the gift shop are surprisingly reasonable! Can\u2019t wait to return!",
          "As a Clevelander, never really thought of this place until I had some out of town guests. Really nice job done with the gift shop and the house tour. Also didn't realize that you could stay in the house for the night. Please note, there are timed tours to see the house so",
          "We had a few hours at CLE so we took a $15.00 Uber ride over to the Christmas Story House.My wife and I both love the movie and you learn so much about it on the tour that you just can\u2019t find on the internet.I wish we had more time in the museum ( I could have stayed an hour)",
          "I didn't go inside because the line was down the street (it was a Saturday in December). But, it was still nice to be able to walk up to the house and get some pictures and see the leg lamp from the street. You can even see a few cars from the movie across the street for free.",
          "So I first need to start with the disclaimer that I am a diehard fan of everything and anything Christmas including this movie of course! With that said, I am a super big critic when it comes to this type of thing. I am totally aware that not much of the film was filmed in",
          "A friend and I visited A Christmas Story House. What a fun time reliving one of our favorite childhood movies. To see the house where such shenanigans took place brought back many memories. All the antiques from the 50's reminded us of days gone by. The displays are just like in",
          "What a great mid week getaway ! The house is interactive and the staff is very knowledgeable. There is plenty of free parking but there is also a pay lot. The museum across the street is very interesting and well kept. The gentleman who was in the museum was very knowledgeable",
          "This was so much fun! Yes, it's touristy. Yes, it's campy. But we had a blast. Was in Cleveland for business and went with co-workers. We only had time for one attraction and this was at the top of all three of our lists. Recommend taking an Uber or Lyft there since it is in a",
          "What a fantastic way to kick off December and visit one of the most iconic houses in all of Christmas movie history. The house is interactive and allows to you to pick up and touch any props in the house (leg lamp, Red Ryder, etc...). A must go for any Christmas Story fanatic.",
          "I\ufe0f consider this to be the only bright spot in the otherwise complete waste of land known as Cleveland. If you\u2019re a fan of the movie and have to be in Cleveland, take the time to see it. Due to time constraints I\ufe0f wasn\u2019t able to take the tour, but I\ufe0f did stop long enough for",
          "Me and my co-workers were here on business and thought this would be a great team building experience. Well first of all the house was hard to find because it is in a neighborhood that everyday people live on. Secondly parking is terrible. You park on the street side in front of",
          "The price to visit the house is a little $$$ because it is very quick. But if you are a fan the every penny is worth the experience. Staff was very friendly and was accommodating to the large group we had.",
          "$11.80 per person was steep and the tour wasn\u2019t much but they have everything from the movie there. Hats, lamps, shirts they got it all.",
          "Each year my family watches A Christmas Story on Christmas Eve. This year I decided it was time to visit the famous house where the movie was filmed...it did not disappoint. The tour was pretty cheap ($11) and they allowed visitors to touch props in the house and to take as many",
          "We arrived on a Saturday after Thanksgiving at 10am and it was packed! We parked on a neighbors lawn for $10.00 and visited the gift shop to buy our tickets to get into the house. The wait for the gift shop was about 20 minutes and then we waited about 30 to get into the house.",
          "We were at the steelyards commons shopping area, when by chance a pin for the Christmas house came up on the gps... My wife had never seen the movie, and still enjoyed the tour, and atmposhere ... a gift shop chocked with leg lamps, and Christmas goodies is sure to please most",
          "Unfortunately I didn\u2019t watch the movie so I couldn\u2019t embrace the house.

          "My husband and I had a great time touring the Christmas Story House. Our guide was very knowledgeable as to information about filming of the movie as well as all the actors. We are both fans of the movie which made it all the more fun! The museum was nice and the gift shop was",
          "Our tour guide was great and very informative. You can take pictures and interact with the props throughout the house. To preserve the materials they ask that you turn off your flash when taking pictures in the museum. You also cannot film the inside of the house or museum.",
          "What a great tour of this house that was used in part of the filming of A Christmas Story. This is a scheduled tour so go to gift shop first to buy tickets and find out tour times. Exploring the house was so fun and listening to others talk about how they love the movie.",
          "This was a great tour. I really enjoyed visiting the home where the movie was film and history behind the making of the movie. The gift shop is wonderful. It has every A Christmas Story souvenir that you can image. I took a lot for me not to go crazy with the shopping.",
          "If you loved the movie like my family does you'll want to stop in at the Christmas story house when in Cleveland. Coolest place ever to have your photo taken for your next card. Just don't \"shoot your eye out!\"",
          "If you\u2019re not a fan you won\u2019t get it. You only need about an hour and a half but it\u2019s worth seeing. The house itself is really cool. You can handle all of the props and take lots of pictures. The museum had the actual props and costumes. We had fun.",
          "If you appreciate the awesomeness that is \"The Christmas Story\" you will not be disappointed. Everyone on the tour is just so happy and excited to be there. You can run around the house, sit under the sink, hold the BB gun and hear the infamous phone convo. Must do for fans!!!",
          "This place is EXACTLY what you might expect-which is why I gave it five stars-If you are a fan of the 1983 movie. If you are a fan of the movie you will not be disappointed. The site contains three buildings: the Christmas Story House, a museum, and a gift shop. Our tour",

          "In the interest of full disclosure, I'll admit that I'm merely a casual fan of the movie \"A Christmas Story.\" Some of my family members are much bigger fans of this movie and have seen it many times. This attraction is tailor-made for the true fans of the movie, and after taking",
          "We visited in Oct 2017. We were so excited to see it. It has been a staple in our family for 22 years. I will say the house itself is amazing. The thing I really did not like is the over commercialism of the most wholesome Christmas movie ever. I realize it is a tourist",
          "I'm a huge fan of the movie, so experiencing the house was a bucket list item checked off. Lots of great scenes were filmed here (leg lamp, bunny suit, dogs ruining Christmas dinner, Ralphi shooting his eye out, etc). The tour guide, Lee, was very friendly and did a great job",
          "Was up in Cleveland for the first time to support a friend. Noticed that the house and museum was near the Hotel I was staying at for the night. Unfortunately got there just after five and the buildings were closing for the night. Was able to get some outside shots and will",

          "Went on a tour of this house. LOVED it! The girl, Brittany, who gave us the tour did a great job! Loved hearing the story behind the story. And for only $11 to take a tour of the house and museum, well worth it!! Loved the gift shop too. And who knew that you can actually",
          "Just to visit and see the house with the Front porch and light up leg lamp in the front window, will make your heart sing. If you\u2019ve grown up watching this movie, you have to stop if you are in the area. The gift shop will make me laugh and smile. Lots of goodies to buy. A",
          "If you\u2019re a fan of the movie, this is a MUST see! The house is completely interactive; you can touch everything, even crawl into the kitchen cupboard like Randy. Of course the Leg Lamp is in the window, the decoded message in the bathroom and a blue bowling ball is under the",
          "This was one of our first stops after landing at the airport. You won't find it by mistake but it isn't tough to find either. It seems odd to have such a tourist attraction in what seems like an otherwise normal neighborhood but even some of the neighbors charge for parking-$5.",

        "wiki": "The Cleveland Museum of Natural History is a natural history museum located approximately five miles (8 km) east of downtown Cleveland, Ohio in University Circle, a 550-acre (220 ha)  concentration of educational, cultural and medical institutions. The museum was established in 1920 by Cyrus S. Eaton to perform research, education and development of collections in the fields of anthropology, archaeology, astronomy, botany, geology, paleontology, wildlife biology, and zoology. The museum traces its roots to the Ark, formed in 1836 on Cleveland's Public Square by William Case, the Academy of Natural Science formed by William Case and Jared Potter Kirtland, and the Kirtland Society of Natural History, founded in 1869 and reinvigorated in 1922 by the trustees of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.Donald Johanson was the curator of the museum when he discovered \"Lucy,\" the skeletal remains of the ancient hominid Australopithecus afarensis. The current Curator and Head of the Physical Anthropology Department is Yohannes Haile-Selassie.\nIn 2002, the new Fannye Shafran Planetarium was built near the entrance to the museum, containing displays on the planets in the Solar System, and historical instruments of exploration, such as compasses and astrolabes.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\nMuseum collections total more than four million specimens and include specimens of paleontology, zoology, archaeology, mineralogy, ornithology, and a variety of other scientific subjects.\nA beloved full-scale model of a Stegosaurus on the lawn delights Cleveland children.\nSome of the more important specimens are:\n\nAn extensive collection of Late Devonian fossil fish from the Cleveland Shale, including several mounted skulls of the arthrodire placoderm Dunkleosteus.\nNine hundred monkey and ape skeletons, and more than 3,100 human skeletons (the Hamann-Todd Collection).\nThe only specimen of the small tyrannosaur Nanotyrannus lancensis.\nThe holotype of the Haplocanthosaurus sauropod.\nThe most complete mount of a Coelophysis bauri.\nMounted taxidermy remains of Balto the sled dog.\nAn extensive mineralogy collection that includes a Moon rock and the Jeptha Wade gem collection.\nReplica skeletons of Triceratops and Jane, a juvenile tyrannosaurid.\nMultiple mastodon and mammoth specimens.\nA cast of an Australopithecus afarensis skeleton, an early hominid affectionately dubbed Lucy.\nA new Tyrannosaurus skeleton that is now on display.\nThe museum's Allosaurus has been remounted and is on display.\nA collection of 30,000 plant fossils acquired from the University of Cincinnati by former curator of paleobotany, Shya Chitaley.\nA Foucault pendulum underneath in which the Bicentennial Education Time Capsule was buried in 1996 and will be opened in 2046.The museum has made many discoveries over the years. Recently, in Vertebrate Paleontology, both the remains of a Titanichthys in Ohio and a new ceratopsian, Albertaceratops nesmoi, have been made. Both are expected to go on display eventually.\n\n\n=== Hamann-Todd Collection ===\nThe Hamann-Todd Collection is a collection of more than 3100 human skeletons and over 900 primate skeletons that were assembled starting in 1893.  The collection was originally housed at Western Reserve University Medical School in a new medical building that was built for that purpose.  The first floor of this building contained the Hamann Museum of Comparative Anthropology and Anatomy.  However, due to the costs of storing the bones, the collection was transferred to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.In 1893, Carl August Hamann initiated the collection.  Its administration was taken over by T. Wingate Todd after Hamann was named dean of Western Reserve University's medical school in 1912.  Todd managed to assemble the great majority of the human skeletons in the collection, over 3000, before his death in 1938.\n\n\n=== Perkins Wildlife Center ===\nThe Ralph Perkins II Wildlife Center and Woods Garden presented by Key Bank, which includes live animals and plants native to Ohio, opened on September 3, 2016.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nJones-Kern, Kevin; Bruce Latimer (Spring 1996). \"Skeletons Out of the Closet\".

          "I've been to many Natural History Museums across the country and this is a nice one. Lots of interactive displays to keep young and old interested while learning something new. They are always updating and improving the Museum. Well worth a visit.",
          "This was a nice museum, with some Ohio specific displays. It is smaller than some natural history museums, but would still be fun for kids. There is also a cafe, for a snack or two, though I did not stop in, so cannot speak to that beyond it is there. There is a parking",
          "This museum is well-known for its dinosaur exhibit, but also has good exhibits on other animals, plants, and ethnography. It was remodeled a few years ago; not much changed on the inside, but there are new outdoor walkways to bring the visitors closer to the local wildlife",

          "I was in town for a conference, which surprisingly restricted my ability to see things in Cleveland. I was not expecting most of the museums/zoo/aquarium to close by 5:00 PM, but, the more you know. Luckily, the Museum of Natural History is open late on Wednesdays. I had a",

          "Yawn!!!! This place has not seemed to change at all in the last 25 years. Most the exhibits are still the same from when I was a kid. It isn't worth the price you have to pay. We were in and out within an hour. Save your money",

          "In comparison to NYC or London Natural History museums this one lacks major \u201cnatural history\u201d and costs $17 - it should be donation only - yes it has its good parts and informative areas but live animals (injured or otherwise) should not be kept in cages far too small for them",
          "Good exhibits on Native Americans, and lots of dinosaur skeletons. Balto is there with a great story, as is Lucy. This museum kept me entertained for a couple of hours. Discounts are very modest. Interestingly, evolution and dinosaurs share a hall. If you don't believe any",

          "Has so much stuff, in all areas of natural history, and even includes a small zoo with many animals native to the Ohio area. Definitely better to go in the summer when you can see all the animals, but in general everything there is amazing, particularly when you consider that",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our day at the museum! My kids vary in age from 3 to 21 and each and every one of them had a great time! We particularly enjoyed the dinosaur exhibit and Balto exhibit! The kids were fascinated with the adventurous life Balto lived and how he was rescued by",
          "Great place for children of all ages. My sons are a big fans of this museum. University Circle is a great place to go.",
          "This is such an excellent museum,with special exhibits constantly changing. Very well displayed dioramas and friendly docents",
          "Went for the first time while visiting family. All the kids had a great time and really enjoyed the interactive exhibits. We were fortunate enough to have a nice weather day and could actually go outside and see the animals which was a bonus. The exhibits are very educational",
          "The museum is great place to visit for all ages. I liked the mammoths and elephants exhibition, dinosaurs, and the planetarium show. The museum has a discovery center for little kids where they can play and have fun. Surprisingly, the cafe wasn't overpriced and I would suggest",
          "My husband and I went for the planetarium, and were surprised by what the museum had to offer. The Mastodon exhibit was very cool. We will be back!",
          "This has always been a good family museum but with the addition of the Euclid Beach carousel, it is even better. The carousel is fully working as in an amusement park. So besides riding on it, there is the auto museum and the costume wing of clothing worn by early Clevelanders.",
          "The floor plan was great! Very interesting exhibits and explanations. Worth the time and effort to get there!!",
          "Always and every time we visit, just us or with out-of-town guests, we have a wonderful time. Each of my grandchildren have been enjoying the Smeed Discovery Center since they were 2 and it is always where they want to go each year they come to Cleveland. We've added the",
          "I'm not much for museums but I went with my two daughters, aged 9 and 11, and we stayed for 5 hours on Sunday. My one daughter loves elephants and she loved seeing the comparison of elephants to mammoths and mastadons in the new exhibit. There are so many exhibits here,",
          "We've enjoyed this museum greatly. We even got a membership. It's not the largest, but it has interesting exhibits and an incredibly friendly staff. If you live locally the membership is a great idea. We've really enjoyed the members events. The little cafe they have is",
          "I came to see the mammoths and mastodons exhibit and was pleasantly surprised with it. I found myself more interested than I predicted. There were lots of things to touch and the fifth grader in me was delighted. I also especially liked the outdoor wildlife section. The weather",
          "It's not the Smithsonian. It's not the American Museum of Natural History in NY. But it's an excellent mid sized museum for all ages. Has something for everyone; dinosaurs, rocks and gems, earthquake simulator and a very good planetarium. The gift shop is fairly large and",
          "Great museum The exhibits on science, animals, dinosaurs , apes, marine life and rare gem stones was Interesting and knowledgeable. A must visit when in the area.",
          "The Cleveland Natural History Museum is moderately sized with very fine and representative exhibits - Gems and minerals, dinosaurs, etc. The special exhibit was on the Silk Road trade from China to the Mediterranean. Kids and grown ups will love this!",
          "I went here for curiosity one evening while spending time in University circle. This museum is good for younger people and maybe children who are fascinated with knowledge about animals. It is just as good for adults who like science. Science and nature are on display here.",
          "We visited the museum on a day when there was a lot going on in the area so had to park quite far away as the police re-routed us for a bike race right by the museum. That being said, it allowed us to have a nice walk in the nearby park and through the Museum of Art (which is",
          "Our oldest son is very into dinosaurs so we had to stop here while visiting Cleveland. Both our boys were thrilled to see the exhibit. I enjoyed the gemstone exhibit. The staff seemed very knowledgeable and were great with my very inquisitive son. It was a nice family day.",
          "Neat museum to visit. Very directed toward kids but we (2 adults) enjoyed walking through and checking everything out. We did giggle that the signs were obviously typed on a typewriter and haven't been updated in decades. The living animals exhibit is kinda cool, we just",
          "You could spend hours in this museum. They have interactive activities that keep the kids entertained. Glad we made the stop!",
          "I love visiting this museum! I recently viewed the excellent exhibit on the ancient Silk Road, the caravan trade route from the area of modern-day State of Israel in the West to China in the East. Great exhibit! I also enjoyed visiting the live animals, including the Ohio",
          "Lots to do, and very fun even for an adult with no kids. Go see a film in the planetarium. And try the earthquake simulator.",
          "I brought my kids (5, 7 & 9) here for a field trip (we homeschool) in April, and my best friend and her baby also came along. We all had a great day. I wish I was able to use my science center membership here but they said no. It's not too expensive though, so it was worth it.",
          "I love this museum because there is something for everyone in the family to enjoy\u2026plus, there is infinite learning to be had here for all ages. Children will especially like the many exotic animals, reptiles, birds and insects on display, as well as all the hands on exhibits",
          "I was pleasantly surprised with the breadth and quality of the exhibits. Their special Spice Road exhibit was outstanding! I also liked their history of evolution section. What a bargain, no fee.",
          "My family of five, with three small children (Ages 10,7,and 5) went here during a recent trip to the Cleveland area. We had a wonderful time and spent about 5 hours exploring this museum without getting bored. We even checked out the planeterium (nominal charge of 4 dollars",
          "We came here on a whim while in town and was very pleased. The kids loved it! Tons of hands on exhibits for the kids to keep entertained and engaged. Plus great information for parents to enjoy as well. Overall couldn't be more pleased and will definitely be here again.",
          "This museum is worth visiting once, and the dinosaur exhibit is pretty good, but I expected more walking in, with the University Circle area being so built up and the fabulous Art Museum nearby. It's worth a visit, but probably only one.",
          "We loved this place so much that we purchased a season pass! It is a great place for kids to learn...lots to see.",
          "Has one section with changing exhibits, and an outdoor Ohio animal walk. Well worth visiting at least once.",
          "We enjoyed the live silkworms in the Silk Road Exhibit and the Humans & Nature, and Gem galleries the most. There is a nice little outdoor walk with some live animal exhibits and you may find a staff member with a hawk or falcon taking a stroll. My daughters liked the",
          "I like to go into museums and find things that are unique to that museum that no other museum has. Unfortunately, there is really nothing special here. I will say that it is a descent museum for kids who have never stepped inside a Natural History Museum before. If they find",
          "Well organized with good collection of gyms and stones.We liked the life animals and birds section.If you have kids with you I am sure they will love it.",
          "My 5 year old grandson choice this venue for his birthday party! The staff did a fabulous job and made it fun as well as a learning experience for the kids and the adults as well!",
          "We used to take field trips here in school, which I remembered positively. Then, about 5 years back, I went to visit on a lark and was disappointed by the dilapidated, dustiness of the place. I only went back recently because I'd seen advertisements for the \"Nature's Mating",
          "Enjoy the area! Needs updates but a small outdoor animal area...excellent! You can get up close and see several native animals to cleveland area.",
          "I love this museum, but I cry inside every time we have to pay the admission. For what they charge, I would expect updated exhibits and more hands on features for children. Now... they did announce this year that they are planning an expansion in 2016, so we are waiting to visit",
          "If you have kids I could totally see this place being fun. But compared to every other natural museum I've been to (Field, Smithsonian, etc) this one feels tiny and doesn't have any unique character. The worst part is that their prime attraction, Lucy, here is a cast and not the",
          "Often crowded wild children running around and small spaces made for a difficult visit. The dinosaur skeletons were by far the best part, but a very small part of this museum. Lucy, is also located here, but for such a spectacular scientific discovery, it's tucked into a",
          "Knew we would not spend a full day here, so came at 7pm on Wednesday--late night is open until 10. Paid discount price of $6 per person. Did not purchase the food/adult drink option. Not crowded, but certainly not empty either. Kids liked the hands-on computer screens. We",
          "This museum definitely needs some updating and more interesting exhibits. We weren't impressed with this museum at all.",
          "I would say that this museum would be perfect for the younger family - masses of intriguing exhibits and close to a couple of other museums to fill a rainy Saturday. $12 for adults and $10 for kids means it might not be a cheap visit, but \"Nature's Mating Games: Beyond the Birds",
          "Took 2-grandchildren aged 5 and 8. Museum is located in University Circle area which has a lot of other museums and things to do (within walking distance). Parking lot is immediately adjacent to museum, timed parking and pay as you leave ($6 for me). Parking also available on",

          "It doesn't stack up to NYC or Chicagos field museum but its defiantly an interesting and fun way to spend the day. Children will love the dinosaur exhibit and the staff is always friendly and informative. Well worth the price but if you live in the Area a year membership might",
          "We were hosting a business event and this museum was our venue. The staff was great and it was a very unique experience. We especially liked when the staff brought out a porcupine and an owl for our guests to interact with. The knowledgeable staff treated our guests with an",

          "OK, so not all the dinosaur fossils are real. And the hall with all the stuffed animals can be kind of creepy if you think too long about how they all got there. But there's good information here. Plus some interesting live animals (be sure to spend some time with the otters",
          "We enjoyed touring the dinosaur skeletons and the other exhibits, it was all very well done, but the highlight of our visit was meeting Spike, a live lizard on the arm of his escort in the live animals program. It's wonderful to go back in time and see the various epochs that",
          "My grandkids enjoy visiting here every year. They have dinosaur bones, information on the different prehistoric eras, bug and butterfly collections, a childrens learning/play room and much morre. An outdoor walking trail with live birds/animals along the way. It is in the",
          "Nice afternoon for a great price. Kids love the dinosaur bones. Usually have an additional special exhibit. Sometimes crafts in the basement area.",
          "This museum is participating in the Blue Star Family program (allowing free admission for military and dependents), thanks to this program we enjoyed the place for free. We loved it. Every section was informative and fun(even for adults), I had no idea Balto was in residence",
          "The museum is a great place to visit. The children there seemed to really be enjoying their time there. The museum is nicely set up and the displays were clear and educational. The wildlife aspect was a treat complete with birds of prey up close and personal. The outdoor",
          "The Cleveland Museum of Natural History is located in the university circle section of Cleveland that houses several other museums. Parking cost $8 for about 5-6 hours. The lot is large but fills up by afternoon. There are two levels. There is not much to see on the lower",
          "Firstly, let me state that my review might initially appear harsh, but I've seen many museum's, and this place has potential, but hasn't found it yet. The history is represented adequately, but the infrastructure is old and in need of a stylistic renovation. There are many",
          "it was very enjoyable. kids ranging from 6-11 all had fun looking at the exhibits. Go on a Wednesday evening though as its half price after 5 and you are done in 2-3 hrs. Big groups can save quite a bit then.",
          "i had not been to the museum for about five years. Unfotunately, we found the museum in disrepair and dirty. The exhibits have not been kept up, the cards in the cases with the verbiage addressing the exhibits were so faded you could not read them. There were no docents or",
          "I remember going here as a child, and sadly with the exception of the travelling exhibits, not much has changed! Definitely needs some updating. That being said the outdoor portion of the museum is very nice to experience wildlife.",
          "well worth the trip,lots to see and do One of the best natural history museums in america. Go early as it can get busy Peter Bruce Photo",
          "We went to see the Megalodon exhibit. That was fine. But, they also have mastodon and mammoth skeletons face to face, and a volunteer came up to help us distinguish the two. Helped me a lot - and the gift store is fun.",
          "Our group of kids enjoyed the sights (ages 7-12) and it held their attention for a few hours. Dinosaur and Balto exhibits were really attention getting. Glad we went. Parking was a bit difficult but perhaps if we knew the area better it would have been easier.",
          "everything, we had a really great time! Want to return with my grandchildren. Balto and all the animals were very entertaining.",
          "My husband and I recently took our son (8) and daughter(3) to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. I was unsure how it would go over with the 3 year old, but she had just as much fun as her brother. I found the museum very kid friendly, with more hands on items than I",
          "I went there with 9 and 10 y old last weekend. Boring expo. Lots of facts just to read off the walls. Dinosores in one room. Sharks in another room. Animal show - that we couldn't stand - more like \"one man telling stories about animals\". We only stayed for eagle and some",
          "Liked the fossil skeletons, displays on rocks and minerals and the temporary exhibit about Megalodon sharks.",
          "My husband and I took our two young children (ages 5 & 2) to spend an afternoon at the Natural History Museum. We decided on the Museum because we were both tired of malls, wanted to avoid Chuck E. Cheese at all costs, and needed an indoor place to escape the damp, dreary",
          "This was an unplanned stop, but very glad we did so. A very nice quiet enjoyable day, with a ton of great stuff to see and learn about.",
          "Great traveling exhibits geared to all ages. Permanent exhibits are well maintained. The theater is comfortable and movies well done.",
          "Good displays,nice quiet area,good easy access from expressways. Always nice to piggyback trip with trip to other events and museums in local area.",
          "Exhibits are nice, if a little dated. Staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. Great place to take the kids.",
          "This is the perfect museum for cold or rainy days, which in Cleveland there are many. I my 2 kids (3 and 11) have a lot of fun at this museum. Many of the exhibits have not changed since i was a kid and that keeps som of the nostalgia for me but the have added many new things",
          "The travelling exhibits - \"50 Greatest Photographs of National Geographic\" and \"Whales/Tohora\" were outstanding! The whale exhibit was a great interactive approach to museum education which will appeal to a wide range of ages. The write ups in some of the permanent exhibits",
          "Again, have been there a number of times over the years. The displays are simply amazing. I always come away having learned something new. To be able to touch the bone of a T-rex in one of the displays (it's designed to BE touched--I didn't do it on the sly), give me chills.",
          "Our kids has a great time. The dinos, and prehistoric animal exhibits were there favorites. Geology and space exhibits, animals of the world and the live animals outdoors were highlights. The place seems dated though it still is a great learning experience.",
          "This is my favorite museum in the Cleveland area, probably since we played on the Stegosaurus outside when I was a child (am a 53 year old child now). I like everything about dinosaurs and have been to dinosaur exhibits all over the world. This museum has a great room with many",
          "Very nice museum, but focused mostly for children ages 12 and under. They have live animals and a live animal show. The planetarium show was entertaining, but mostly because of the staff member facilitating the show.",
          "Son and I had been on a fun and short educational trip during his summer vacation and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History has been a great place to visit. Worth the drive all the way from Buffalo, NY, together with the Zoo and the museum of Science. The dinosaurs are great,",
          "This museum is an awesome place to take kids, big and little. It has some great dinosaur exhibits and some very interesting things for children of all ages.",
          "The current new exhibits were nice, but the older \"stuffed and bones\" parts of the museum had a musty smell. Quite a few of the interactive exhibits had buttons that didn't work, lights that didn't light up, etc. (The live outdoor exhibits included ADJACENT exhibits of bobcats",
          "We went for the kids but quite enjoyed it. Lots of good displays and diaramas",
          "Love the dinosaurs and outdoor exhibits are great.",
          "But this place gets me excited every time. The first section, from the early North America room to the dinosaurs, brings back memories of school trips as a child. It might be outdated, but I hope they never change it. Still a great collection of skeletons and reproductions. Some",
          "My husband and I enjoyed this museum when visiting Cleveland. It is not in the same league as the Art Museum, but is still interesting and enjoyable. Given that this is 2012, I find no excuse for old typewritten signs. They need to refresh. However, I love the stuffed animal",
          "This is another of the great museums in the University Circle area of Cleveland.I still remember going there as a school kid and seeing the well preserved mastodons from the Ice Age. They also have incredible mummies and other cool natural history relics. This is a great place",
          "I have been a member for a few years and every time the grandchildren have a break from school, we visit the Natural History Museum or the zoo. They never seem to tire of it. The kids loved the dinosaurs, the special presentations, seeing the live animals, the nature walk",
          "Half-@$$ed. I don't think the organizers have ever been to a natural history museum. Feels like they threw some stuffed animals in a building and called it a museum.",
          "We are very lucky to have this museum in Cleveland. It is a wonderful adventure; children are awestruck. Gotta go.",
          "I lived in Cleveland and visited this museum many times growing up. I always liked it and visited it again with my children this time. I can't say enough about it. It is a wonderful museum, delightful in so many ways. When you first walk in to the museum you see dioramas and",
          "First of all, I was on a long bus trip with seniors, so our visit to the museum was timed and much shorter than I would have liked. The museum was well laid out and well directed. I visited the parts I liked first: the live animals outside, the dinosaur exhibit, the animals",
          "The dinosaur exhibit is a showstopper. We especially like the childrens activities and educational exhibits.",
          "Parking is hard to find, but there are meters on the street if you can find a spot...didn't notice if there was a parking garage or not. Admission was free for us as we have the ASTC American Science and Technology Membership from a PA museum. Spent about a 1/2 hr. to 1 hr.",
          "The actual displays and interactive opportunities at the museum were excellent. We especially enjoyed the \"Mythic Creature\" exhibits and the dinosaur and early human exhibits. The live animal section was also interesting. We had really looked forward to the planetarium.",
          "The exhibits are fabulous. They have a really neat kids play area in the basement and outdoor animal exhibit.",
          "We like this museum, but parts are a little dated. They do some great programing, but the regular collection needs updating.",
          "My children enjoy the Natural History museum. There are some nice exhibits and a lot to look at for children of all ages. It's not as big as some other Natural History museums in other cities, but it is a very nice museum. The food in their cafeteria is great! I normally",
          "We love the Museum of Natural History! Great permanent and special exhibits, including plenty of dinosaur skeletons and an outside animal exhibit. On Saturdays, volunteers might have a live skunk or opossum to show you. Fantastic planetarium shows, check online for the",
          "This was my first museum experience in my life, and I'm 23. I thought this place would be really boring, and I didn't want to go, but my boyfriend insisted. It was suprisingly pretty cool to me. They have the dinosaurs exhibit, an outdoor animal exhibit, a lot of human history,",
          "Very well thought out, fun, great for all ages. Can eaily kill a rainy afternoon there! Not too expensive.",
          "This was an unexpected addition last minute to our trip. After finding out that this museum is open until 10pm on Wednesdays it was important to include it in order to get just a little more education in for my 11 year old and the rest of the adults in our group tagged along.",
          "Went to visit this wonderful museum recently that has been in my backyard the whole time and I was very impressed. Children and family members of all ages will delight in displays that feature entire dinosaur skeletons to interactive games for the kids. I had no idea we had",
          "This museum is just my size- great for an afternoon stroll around. The outdoor areas were my favorite, with native species exhibited in as natural environment as possible. The live animal display was great - the docent was well versed and gave an enjoyable presentation about the",
          "We'd already done the art museum, but it was 90 and who wanted to be outside? Went with 6 & 8 year olds on a hot day and had a great time. The Mythic Creature temporary exhibit is absolutely 100% awesome. Kids always love stuffed dead animal dioramas and there are plenty of",
          "This museum features a variety of rooms and lots to see. I love visiting the outdoor animal walk in the summer that features raccoons, deer and several hawks and other birds. The dinosaur room is one of my favorites that feature a t rex and mammoths. A great place for kids and",
          "I've been coming to this museum since I was a kid; now I'm able to bring my own children and we always have fun. The dinosaurs are fantastic, but there's much more here. My children's favorite section is the jewels and, of course, the Discovery Center on the bottom floor which",
          "My husband and I visited this museum last fall and we were kind of disappointed to be honest. We thought there would be a lot more to see and do but it was kind of small and had a lot of kid based stuff yet it wasn't very hands on. I was not impressed with this museum one bit.",
          "Great place to take the kids on a rainy day! We always like to go at least once a year.",
          "The Cleveland Museum of Natural History is one of the best places for children of all ages to explore. Soooo much to learn!! So much to enjoy! This is one of Cleveland's BEST places to go, always. Marvelous programs, classes, exhibits.",
          "It's a very good museum with the exhibits they show. Very well put-together. I love the dinosaurs!",
          "One of the best. Many one-of-a-kind items, especially dinosaur and hominid fossils. Some of the exhibits are a little dated, but it's still great. There's something for all ages and knowledge levels.",
          "So many things to see here from your traditional rocks and bones exhibits to a wonderful planetarium and outdoor nature/animal exhibit. Kids and adults will love it and there's always a traveling exhibit to enjoy. There's space to eat in the circle outside so bring a picnic",
          "The museum has a lot to do and see. The exhibits moving through help keep the interest of the patrons. Great for field trips and family outings.",
          "The museum has many different exhibits, in addition to an outdoor area with live animals on display. The dinosaurs are always a great sight and a wonderful crowd pleaser. The earthquake section of the museum was pretty cool - you are able to stand on a platform that will",
          "This is a nice natural history museum - It has a great earth science/ astronomy section and a great outdoor exhibit of rescued local animals. Good special exhibits - especially the Mythical Creatures now running.",
          "This museum is for children around 10 years. I didnt knew it, it wasnt written anywhere. Thats why i was disappointed.",
          "My husband and I visited the Museum and was pleased to find a mini zoo there. The male and female bald eagles were STUNNING! My favorite were the otters who were so elegantly and playfully swimming. Also during our visit we purchased a ticket to watch the movie at the",
          "The museum is very interesting, visually and educational. The traveling shows are usually worth the trip there and could take up all your time in and of themselves. Cafe is good - spend the day.",
          "Go there once a year, always fascinated, great exhibits,",
          "This museum was amazing, there were all sorts of exhibits through out the museum and even an outdoor safari with some of the animals showed in the exhibits, except the dinosaurs of course! Great for all ages, they even had a cafe!",
          "This is a very old museum but has been maintained nicely. Lots of good exhibits. A good place to bring the family-especially if the kids love dinosaurs.",
          "Great exhibits for the entire family. Young and old can enjoy this place. Excellent Day.",
          "While not the newest or most modern of facilities, there are many reasons to visit this museum. The exhibits are varied and interesting. There's plenty of space so you don't feel crowded. The outdoor animal exhibit was an unexpected surprise. Contrary to some other",
          "The museum has an older feel, but I think that is expected given that it is the history museum. The outdoor exhibits are a nice surprise. I have also worked with the museum regarding their involvement with students with disabilities and they are wonderful with the group. This",
          "I have not been blown away by a natural History museum in a small town ever. My daughter did not spend a second bored in the museum. The dinosaur exhibit was her absolute favorite and the T-Rex skeleton blew her little mind. We have not gone to a museum that had one and she was",
          "Really nice exhibits with enough for all ages to hold interest. The Kids Discovery Ctr. is great and I love that they change the stuff pretty regularly. The Cafe in the museum has incredibly good food for a cafeteria! Would highly recommend staying there for lunch.",
          "If you have kids this is an absolute must. When our kids were young this was a regular visit. This is truly a great museum.",
          "Great place just needs to be update in the decorating department.",
          "many of the exhibits have been there for years. The museum could use a facelift, more interesting exhibits, and perhaps make the exibites come alive or be more interactive.",
          "Who doesn't like dinasours but they have so much more. The area it's located is home to many museums, the botanical garden and a city park that we would have enjoed more in warmer weather. Drive once and explore all day.",
          "This museum is relatively small compared with comparable museums in large cities but it has several strengths some of which are sort of hidden away so be sure to ask about them. It specializes in human bones most of which are for research but that does result in a great public",
          "This was a nice museum. The price was pretty good. The exhibits were very good. The special exhibit was climate change, which I think everyone should know about. I enjoyed the main exhibit also.",

          "The museum is modern, clean and well maintained. Exhibits are well organized and each section tells its story well and clearly, with plenty of hands-on exhibits. There is an emphasis on Ohio. A high point for us was the outdoor garden with live animals native to the state:",
          "We came here for a reception. It was beautiful and I would have never thought about this place for one. I think having all this history & culture made the night even more special.",
          "Average describes this museum rather well. They offer some nice displays and lots of fun facts but there are certainly a few better museums in the country. However, it does offer enough to suit the average guest. If you do not want to go to DC or Chicago for natural history",
          "This museum is very practical, insightful, and educational without coming off as pompous or super nerdy. We really liked their area dedicated to climate change - as it really helped make such a complex subject easier to understand. There are a variety of dinosaur skeletons",
          "This is not a really big museum, but fun for kids, and also adults. Both inside and outside. Many things to learn at this museum. Many animals and rocks. Outside there is animals from Ohio. Fun for kids! They have a small resturant, not so much food to choose from, but okay for",
          "From the displays to the live animals, my young children had a great time. There is a learning center in the lower level that they didn't want to leave. We enjoyed the exhibits as well. The cafe was a little on the pricey side, but you are able to bring in your own food - a",
          "I would highly recommend for everyone to take a trip to the History Museum for all ages! Many interesting facts and displays as well as all the other museums in the area. Very educational and its something to do different.... In addition there are many great places to eat",
          "I would not recommend this museum to MY friends, but it would be good for some people. It is very kids orientated. There are \"\"hands on\"\" exhibits; there are videos and audio throughout. The beginning didn't really interest me personally, but the later exhibits on climate",
          "The Natural History Museum is another world-class museum in Cleveland. The top attraction has to be the extensive dinosaur exhibit.",
          "We visited this museum with some friends of ours - totaling 4 kids ages 5 and under. Admission was free with our local science museum membership. The museum had a great dinosaur display, and there were great displays throughout the museum. The live regional animal display"

We always love going here when we are in town and have time. They change out the big exhibit every few months to keep it fresh. Make some time and take the kids if you can.",

          "BOTTOM LINE : the outdoor addition certainly gives the museum a boost, but the rest is aging and in dire need of modernization.  Too pricey for what little there is to see. \n\nPRO : Outdoor nature walkway gives some close-up views of North \u2026",
          "The History Museum is very interesting! The outdoor walk is an added adventure. Children can feel an earthquake, learn about jewelry and gems, not forget fossils.",

          "The price is very reasonable, the museum is clean and entertaining, the outside portion is a great addition, and the cafe was a great way to end my trip. It was reasonably priced, so tasty, and the workers there were very eager to make my meal as great as it could be. I'm very satisfied with my experience here.",
          "This museum seriously needs a update. It\u2019s been the same way for seems like 30 years since I was in elementary school and I\u2019m 41 now! I would never pay full price and if I did I would want a refund after experiencing that. All I can say is \u2026",

          "Always a great place to visit. They are constantly changing exhibits which is fun & the outdoor area where you can get close to wild animals is fun. Trying to find the hidden cheeseburgers throughout the museum is an extra little quirk to keep you aware. There are 6 cheeseburgers to find. Still haven't found them all yet.",
          "Impressive display of dinosaur skeletons.  Interesting exhibit about Lucy, a specimen of a human ancestor, discovered by an associate of the museum.  The museum could stand to be updated.  It looks much the same as when I first saw it more than fifty years ago.",

          "My kids had the time of their life.  All the exhibits were great and the outdoor exhibit was amazing.  The only negative I could give is that we packed our cells a lunch to eat because online it said there was picnic benches we could useto \u2026",
          "Excellent family experience. Might be a little trying with younger kids, but the exhibits are big, colorful, and well-portrayed, engaging the imagination of kids.\nThe kids activity section in the basement is large, spacious, and has \u2026",
          "Not a huge museum, but lots to see and do. Spent the whole day there and the kids loved it.",
          "Great time to spend with your family learning about different things from space to dinosaurs",
          "I love the place so much my son had so much fun going there so next time i will go take whole family or Friends to come with me",
          "The guides were very friendly and knowledgeable and happy to share stories.  The place was under restoration, but the inside is beautiful.  Lovely grounds, very nice visit.",
          "Fantastic place includes a planetarium and if you go on Wednesday it is open until 10pm. The outdoors has a wildlife area. Which includes coyotes, grey and red foxes, eagles, falcons, fish and lots of descriptions of Ohio's swamps, etc. I'm \u2026",
          "Great exhibits for kids and adults of all ages!",
          "Exhibits were great! Don't miss Balto! The live animals outside were also an excellent surprise.",
          "Great museum. The cafe has awesome food not what you would expect. The best part is the outdoor exhibits and animals.",
          "Fun and family friendly near other attractions with a parking garage. Knowledgeable and helpful staff. Live animals and a cafe.",
          "Lots to do for the young ones, but parking should be free with the purchase of adult tickets. $12 to park is kind of a rip off.",
          "Always a great time. Whether with a family or just for a simple date with the wife this place never disappoints. The staff are super friendly and always very helpful as well as the volunteers. They constantly refresh the exhibits and experiences so there is always something new to do or see.",
          "So much fun for adults and children of all ages. lots of different exhibits including a wonderful area for toddlers to play. Staff was very friendly and helpful as well as a clean location and clean restrooms. Elevators all the way down to the parking garage which made it very handicap accessible",
          "Wonderful exhibits. Fun, experienced staff.",
          "On a hot day in Cleveland. What a great place to beat the heat. We seen dinosaurs,rocks, bugs and animals. We had a nice time.",
          "After having memberships to most of Cleveland's museums/attractions I have to say this is the best hands down. I've been taking my boys here since my oldest was 2 (now nearly 7) and there's always been more than enough to hold his interest \u2026",
          "First time taking my kids to a museum.. My daughter is 9 and my son is 3 and they both loved it and were totally impressed.",
          "The Cleveland Museum of Natural History provided a surprisingly interactive experience. There are many hands-on activities provided throughout the museum with signs stating, \"Please Touch.\" This museum is great for children, teens and \u2026",
          "There's a great BIG dinosaur exhibit there. The outside animal area allows close views of birds & animals.",
          "Perfect place to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon.",
          "The planetarium show was interesting, I recommend asking questions at the end instead of just staying silent. Definitely lots of interesting demonstrations and exhibits, especially if you're into geology, the science of evolution, or astrology.",
          "This is a great museum with all the basics. Dinosaurs, space, animals, geology and so on. What it lacks in pure volume compared to larger museums, it makes up for in quality and hands-on opportunity. It also has a new outdoor wildlife \u2026",
          "It's a wonderful museum and there is so much to see, do, and learn. Great place to take kids.",
          "So many things for kids of all ages to enjoy. We've been going for years as member and continue to go at least once a year. Always something new to see and the kids enjoy seeing the regular exhibits. They always learn a new fact that they missed the year before.",
          "This is always an awesome museum to visit. They also have a great live animal section.",
          "The Museum has improved tremendously over the years. This is a real gem in Cleveland!",
          "Great place to visit with family to educate kids of evolution of mankind and other animals. Good way of spending time with family esp with kids.",
          "It was nice, the gift shop is kind of lacking though. The main things I wanted to see was Lucy and the dinosaurs, it is well worth the money and if you have the time to actually explore, it is worth it.",
          "Such an awesome place to visit. The exhibits are a lovely mix of interactive and informative. The live otters are adorable and the dino bones are sure to impress. A lovely gem to visit and spend a day or afternoon.",
          "I love this place! It's a great opportunity to learn more about STEM and history while still having fun! The gift shop is great, and has a lot of good stuff! If it's warm out, definitely go see their outdoor animal exhibits.",
          "Coming from a 1st grade teacher from St. Louis Mo. I thought the museum was interesting for all ages. I only wish that  I had enough time to explore it all. I was with a bus tour and they only gave us a short time.  I must come back.",
          "I only had one hour to spend at the museum and I could have spent four hours there. Loved the exhibits and artifacts.  Enjoyable for kids and adults.  A must see if you visit Cleveland.",
          "Despite living in Ohio for most of my life, I never knew this museum existed until this year when Balto\u2019s 100th birthday celebration was happening. I decided that I HAD to go and see him. I visited the museum with my mom, sister, and \u2026",
          "Awesome!  Membership for parents or grandparents is a good deal.",
          "Very expensive $100 Cad for a family of 4. They charged extra once inside for exhibits.  I must say it was very well done and huge .",
          "Great family trip,lots to see and learn about take a full day and enjoy this great resource.",
          "Awesome experience at the Museum this Evening. Great place to visit for kids of all ages.",

          "A gem of a museum, fun to wander; also an excellent venue for a party.",
          "Had not been here since 3rd back in 1989. So nostalgic for me. It was great brought the kid in me. I'm back home to finish my fight with cancer and my wife was just so happy to see me smile like a kid again.",
          "My son loved every second of being in the museum! It was amazing.",
          "Great day learning the science of Ohio.",
          "Non informative. No guides. Very little information. Very random. Mostly fake animal, artifact, and fossils. Just a small place period. A lot was closed and under construction. The little technology they had was broke and out dated, \u2026",
          "Great museum. Kids loved seeing the fossils.",
          "A wide variety of quality displays in a clean and organized facility.",
          "Always enjoy coming here. Since my first visit 25 years ago until now. Always a good time and I feel I learn something new every time. There\u2019s a lot to take in and can\u2019t be done in one day.",
          "Think & Drink with the Extinct is always a great time.",
          "We love it here! We have a membership and will probably always keep one. They change one of their exhibit areas a couple times a year so it's not always the same things. They'll do lectures for adults and the outside area with the animals is awesome. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.",
          "A great museum with something for just about every inquisitive mind.",
          "We went there exclusively to see Balto. Found him, and it was great. Surprised by the T-rex and triceratops. I could definitely tell some of the displays have not been updated since my last visit in 1978.",
          "Beautiful red fox looks like he has eyeliner on.! Wow what a spot!",
          "Select Thursdays, Think and Drink! Enjoy food and cocktails while touring the museum.",
          "Wonderful source of information; however there needs to be more interactive exhibits.",
          "Superior to many other natural history museums! We spent six hours and had a wonderful time.",
          "Enjoyed Speakers night and great guest..",

          "Highly educational Many schools visit Most popular thing I saw were the Dinosaurs",
          "Visiting professors at tables taking time to answer questions using hands on demonstrations. Offers classes and memberships which are good at numerous museums outside Ohio. There is a list of the them on their site. They have great movies and membership offerings.",
          "I was just looking for something easy and fun to do with my parents coming into town and we decided to come here. Loved learning about the earth and the nature around us. So many amazing artifacts. Come while the weather is good so you can check out the animals!",
          "Probably my favorite place on earth.",
          "Nice dinosaur exhibit and human evolution display",
          "Very well curated, lots of interactive things for kids. Favorite things were definitely the prehistoric exhibits and the space ones too. The only reason I wouldn't give it another start is the mislabeling of the Native American exhibits continually being called \"Indians\".",
          "Walk by it \"all\" the time, haven't been in in \"ages\". No pun intended. Cool dinosaurs",
          "Excellent diversity of exhibits and very friendly curators!",
          "We had a great time exploring the exhibits. The staff were friendly and helpful. They answered all our questions (we had a lot!) And engaged in conversation with our children who we're very curious about everything. Great for all ages. Our two year old to our 15 year old enjoyed our visit.",
          "One of the many great museums in Cleveland that deserve being visited ....especially set up for children",
          "Great place for kids and adults.  Good for groups who are just looking for somthing to do.",

          "Awesome! Great interactive and tactile exhibits.",

          "It was great coming to visit and see the adorable animals and the very knowledgeable folks that work there",
          "One of the most outstanding museums I th country. You really need to spend some time here during their remodeling.  I've been a member for quite some time and it's definitely worth it.",
          "This is a nice museum of natural history. The exhibits are solid and the museum is extremely kid friendly while keeping adults engaged. The staff, however, are minimal and don't offer help with exhibits or maps and directions unless specifically asked to do so. Make a point of asking for a map. It will be helpful.",
          "I can't wait to go back!\ud83d\ude04",
          "This is one of the best natural history museums in the country.  They specialize in human evolution and earth science.",
          "Beautiful place, my first visit. Learned all about Lucy.",
          "What a fun day at the museum!",
          "My husband and I haven't been to the Natural History Museum in decades and going back was a very enjoyable experience! We had a great time just touring the exhibits and learning more about the world around us. My only complaint? $10 parking if you are not a museum member. A little steep.",
          "Great place to get away and learn.",
          "Great place to see dinosaur bones",
          "This is an awesome place.",
          "Very fun and interesting! Loved it!",
          "There is so much to see you can't do it in one day. It was great for adults and kids. They his all kinds of silly things in some of the exhibits. My kids ran around all day looking for the hidden cheeseburgers.",
          "They have done a great job with all of their displays.",
          "I was a chaperone on a school field trip and I enjoyed the museum. I just think there shouldve been more hands on activities for the children to keep them focused",
          "Our favorite is probably the possibility of \"Easter eggs\".  Outdoor area was quite enjoyable, though we didn't think to dress appropriately.  Be sure to find a map when you arrive so that you don't overlook anything.",
          "The Natural History Museum was a great experience, but not one I would do often. We found the security personnel to be very friendly, as well as the service desk to be above average. There wasn't as much to do as the Cleveland Museum of Art \u2026",
          "Very diverse selection of history and information. Well laid out, plenty of seating to sot and relax if needed.",
          "Really fun Museum..... if it's knowledge you seek then you have found it! They have an extensive live animal display outside... you will not be disappointed! I encourage every family to become a member, you will save money and if you go to \u2026",
          "One of our favorite places in Cleveland!  Don't miss the basement play area or the live animals outside!!",
          "We haven't been to the museum in about 5 years, it has grown so much! We had 12, 11, and a 3 year old with us and they all enjoyed it. There is a lot to see and interact with. The cafe was really good for lunch too!",
          "Great exhibits! Check out the \"free\" admission dates on the website. However, parking fees still apply. Bring your own lunch.",
          "Pretty awesome and they have live animals outside, saw the coyote feeding.  Something different for a museum.",
          "Too expensive! But vale la pena",
          "Loved it so much to see were going back soon at age 75 it takes two trips \ud83d\ude0a",
          "I have been coming to the CMNH since I was a kid and now I'm bringing my kids. I love that they have been constantly adding and improving through the years, but its also cool to see some of the original exhibits I have been enjoying for the last nearly 30 years.",
          "Its been years since I visit the museum and was pleasantly surprise of the additions.  I love the outdoor forest walk.  A bit pricey though.",
          "Great place, suffering from the lack of funding pure science has in a culture built around warfare. But, they're still creating new showcases. Visit, if you're going to spend some money on a family outing, do everyone a favor and put some money into the sciences.",
          "My event planning company recently visited her while we were on a business trip to Cleveland. I had an amazing time! I love dinosaurs and this place was full of them! I could hardly stand in line long enough to get my ticket before exploring the museum! An extra bonus was the love animal exhibits outside. It was super fun!",
          "Awesome, fun place to visit and learn.",
          "A LOT of interesting things to see, including (to my surprise) an outside \"zoo\" area with many wilderness type animals of North America.  My big event was to see the famous dog Balto, who was actually smaller than I imagined him to be. \u2026",
          "The Think and Drink events they do each month (except summer) are a fun, enjoyable way to learn and appreciate what the museum does!",
          "My son wanted to see dinosaurs, so we visited the museum of natural history. He was disappointed that the dinosaurs weren't alive. All of the exhibits were wonderful. We loved the lower level learning area and spent at least an hour playing there. Will visit frequently, I'm sure.",
          "A great day trip for the family.",
          "Good displays and variety.  Could be more staff around as I saw many, many kid-visitors just whamming the hell out of the interactive exhibits, and parents not doing anything to correct their children.  I guess teaching and showing manners is simply not important to many parents I had to watch in horror!",
          "I loved the fact that there were a lot of interactive parts to the exhibits. Its a fun way to get children involved with science and other things.",
          "Took the kids here and they loved it. They loved all the displays about dinosaurs and all the different type of animals there. I was more into the science aspect of the place. Very fun and educational. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "This place is so great! We spent about 4 hours here, saw a show at the planetarium, had the famous Mac and cheese! We had a great time! (You need to try the mac and cheese!) The hall with all of the animals was so fantastic, toddler enjoyed \u2026",
          "Great exhibits, lot's of history. Alot we can learn at this place.",
          "Wonderful museum! Balto popped out of a Dinosaur egg to wish us a Happy 2019! Innovative displays and lecture series. Inspiring Warhol exhibit and a beautiful outdoor experience presenting the native ecology of Northeast Ohio.",
          "The biomechanics exhibit was very interactive, even for adults! Thoroughly enjoyed my experience in this exhibit as well as the entire museum. A great place for any lover of science, anthropology, and anything about the natural world.",
          "A wonderful place to visit.",
          "I haven't been since the updated outdoors area. I enjoyed the layout and play areas. I look forward to coming back and learning more.",
          "Great place to take the kids!",
          "Awesome place to visit, we loved the outdoor zoo area as well.",
          "It's the Natural History Museum..you know what it is. And you know how awesome it is!",
          "Awesome! Great for families.",
          "Awesome museum. Really friendly staff. I love Think and Drink with the Extinct!  Plus they have otters!",
          "Love the newer outdoor area, but the inside needs to be updated with more interactive displays. Just a suggestion...",
          "Great place to bring my son. He had so much fun learning.",
          "A variety of content if you have the time to explore all of the exhibits.  A large crowd can make this a challenge, but it is worth it for middle school age kids. The content is perfect for the information they are covering at school.",
          "Always a great place to see when we visit Cleveland. Lots of things to see and do for different ages. They even expanded the zoo since we were there last time.",
          "I scheduled this stop as part of a family trip and thought that it was just going to fill an open couple of hours in the schedule. I wish we could have spent the entire day there. Will definitely go back to take it all in sometime.",
          "The cost of admission is worth it just for the live animal exhibits. You can see the animals  up close. It was great. The rest of the museum was great too.",
          "Wonderful museum to entertain the kiddos.  We spent about 2.5 hours here (2 year old and 1 year old).  Great sesame street planaterium show. Tip you can sometimes score free passes at the library.",
          "Great exhibits. Lots to touch. Excellent outdoor widlife exhibits with live gray fox, raccoons, coyotes, cranes, porcupine, many birds and more. Exceptionally well done!",
          "Great place to visit to learn about scientific history.",
          "Perfect for the whole family.",
          "Ultimate Dinosaurs exhibit was amazing!",
          "The outdoor wildlife area is really nice and of course the indoors is amazing. My grand daughters love the time we had here.",
          "It was ok but needs more fascinating things like nasa or that aren't in nasa",
          "Had a Members behind the scenes visit. So much more hidden than what you see on a normal visit and you find out the staff you don't see has a great passion for the Museum",
          "Outdoor portion is really nice.   Indoor portion is really dated",
          "This place has a huge array of displays on a wide range if subjects. There are many incredible things to see for people of all ages. The interactive features of the exhibits are wonderfully entertaining and engaging for children. The staff \u2026",
          "It's always good and fabulous to come and share the \ud83c\udf0e.",
          "Very nice museum.  Fun for kids of all ages with a lot of interactive exhibits.  The outdoor animal center was amazing and their river otter exhibit was outstanding.   The otters got right up to you and personal.  They are very curious animals.  Not bad to spend an hour or two.",
          "We had a wonderful time. My wife and I, a long with my 2 year old daughter were entertained. I definitely recommend this museum.",
          "Always fun and family friendly",
          "Really enjoyed the exibits",
          "Love it! Specially the minerals section! Great things to learn here! But I visited in the winter and I did not like that they kept animals outside at 28\u00b0F.",
          "Lots of fun, regularly rotated exhibits with old favorites, great shows and lots of live hands-on stuff to do.",
          "Solid set of exhibits, parking was a bit pricey, but a fun way to kill a few hours if you're a museum fan.",
          "If you are taking your kids that is a great place. But I would like more displays not the kids activities. Honestly this museum is missing a big chunk of the information you can learn.",
          "The kids had a great time, they are super into dinosaurs right now. They also loved the planetarium kids show. I hadn't been there in years and it brought back some good memories of those grade school field trips.",
          "It is the absolute best.  Anything your interested in... your going to find it",
          "Attended the \"fantastic beasts\" evening event and had an amazing time.  Truly a great museum, much better than I expected and a new favorite destination!!",
          "They got dinosaurs!! What more is there to say! Visit this place and you surely won't regret it",
          "If you ever want go to a natural history museum, then go here , it isnt as massive as the Smithsonian in DC, but is just as nice and educational.  Get a few mummies and it will be perfect , but the have Lucy.",
          "Great place.  They took out the shrunken heads!!",
          "The dinosaur exhibit was AMAZING",
          "75 percent of the displays are the same ones that were there 30 years ago when I went there on my 6th grade field trip. The planetarium was very nice but it was an extra $6 on top of the $17 General admission price. Plus $13 for parking. \u2026",
          "awesome museum! new to ohio and decided to go here. this place was MUCH larger than i anticipated. you could easily spend 3+ hours here.\n\ni wasnt able to go to the outside area this time due to rain but ill be sure to check it out on next \u2026",
          "I love history and evolution.",
          "A fantastic museum and always getting better. Some exhibits are 30+ years old and still fun to look at/ interact with. The relatively new outdoor animal rescue area is always a highlight, but especially around feeding time (2pm or so)",
          "Pretty cool place. You must visit if you're in town. A detailed visit can take about 3-4 hours, a quick one 1.5 to 2. The interaction with the scientific tools can be fun although the computer graphic seems a little dated in some cases. Dinosaurs are unbelievable and the \"jewelry\" section is very interesting.",
          "My son loves dinosaurs and as a result we've been to many museums and exhibits in U.S. and a few in Europe and this is by far my favorite. The layout and scale of the hall and seeing the lab and current projects is a highlight. There are \u2026",
          "Good place with good people and good food.",
          "The Cleveland Museum of Natural History is constantly expanding and has a variety of amazing topics and exhibits. I love anthropology and got a kick out of their human history exhibit.",
          "My toddler loves it here and asks to go a lot - the children's area is very interactive and has learning value. The animal exhibits outside are well done. Also, who doesn't want to see taxidermied Balto?",
          "Really enjoyed my time here. I especially  like a museum of this size that has an amount of information that is presented in a way that one can cover the majority of it without feeling exhausted. The presentations are also done so that there is plenty for both adults and kids to dig into.",
          "Second time there will definitely go again and the kids loved it",
          "My kids loved it so much I bought a pass. A Fantastic way to spend a rainy summer day.",
          "This place is sooooooooo cool!!!!! I never saw a dinosaur skeleton before I was so excited about it! \nBe barely make it and people on the door was so nice! They let us go in cause was our last day in Cleveland.\nI believe is a great place to \u2026",
          "Great exhibits and fun for children",
          "We went here while on a business trip to the area. It was perfect because it offered a leisure experience we could fit in to our hectic schedule. We loved the exhibits and were particularly thrilled with all the dinosaur bones. We were \u2026",
          "I found myself underwhelmed with this museum. You start off in the taxidermy room, a bunch of animals which is great for the kids. Then move onto the dinosaurs which are mostly casts of bones that are actually kept in other museums. Then \u2026",
          "Lots of different things to look at like, dinosaurs, bugs, the planet, and animals, inside and out. They have a small gift shop also. Really enjoyed our time!",

          "Nice place to go to every few years.",
          "Lots of interesting stuff.",
          "Small museum, but they had alot going on for them.  Nice exhibits. Balto was breath taking, and they had passenger pigeon mounts which is note worthy.",

          "So much fun. Love this place.",
          "The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. They have some awesome stuff to check out here",
          "Wonderful place, my kids love it so much! Outdoor animal area is much bigger than expected and loved seeing the animals up and playing. The observatory and planetarium tour with the Cub scouts was amazing! Our guide was fantastic! I \u2026",
          "This museum has improved dramatically since it's remodel.  The new outdoor area is also amazing!",
          "If your kids like dinosaurs, they will love the dinosaur bones. The new outdoor exhibit is enjoyable because you are so close to the animals. We found it to be pricey, but expect the annual pass to be more reasonable in the long run.",
          "Go i love it i am going this week by myself.",
          "Always a treat to see the displays and always a learning experience.",
          "Bring your sneakers, this place has a ton to see! A great destination for all ages! Better than a zoo because you can see the taxidermied creatures! Enjoyed the gems and rocks, the variety of compasses and the humor mixed in the beetle \u2026",
          "Love it here. So much information and the exhibits are great! Really love coming here",
          "We loved it and the little one loved the dinosaur's. I enjoyed learning what was found in our area.",

          "This has always been a favorite spot to visit of mine. I dont remember the outside sanctuary so it must be new but it was nice.

          "My Grand daughter had fun. A lot of the exhibits were broken. There were many school field trips so it was crowded. The best time to go would be after 1pm.",
          "Nice way to spend a winter day in Ohio. The displays are missing some parts and could use updating. The hands on was fun for the kids. All In all a nice experience.",
          "Watching my grandson show his grandmother all the great stuff he has learned from past visits made this visit extra special! The amount of educational information he retains from our visits here amazes me!!!",
          "Visited with my family. 11 year old and 7 year old. Lots of potential but overall it was just ok for all we paid to get in. The movie experience was great.",

          "This place is SUPREME !!! .. totally enjoyed the hands-on activities and would highly recommend for all ages",
          "We attended the Maker Faire Cleveland and enjoyed both the museum and the Faire. The exhibits are spacious and interesting. The program was excellent. The throngs of people were a testament to how well the museum is regarded.",
          "There are three places to see in this area, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, The Cleveland Browns Stadium and the Science Center. they are lined up all beside one another. This place is beautiful and right on the water! I happened to catch the Titanic exhibit when it was there",
          "Our business group of over 500 people rented out the entire building for an evening. This place is huge! The exhibits have everything from aerodynamics, building construction, astrophysics, astrobiology, computer science, micro technology, robotics, and so much more. On the 1st",
          "medium size science museum that somehow manages to incorporate all phases of science especially astronomy. PLEASE, take the kids, all of the exhibts are not only \"hands on\" but you are encouraged by staff and instructors to grab hold \"lets have some fun\"",
          "We visited the Great Lakes Science Center on a Saturday afternoon. There was plenty of parking (paid) available and the crowds really weren\u2019t that bad. You can drop off and pick up your friends/family at the entrance if you don\u2019t feel like having them walk a couple blocks to the",
          "Overall, it's a nice small-medium sized science museum. I'm always a little torn on these reviews because I have a hard time not comparing it to other science museums and sometimes I think the stars should just be based on the actual experience itself. It's just ok compared to",
          "My boys are 5 and 7. They had do much fun. We were only planning on being there for an hour. We were there for 4 hours. The live demos were amazing. So much to see and do in each exhibit!",
          "Lots of interactive exhibits. Loved especially the space and robotics in medical matters opportunities. Great to see kids enjoying the hands on pieces. Lunch options at this museum were dismal and the salad I chose was pretty close to inedible.",
          "I went with 3 friends to see the movie: \"Rescue Dogs\" in the IMAX on the Dome screen. What a fantastic movie and great experience this was! In the gift shop, we met with the best salesman and a super awesome person. I think his name was Vincent? He is a keeper! I will go back to",
          "We went with our 14 and 10 year old boys. The day we went, a Monday, there were a few school groups there. But it wasn\u2019t too crowded. My boys were hoping to tour the Mather ship but it was closed. There was an NASA exhibit that was nice. Overall though, we were all less than",

          "We went to the Great Lakes science center in the beginning of August, first off very inconvenient handicapped expensive limited parking. The price of admission was surprisingly high I wondered what they are doing with the money because it seems like there has been zero upgrades",
          "Excellent Seating was great and I enjoyed the 3D effects. It was a group of us and everyone felt very comfortable",
          "Took my 2 grandsons yesterday ages 4y and 11y. We arrived at 10 and left 20 minutes before closing time. Other than a break for lunch, they didn't stop all day. Regardless of their level of understanding, they enjoyed exploring the hands on activities. Many parents were just as",
          "Thought to visit this for a couple of hours road trip break. Biy, we could have spent the day there, easily. There is an excellent John Glenn interactive exhibit (yes, land a lunar rover, or bring home the Space Shuttle), celebrating the 50th anniversary of the moon landing.",
          "The center is located next to Rock n Roll hall of fame and Browns stadium. It is loaded with wonderful hands on experiences for kids. Adults will like them too and may even learn a thing or two. The main exhibit was celebrating Space.",

          "This place has lots and lots of hands on exhibits. I definitely recommend it for families. If you are an adult by yourself, though, it only takes about an hour or two to see the exhibits. So I would call it more of a hands on exploring museum than a real science museum. The",
          "So glad I went as John Glen exhibit was great. A hero! IMAX- saw NASA documentary. Museum is interesting all though and comfortable for retired \u2018children\u2019. Loved inter-actives on upper floor although a few not working. Typical gift shop. Staff friendly and helpful. An afternoon",
          "Our boys are 5 and 7, and they LOVED it. We spent about four hours and did a majority of the exhibits / activities. My 5-year-old most enjoyed the playroom for smaller kids (ball pit, train table, etc., and outdoor play structure and water table). My 7-year-old most enjoyed the",
          "I should have read the trip advisor reviews. I assumed it had something to do with the Great Lakes. This place is is not for adults. It\u2019s nice enough, but seriously, it\u2019s packed with kids. Reminds me of Sesame Place.",
          "I guess I expected an experience the whole family (including adults) could enjoy. This museum should be renamed children's science and discovery center. My nephews enjoyed visiting exhibits as there were plenty of buttons to push, levers to push, and hands-on. Description,",
          "Great choice next to Rock N roll Hall of Fame that the kids enjoyed spending several hours visiting the multilevel exhibits with hands on activities. Worth a visit and seating along the lake make for nice stop.",
          "Great experience for kids. There were plenty of children there on my visit all exploring and having a ball. Not to be missed is the NASA exhibit. Price is well worth it.",
          "Our visit was to see the Apollo 11 movie. The show time on the website differed from the time at the Science Center by two hours. We were issued general admission tickets as an error. Bernie, a docent, addressed our problem and made the day. Food at the center is pretty good",
          "Our visit was casual and we allowed ourselves a substantial amount of time. Some great unique exhibits focusing on the ecological health of Lake Erie. The Imax is the best we've seen since Boston Science Center",
          "We took our 12 year old and she enjoyed it. Lots of learning exhibits and hands on learning activities. You can spend a good 3-4 hours. For the cost, they really need to keep the activities in working order. Many displays were \u201cout of order\u201d ? That becomes disappointing.",
          "Spent an entire day at the center with 5 kids. Our interest lasted the whole time and all of us learned something new! Great experience, and membership only makes it better.",
          "Ideal for kids of all ages as very informative with all kinds of little learning hands on experiments throughout",
          "Took our 10 year old grandson here. Had a good time looking and trying all the stuff. There was a short time that some of the school kids were running around and causing a riot but their time was short this day. I would have given a 5 but with the tech world we now live in they",
          "This museum has a lot of hands on things for you to try. They are well labeled and they illustrate scientific principles. There is also quite a bit on space which was well done. Don't miss going on the cargo ship. It was great.",
          "I love how many hands on things they have for exploring! As a adult I really liked the John Glen exhibit and I have to admit, a lot of the interactive stuff too! This place is huge! Very clean and even when busy it seems to be big enough. A great gift shop is the added bonus",
          "Quite good, nothing there, really, thats not already on offer in any other Science Centre. Its not that big. The Space section is good but small. Shop great!",
          "Took our two grandsons, ages 5 and 7. Was disappointed in the value for the price. For the four of us (and my husband and I got senior citizen prices), the admission for the museum and theater was $82, and for lunch was near $40. Parts of the Great Barrier Reef movie were",
          "We had our two granddaughters with us 4 and 8 and we could not get them to leave. The varroom room was the highlight of the day.They enjoyed many of the displays and projects and shows. We spent almost two hours with the cars. Adults you will enjoy the N A S A display.",
          "We took our 8, 4 and 2 year old. There was a lot to do. We spent 4.5 hours there and could have stayed longer. My only complaint is that the food is ridiculously over priced.",
          "Lots of hands on exhibits on the second floor. The museum was busy with school groups so it was a little difficult to try all. Interesting things to do such as reaction time, speed of pitch, magnetic train display, etc. The first floor is currently dedicated to NASA and very",
          "Very enjoyable science center with many attractions and an IMAX theater. Kept the kids busy for hours! Highly recommended!",
          "Visited with my 2 kids on a weekday when they were on school break, but Ohio kids weren\u2019t, so wasn\u2019t busy at all. We love science and really enjoyed our visit. Lots of hands on exhibits especially on second floor, loved the shadow room and hair-raising experience. Staff was",
          "I've heard that this was a good place to bring kids. I finally went with my family today, and we were all left disappointed. There is a lot of stuff here, but it's just jumbled together, tired and weathered, some things out of repair, some with no instruction. No supervision, no",
          "Attended here for free since we are members at another science museum. Great Lakes is a part of the ASTC Travel Passport Program which offers discounts for members of other science museum to visit museums nationwide. Smaller for sure compared to other science museum I have been",
          "This place is great for everyone, kids of all ages! If you need something to do on a rainy day especially. So many things to do with most being interactive to really get the point across. Many thing to read but not boring because of the very stimulating visuals, videos, and",
          "Kids run around and have so much fun here with the interactive activities! Their is a large selection of food and drinks at the cafe. The theatre (dome) is huge and super fun to watch programs in. I think older people would enjoy it here and trying the fun, different exhibits,",
          "It\u2019s worth it visit with school age kids. So much to learn for everyone. My kids are asking so many questions.. when they see exbits. I suggest for each kid accompanied adult is best, so we can answer their enthusiasm questions. It\u2019s ok for adults visit one time.",
          "Took my great grandson and he loved it. Not too bad for a 70-year old either. Parking isn't that great for handicapped, but the activities/exhibits are very good.",
          "Went with kids and grandkids. Three generations having fun and learning. Awesome displays and areas of participation for all ages. Can't say enough about the experience. Will go here again and again when in town visiting. There are many things to do and see in Cleveland,",
          "Let yourself go back to being a kid exploring how things work. Saw the very young and then again the very senior playing as kids. There was so much to put your hands on. I even made a paper rocket and watched it launch. Didn't go very high, but had a lot of fun just the same.",
          "Went opening day of grossology ( innovative ) way to learn an out body. Lots of hands on. Extra fee for omni theater, not a must but nice addition. They really do give huge discount to veterans which was nice suprise. You can purchase lunch. EXPENSIVE,very limited seating.",
          "What an awesome way to spend the day. This place is awesome. Tons of interactive displays. So much to learn. Great for all ages. Indoor parking keeps you out of the weather. You can purchase your tickets online to save time. We will return.",
          "Located next door to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, this venue makes for a great way to spend some time learning about science, and space travel in particular. Ohio has a great association with space exploration - think John Glenn. The Science Center devotes a large portion of",
          "I feel like every time we go here it gets better. The demonstrations are fantastic and really engage the kids. We went this time while the Navy was visiting and they also did an incredible job of teaching the kids stuff without boring them. The space area is really interesting",
          "We planned to visit when we were there but we were greeted by signs on the doors saying it was closed for cleaning! Really? I have never seen an attraction of this type close totally for cleaning on a Friday. So sorry to miss this.",
          "I wanted to share the Great Lakes Science Center with my granddaughter, who is ten years old. She enjoys going to places with us in the summer, when she is off school, and we all had a good time. We saw some exhibits, though a couple weren't working. The escalator is under",
          "We love this great museum so much we buy family memberships so we can take the grandkids throughout the year! Always something new to see, lots and lots of hands on science for all ages! Great science shows and demos. Our grandkids love seeing what they are going to blow up at",
          "My kids enjoyed it when they were 5-8, but after that, the kids kind of age out of the displays. I think it's a bit pricey and parking is a pain.",
          "We had a great time at the science center with our 3 kids (13, 10, and 7) for most of the day! We just got the basic ticket and had plenty to do. The 2 shows we saw were great - my kids were totally entertained and learned a lot! The hands on exhibits kept them busy for hours -",
          "I went to the Science Center with my teenage boys recently...this place is fun for all ages! Everything is interactive and safe. Lots to explore here! Two thumbs up!",
          "My kids love going to the science center every time we are in Cleveland. It\u2019s a short walk from most hotels and can definitely be added on to a visit to the R + R Hall of Fame. My kids love how interactive this museum is. We spend a few hours there each time... the best part is",
          "its a great place to visit we took our daughter there after we went to the rock and roll hall of fame next door, heaps to do and you can learn alot more than you can imagine they have events there for kids and even the adults get a real kick out of the place",
          "This is a very interactive science center. Children, teens, adults and grandparents can all benefit by the visit. Starting on the second floor with the polymer room, an interactive exhibit of plastic balls that children can dump, shoot (they have a fixed air cannon aiming to a",
          "Interesting exhibits on space as well as the duct tape exhibit. My boys really enjoyed themselves. We went with only an hour and a half before it closed. We wish we were able to have spent more time here.",
          "Brought my 12 and 7 year old boys here for the day. Having been to many science centers in various states I would say that this will be a one and done for us. Second floor interactive exhibits were the highlight for my boys. They also enjoyed the Tape Escape exhibit and the",
          "If two Grandgirls, ages 10 and 6+, are any barometer of enjoyment, our Science Center continues to surprise and delight! New visually stimulating exhibits are so appealing, the IMAX movies this summer (HIGHLY recommend WATERMELON MAGIC - 20-25 minutes, all ages but esp. for",
          "I took a group of four 13 year old girls to the Science Center. They had a great time. They enjoyed the sticky science exhibit and spent quite a bit of time in there. We enjoyed lunch in their eatery and was reasonable. We also watched the Amazon movie on the dome screen.",
          "Second time here and we really enjoyed it. The first time we we're expecting our little guy but enjoyed watching our friends kids play and learn. This time our done was 2 and he loved every moment, especially the space area, outdoor area, ball pit, and instruments. We didn't",
          "We truly enjoyed watching the children that were there interact with all of the activities that were there for them to learn from.",
          "Had not heard of this attraction but went as a chaperone to a high school band field trip. It was so much more interesting than we imagined. The kids loved all of the \u201chands on\u201d exhibits and the employees were always there to interact with the kids. It had three floors of",
          "We had a great time at the science center. There were interactive learning attractions as well as live shows. The steam ship was a really neat place to explore. You have access to most of the ship. It is definitely unique and keeps your attention, and the kids attention. Food in",
          "This was a great find for us. There are workers there that lead you through quick experiments and help explain \u201cthe science\u201d behind the experiment. My son loved that. There is a whole second floor that is NOTHING but \u201chands-on\u201d science experiments. I learned so much, as an",
          "Based on the name we went here thinking this was a science facility dedicated to the science behind the Great Lakes, this is not the case. This is a science museum with various displays and exhibits involving the space program and other non Great Lakes topics, all geared towards",
          "Not good, I really want to say \"horrid\". We needed to kill some time so we visited here. There is nothing here of interest to any adult who has a basic science education and keeps up with scientific news available in the basic newspapers. What a disappointment. Not up to",
          "We wanted to check this place out the day after visiting the Rock & Roll Hall of fame that was next door, and had a good time, indeed. It is definitely a little geared more towards children, but adults can still have fun as well. Parking is easy in the same Garage that is used",
          "Despite the fact that we were three adults we were glad we visited. The Nasa exhibit was excellent and well worth seeing. We went to the dome theatre and watched America's Music journey which was superb and perfect along with our visit to the rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The rest",
          "If visiting Cleveland this place will keep the kids entertained for a couple of hours. There are tons of hands on activities as well as educational movies there. There is a public parking garage right past the science center and it is in the vicinity of the Rock Hall of Fame as",
          "Went to the science center because it was next door the Rock and Roll HOF. Great science center with A LOT of hands on displays to learn about all kinds of science. And they have a fantastic space display including an Apollo capsule and a nice dedication to John Glenn. Don't",
          "went there since friend was at rock and roll and not my scene. Was nice place to spend time and chill. Really enjoyed the waterfront",
          "Great place to take young children at least once. Hands on activities are great. I would not go there more than once per year because of lack of activities. You can easily get through it in 4 hours.",
          "It cost us $80 for three adults and one child, just to get in! My daughter had an okay time but got bored really fast. We won\u2019t be back. Maybe for half the price and if there was more to do.",
          "I have a 11 and 13 year old and they loved our visit to this science center. We especially loved the NASA exhibit and the dome movie. The museum is filled with hands on activities that kept my children busy. The only part that we didn't enjoy was the cafe. The food was just",
          "We took a day trip to Cleveland. We decided to check out the science museum. There are a lot of great hands on activities. The NASA display was great. The science show was a lot of fun. The staff is helpful & knowledgeable. Kids of all ages would enjoy the museum.",
          "We went on a day with messy weather and appreciated the indoor parking. The place was very large with much to do. Our four year-old grandson loved the LEGOS building and the ball pit. Our two year-old granddaughter preferred the other play areas. Both enjoyed some of the",
          "This was so much nicer than we expected. So much to do. We liked it better than Cosi. Parking was really convenient. Kids had a ball. I liked the open layout instead of a bunch of different rooms, like COSI. Looking forward to returning when the big ship opens for exhibition.",
          "Our kids range from 9 years to 21 months, and they all found a lot to do and see. Even us big kids had fun . Can't wait to go back in the summer",
          "We decided to use our Imagination Station membership to visit a few other Ohio science centers. The Great Lakes Science Center was a fun stop. It did not have as many exhibits as COSI in Columbus, or Imagination Station in Toledo, but there were some fun activities (we",
          "This place is an entire day event. Get here early to get to everything. The kids were entertained the entire time. I personally geeked out at the NASA Glenn Visitors Area. The movies are wonderful and not too expensive. I would recommend a membership since you can use it at",
          "Firstly this place is so overpriced for what it is! It\u2019s a good museum but there\u2019s not a great deal of exhibits and the boat tour is closed in the winter time so it\u2019s definitely not worth $18! But what\u2019s more, and this is my biggest complaint, it contains no information at all",
          "We really enjoyed our visit but the exhibits seemed pretty rundown. They need to add some new exhibits, expand the shop, basically a remodel. It was fun, but could be much better.",
          "We have been to many science centers with our membership program, but this one stands out with its many age appropriate activities and exhibits for my children.",
          "Went with my adult kids who still like to be young kids. It would be a great place if you have smaller kids.",
          "We went on a Thursday and the ship was closed (which is what we wanted to see). We thought there would be exhibits for adults. Other than the space capsule at the entrance, 100% of the interactive exhibits and other exhibits are for children. Unless you are out for a day trip",
          "We decided to take our niece here and she had a blast! It was fun for the three of us just trying out the different interactive stations. We spent about 2 and half hours here, we did not see any imax shows just enjoyed the exhibits. We always enjoy coming here because it\u2019s just",
          "My daughter, my grandson and I went to the Great Lakes Science Center yesterday when it was free. It seemed there were more people there then they could hold. It was difficult to see an exhibit let alone get up close to it to actually get your hands on it. It seemed rather",
          "We were looking for some thing to do at around 1pm on a Saturday and chose to go see a short film at the IMAX in the science center. We saw AMAZON and really enjoyed the show and the comfort of the theater.",
          "Great exhibits about space exploration. Lots of hands on activities for children but interesting for adults too. Good visuals, time lines and artifacts. Enjoyed the Dome Theater.",
          "This was a fun hands on place for a science museum. It only is a couple of floors, but we killed an hour here. Lots of hands on projects for any age to like. The lake view is amazing and I would definitely go and see the little Cleveland statue that faces the city outside.",
          "This was a nice experimental day. Activities being hands on makes it much more interesting for the children. It did feel as though young children ....much of museum is above them. I'd say I would not take children under....6, maybe even 8, as these children seemed bored because",
          "Figured we'd wander thru for a couple hours before going next door to see the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, since we parked in their parking garage (HIGHLY recommended!). Well... we could have stayed there all day instead! LOTS of fun, interactive exhibits - the Imax-type movie",
          "There were dozens of exhibits encouraging both the young and inquisitive to conduct science exhibits. We found much of the information quite interesting, even for us seniors. There is an IMAX theater to watch if desired. A grab-n-go cafe is in the basement.",
          "The location is perfect, on the lake and next to the HOF Museum and Browns Stadium...many exhibits to see but be sure to go into the IMAX Theatre...there is a NASA exhibit you should also see",
          "Was somewhat disappointed in the Science Center. I did enjoy the NASA exhibit, but thought the admission price too high for what we saw",
          "Came here with a friend to see the National Parks movie on Omnimax. Great video! Gotta love this beautiful earth! Always enjoy the Omnimax. Super nice theater. We had about 45 min to kill before the show started, so we explored outside. It was fun to walk by the water.",
          "Great for Kids of every age.. (I'm 64 and had an awesome, informative time) good interactive displays on every level... Watch the live shows while you're there",
          "My wife and I decided to check out the Science Center while the Air Show and Oktoberfest were in town. We enjoyed the NASA exhibits and the OmniMax Theater, but the rest was geared more for children. If you have younger kids, this might be right up your alley. If not, you my",

          "Great place to spend the day. Lots of little hands on things to keep the little ones entertained. A lot of fun.",
          "Honestly I could find way better stuff for 50 dollars for my kids. Everything was broken or just turned off. How can you charge almost 20 dollars a person and not take care of anything in there. Its really sad as a kid I loved going here. Will not be back for a long time. Should have just went to the childrens museum.",
          "I took my class on a field trip today.  The scholars were coding.  They had an Awesome time.  This program is truly one of the better ones offered at the center.",
          "Used to be really awesome years when it first came out. Now it's too crowded and half their equipment needs and update or repair. NASA gallery was pretty cool.",
          "Where to begin?  If you've never been to another science center you might think this place was okay, but it's really not.  It's dirty, the exhibits are worn out and tired, and there's no staff to be found.  It seems like they built this \u2026",
          "Wonderful place for kiddos to explore! The little kiddos area is well Cleaned and also enclosed so it is not difficult to keep an eye on your little one while also sitting on a bench and taking a breather. The exhibits are well thought out and intriguing.",
          "It\u2019s a terrific place to bring children. There are a lot of hands on activities and demonstrations. It\u2019s a great way to stimulate interest in STEM.",
          "Extremely costly, extra $ to see a movie or tour the ship. But AWESOME for kids, could spend a couple days in there. Definitely geared towards elementary aged children, but there's plenty to keep the attention of older kids and adults. \u2026",
          "Awesome place! I\u2019ve been to the Great Lakes science center many times and I can say for sure it\u2019s great.\n\nPros: \n-exhibits are very cool\n-great place for family and relatively cheap\n-lots to do, makes for more than one day\n\nCons:\n-food there is expensive so pack a lunch\n-Too much fun",
          "Our family visited here during a recent trip to the area. This is a nice facility. The NASA Glenn displays were interesting and informative. The top floor had a wide variety of hands on science displays that are fun for all ages. There is a parking garage attached to the Center. I highly recommend visiting here.",
          "It's ok. Many exhibits don't work. Kids area was dirty. Skip the cafe area. The restrooms have really annoying push faucets from the 80's. My 4 1/2 year old had a lot of fun.",
          "Went on a field trip with 7th graders & it was great! Activities were well planned & everything was very organized! Thank u!",
          "Unless you have kids there\u2019s no need to go here more than nice. The exhibits are nice but there\u2019s always a ton of kids running around.",
          "Very interactive for various ages. I enjoyed it as an adult and so did my 50yo mom! Of course my 6 and 4 yo had a good time too.",

          "I took my Children here and they have lots of things for you to your as well as it is definitely a learning experience the entire time. We'll be going again soon.",
          "Great place to bring the kids. Admission is for science center. There is an add-on for IMAX theater. Fun experience for the entire family.",
          "Always fun. But admission is a bit steep.  And why do they charge adults more than kids???  All the stuff is for kids.",
          "This place is awesome. Learned a lot here. Always keep coming back.",

          "Great place to learn science by doing. We would have liked more exhibits as there were a lot of empty places.",
          "The science center here is Cleveland is wonderful.  Very interactive and offers lots for all ages.  As an adult, I really enjoyed the information birds next to each exhibit.  The kids loved every floor.  I never heard the children complain \u2026",
          "Great experience for kids 4 years and older to spend some time out during winter specially .",
          "One of the best museums in midwest for kids. Full of fun activities.",
          "Always a good time but the exhibits should change a little every year.",
          "Wonderful Venue for Our Company Christmas Party. A Lovely View of the Water and the Rock Hall.",
          "Beware of Summer camps payment policies.  No matter what the reason, you are unable to get a refund if you have to cancel a child's enrollment.  They will keep your money and offer you classes in the 'future'.  I would stay away from camps \u2026",
          "Good museum. Children will enjoy interactive activities.",
          "Great place to explore with young kids. It was a lot of fun just a little pricey.",
          "It was great to learn from, but somethings that looked very interesting were out of order",

          "GREAT PLACE for kids 2 and UP MY 6 yr old  had the BEST TIME OF HIS LIFE.  I ENJOYED AS AN ADULT",
          "This place is great for kids and that's about it. My husband and I went not knowing it was for children. Only had access to the main floor. Very disappointing for the price we paid. Was a waste of money. Food cost was outrageous. Very misleading. Should be renamed \"Children Center\".",
          "Great for children but I would avoid going on the days it's free admission",
          "And the screen and the Dome Theater you better sit up close to the top otherwise you'll be turning around and craning your neck all the way luckily I stayed near the top",
          "An amazing and fantastic place to get your kids and enjoy the science there...very informative place about the US scientific history and many applications too help people better understand theories and basics of science.\nIt takes 1:30 to \u2026",
          "Great place to visit, especially with kids. There were a couple displays that were broken or had issues, but overall the displays were interesting, very informative, and very cool.",
          "Awesome experience everytime. Check out the IMAX theater. Also a beautiful view of the lake.",
          "Not as fun as when we were kids.. but still interesting especially the NASA visitors center.",

          "The cafe has excellent food even if the prices are higher, they are fair for the area.  It is next door to the rock and roll hall of fame.  The science center had a free day and there were a lot of exhibits to check out.  My daughter are teens and they really enjoyed it.",
          "My kiddos loved the Science center.  They didn't want to leave.",
          "My kids had a blast. So much hands on fun",
          "Science! Need I say more? Plus it's right next to the lake and the hall of fame",
          "Really fun spot and a must visit if in the Cleveland area.  Mostly for kids but still plenty to keep adults entertained especially the barge and the John Glenn area and the large theater. Really enjoyed this stop on our visit to Cleveland",
          "Amazing and captivating! There's not much else to say. The regular exhibits are great, the Makers pace activities are wondrous, and the temporary exhibits are astounding! Great place to bring kids, students, or anyone really! The Cafe is the cherry on top with its robotic version of froyo. This place never gets old.",
          "This was a great experience for the whole family! The military discount was greatly appreciated. There were so many things to experiment with and learn from. My eight year old brother has sever adhd and some sensory issue but this layout \u2026",
          "It was a nice experience never been before\ud83d\ude01\u2705",
          "Was an awesome experience for my family although there needs to be more employees walking around just to disinfect the hands on exhibits.",
          "Really interesting activities for kids of all ages.  Loved to see a moon rock.  The kids enjoyed the moon landing simulation game.  The race car exhibit was lots of fun with interesting matchbox car tracks and a build your own mini race car \u2026",
          "The science center is a fun and informative trip for all ages to enjoy! The imax is also a blast every time! Highly recommend this place!",
          "I guess I expected an experience the whole family (including adults) could enjoy. This museum should be renamed children's science and discovery center. My nephews enjoyed visiting exhibits as there were plenty of buttons to push, levers to \u2026",
          "My 10 y/o boy loves this place",
          "Great Lakes Science Center always fascinating & educational & love the hands on exhibits! The NASA space exhibits are out of this world! \ud83c\udf0e \ud83c\udf19",
          "Excellent place for the kiddos. Brings back memories from when I was a kid!",
          "I was considering getting a membership before visiting but after going realized how little there was to see.  It's fun for the kids but definitely not somewhere to go multiple times",
          "Great place to take family to have some fun. Get educated on a few things.",
          "A fantastic science center. The Dome Theater was amazing.  I remember going to a similar theater as a kid and it always stuck with me. Very awesome to see these are still around!  I loved all the hands on exhibits.  We bundled our tickets with the Rock Hall which has made for a great weekend.",
          "It was very clean and nice inside.\nThe workers were friendly. The exhibits very fun, for little kids to adults.\n\nAlthough it is very pricey there for food or drink. So bring something. The theater is also very nice. I would suggest sitting in some of the highest seats in the back.",
          "We particularly liked the NASA portion of the museum, with excellent exhibits including an actual space capsule. The exhibit seems to benefit from the connection of John Glenn, who is from Ohio. We also enjoyed being able to tour The Great Lakes commodity carrying ship, tied up at a pier outside the museum. That was unique!",
          "Lots of fun science center with many interactive exhibits. Around Halloween you can see a pumpkin explosion which is always cool",
          "Pretty run down, and overly expensive all things considered. A lot of broken or out of order exibits.",
          "#uncorcked event or with family it's a good time",
          "Everything was GREAT!!! My kids loved the car exhibit. The only thing is that there is no nursing area or family restroom for nursing mothers to sit and relax. I went to the restroom with my 2 year old to change his diaper and there was a \u2026",
          "I really loved. Great place to go with kids.",
          "The exhibits are really cool and interesting and it really makes science come alive. I also love how interactive it is. I will definitely be coming back again.",
          "My 3 year olds had a blast here.  There's a ton of stuff for kids if every age.",
          "Always fun for the whole family. I truly enjoy watching the look on kids faces when they see something truly spectacular!  Like the after image effect room.  Or any of 100 different exhibits. I truly love their NASA exhibit,  As it has models of the old apollo mission capsules! \n\n I couldn't recommend this place enough!",
          "Nice place...I just expected few more things to see",
          "The great lakes science center is THE place for young people and people in general to learn about the exciting advances and phenomena that science unearths in its various discoveries. It also happens to be the place where most science fairs happen. It's legitimately a fun place to be if you have the time. Well worth it!",
          "By far my favorite museum out here in Cleveland. So many hands on activities for all ages, you\u2019ll lose track of time while your there, so plan accordingly. There\u2019s food options on-site which is sometimes an issue with little ones, so don\u2019t \u2026",
          "I had a blast at the Great Lakes Science Center! It was a fun and inspiring filled day\u2014 so much so I am actually going back to school to become an engineer. Wish me luck! Take your family there!",
          "It has alot of cool things for all ages",
          "Nice place to spend the afternoon with the kids when it's too hot or cold outside or just as something to break the summer monotony.  While it attempts to be educational, the exhibits feel more and more dated and it ends up feeling like a \u2026",
          "Exhibits are always is good repair.  Best to visit early in the day to beat the crowds and chaos.  Great Science Academy has a great STEM program which my daughter attends during the school year and it has kept her ahead in Science class at school.",
          "The kids and I always have a lot of fun here!",
          "Wonderful mixture of exhibits and it's reasonably priced. The IMAX movies are the most fun in my opinion but there's always something for young and old alike! Personally I think it's perfect for ages 3 to 13!",
          "Had a great time!  Everything so hand on",
          "This is a great museum. We went with family that had children ages 2 yrs- 10 yrs. Those ages are perfect for that center. We also toured the ship on site for a combo price of 21.95. Parking was 10.00 though so be prepared for that. We all \u2026",
          "I really enjoy myself the music and the light show was so relaxing a couple of times I had to close my eyes but all on all it was beautiful",
          "More than enough for anyone interested in science and then some... Wonderful exhibits and plenty of hands on displays for children and adults alike.",
          "Great for elementary school kids. Not a very big exhibit area. The IMAX theater was the best part.",
          "Fun place for the family, lots to see and do.",
          "Got a year membership for the kids and they both loved it. Plenty of stuff to do and see. Fun for both my wife and I, as well as the kiddos. Definitely recommend.",
          "Great place for children to have hands-on experience and learn while having fun. The new car exhibit so engaging. You can spend hours there.",
          "My five year old had a blast at this interactive museum. 3 hours wasn\u2019t long enough for us to get through everything he wanted to do though, so check hours and plan accordingly.",
          "It looks like they are in the process of revamping. I'll be excited to see the process. All ton of exhibits on the top floor have been there since the early 2000s.",
          "The kids had a blast at the science center playing with all fun displays! The IMAX movie about the Great Barrier Reef was a good time too. The space exhibit was very interesting and lots to do for the kids! I'm several decades beyond the \u2026",
          "Convenient and well laid out. We attended a maker's fair that was well done.",
          "We received a yearly membership this past Christmas. What a fantastic gift. It's great to take my family and not feel obligated to see everything at one. We focus on one floor or set of activities each time we go.",
          "Great learning time with many fun things to do!",
          "My daughter loves it, so this review would go differently if she wrote it. The science center is an at, or below average experience. Is it worth going to? In my opinion it is, but once. I could not see attempting to go repeatedly. We had \u2026",
          "Lots of fun stuff to do, we have a 7 month old and a 2 year old. There were even fun things for them to try, and a giant ball pit area. Lots of fun.",
          "This place has a lot to offer, I felt like a kid and I started playing with everything. We really enjoyed our time here. It took us around 2 hours and a half to eat in the cafeteria and walk around with trying and playing in almost \u2026",

          "Interesting exhibits very interactive, we had a  great time",
          "The Great Lakes Science Center is a great place for younger kids. I expected activities that the entire family would enjoy. Although the science activities weren't meant for older kids the staff was very friendly!! The cafe had good food!",
          "The Mesamerica show combined music with images. Very good show if a little pricey. Tickets were $42.00 each.",
          "The science Center has always been awesome. I've been going since it opened. I've done an over night lock in while in school many years ago. I was just recently there for an after hours event. They always have interesting new things to do. It is more centered around children but you can have fun as an adult too.",
          "Great for Kids! However, if you're an adult and have been to a few other good science museums in the country, you may find this one disappointing. The Vroom Car Adventure exhibit is quite interesting and car lovers both young and old would love to interact with the exhibits here.",
          "The whole building is full of displays and movies. But if you have children the second floor is wonderful. There are many, many hands-on displays. My grandchildren have visited numerous times and still try all the hands-on. For the younger \u2026",

          "We absolutely loved our visit and the kids did too.  So many fun activities and exhibits for young and old. You could easily spend all day there and not get bored.  It's also a great spot for a wedding reception or corporate event as the lobby overlooks the Lake Erie harbor.",
          "Very informative and interesting especially for young children. My nephew loved it.",
          "Has something for all ages. My toddlers, 11 year old, my wife and I all had a good time. The kids play room was nice to let the kids loose to play and run around. Lots of fun science stuff to learn about. Things get changed around with new stuff every so often to entice locals to return.",
          "As a homeschooling family,  Great LAKES science center was one of our favorite resources! With new exhibits all the time and awesome science shows,  the kids were hooked and I was equally as excited to go! There are floors and floors of fun \u2026",
          "Attended here for free since we are members at another science museum. Great Lakes is a part of the ASTC Travel Passport Program which offers discounts for members of other science museum to visit museums nationwide.\n\nSmaller for sure \u2026",
          "Kids loved the hands on exhibits.... obviously. Kids range from 11 to 2 and they all had a blast. Food is expensive there so I suggest eating before or after. Located right on the lake so we took the kids for a walk on the pier. Overall experience was great! Wish they had a planetarium.",
          "This place is so much fun! We checked out all of the exhibits, but the kids (and us)liked the third floor best! It's in a beautiful location right downtown on the lake. They have a cafeteria there, but the food prices were high. Prepare to \u2026",

          "Went there with my fiance and 2 young boys (4 and 20mo), and we had a blast! So much to do for the entire family, though there wasn't a lot for my 20mo to do. But we will definitely be back once he's a little older! Bummed the cafe wasn't \u2026",

          "Had a great time. Great exhibits for all ages.",
          "We had such a great time with so much to do.  We spent over 5 hours here and could have spent more time but they were closing. We enjoyed it better then the imagination station. More things to do and touch for children of all ages.",
          "Fun, educational place for kids! My grandkids ages 17 mos..3...and 4.5 love it! Ball pit and other indoor fun, plus fun outside with water tables and slide for warm weather. Small cafeteria with over priced food...but it is tasty. Could use \u2026",
          "I love this place.  Have a great time every time we go. Went with my grand daughter Kylee, Son Jesse, and daughter in law Kristy. It's a educational opportunity for you and your family.  A lot of interesting and interactive things to do.  It's truly fascinating.",

          "Awesome attractions. The area has several places you can visit like the Rock and roll hall of fame, the NASA museum and the science museum. You can also visit the water front area and take pictures. Brown's stadium and ball park are not too far either.",
          "A lot of exhibits were broken. Overpriced",
          "I love science museums. We visited here at weekend tourist.  The Theater is great. The cars exhibit has lots to build and read about the future of cars. I am 100% team honeycomb tire!",

          "Many fun interactive experiments to help kiddos and adults understand science principles. The NASA space program exhibit was very informative - didn\u2019t know Ohio produced dozens of astronauts. Had a chance to play with Curious, the Mars \u2026",
          "Great place for kids as well as adults to spare few hours and learn scientific concepts, parking was included in the ticket. You can also consider visiting Rock&Roll museum because it is in walking distance. They also have rooms to be reserved for birthday parties.",
          "Spend your money at the children's museum. Run down and dirty exhibits on the third floor. Kids play area smelled of pee and a kid vomited in the ball pit. The area looks like it's never been cleaned! Many other parents complaining and \u2026",
          "A large percentage of the displays were broken/damaged making this a not-so-fun day at the GL Science Center. This place could use some work - especially at almost $18 a head.",
          "This is definitely something I would recommend for schools to make field trips for that has Hands-On exhibits and it is educational.",
          "It's a fun place to go on a date. I took my girlfriend out there and we had a good time. Only problem was that I got a headache from the blast of nostalgia of being there as a kid. Not to much changed...",

          "Excellent, informative, and inexpensive. Loved all of the hands on exhibits.",
          "The expos they have are almost always really cool. Not a place for really young kids though (I would suggest at least age 5). Always take my kids at least once a year.",
          "For kids it has lot of activities..Space medical Automobile and sound technologies are notable ones .. small though...",
          "Not enough for adults and older children to do and the food is way over priced",
          "Beautiful science center. We took my 8 year old and he had a blast and learned so much here. We particularly loved the music and audio section. It was nice to experience hands on activities that kept my son engaged the whole day. I will definitely visit again if ever back in Cleveland.",
          "Really, really loved this place. Parking was fairly easy to find and you can pay when you buy your admission or with a kiosk at the end, but you need to pay before you leave the parking area. We mainly wanted to go for the NASA exhibit and \u2026",
          "So much fun! Plan for a full day. It takes that long to see it all. I'd bring your own lunch. Food is overpriced.  Not very good. And takes more than 20 minutes to prepare chicken tenders.",
          "Awesome place to visit neat stuff to explore",
          "Great place to take the kids for hands  on fun and learning!",
          "We love this place! Great for kids of any age - there is literally something for everybody. Very engaging staff. This place is for curious minds! Get the season pass - totally worth it!",
          "We loved exploring the science center, but we had a hard time telling our son it was time to go. He loved it so much. Three floors of exploring and discovering was more than my son could ever ask for. He had to try everything and especially \u2026",
          "I just felt there wasn't much there. The movies are good so I would recommend the dome theatre, but just felt like the center itself was just meh.",
          "Very fun for the kids and adults while teaching both the kids and adults as well. Really clean and well maintained, and the parking garage is well worth the money.",
          "This place was fun, the prices are reasonable and their gift shop is, for the most part, cheap",
          "Awesome place. Took granddaughter 10,\nSo many things to do. If one place is busy, you can return in minutes as you do another test of some sort.\nAges are covered, so, all can be amused.",
          "The Great Lakes Science Center has something for everyone. Good for families because they have a lot of interactive activities that are great for kids. Good for adults who want to stimulate their mind also. And of course it's it's in a beautiful location.",
          "Was a nice time. Only bad thing is that it's located in the city of Cleveland.",
          "Science center was great! Just fyi. This place is more for children than adults. I visited with the belief otherwise. Awkward. It is still a great place for the curious young mind!",
          "Great music visual art show,beautiful dome theater",

          "You will love this place no matter your age! There are interesting things to do and try here for everyone. Tons of hands on simple science exhibits to try and learn something new. This place is huge and has a great space exhibit to celibate \u2026",
          "I have mixed feelings about this place. When we first got our membership last year, it seemed like certain exhibits/interactive displays were frequently \u201cdown for maintenance,\u201d and things looked a bit run down. That seems to have improved \u2026",
          "This is a great place to visit especially if you have young children.  It is pretty heavily geared toward kids but I found it very interesting as well.  Pricing to get in is not too bad, parking is easy in the attached garage and overall I \u2026",
          "Awesome kids area and experiments, our daughter had a great time running around. The exhibit space wasn't very large, but everything worked and taught something meaningful. Cafe was a let down, I'd recommend bringing your own lunch/snacks.",
          "Fun for the whole family, kids from 3 to 15! Lots of hands on experiments",
          "I had a good time visiting. It has multiple floors and loads of exhibits.",

          "Place is great. So much to do here. Can get pretty crowded and wild with all the day camp kids though.",
          "Fun for the whole family! We love the science center. The grossology exhibit was hilarious, informative, and well, gross! They also allow you to put your ticket purchase towards a membership, which we did. I can\u2019t wait to make more regular visits!",

          "this place made my kids love science (and me too)",
          "It is one of the best places for family outings as well as to take kids along. The place in itself is a knowledge hub and the various exhibits depict the features of natural environment.Last week , i went here with my family and the kids in the family had a lot of fun along with learning.\nThe best place for kids.",

          "I went here with my son and daughter in law and my 3 grandchildren, ages 8, 5 and 3.  There was something for everyone.  We saw the film The National Parks in the Dome Theater, we saw the exhibits on the third floor, and we saw Grossology \u2026",

          "Kids had a great time at the Marker Faire",
          "What a fun place for all ages! We spent hours exploring, experiencing and learning with our 8 yo grandson. One warning--the cafe food is very expensive! Take your own and enjoy the picnic area if you go in nice weather. We loved the tape exhibit!",
          "Great for kids and tourists. The theatre is a super fun experience. Big variety of stuff to do and look at. Good learning experience for everyone too.",

          "It was a fantastic day with my son and his class. So much to see and do. Lots of hands on learning.",
          "The recent (summer 2018) renovations are very nice.  We watched one of the science shows this time, for the first time. It was a lot of fun. There is so much to see and to do, you can easily spend an entire day here but I'd recommend breaking it up into multiple visits because it can be overwhelming.",
          "It's fun but sometimes some of the activities are broken. The live exhibits are great though.",
          "Despite a few dated exhibits, it is a well put together and maintained museum. Their space exhibits are particularly interesting, due to their partnership with the NASA Glenn Research Center.",
          "Toured the Mather. Very cool.  Friendly and informative docents",

          "Great place to take kids. Lots of activities. Must watch a movie at the dome theatre it's an amazing experience.",
          "It's more for kids. I went in expecting something fully interactive that I, as an adult could also enjoy. Don't get me wrong, it was fun, but I think I was lead on a little for it to be more than it was",
          "We absolutely love it here. We recently purchased a membership and we have gone twice within 4 days! My children have learned so much in just the 2 times that we have been here so far. They get to play with everything! We cannot wait for warmer weather to enjoy the outdoor play area and the ship.",
          "A lot to do for every age. Great young children areas that you can let your children have hands on expierences.",
          "What a great museum, full of fun and educational exhibits. Staff and volunteers even walk around and help with demonstrations and explain the science behind the exhibit.",
          "Great place! We took a group of high school seniors. They participated in a pig heart dissection. The instructors were awesome! Everyone really enjoyed the day there.",
          "We visited here and the whole family enjoyed this experience",

          "The hands-on exhibits upstairs could occupy your whole visit. The second floor space exihibit is small but interesting. Travelling exhibits on the ground floor are more hit or miss. But kids had fun all ages and curious adults should have a good time",
          "Fantastic science center! Lots of hands-on activities teaching a wide range of concepts. Appreciate the opportunity to read instructions, observe and then read for further understanding (avoid misconceptions). Large portion of building \u2026",
          "Very cool things to do here",
          "Place is great for kids and adults if you love to learn. My kids love it here. IMAX movies are awesome. Lots of things to see and do. Make sure you check out the steamship Mather when it's in season. Their little experiments and shows are fun. One involves liquid nitrogen and explosions. In the summer they blow up watermelons.",
          "Children loved it. Hands on is great",
          "Kids loved it, didn't even realize they were learning in the midst of all the fun.",
          "I love it... I'm such a science fanatic... I actually had more fun than my kid. We both had an amazing time and look forward to a return visit!",
          "It\u2019s a amazing beautiful lakeside place for local people and the tourists.",
          "The only interesting exhibit was the automobile play section.",
          "Loved the little kid area. Staff was helpful too",
          "Will definitely return here, so much to see and do, wonderful day with my family making memories for my grandchildren",
          "How about some interactive exhibits for a little older age group? Science isn't just for kids.",
          "Very educational,  mainly based for children. A little over priced. Still fun if your older.",
          "Nice place. Space stuff. Apollo command module, if memory serves, and a replica Mercury capsule. Assorted physics displays.",
          "Beautiful hands on science center,  with awesome views of lake Erie. Give yourself a good 2 hrs, maybe more with young children.",
          "The place needs cleaned bad, like all the exhibits. Half the exhibits weren't functioning during our visit. But i love this place and learn so much!",
          "So much fun, kids really enjoyed themselves and so did the adults. The acoustics in the \"visiting\" exhibit were so bad we could not hear any of the automatic descriptions for the exhibits... Be prepared to pay a lot for their food if you purchase it there.  Next time we will pack food...",
          "Third floor is fun for kids. Second floor exhibits lacked appeal and something did not work.",
          "Had an amazing time the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. An fun for all ages .... you can always learn something new, no matter the age.",
          "Great place for kids get there early lot's to see and do",

          "Our four year old had a wonderful first time experience at the Great Lakes science Center. We spent over three and a half hours enjoying all aspects of the Center. Lots of things to learn and try first hand. Staff were friendly along with \u2026",

          "Great science center for all ages even my 2yr old. Clean and the staff was kind and helpful.",
          "Definitely a kids only museum. I do not have children of my own yet and all exhibits are kid oriented which isn't a bad thing, just to keep in mind if you are heading here solo or with another adult. High ticket price for this museum in \u2026",
          "A very well maintained \"hands on\" museum for kids all ages. A place to learn a lot! Well worth it! Hint - get a pass along with an included Mathers Freighter tour - for the best value. The 600 foot freighter is docked out back and wonderful walk about - to learn things about freighting and the sea shipping industry.",
          "This place was awesome! They even had a group of reptiles there for display on the day i went, so they probably do things like this all the time!",

          "Lots of fun for all ages.",
          "This place is amazing for children and adults.  Lots to learn and their science shows are always awesome to see. Please take the time to check out one of the movies that they show on the big screen...its with the extra few dollars to see! The movies are always changing arms so are the exhibits.  Staff here is very friendly!",
          "Indoor playground for children without much science learning.",
          "always fun.  free first week end forBank ofAmerica card holders. museums on us program.  love the outside binoculars.",

          "This is a very interactive science center. Children, teens, adults and grandparents can all benefit by the visit. Starting on the second floor with the polymer room, an interactive exhibit of plastic balls that children can dump, shoot \u2026",
          "Fun science center with lots of things to see and play with. It was easy to find parking and buy tickets. It took less than 3 hours for us to see everything and be ready to leave, which was fine because they were closing (at 5pm). Also we \u2026",
          "It's a great experience especially for the kids to learn something and have fun",

          "Really great experience. They always have a new features exhibit. The science shows are wonderful. My son really enjoys it",

          "Attended wedding at the center.\nGreat time",
          "The staff was extremely courteous very helpful and knowledgeable always willing to help in any way they could, but as far as the entrance price was simply just overpriced.

          "Great place to learn about all things. Kids had a wonderful time and cant wait to go back!",
          "An amazing place.  I took my 3 daughters and they had a blast. There's so much for them to do, so many hands on activities, it was impressive. There's so much to do in fact,  that we didn't get to do everything. You many need to make multiple visits to  have the full Science center experience.",
          "Well kinda boring...the space stuff was cool",
          "Great place! So much for the kids to do and a ton of things for everyone. It is clear that the space program carries a special place in the Heart of Ohio. The Dome theater was fantastic and all of the exhibits were a lot of fun. The price \u2026",

          "So far we've only gone through the ship, but it was amazing to get to tour!",
          "Good but Expensive. I believe the season passes are fairly priced, but as has become the norm, single day tickets - the kind tourists would always want - are punitively priced. A family of four is looking at around $100. Not horrible but when you consider this is basically a playground combined with a few science facts it seems steep.",
          "We took our schoolchildren here today, grades K through 10 and they loved it.",
          "It's a nice place. Omnimax theater is great. The science exhibits are showing their age, though. Time for upgrades.",

          "Second time here and we really enjoyed it. The first time we we're expecting our little guy but enjoyed watching our friends kids play and learn. This time our done was 2 and he loved every moment, especially the space area, outdoor area, \u2026",
          "It is the middle of flu season and all hands on activities but there no hand sanitizer stations anywhere! We even asked an employee and they said \u201coh there should be one over there\u201d but there was none. Please add hand sanitizer stations \u2026",
          "I am not the type of person to enjoy museums of any kind, but this one was by far the most fun and exciting one I have ever been too. There\u2019s so many interactive activities for kids and adults of all ages. Not only are you having fun \u2026",
          "Was great.  Grandkids had a blast",
          "This place was amazing! So much to do with hands on play. Would be great for any age kids as they have an under 7 play room. The Grossology exhibit was very educational and gross! \ud83d\ude02",
          "This is one of my favorite places to visit in Cleveland with the kids.  There is an outside water area for very young kids on the roof and see a great view of the lake, a ball pit area for young kids where you can feed balls into a machine \u2026",
          "Fun for the whole family",

          "Medium size place, but expensive for the experience. Every exhibit had at least one thing not working. Overall I would say it was somewhat run down.",
          "It was a very nice experience as well as educational and I highly recommend this as a field trip location or somewhere to take your 6-16 yo kids, niece's, nephews etc.",
          "Awesome tour of the Mather freighter! Recommend this tour to everyone!",

          "Lots of fun activities",
          "Awesome experience for all of our kids. Very hands-on, open areas to explore, lots of cool stuff.  Parking is expensive, but entry was a deal with group rate. Take the lead and get a membership, only a little more, overall.",
          "This is a great place for both kids and adults. Lots of interactive things to do from electronics to harmonics and some NASA history on display. \n\nWe had been on a tour of the NASA Glen Research Center on Saturday the spent some time here with the kids.",

        "wiki": "Cleveland ( KLEEV-l\u0259nd), officially the City of Cleveland, is a major city in the U.S. state of Ohio, and the county seat of Cuyahoga County. The city proper has a population of 381,009, making it the 53rd-largest city in the United States and the second-largest city in Ohio. Greater Cleveland is ranked as the 33rd-largest metropolitan area in the U.S., with 2,057,009 people in 2018. A Gamma + city, Cleveland anchors the Cleveland\u2013Akron\u2013Canton Combined Statistical Area, which had a population of 3,515,646 in 2010 and is ranked 15th in the United States.\nThe city is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie, across the U.S. maritime border with Canada and approximately 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of the Ohio-Pennsylvania state border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River by General Moses Cleaveland. It became a manufacturing center due to its location on both the river and the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy relies on diversified sectors such as manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, biomedicals, and higher education, and the city ranks 31st in the nation per economic output, with a GDP of $134 billion in 2018.The city's major cultural institutions include the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Cleveland Orchestra, Playhouse Square, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Known as \"The Forest City\" among many other nicknames, Cleveland serves as the center of the Cleveland Metroparks nature reserve system.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nCleveland was established on July 22, 1796, by surveyors of the Connecticut Land Company when they laid out Connecticut's Western Reserve into townships and a capital city. They named the new settlement \"Cleaveland\" after their leader, General Moses Cleaveland. Cleaveland oversaw the New England-style design of the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on Public Square, before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first permanent settler in Cleaveland was Lorenzo Carter, who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River.The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814. In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, the town's waterfront location proved to be an advantage, giving it access to Great Lakes trade. It grew rapidly after the 1832 completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal. This key link between the Ohio River and the Great Lakes connected it to the Atlantic Ocean via the Erie Canal and Hudson River, and later via the St. Lawrence Seaway. Its products could reach markets on the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. The town's growth continued with added railroad links.In 1831, the spelling of the town's name was altered by The Cleveland Advertiser newspaper. In order to fit the name on the newspaper's masthead, the editors dropped the first \"a\", reducing the city's name to Cleveland, which eventually became the official spelling. In 1836, Cleveland was officially incorporated as a city.  That same year, Cleveland, then only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring Ohio City over a bridge connecting the two communities. Ohio City remained an independent municipality until its annexation by Cleveland in 1854.\n\n\n=== Growth and expansion ===\n\nCleveland served as an important center for the Union during the American Civil War. After the war, the city witnessed rapid growth. Its prime geographic location as a transportation hub between the East Coast and the Midwest played an important role in its development as a commercial center. Cleveland served as a destination for iron ore shipped from Minnesota, along with coal transported by rail. In 1870, John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in Cleveland. In 1885, he moved its headquarters to New York City, which had become a center of finance and business.By the early 20th century, Cleveland had emerged as a major American manufacturing center. Its businesses included automotive companies such as Peerless, People's, Jordan, Chandler, and Winton, maker of the first car driven across the U.S. Other manufacturers in Cleveland produced steam-powered cars, which included White and Gaeth, as well as the electric car company Baker.\n\nKnown as the \"Sixth City\" due to its position as the sixth largest U.S. city at the time, Cleveland counted major Progressive Era politicians among its leaders, most prominently the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson, who was responsible for the development of the Cleveland Mall Plan.  The era of the City Beautiful movement in Cleveland architecture, this period also saw wealthy patrons support the establishment of the city's major cultural institutions. The most prominent among them were the Cleveland Museum of Art, which opened in 1916, and the Cleveland Orchestra, established in 1918.Cleveland's economic growth and industrial jobs attracted large waves of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Ireland.  African American migrants from the rural South also arrived in Cleveland (among other Northeastern and Midwestern cities) as part of the Great Migration for jobs, constitutional rights, and relief from racial discrimination.By 1920, the year in which the Cleveland Indians won their first World Series championship, Cleveland had grown into a densely-populated metropolis of 796,841 with a foreign-born population of 30%, making it the fifth largest city in the nation. At this time, Cleveland saw the rise of radical labor movements in response to the conditions of the largely immigrant and migrant workers. In 1919, the city attracted national attention amid the First Red Scare for the Cleveland May Day Riots, in which socialist demonstrators clashed with anti-socialists.Despite the immigration restrictions of 1921 and 1924, the city's population continued to grow throughout the 1920s. Prohibition first took effect in Ohio in May 1919 (although it was not well-enforced in Cleveland), became law with the Volstead Act in 1920, and was eventually repealed nationally by Congress in 1933.  The ban on alcohol led to the rise of speakeasies throughout the city and organized crime gangs, such as the Mayfield Road Mob, who smuggled bootleg liquor across Lake Erie from Canada into Cleveland. The Roaring Twenties also saw the establishment of Cleveland's Playhouse Square and the rise of the risqu\u00e9 Short Vincent entertainment district. The Bal-Masque balls of the avant-garde Kokoon Arts Club scandalized the city. Jazz came to prominence in Cleveland during this period.\n\nIn 1929, the city hosted the first of many National Air Races. Construction of the Terminal Tower skyscraper commenced in 1926 and, by the time it was dedicated in 1930, Cleveland had a population of over 900,000.  The era of the flapper also marked the beginning of the golden age in Downtown Cleveland retail, centered on major department stores Higbee's, Bailey's, the May Company, Taylor's, Halle's, and Sterling Lindner Davis, which collectively represented one of the largest and most fashionable shopping districts in the country, often compared to New York's Fifth Avenue.Cleveland was hit hard by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. A center of union activity, the city was aided by major federal works projects sponsored by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 at the city's North Coast Harbor, along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived by Cleveland's business leaders as a way to revitalize the city during the Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937.On December 7, 1941, Imperial Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and declared war on the United States. One of the victims of the attack was a Cleveland native, Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd.  The attack signaled America's entry into World War II.  A major hub of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\", Cleveland under Mayor Frank Lausche contributed massively to the U.S. war effort as the fifth largest manufacturing center in the nation.  During his tenure, Lausche also oversaw the establishment of the Cleveland Transit System, the predecessor to the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority.\n\n\n=== Late 20th and early 21st centuries ===\nAfter the war, Cleveland initially experienced an economic boom, and businesses declared the city to be the \"best location in the nation.\" In 1949, the city was named an All-America City for the first time and, in 1950, its population reached 914,808.  In sports, the Indians won the 1948 World Series, the hockey team, the Barons, became champions of the American Hockey League, and the Browns dominated professional football in the 1950s. As a result, along with track and boxing champions produced, Cleveland was declared the \"City of Champions\" in sports at this time. The 1950s also saw the rising popularity of a new music genre that local WJW (AM) disc jockey Alan Freed dubbed \"rock and roll.\"\n\nHowever, by the 1960s, Cleveland's economy began to slow down, and residents increasingly sought new housing in the suburbs, reflecting the national trends of suburban growth following federally subsidized highways.  Industrial restructuring, particularly in the railroad and steel industries, resulted in the loss of numerous jobs in Cleveland and the region, and the city suffered economically. The burning of the Cuyahoga River in June 1969 brought national attention to the issue of industrial pollution in Cleveland and served as a catalyst for the American environmental movement.Housing discrimination and redlining against African Americans led to racial unrest in Cleveland and numerous other Northern U.S. cities. In Cleveland, the Hough riots erupted from July 18 to 23, 1966 and the Glenville Shootout took place from July 23 to 25, 1968. In November 1967, Cleveland became the first major American city to elect an African American mayor, Carl B. Stokes, who served from 1968 to 1971.In December 1978, during the turbulent tenure of Dennis Kucinich as mayor, Cleveland became the first major American city since the Great Depression to enter into a financial default on federal loans. By the beginning of the 1980s, several factors, including changes in international free trade policies, inflation, and the Savings and Loans Crisis, contributed to the recession that severely affected cities like Cleveland. While unemployment during the period peaked in 1983, Cleveland's rate of 13.8% was higher than the national average due to the closure of several steel production centers.The city began a gradual economic recovery under mayor George V. Voinovich in the 1980s. The downtown area saw the construction of the Key Tower and 200 Public Square skyscrapers, as well as the development of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex\u2014consisting of Progressive Field and Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse\u2014and the North Coast Harbor, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, FirstEnergy Stadium, and the Great Lakes Science Center. The city emerged from default in 1987.By the turn of the 21st century, Cleveland succeeded in developing a more diversified economy and gained a national reputation as a center for healthcare and the arts. Additionally, it has become a national leader in environmental protection, with its successful cleanup of the Cuyahoga River. The city's downtown has experienced dramatic economic and population growth since 2010. In 2018, the population of Cleveland began to flatten after decades of decline. However, challenges still remain for the city, with economic development of neighborhoods, improvement of city schools, and continued encouragement of new immigration to Cleveland being top municipal priorities. Despite such challenges, Cleveland has become increasingly recognized by national media as a city on the upswing. This trend has been accompanied by major victories in sports, most prominently the victory of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals, the first major professional sports championship won by a Cleveland team since 1964.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 82.47 square miles (213.60 km2), of which 77.70 square miles (201.24 km2) is land and 4.77 square miles (12.35 km2) is water.\nThe shore of Lake Erie is 569 feet (173 m) above sea level; however, the city lies on a series of irregular bluffs lying roughly parallel to the lake. In Cleveland these bluffs are cut principally by the Cuyahoga River, Big Creek, and Euclid Creek.\nThe land rises quickly from the lake shores elevation of 569 feet. Public Square, less than one mile (1.6 km) inland, sits at an elevation of 650 feet (198 m), and Hopkins Airport, 5 miles (8 km) inland from the lake, is at an elevation of 791 feet (241 m).Cleveland borders several inner-ring and streetcar suburbs.  To the west, it borders Lakewood, Rocky River, and Fairview Park, and to the east, it borders Shaker Heights, Cleveland Heights, South Euclid, and East Cleveland. To the southwest, it borders Linndale, Brooklyn, Parma, and Brook Park. The city also borders Newburgh Heights, Cuyahoga Heights, and Brooklyn Heights to the south, and Warrensville Heights, Maple Heights, and Garfield Heights to the southeast. To the northeast, along the shore of Lake Erie, Cleveland borders Bratenahl and Euclid.\n\n\n=== Cityscapes ===\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nCleveland's downtown architecture is diverse. Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including City Hall, the Cuyahoga County Courthouse, the Cleveland Public Library, and Public Auditorium, are clustered around the open Cleveland Mall and share a common neoclassical architecture. Built in the early 20th century, they are the result of the 1903 Group Plan. They constitute one of the most complete examples of City Beautiful design in the United States.The Terminal Tower, dedicated in 1930, was the tallest building in North America outside New York City until 1964 and the tallest in the city until 1991. It is a prototypical Beaux-Arts skyscraper. The two newer skyscrapers on Public Square, Key Tower (currently the tallest building in Ohio) and the 200 Public Square, combine elements of Art Deco architecture with postmodern designs. Cleveland's architectural treasures also include the Cleveland Trust Company Building, completed in 1907 and renovated in 2015 as a downtown Heinen's supermarket, and the Cleveland Arcade (sometimes called the Old Arcade), a five-story arcade built in 1890 and renovated in 2001 as a Hyatt Regency Hotel.Running east from Public Square through University Circle is Euclid Avenue, which was known for its prestige and elegance as a residential street. In the late 1880s, writer Bayard Taylor described it as \"the most beautiful street in the world\". Known as \"Millionaires' Row\", Euclid Avenue was world-renowned as the home of such major figures as John D. Rockefeller, Mark Hanna, and John Hay.Cleveland's landmark ecclesiastical architecture includes the historic Old Stone Church in downtown Cleveland and the onion domed St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Tremont, along with myriad ethnically inspired Roman Catholic churches.\n\n\n=== Parks and nature ===\n\nKnown locally as the \"Emerald Necklace\", the Olmsted-inspired Cleveland Metroparks encircle Cleveland and Cuyahoga County. The city proper is home to the Metroparks' Brookside and Lakefront Reservations, as well as significant parts of the Rocky River, Washington, and Euclid Creek Reservations. The Lakefront Reservation, which provides public access to Lake Erie, consists of four parks: Edgewater Park, Whiskey Island\u2013Wendy Park, East 55th Street Marina, and Gordon Park. Three more parks fall under the jurisdiction of the Euclid Creek Reservation: Euclid Beach, Villa Angela, and Wildwood Marina. Bike and hiking trails in the Brecksville and Bedford Reservations, along with Garfield Park further north, provide access to trails in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The extensive system of trails within Cuyahoga Valley National Park extends south into Summit County, offering access to Summit Metro Parks as well. Also included in the system is the renowned Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, established in 1882. Located in Big Creek valley, the zoo has one of the largest collection of primates in North America.The Cleveland Metroparks provides ample opportunity for outdoor recreational activities. Hiking and biking trails, including single track mountain bike trails, wind extensively throughout the parks. Rock climbing is available at Whipp\u2019s Ledges at the Hinckley Reservation. During the summer months, kayakers, paddle boarders, and rowing and sailing crews can be seen on the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie. In the winter months, downhill skiing, snowboarding, and tubing are available not far from downtown at the Boston Mills, Brandywine and Alpine Valley Ski resorts.\nIn addition to the Metroparks, Cleveland Public Parks District oversees the city's neighborhood parks, the largest of which is the historic Rockefeller Park, notable for its late 19th century landmark bridges, Rockefeller Park Greenhouse, and Cleveland Cultural Gardens, which celebrate the city's ethnic diversity. Just outside of Rockefeller Park, the Cleveland Botanical Garden in University Circle, established in 1930, is the oldest civic garden center in the nation. Located in the historic FirstEnergy Powerhouse in the Flats, the Greater Cleveland Aquarium is the only independent, free-standing aquarium in the state of Ohio.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nDowntown Cleveland is centered on Public Square and includes a wide range of districts. It contains the traditional Financial District and Civic Center, as well as the Cleveland Theater District, which is home to Playhouse Square Center. Downtown also historically included the lively Short Vincent entertainment district, which emerged in the 1920s and reached its height in the 1940s and 1950s. Today the former Short Vincent forms part of the Financial District. Mixed-use neighborhoods, such as the Flats and the Warehouse District, are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units, in the form of condominiums, lofts, and apartments, has been on the increase since 2000 and especially 2010. Recent developments include the revival of the Flats, the Euclid Corridor Project, and the developments along East 4th Street.\n\nClevelanders geographically define themselves in terms of whether they live on the east or west side of the Cuyahoga River. The East Side includes the neighborhoods of Buckeye\u2013Shaker, Central, Collinwood, Corlett, Euclid\u2013Green, Fairfax, Forest Hills, Glenville, Goodrich\u2013Kirtland Park (with Asiatown), Hough, Kinsman, Lee\u2013Miles, Mount Pleasant, Nottingham, St. Clair-Superior, Union\u2013Miles Park, University Circle (with Little Italy), and Woodland Hills. The West Side includes the neighborhoods of Brooklyn Centre, Clark\u2013Fulton, Detroit\u2013Shoreway, Cudell, Edgewater, Ohio City, Tremont, Old Brooklyn, Stockyards, West Boulevard, and the four neighborhoods colloquially known as West Park: Kamm's Corners, Jefferson, Bellaire\u2013Puritas, and Hopkins. Three neighborhoods in the Cuyahoga Valley are sometimes referred to as the South Side: Industrial Valley, Broadway\u2013Slavic Village, and Tremont.\nSeveral neighborhoods have begun to attract the return of the middle class that left the city for the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. These neighborhoods are on both the West Side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit-Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the East Side (Collinwood, Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy). Much of the growth has been spurred on by attracting creative class members, which in turn is spurring new residential development. A live-work zoning overlay for the city's near East Side has facilitated the transformation of old industrial buildings into loft spaces for artists.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTypical of the Great Lakes region, Cleveland exhibits a continental climate with four distinct seasons, which lies in the humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfa) zone. Summers are warm and humid while winters are cold and snowy. The Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east\u2013west from the mouth of the Cuyahoga west to Sandusky, but at the mouth of the Cuyahoga it turns sharply northeast. This feature is the principal contributor to the lake effect snow that is typical in Cleveland (especially on the city's East Side) from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, usually in late January or early February. The lake effect also causes a relative differential in geographical snowfall totals across the city: while Hopkins Airport, on the city's far West Side, has only reached 100 inches (254 cm) of snowfall in a season three times since record-keeping for snow began in 1893, seasonal totals approaching or exceeding 100 inches (254 cm) are not uncommon as the city ascends into the Heights on the east, where the region known as the 'Snow Belt' begins. Extending from the city's East Side and its suburbs, the Snow Belt reaches up the Lake Erie shore as far as Buffalo.The all-time record high in Cleveland of 104 \u00b0F (40 \u00b0C) was established on June 25, 1988, and the all-time record low of \u221220 \u00b0F (\u221229 \u00b0C) was set on January 19, 1994. On average, July is the warmest month with a mean temperature of 73.5 \u00b0F (23.1 \u00b0C), and January, with a mean temperature of 28.1 \u00b0F (\u22122.2 \u00b0C), is the coldest. Normal yearly precipitation based on the 30-year average from 1981 to 2010 is 39.1 inches (990 mm). The least precipitation occurs on the western side and directly along the lake, and the most occurs in the eastern suburbs. Parts of Geauga County to the east receive over 44 inches (1,100 mm) of liquid precipitation annually.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 396,698 people, 167,490 households, and 89,821 families residing in the city. The population density was 5,107.0 inhabitants per square mile (1,971.8/km2). There were 207,536 housing units at an average density of 2,671.0 per square mile (1,031.3/km2). The racial composition of the city was 53.3% African American, 37.3% White, 0.3% Native American, 1.8% Asian, 4.4% from other races, and 2.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.0% of the population.There were 167,490 households of which 29.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 22.4% were married couples living together, 25.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 6.0% had a male householder with no wife present, and 46.4% were non-families. 39.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.29 and the average family size was 3.11.\nThe median age in the city was 35.7 years. 24.6% of residents were under the age of 18; 11% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.1% were from 25 to 44; 26.3% were from 45 to 64; and 12% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.0% male and 52.0% female.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $27,349, and the median income for a family was $31,182. The per capita income for the city was $16,302. 31.0% of the population and 22.9% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 37.6% of those under the age of 18 and 16.8% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line. Of the city's population over the age of 25, 13.1% held a bachelor's degree or higher, and 75.7% had a high school diploma or equivalent.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Cleveland saw a massive influx of immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and the Austro-Hungarian, German, Russian, and Ottoman Empires, most of whom were attracted by manufacturing jobs. As a result, Cleveland and Cuyahoga County today have substantial communities of Irish (especially in Kamm's Corners and other areas of West Park), Italians (especially in Little Italy and around Mayfield Road), Germans, and several Central-Eastern European ethnicities, including Czechs, Hungarians, Lithuanians, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Rusyns, Slovaks, Ukrainians, and ex-Yugoslav groups, such as Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs. The presence of Hungarians within Cleveland proper was, at one time, so great that the city boasted the highest concentration of Hungarians in the world outside of Budapest. Cleveland has a long-established Jewish community, historically centered on the East Side neighborhoods of Glenville and Kinsman, but now mostly concentrated in East Side suburbs such as Cleveland Heights and Beachwood, home to the Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage.The availability of jobs also attracted African Americans from the South. Between 1920 and 1970, the black population of Cleveland, largely concentrated on the city's East Side, increased significantly as a result of the First and Second Great Migrations. Cleveland's Latino community consists primarily of Puerto Ricans, while the city's Asian community, centered on historical Asiatown, consists of Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese, and other groups. Additionally, the city and the county have significant communities of Albanians, Arabs (especially Lebanese, Syrians, and Palestinians), Armenians, French, Greeks, Scots, Turks, and West Indians.There are many ethnic festivals held in Cleveland throughout the year, such as the annual Feast of the Assumption in Little Italy, the Harvest Festival in Slavic Village, Russian Maslenitsa in Rockefeller Park, the Cleveland Puerto Rican Parade and Festival in Clark\u2013Fulton, and the Cleveland Asian Festival in Asiatown. Vendors at the West Side Market in Ohio City offer many ethnic foods for sale. Cleveland hosts an annual parade on Saint Patrick's Day that brings hundreds of thousands to the streets of downtown. The Cleveland Thyagaraja Festival held annually each spring at Cleveland State University is the largest Indian classical music and dance festival in the world outside of India. Since 1946, the city has annually marked One World Day in the Cleveland Cultural Gardens in Rockefeller Park, celebrating all of its ethnic communities.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe influx of immigrants in the 19th and early 20th centuries drastically transformed Cleveland's religious landscape.  From a homogeneous settlement of New England Protestants, it evolved into a city with a diverse religious composition. The predominant faith among Clevelanders today is Christianity (Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox), with Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist minorities.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nAs of 2010, 88.4% (337,658) of Cleveland residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 7.1% (27,262) spoke Spanish, 0.6% (2,200) Arabic, and 0.5% (1,960) Chinese. In addition 0.9% (3,364) spoke a Slavic language (1,279 \u2013 Polish, 679 Serbo-Croatian, and 485 Russian). In total, 11.6% (44,148) of Cleveland's population age 5 and older spoke a language other than English.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 1920, Cleveland proper boasted a foreign-born population of 30% and, in 1870, that percentage was 42%. Although the foreign-born population of Cleveland today is not as big as it once was, the sense of identity remains strong among the city's various ethnic communities, as reflected in the Cleveland Cultural Gardens.  Recent waves of immigration have brought new groups to Cleveland, including Ethiopians and South Asians, as well as immigrants from Russia and the former USSR, Southeast Europe (especially Albania), the Middle East, East Asia, and Latin America.  In the 2010s, the immigrant population of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County began to see significant growth, becoming one of the fastest growing centers for immigration in the Great Lakes region. A 2019 study found Cleveland to be the city with the shortest average processing time in the nation for immigrants to become U.S. citizens, and a 2020 analysis found Cleveland to be the most ethnically and racially diverse city in Ohio. The city's annual One World Day in Rockefeller Park includes a naturalization ceremony of new immigrants.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nCleveland's location on the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie has been key to its growth. The Ohio and Erie Canal coupled with rail links helped the city become an important business center. Steel and many other manufactured goods emerged as leading industries. The city has since diversified its economy in addition to its manufacturing sector.\nEstablished in 1914, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is one of 12 U.S. Federal Reserve Banks. Its downtown building, located on East 6th Street and Superior Avenue, was completed in 1923 by the Cleveland architectural firm Walker and Weeks. The headquarters of the Federal Reserve System's Fourth District, the bank employs 1,000 people and maintains branch offices in Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. The chief executive officer and president is Loretta Mester.\n\nThe city is also home to the corporate headquarters of many large companies such as Aleris, American Greetings, Applied Industrial Technologies, Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc., Eaton, Forest City Enterprises, Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, KeyCorp, Lincoln Electric, Medical Mutual of Ohio, NACCO Industries, Nordson, Parker-Hannifin, PolyOne, Progressive, RPM International, Sherwin-Williams Company, Third Federal S&L, TransDigm Group and Travel Centers of America. NASA maintains a facility in Cleveland, the Glenn Research Center. Jones Day, one of the largest law firms in the U.S., was founded in Cleveland.The Cleveland Clinic is the largest private employer in the city of Cleveland and the state of Ohio, with a workforce of over 50,000 as of 2019. It carries the distinction as being among America's best hospitals with top ratings published in U.S. News & World Report. Cleveland's healthcare sector also includes University Hospitals of Cleveland, MetroHealth medical center, and the insurance company Medical Mutual of Ohio. Cleveland is also noted in the fields of biotechnology and fuel cell research, led by Case Western Reserve University, the Cleveland Clinic, and University Hospitals of Cleveland. The city is among the top recipients of investment for biotech start-ups and research.Technology is another growing sector in Cleveland. In 2005, the city appointed a \"tech czar\" to recruit technology companies to the downtown office market, offering connections to the high-speed fiber networks that run underneath downtown streets in several \"high-tech offices\" focused on Euclid Avenue. Cleveland State University hired a technology transfer officer to cultivate technology transfers from CSU research to marketable ideas and companies in the Cleveland area. According to Forbes, Cleveland could be the next tech hub. 180 tech companies have started in the local area. Local observers have noted that the city is transitioning from a manufacturing-based economy to a health-tech-based economy.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nThe Cleveland Metropolitan School District is the second largest K\u201312 district in the state of Ohio. It is the only district in Ohio under direct control of the mayor, who appoints a school board. Approximately 1 square mile (2.6 km2) of Cleveland, adjacent the Shaker Square neighborhood, is part of the Shaker Heights City School District. The area, which has been a part of the Shaker school district since the 1920s, permits these Cleveland residents to pay the same school taxes as the Shaker residents, as well as vote in the Shaker school board elections.Private and parochial schools within Cleveland proper include Benedictine High School, Birchwood School, Cleveland Central Catholic High School, Eleanor Gerson School, Montessori High School at University Circle, St. Ignatius High School, St. Joseph Academy, Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School, Urban Community School, St. Martin de Porres, and The Bridge Avenue School.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nCleveland is home to a number of colleges and universities. Most prominent among these is Case Western Reserve University, a world-renowned research and teaching institution in University Circle. A private university with several prominent graduate programs, CWRU was ranked 40th in the nation in 2020 by U.S. News & World Report. University Circle also contains Cleveland Institute of Art and the Cleveland Institute of Music. Cleveland State University (CSU), based in Downtown Cleveland, is the city's public four-year university. In addition to CSU, downtown hosts the metropolitan campus of Cuyahoga Community College, the county's two-year higher education institution.\nOhio Technical College is also based in Cleveland. Cleveland's suburban universities and colleges include Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, John Carroll University in University Heights, Ursuline College in Pepper Pike, and Notre Dame College in South Euclid.\n\n\n=== Public library system ===\n\nEstablished in 1869, the Cleveland Public Library is one of the largest public libraries in the nation with a collection of 10,559,651 materials as of 2018. Its John G. White Special Collection includes the largest chess library in the world as well as an impressive collection of folklore and rare books on the Middle East and Eurasia. Under head librarian William Howard Brett, the library adopted an \"open shelf\" philosophy, which allowed patrons open access to the library's bookstacks. Brett's successor, Linda Eastman, became the first woman ever to lead a major library system in the world. She oversaw the construction of the library's main building on Superior Avenue, designed by Walker and Weeks and opened on May 6, 1925. The Louis Stokes Wing addition was completed in April 1997. Between 1904 and 1920, 15 libraries built with funds from Andrew Carnegie were opened in the city. Known as the \"People's University,\" the library presently maintains 27 branches. It serves as the headquarters for the CLEVNET library consortium, which includes over 40 public library systems in the Greater Cleveland Metropolitan Area and Northeast Ohio.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nCleveland is home to Playhouse Square, the second largest performing arts center in the United States behind New York City's Lincoln Center. Playhouse Square includes the State, Palace, Allen, Hanna, and Ohio theaters within what is known as the Cleveland Theater District. Playhouse Square's resident performing arts companies include Cleveland Play House, Cleveland State University Department of Theatre and Dance, the Great Lakes Theater Festival, and the Cleveland Ballet. The center hosts Broadway musicals, special concerts, speaking engagements, and other events throughout the year. A city with strong traditions in theater and vaudeville, Cleveland has produced many renowned actors and actresses, most prominently comedian Bob Hope.Outside Playhouse Square, Cleveland is home to Karamu House, the oldest African American theater in the nation, established in the 1920s. On the West Side, the Gordon Square Arts District in Detroit-Shoreway is the location of the Capitol Theatre, the Near West Theatre, and an Off-Off-Broadway Playhouse, the Cleveland Public Theatre. Cleveland's streetcar suburbs of Cleveland Heights and Lakewood are home to the Dobama Theatre and the Beck Center for the Arts respectively.Cleveland is home to The Cleveland Orchestra, widely considered one of the world's finest orchestras, and often referred to as the finest in the nation. It is one of the \"Big Five\" major orchestras in the United States. The Orchestra plays at Severance Hall in University Circle during the winter and at Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls during the summer. The city is also home to the Cleveland Pops Orchestra, the Cleveland Youth Orchestra, the Contemporary Youth Orchestra the Cleveland Youth Wind Symphony, and the biennial Cleveland International Piano Competition which has, in the past, often featured The Cleveland Orchestra.\nOne Playhouse Square, now the headquarters for Cleveland's public broadcasters, was initially used as the broadcast studios of WJW (AM), where disc jockey Alan Freed first popularized the term \"rock and roll\". Cleveland gained a strong reputation in rock music in the 1960s and 1970s as a key breakout market for nationally promoted acts and performers. Its popularity in the city was so great that Billy Bass, the program director at the WMMS radio station, referred to Cleveland as \"The Rock and Roll Capital of the World.\" From 1974 through 1980, the city hosted the World Series of Rock at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The cult rock band Mushroomhead was formed in Cleveland in 1993.\nJazz has a long history in Cleveland. Many major figures in jazz, including Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Goodman, and Billie Holiday performed in the city, and legendary pianist Art Tatum regularly played in Cleveland clubs during the 1930s. Gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt gave his U.S. debut performance in Cleveland in 1946. Prominent jazz artist Noble Sissle was a graduate of Cleveland Central High School, Artie Shaw worked and performed in Cleveland early in his career, and bandleader Phil Spitalny led his first orchestra in Cleveland. The Tri-C Jazz Fest has been held annually in Cleveland at Playhouse Square since 1979 and the Cleveland Jazz Orchestra was established in 1984. Joe Siebert's documentary film The Sax Man on the life of Cleveland street saxophonist Maurice Reedus Jr. was released in 2014.The city also has a history of polka music being popular both past and present, even having a subgenre called Cleveland-style polka named after the city, and is home to the Polka Hall of Fame. This is due in part to the success of Frankie Yankovic who was a Cleveland native and was considered the America's Polka King and the square at the intersection of Waterloo Rd. and East 152nd St. in Cleveland (41.569\u00b0N 81.5752\u00b0W\ufeff / 41.569; -81.5752), not far from where Yankovic grew up, was named in his honor.\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\n\nCleveland has served as the setting for many major studio and independent films. Reflecting its position as one of the largest American cities at the time, the city was referenced in numerous classic Hollywood movies, such as Howard Hawks' Ceiling Zero (1936) with James Cagney and Pat O'Brien, and Hobart Henley's romantic comedy The Big Pond (1930) with Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert, which introduced the hit song \"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\". Michael Curtiz's 1933 pre-Code classic Goodbye Again with Warren William and Joan Blondell was set in Cleveland.  Players from the 1948 Cleveland Indians, winners of the World Series, appeared in The Kid from Cleveland (1949).

More recently, the teenage comedy Fun Size (2012) takes place in and around Cleveland on Halloween night, and the film Draft Day (2014) followed Kevin Costner as general manager for the Cleveland Browns.Cleveland has often doubled for other locations in the film. The wedding and reception scenes in The Deer Hunter (1978), while set in the small Pittsburgh suburb of Clairton, were shot in the Cleveland neighborhood of Tremont; U.S. Steel also permitted the production to film in one of its Cleveland mills. Francis Ford Coppola produced The Escape Artist (1982), much of which was shot in Downtown Cleveland near City Hall and the Cuyahoga County Courthouse, as well as the Flats. A Christmas Story (1983) was set in Indiana, but drew many of its external shots\u2014including the Parker family home\u2014from Cleveland.

The Browns have never played in a Super Bowl, getting close five times by making it to the NFL/AFC Championship Game in 1968, 1969, 1986, 1987, and 1989. Former owner Art Modell's relocation of the Browns after the 1995 season (to Baltimore creating the Ravens), caused tremendous heartbreak and resentment among local fans. Cleveland mayor, Michael R. White, worked with the NFL and Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to bring back the Browns beginning in the 1999 season, retaining all team history.

Since the city's industrialization, the Cuyahoga had become so affected by industrial pollution that it \"caught fire\" a total of 13 times beginning in 1868. It was the river fire of June 1969 that spurred the city to action and played a key role in the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 and the National Environmental Policy Act later that year. Since that time, the Cuyahoga has been extensively cleaned up and, in 2019, the American Rivers conservation association named the Cuyahoga River \"River of the Year\" in honor of \"50 years of environmental resurgence.\"In addition to continued efforts to improve freshwater and air quality, the city is now exploring renewable energy. Cleveland's two main electrical utilities are FirstEnergy and Cleveland Public Power.

From 1924 to 1931, the city briefly experimented with a council\u2013manager government under William R. Hopkins and Daniel E. Morgan before returning to the mayor\u2013council system.The office of the mayor has been held by Frank G. Jackson since 2006. Previous mayors of Cleveland include progressive Democrat Tom L. Johnson, World War I-era War Secretary and BakerHostetler founder Newton D. Baker, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harold Hitz Burton, two-term Ohio Governor and Senator Frank J. Lausche, former U.S. Health, Education, and Welfare Secretary Anthony J. Celebrezze, two-term Ohio Governor and Senator George V. Voinovich, former U.S. Congressman Dennis Kucinich, and Carl B. Stokes, the first African American mayor of a major U.S. city.Another nationally prominent Ohio politician, former U.S. President James A. Garfield, was born in Cuyahoga County's Orange Township (today the Cleveland suburb of Moreland Hills). His resting place is the James A. Garfield Memorial in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery.From the Civil War era to the 1940s, Cleveland was primarily dominated by the Republican Party, with the notable exceptions of the Johnson and Baker mayoral administrations. Businessman and Senator Mark Hanna was among Cleveland's most influential Republican figures, both locally and nationally. In addition to the established support of organized labor, the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, led by former mayor Ray T. Miller, was able to secure the support of the city's ethnic European and African American communities in the 1940s. Beginning with the Lausche administration, Cleveland's political orientation shifted to the Democratic Party and, with the exceptions of the Perk and Voinovich administrations, it has remained dominated by the Democrats ever since.Today, while other parts of Ohio, particularly Cincinnati and the southern portion of the state, support the Republicans, Cleveland commonly produces the strongest support in the state for the Democrats. At the local level, elections are nonpartisan. However, Democrats still dominate every level of government. During the 2004 Presidential election, although George W. Bush carried Ohio by 2.1%, John Kerry carried Cuyahoga County 66.6%\u201332.9%, his largest margin in any Ohio county. The city of Cleveland supported Kerry over Bush by the even larger margin of 83.3%\u201315.8%. As a result of the 2010 Census, Ohio lost two Congressional seats, which affected Cleveland's districts in the northeast part of the state. Today, Cleveland is split between two congressional districts. Most of the western part of the city is in the 9th District, represented by Marcy Kaptur. Most of the eastern part of the city, as well as most of downtown, is in the 11th District, represented by Marcia Fudge. Both are Democrats, two of four representing the state of Ohio.\nCleveland hosted three Republican national conventions in its history, in 1924, 1936, and 2016. The city also hosted the Radical Republican convention of 1864. Cleveland has not hosted a national convention for the Democrats, despite the position of Cuyahoga County as a Democratic stronghold in Ohio.\nFounded in 1912, the City Club of Cleveland provides a platform for national and local debates and discussions. Known as Cleveland's \"Citadel of Free Speech,\" it is one of the oldest continuous independent free speech and debate forums in the country.\n\n\n== Public safety ==\n\n\n=== Police and law enforcement ===\n\nLike in other major American cities, crime in Cleveland is concentrated in areas with higher rates of poverty and lower access to jobs. In recent years, the rate of crime in the city has seen a significant decline, following a nationwide trend in falling crime rates. Cleveland Police statistics published in 2019 showed that rates for violent crimes and property crimes in Cleveland dropped substantially in 2018. The rate of property crimes specifically fell by 30% since 2016.Cleveland's law enforcement agency is the Cleveland Division of Police, established in 1866. The division has 1,444 sworn officers as of 2016. Cleveland has five police districts. The district system was introduced in the 1930s by Cleveland Public Safety Director Eliot Ness (of the Untouchables), who later ran for mayor of Cleveland in 1947. The division has been recognized for several \"firsts,\" including the \"first criminal conviction secured by matching a palm print lifted from a crime scene to a suspect.\" The current Chief of Police is Calvin D. Williams.\n\n\n==== Consent decree with Department of Justice ====\nIn December 2014, the United States Department of Justice announced the findings of a two-year investigation, prompted by a request from Mayor Frank Jackson, to determine whether the Cleveland Police engaged in a pattern of excessive force. After reviewing nearly 600 use-of-force incidents from 2010 to 2013, the investigators found systemic patterns, insufficient accountability mechanisms, inadequate training, ineffective policies, and inadequate community engagement. As a result of the Justice Department report, the city agreed to a consent decree to revise its policies and implement new independent oversight over the police force.The consent decree, released on May 26, 2015, mandates sweeping changes in training for recruits and seasoned officers, developing programs to identify and support troubled officers, updating technology and data management practices, and an independent monitor to ensure the decree's goals are met. At least some of the provisions have been identified as unique to Cleveland. On June 12, 2015, Chief U.S. District Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. approved and signed the consent decree, beginning the process of police reform.\n\n\n=== Fire department ===\n\nCleveland is served by the firefighters of the Cleveland Division of Fire, established in 1863.

The current Chief of Department is Angelo Calvillo.\n\n\n=== Emergency Medical Services ===\n\nCleveland EMS is operated by the city as its own municipal third-service EMS division. Cleveland EMS is the primary provider of Advanced Life Support and ambulance transport within the city of Cleveland, while Cleveland Fire assists by providing fire response medical care. Although a merger between the fire and EMS departments was proposed in the past, the idea was subsequently abandoned.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Print ===\nCleveland's primary daily newspaper is The Plain Dealer. Defunct major newspapers include the Cleveland Press, an afternoon publication which printed its last edition on June 17, 1982; and the Cleveland News, which ceased publication in 1960. Additional newspapers include: The Morning Journal, which serves suburbs bordering directly on the western Cleveland border; the News-Herald which serves the smaller suburbs in the East Side; the Thursdays-only Sun Post-Herald, which serves a few neighborhoods on the city's West Side; and the Call and Post, a weekly newspaper that primarily serves the city's African American community. The city is also served by Cleveland Magazine, a regional culture magazine published monthly; Crain's Cleveland Business, a weekly business newspaper; Cleveland Jewish News, a weekly Jewish newspaper; and Cleveland Scene, a free alternative weekly paper which absorbed its competitor, the Cleveland Free Times, in 2008. In addition, nationally distributed rock magazine Alternative Press was founded in Cleveland in 1985, and the publication's headquarters remain in the city. The digital Belt Magazine was founded in Cleveland in 2013. Time magazine was published in Cleveland for a brief period from 1925 to 1927.\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\nCombined with nearby Akron and Canton, Cleveland is ranked as the 19th-largest television market by Nielsen Media Research (as of 2013\u201314).

Its former sister station, rock station WMMS, dominated Cleveland radio in the 1970s and 1980s and was at that time one of the highest rated radio stations in the country. In 1972, WMMS program director Billy Bass coined the phrase \"The Rock and Roll Capital of the World\" to describe Cleveland. In 1987, Playboy named WMMS DJ Kid Leo (Lawrence Travagliante) \"The Best Disc Jockey in the Country\".\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\nCleveland is home to a number of leading hospital systems, several of which are in University Circle. Most notable is the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic, which is supplemented by University Hospitals and its Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital. On the city's West Side is the main campus of the MetroHealth System, which operates a level one trauma center in northeast Ohio, and has various locations throughout greater Cleveland.

      "name": "USS COD",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "USS Cod (SS/AGSS/IXSS-224) is a Gato-class submarine, the only vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the cod, an important and very popular food fish of the North Atlantic and North Pacific.\nHer keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut on 21 July 1942. The submarine's five diesel engines were built by General Motors Cleveland Diesel Plant located on the west side of Cleveland. She was launched on 21 March 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. G.M. Mahoney), and commissioned on 21 June 1943 with Commander James C. Dempsey in command. Dempsey had already won fame by sinking the first Japanese destroyer lost in the war while in command of USS S-37, a tiny World War I-era submarine.\nShe is now permanently moored as a museum ship in Cleveland, Ohio, and is open to visitors.\n\n\n== World War II ==\n\n\n=== First and second patrols ===\nCod arrived in Brisbane, Australia, on 2 October 1943 to prepare for her first war patrol. She sailed from there 20 days later. Penetrating the South China Sea, she contacted few targets, and launched an attack only once, on 29 November, with unobserved results. Returning to Fremantle, Western Australia, to refit from 16 December 1943 to 11 January 1944, Cod put to sea for her second war patrol in the South China Sea, off Java, and off Halmahera. On 16 February, she surfaced to sink a sampan by gunfire, and on 23 February, torpedoed a Japanese merchantman. She sent another to the bottom on 27 February, Taisoku Maru (2,473 tons) and two days later attacked a third, only to be forced deep by a concentrated depth charging delivered by a Japanese escort ship.\n\n\n=== Third and fourth patrols ===\nRefitting at Fremantle again from 13 March \u2013 6 April 1944, Cod sailed to the Sulu Sea and the South China Sea off Luzon for her third war patrol. On 10 May, she attacked a heavily escorted convoy of 32 ships and sank the destroyer Karukaya and cargo merchantman Shohei Maru (7,256 tons) before the escorts drove her down with depth charges. Returning to Fremantle to replenish on 1 June, she left again 3 July on her fourth war patrol, under the command of Commander James \"Silver Leader\" Adkins. She ranged from the coast of Luzon to Java. She sank the converted net tender, Seiko Maru (708 tons) on 3 August, and a landing craft, LSV-129, on 14 August, and, once more successful, returned to Fremantle 25 August.\n\n\n=== Fifth patrol ===\nCod put to sea on her fifth war patrol 18 September 1944, bound for Philippine waters. She made her first contact, a cargo ship, Tatsushiro Maru (6,886 tons) on 5 October, and sank it. Two days later, she inflicted heavy damage on a tanker. Contacting a large convoy on 25 October, Cod launched several attacks without success. With all her torpedoes expended, she continued to shadow the convoy for another day to report its position. In November she took up a lifeguard station off Luzon, ready to rescue carrier pilots carrying out the series of air strikes on Japanese bases which paved the way for the invasion of Leyte later that month.\nCod returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 November 1944, and sailed on to a stateside overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, returning to Pearl Harbor on 7 March 1945.\n\n\n=== Sixth and seventh patrols ===\nOn 24 March she sailed from Pearl Harbor for the East China Sea on her sixth war patrol. Assigned primarily to lifeguard duty, she used her deck gun to sink a tug and its tow on 17 April, rescuing three survivors, and on 24 April launched an attack on a convoy which resulted in the most severe depth charging of her career. The next day, she sent the minesweeper W-41 to the bottom. On 26 April Cod was threatened by a fire in the aft torpedo room, but the ship's crew brought the fire under control and manually launched a torpedo already in its tube before the fire could detonate it. QM2c L.E. Foley and S1c A.G. Johnson were washed overboard while freeing the torpedo room hatch. Foley was recovered the next morning, but Johnson was drowned during the night, the Cod's only fatality during the war.\n\nAfter refitting at Guam between 29 May and 26 June 1945, Cod put out for the Gulf of Siam and the coast of Indo-China on her seventh war patrol under the command of Lieutenant commander Edwin M. Westbrook, Jr. On 9 and 10 July she went to the rescue of a grounded Dutch submarine, O 19, taking its crew on board and destroying the Dutch boat when it could not be gotten off the reef. This was the only international submarine-to-submarine rescue in history. After returning the Dutch sailors to Subic Bay, between 21 July and 1 August Cod made 20 gunfire attacks on the junks, motor sampans, and barges which were all that remained to supply the Japanese at Singapore. After inspecting each contact to rescue friendly natives, Cod sank it by gunfire, sending to the bottom a total of 23. On 1 August, an enemy plane strafed Cod, forcing her to dive, leaving one of her boarding parties behind. The men were rescued two days later by Blenny (SS-324).\nWhen Cod returned to Fremantle 13 August 1945, the crew of O-19 was waiting to throw a party for their rescuers. During that celebration, the two crews learned of the Japanese surrender. To symbolize that moment, another symbol was added to Cod's battle flag: the name O-19 under a martini glass.Cod sailed for home on 31 August. Arriving in New London, on 3 November after a visit to Miami, Florida, Cod sailed to Philadelphia for overhaul, returning to New London where she was decommissioned and placed in reserve 22 June 1946.\n\n\n== Post-War Service ==\nCod was recommissioned in 1951, under the command of Captain Francis E. Rich, to participate in NATO anti-submarine training exercises. During the Cold War, Cod traveled to St. John's, Newfoundland, as well as Cuba and South America.\nCod was decommissioned in 1954 and placed in reserve. In 1959 she was towed through the St. Lawrence Seaway to Cleveland, Ohio, and used as a training vessel. Cod was reclassified first as an Auxiliary Submarine (AGSS-224) on 1 December 1962, and later as a Miscellaneous Unclassified Submarine (IXSS-224) on 30 June 1971. In 1971, Cod was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nCod is credited with sinking more than 12 enemy vessels totalling more than 37,000 tons, and damaging another 36,000 tons of enemy shipping. All seven of her war patrols were considered successful and Cod was awarded seven battle stars. Cod's battleflag and conning tower both carry a cocktail glass above the name \"O-19\" to commemorate the rescue and the party. \n\n\n== Commanding officers ==\nPatrols 1, 2, and 3 were under the command of Commander James C. Dempsey, USN; patrols 4, 5, and 6 were under the command of Commander James \"Caddy\" Adkins, USN; and patrol 7 was under the command of Lieutenant commander Edwin M. Westbrook, Jr., USN. When recommissioned in 1951, Cod was under the command of Captain Francis E. Rich, USN, and was placed out of commission by Captain Joseph Adelman, USN.\n\n\n== Museum ship and National Historic Landmark ==\nA group of Cleveland residents formed the Cleveland Coordinating Committee to Save Cod, Inc., with the goal of preserving the ship as a memorial. In January 1976, the U.S. Navy gave guardianship of the submarine to the group. Cod opened for public tours as a floating memorial in May 1976. In 1986, the U.S. Department of the Interior designated Cod a National Historic Landmark. The memorial is open daily between 1 May and 30 September of each year from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\nToday, Cod is one of the finest restored submarines on display and is the only U.S. submarine that has not had stairways and doors cut into her pressure hull for public access. Visitors to the ship use the same vertical ladders and hatches that were used by her crew. Cleveland can claim partial credit as Cod's birthplace, since the submarine's five massive diesel engines were built at the General Motors Cleveland Diesel Plant on Cleveland's west side. She also has unique attractions such as the 5-inch deck gun that still can be rotated by visitors and mock-fired by Cods volunteer crew. The Cod 's Mark IV Torpedo Data Computer is also fully restored, as well as other various parts on the submarine.\nThe Cod memorial acquired two General Motors Model 248 engines that had originally been used aboard another World War II submarine, Stingray (SS-186). The two V-16 1,600 HP diesel engines were originally built in Cleveland, Ohio, the last in 1943, out of the General Motors Cleveland Diesel Plant on the west side. The engines were used for parts for the restoration of Cod's engines. Four out of the five main engines on the Cod are in running and working order, and are fired up on special events through out the year. In 2013 the Cleveland office of PetroLiance helped the Cod get 500 gallons of fresh oil to operate her newly restored engines. \"We are proud to help Cod get her engines running again\", said PetroLiance regional VP Jim McClellan. It amounts to about a $10,000 donation, said Paul Farace, president of the Cod memorial.\nThe Cod operates an amateur radio station, W8COD, and participates in various amateur radio contests and other events such as Field Day.\n\n\n== Media Productions ==\nCod was used for exterior and interior scenes in the 2016 Smithsonian Channel war documentary Hell Below to depict the USS Tang, U-99 and U-100.  Filming took place aboard the Cod in 2015. The series premiered Sunday 17 July 2016.\nCod was the subject of a two-part documentary in the World of Warships YouTube channel named Naval Legends: USS Cod. The documentary published on 2 and 4 July 2019.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\nThis article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

          "We visited here over a year ago and took this side tour of the submarine. It was fascinating and educational. The only downside is you enter the sub the way the sailors did down the hatch. People were much smaller in the WW2 era",
          "Very cool submarine and especially if you have elementary/High schoolers. Awesome learning experience while having fun. I was impressed with the sub since my brother served in the U.S. Navy on submarines. ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT was the man who apparently was the captain. He",
          "This was very interesting. We had a great tour guide and he and my husband spent tons of time talking about the submarine. He was very knowledgeable. Very small inside. A must see!",
          "Our dad served on a submarine, so whenever we get a chance to tour one we visit. The USS Cod was set up with period correct supplies, and had to be entered through the original deck hatches down the ladders. Because we were visiting On the 4th, we got to witness the firing of",
          "We've seen submarines before, but this one allowed us to access nearly every area and take as much time as we wanted to see everything. It's very well maintained and the exhibits were well-marked. It was cool to see.",
          "This is quite an eye-opener to see the cramped quarters of submarine crew, and how they crammed in so many people. I was impressed by the efficient use of space. It is very tight quarters here, and takes a bit of flexibility to get from one compartment to the next. You climb",
          "Lots of history, several sailors on site to answers questions and give insight. Tight spaces, not for oversized or low mobility visitors, however, they do have a picnic table with shade for these people to sit out while the rest of the group can enjoy the visit. The day we were",
          "I decided to go here for the other half, but was relatively surprised with how interesting it actually was. At only $12 each to get in, you could get a good couple of hours looking around. It is cramped, but it is a submarine so what do you expect? There is voice overs all the",

          "We had gotten tickets to tour the sub and unfortunately I felt I could not complete the tour due to feeling claustraphobic. My husband continued on and said it would have only been a short while of close quarters before entering the bottom part and would have been worth it. I do",
          "We had so much fun! Really immersed in the life of a sailor on the USS Cod. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes because you get to walk and climb through all the portals.",
          "This is a real World War 2 submarine. They keep the vessel true to the way it was during the war. This means ladders and tight spaces. They want the interior to look the way it did during the war. My grandparents were part of the WW2 generation and this experience reminds me of",
          "This is a great place to see an actual piece of history. It is very inspiring to see what our servicemen went through on a sub like this. The tour is very interesting as is the narration done in various sections of the sub. Access is very tight. Ladders in and out are very",
          "My wife wasn\u2019t able to go down the ladder into the sub as she has some claustrophobia so be prepared for that. However I absolutely loved the sub. The staff members telling stories were awesome. The narrated info was excellent. More people should take time to honor our veterans",

          "Very impressive restoration. Meticulous details down to the era correct canned goods. I\u2019ve been on numerous WW2 Navy Vessels and this one ranks at the top. The Veterans volunteering their time were fantastic to talk to. I hope you get your new truck Mike. Definitely worth the",
          "Had a real good informative time as they had a real good guide that explained the history of the sub in great detail. One hour well worth it as close to R&R HOF",
          "I was in awe of the history and workings of this submarine! The volunteers shared stories of the ins and outs of submarine life. I still cannot believe it fits 80 men! The kitchens were small but functional. And the restrooms smaller. $12 to enter and it requires you climb",
          "Nice inexpensive tour of a submarine. You must be able to climb up and down ladders. Very interesting to hear how all these men worked and lived in such tiny area. Veterans are around to answe ant questions.",
          "If you are looking for an excellent way to spend a half hour this is a great tour and excellent representation of WW2 history. Very friendly folks at the counter; can pay by credit card; the boat is unaltered from its wartime state and well maintained; free parking; right next",
          "A piece of history, Great place to take the children. It is amazing to walk through out the submarine and imagine all the sailors running back and forth and having to jump and duck as they go through the doorways. Just a reminder, if you do not like cramped, small places don't",
          "The submarine isn't large, but it's filled with hands on information and is well worth a visit. My young kids were nervous about taking the ladder in and out, but other than that they had a great time exploring every nook and cranny. I'm sure we'll be back.",
          "This was a main point of our visit to DT Cleveland and I was not disappointed. The sub is in great shape, and the fact that it technically could still move under it's own power is very cool. The audio narration at various points along the tour are excellent, and enhanced the",
          "Great way to teach the kids about the sacrifices submariners make. My father in law was in WWII in a submarine as a cook and this gave his grandson who he never got to know what it looked like to be in these vital ships. One of the best ways for people to appreciate the sailors",
          "You can walk through yourself, but make sure you take every opportunity to hear the stories from the volunteers on board. The most interesting was how they put this historic sub back together like it was originally. Fascinating!",
          "Historic ship displays are eye-wateringly expensive to operate and maintain. Visiting the USS COD and paying admission to ensure its survival is reason enough. But the submarine is an outstanding artifact. And with the right guide, equipped with the stories to bring the hardware",
          "Go. Tour the submarine. It was so much fun and interesting. Very clean and so interesting. Super knowledgeable staff members.",
          "This is a great attraction. The Cod is an actual WWII submarine an d it truly gives you the idea of what it was like to serve on a submarine. My hats are off to all submariners. I recommend a visit to the Cod. That being said I have to say that if you have mobility issues this",
          "First things first. It was not that easy to get in and out of the ship for a big guy. Not easy at all. They are skinny ladders basically straight up and down going through portholes. These subs were made for skinny, short people. Conditions are cramped and tight onboard,",
          "The USS Cod has been restored to the point it feels like it could set sail within the hour. It it one of the best maintained, and largest, submarines that I have visited. You will need to be able to crawl down the ladder into the sub. They have not provided an easy way to get",
          "Fascinating...learned alot. 14 yr old was totally interested. We had a great time. Cant believe, 77 to 99 men on board such tight conditions for lengthy periods of time. Crazy to witness it.",
          "We had a fantastic time here with our guide Paul. As soon as he learnt that Brian was an x submariner that was it!! We had an in-depth guide. It was fun informative and we just loved Paul. Thank you Paul x",
          "This sub was off the path but well worth the visit. This is history. Everyone should visit this exhibit. A great feel for ALL the conditions that our WWII vets served on this sub. When you visit, you will have to climb down a ladder and climb through from room to room. I dont",
          "Located close to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, this was a unexpected find. I decided to go before visiting the Hall of Fame and this meant very few other visitors at the time. This was one of the coolest things I've ever done. Coincidentally, I had recently seen \"Run Silent,",
          "Great visit to see the submarine, it is amazing to see how they lived and fought etc nearly 80 years ago. The narratives in each room are really interesting and the artifacts bring the ship to life, all the tinned foods and the story about the Italian chef amused me. The",
          "A visit to this submarine was one of the highlights of our stay in Cleveland Ohio. The 2 volunteers were ex US Navy submariners who knew everything about the sub. The submarine itself was maintained in excellent condition and the fact that you could inspect the whole submarine",
          "My husband was in the Navy for nine years and was a submariner. This was in the 80's and 90's so this WWII sub was not like the ones he served on but it was such a great experience. He was able to show me around and explain what everything was, it's purpose, and explain the",
          "We arrived at 4:32 and were not allowed to join the tour that started at 4pm. Web site said it was open to 5pm. The person that was running the tour yelled at my son for stepping on his hostas which he wasnt even close to. The tour guide was more interested in his plants",
          "The USS Cod was a real treat. The men and women working at the submarine are true patriots and are well versed in her service in the Pacific. We were lucky to visit while they were doing a reinactment of a rescue the USS Cod made of Dutch Sailors that had run aground in enemy",
          "Dont rush enjoy and try to find a mid week time the guides were great and very informative .But under stand there was no one there so we talked for 30 min",
          "I have been on lots of \"museum\" ships and most have large portions not accessible or they have been severely stripped of the original equipment. USS COD looks like it is read to sail today from Cleveland. A short walk from the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame, just past the Coast",
          "The US Cod memorial was anauthentic look back to the best technology of the day used for fighting and winning the war against the Japanese and Germans. There are self guided voice stations at various locations on the sub offering descriptions of the area being viewed and on",
          "If you're a naval fan, this is really a nice boat. Stopped in on a rainy Sunday afternoon for a look. The folks taking care of the boat do a great job! The interior is nicely done in the 40s war theme. The helm area has the authentic red combat lighting. The forward and aft",
          "I\u2019ve visited the USS COD and had a blast. If you love World War II history this is a must! It is $12 to enter and it is a self guided tour. It took about an hour and a half to go through the entire ship. Because it is a submarine I will warn that this place is not ideal for",
          "I make a point to visit this museum yearly. It's a fascinating tour. The \"boat\" has a unique history and is well represented.",
          "Went first thing in the morning and we had the entire sub to ourselves for over an hour. The veterans on site are happy to answer questions and you could tell that they really enjoyed sharing their stories with you.",
          "This is a great piece of WW2 history located just before the entrance to Burke airport. Well worth a visit and she\u2019s still in great condition after 75years. The nice thing is you can get right inside and see how the boys lived and worked. A great tribute to those lost in",
          "Was here for the Halloween special. It was night time when we went. The sub was lit in a red light. stories and information in every area of the sub. They were firing the cannon on the deck which could be heard from far away and scared me. Was not as bad in side the sub The",
          "We weren't prepared for such a comprehensive exhibit on submariner living, warfare, history, spanning many decades! The USS Cod Exhibit is a portal through which you enter into a time and culture that defy today's Hollywood/TV wartime presentations and self-indulgent lifestyles.",
          "Had some time before attending the Indians game and decided to check this out. Such an eye opening experience to learn about how the 97 men lived on this submarine during WW II, sometimes 75 days in a row...how they slept, ate, and negotiated the tight quarters. It will give you",
          "I have been on the Cod for several touching Memorial Day Services. This submarine is one of the few and the best restored submarine from the Second World War era. I have been on the submarines in San Diego. They are fine submarine specimens, but are not from that era or have",
          "The submarine is available to view in its natural state. That means you climb a narrow ladder through a small tube to get on and off the ship. As expected, the interior of the sub is tight but maneuverable. It is amazing that they could fit a crew of almost 100 men on board.",
          "We took our kids to see this & it was very eye opening. You can see almost the entire inside of the submarine & it's hard to believe that people actually live like that! One thing is that the only way to get into/out of the sub is to climb down the very steep ladders. May not",
          "We were so lucky, we arrived early and had a good hour on the submarine all to ourselves. An absolutely fantastic piece of history and machinery to see. Very interesting and the guys on shore are informative and really helpful with any questions we had.",
          "The USS Cod was one of the most successful US submarines in WW2. The volunteers have worked hard to preserve and restore the USS Cod to a condition where we can get a glimpse of the inner workings of a submarine. Great photo ops, too.",
          "This sub is amazing! There are buttons to push throughout the sub that will give you an audio tour, they have one in the different sections to tell you what they did, how they worked, and what life was like for them. It was truly amazing to get a glimpse of what life was like",
          "Great deal even if not on groupon but I couldn't figure out why they tarp it before opening. maybe to keep out the rain water or the homeless.",
          "We visited on a Tuesday morning and the sub was not overly busy. We thoroughly enjoyed the self-guided tour, the recorded information you could listen to while in the sub, and just seeing how these brave men lived while on the sub. One note-you have to be able to crawl down into",
          "We got a Groupon for this and visited after the Rock & Roll HoF. It was pretty cool to get a glimpse into what it was like aboard a submarine. We saw the USS Midway in San Diego earlier this year so seeing the comparison between a city on a sea and compact submarine was really",
          "This is pretty neat to see how the living and sleeping conditions were for the men that were on this sub!",
          "I visited the USS Cod with three young girls, they enjoyed the visit and it was a wonderful piece of history for them to experience. The COD is all original so u have to climb up and down steep stairs but it is part of the experience. I will say the inside is very tight and if u",
          "I took my 15 and 11 year old boys to this and they Loved it!! It's a real submarine with very tight quarters, but does a wonderful job explaining what the different area's of the sub were used for. The boys listened to the audios and then enjoyed being able to sit, lay down",
          "This exhibit is located close to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. If you don't like tight quarters this is not the place for you.",
          "Thos is within walking distance from HoF. It is tight getting in and out. Once inside it is neat to observe and a very short walk through if you are claustrophobic. We would recommend for a one time visit. It takes about 30 minutes",
          "Never forget - this sub tour is great for old and young alike. You must be agile enough to ascend and descend a narrow hatch with a narrow steel ladder. The enclosed sub interior is narrow and dimly lit. Plenty of photo ops inside and out. Don't forget to view Lake Erie",
          "Wow scaty to think people lived in this sub .... if your tall like 5 '8 be careful ahaha watch your head ;)",
          "We got lucky at the Cod and came down the hatch just as a very knowledgable guide was starting a tour. What an amazing history. We learned so much about the history not only of this ship but of the US submarine program. It was very informative. If you are at the Rock and Roll",
          "A unique historical opportunity that accurately depicts what life aboard a sub must have been like without altering it for tourist visits. The real thing.",
          "Fantastic day aboard the U.S.S Cod. Who need text books or google when you can experience history live. Amazing! Grateful to the men and women who serve our country.",
          "Oclaustrophicn the 4th of july we toured the USS COD submarine. It was an eye opener! I was amazed at how jampacked everything was, no wasted space. this sub was used in world war 2so it did not have all the modern gizmos that today\"s subs have. It would not be good for anyone",
          "This is indeed an Amazing experience! To actually walk through the very USS Cod! To get the feel of what these men went through. Sleeping in confined spaces so close to torpedoes, (some cots looked to be on top of them). How these men had to sleep, eat, shower, etc.",
          "Discovered this attraction once in Cleveland for RRHOF. What an opportunity! To go down into a WW2 submarine! Great audio tour once inside. Everything left just as it was so really atmospheric. Great history and you feel part of it when you are down there. Not suited to those",
          "Excellent place to learn about American submarine operations during WWII. The Cod is the most extensively restored WWII submarine left.",
          "We took our 12 year old granddaughter to visit the sub. She was enthralled by it and the fact that people lived in it, and slept on the torpedo. Such tiny spaces. Well worth the visit.",
          "Seeing a WWII submarine in it's original configuration is quite a find for anyone interested in history. Do NOT miss visiting this treasure! Try to visit (or wait) for a moment when there are not many people in the submarine since the one-way confines easily clog traffic.",
          "I can't wait to return and tour the USS Cod. Unfortunately there was a ceremony the day we went to tour the boat. We did not have time to wait for the conclusion of the ceremony and the take the tour. We did listen to some of the ceremony and it was very inspiring. We will",
          "The USS Cod dating back to 1941 and decommissioned in 1971 is such an amazing piece of history. The submarine has been beautifully renovated and maintained. Once you arrive at the attraction, the staff are wonderfully friendly, helpful and so happy to share their knowledge.",
          "We stopped by here on Memorial Day, and it was interesting. We couldn't get a Group on because the website was having technical difficulties which sucked and I was standing right in front of the Place, and didn't want to wait. We paid about 25 dollars for two People, which was",
          "This gem is worth the visit-you will get a great perspective on subs and their role in the war. Staff are knowledgeable and the onboard exhibits are interesting. Note that you will descend and ascend vertical ladders, so those with physical limitations or small children, take",
          "Decided to stop by and see the USS Cod on a recent trip to Cleveland and am very glad I did! This is the only submarine still in it's WWII configuration. This means that wearing a skirt is probably not the best option! Visitors must enter and exit using the ladders that the",
          "This submarine is still fully functional! The mechanic took us through and he explained every part in detail. He was a great guide",
          "To be honest, this had to be the finest most entertaining guided tour I have ever been on. They were actually closed and Paul, one of the awesome guides, took pity on a group of us that had shone up. I really enjoyed myself, over an hour passed while we were below deck, it",
          "It was our first time experience to visit a sub or navy things, interesting experience. Inside area is tight but you can pretty much touch everything the control panel, kitchen, bedroom...",
          "Great place to stop if your visiting and in downtown Cleveland. If you don't like cramped spaces, I wouldn't recommend it. If you're a history buff like me, it's a good time. Wonderful to see how our service members had to live for months at see, Could You Do It??",
          "This is a real World War II submarine, permanently docked on Cleveland's lakefront. No stairs in, you go down ladders into the interior and walk from front to back, pausing along the way to give thanks to those who served aboard her.",
          "The USS Cod Submarine Memorial was very interesting and educational. I think if you are a tourist it is only fair to visit the smaller and historic attractions to show your respect. Smaller as in not as big as the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame museum but equally as enjoyable if",
          "I have toured many navy ships and this is one of the best. The boat is in great shape for her age and is a great way to go back in time.",
          "Very nice ww2 restored submarine. I was only able to see the sub from the ouside and was unable to board when I went to see it. Not much else to do there.",
          "The U.S.S. Cod is a World War 2 era sub that had distinguished service right up until the the 70's. It is well maintained and very original. Visitors have to use the same ladders and hatches used by the crew. I truly liked the tour and was lucky enough to be behind a former",
          "Very interesting and very historic - from WWII. And you can go thru the sub and see just how close the quarters were. If you aren't claustrophobic, visit the COD.",
          "Near the Science Museum, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and other attractions it is an interesting stop....especially if you are a naval history buff.",
          "Being from Quebec, I have never - and probably never will - be aboard an actual submarine. A submarine, y'all! What an exciting experience, both from a historical and an adventure perspective. You even get to reenact living in the actual sub, making it even more memorable. I",
          "Not for everyone, tight spaces, if you enjoy military circa 1945 worth a look. It does establish the fact that early submariners were a very tough breed...one interesting fact, due to a treaty with Canada, the USS Cod has no propeller.",
          "there is not a lot of headroom , the ceilings are surprisingly short , but overall the tour was great",
          "A most noteworthy craft that has been excellently restored! It seems they only lost one man to an accident through the war in the pacific, but the sub took a tool on Japanese shipping. Very good attention to detail through the sub, many \u201caudio experience\u201d displays that help to",
          "This is a great stop if you have an hour or so, to really get to explore the submarine. It's amazing how many men stayed in the sub at one time. There is a lot to explore, and you get to climb down into it the same way they did. So, be prepared for some steep ladders. I",
          "We were very impressed with this submarine!! Everything is exactly as it was during WWII. To think our fathers who fought in WWII fought on a ship like this was amazing.",
          "We had a great visit to the Cod. First of all, they have a free parking lot for Cod visitors. The volunteers are friendly and both the printed guide and the audio guides on board are informative. It is really important that we all see what it truly was like for our armed forces",
          "We planned this day as a family outing and I was pleasantly surprised by the experience. Let me warn you that this is not for the faint of heart, you are literally climbing down into a submarine and through portholes from room to room. It was unbelievable to see how the brave",
          "From a distance, this submarine looks like a ship, but that was intentional, according to the information during the tour. The tour is self-guided, but we received a brochure at registration that provided information about the history of the ship and its role in serving in World",
          "Great place to spend a sunny few hours to discovered the brave and courageous man who helped save this country by risking their lives. Explore the past and see if you would have had the courage to stay aboard!",
          "Surprisingly fun. We learned so much and have a great appreciation for our navel men and women living in such small quarters.",
          "Very interesting to see what life was like in a WW2 submarine. The docents were very knowledgeable. It is very well kept up with original furnishings. We had a preschooler and elementary schooler and both enjoyed it. They especially liked the turrets and 50 cal guns. There is",
          "Great history and great experience of submarine life. Good place to visit during spring/summer. Good for kids too.",
          "Very interesting look into the depths of a diesel sub. There were recorded audio tour snippets throughout the ship, as well as descriptive placards, etc. The staff were awesome friendly.",
          "If you want a glimpse into WWII submarine warfare and just one example as to why the 'Greatest Generation' is so aptly named, a visit to the USS Cod is well worth your time. Those who have mobility issues, physical impairments, or are bothered by close quarters will find the",
          "The kids really enjoyed being able to see what a real submarine is like, from the tiny dining area to the sleeping bunks and the gentleman who told us all about how the crew would spend a typical day and what their duties would be was fascinating. A definite must see!",
          "This is a must see if you're in the neighborhood. Was a great lesson for my son as well as for us parents to see first hand how the sea men lived in \"cramped\" quarters. I believed there were 177 men living in this vessel underwater. Very, very cool experience. Very affordable",
          "This is a definite for anyone looking to learn about life on a WWII submarine. You would think that the crew had just left. Our four year old son really enjoyed it. A word of caution though, if your are physically unable to climb ladders or have trouble fitting into cramped",
          "The USS Cod is a successful submarine vessel during World War 2 and is a hidden gem alongside the Lake near the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Be prepared to climb up and down the ladder which is intimidating at first glance but not as bad thanks to the helpfulness of the guide.",
          "great site for war enthusiasts as all parts of the submarine is still accessible from end to end be prepared to climb down ladders and the audio tour is excellent. Lots of history from WW2 the volunteers have done an great job of preserving this sub.",
          "While my husband and I had toured a ship such as this before, our kids had not and we all enjoyed the experience. Our 4 yr old grandson liked seeing where the men \"ate lunch\" and slept. Those two things seemed to be important to him :) I do have to say though that the way to",
          "Ever want to see what a submarine looks like on the inside? Be prepared to climb down the ladder and experience for a bit what a real submariner felt like. The volunteers, mostly former submariners, are friendly and have lots of stories to share. They can answer practically",
          "The Cod is a great experience to see what our Navy personnel had to deal with while defending us. It is not expensive and there are many other attractions in the area. If you are claustrophobic you may want to think twice as the are inside is narrow with no windows, etc. It's",
          "We planned on our visit to the USS Cod to be a quick submarine tour...until we met Frank in the very first compartment. He educated and entertained us for 2 hours with his extensive knowledge of the workings of a submarine, the crew, life on the USS Cod, and the",
          "A lot of history about the war. Nice to walk thru the ship. The people was nice there. They was willing to answer any questions you might have.",
          "The USS COD was possibly the highlight of my trip Cleveland. I definitely recommend a visit. We were there in August on a Tuesday and it wasn't busy, but there were a few other people. The sub is docked on the Lake and is easily accessed from Downtown. It's $10 to get in and",
          "Of the submarines I've been on, this was the best one. You get to see most everything from fore to aft. Go at your own pace, some reading, and audio tours. I was impressed and had fun! However, you actually use the hatches to get in and out, can be difficult for some.",
          "Well worth going from across the great lakes area to see. This ship is amazing with animated guides who make the ship come to life.",
          "Great for everyone to see what conditions were like for sailors life during that time period. Definitely need to be able to climb down the hatch to get inside.",
          "Great history walk though on the USS Cod.On several places you find a button and it provides a voice activated narration of the whats and whys.",
          "This was a really unique experience. It was staffed by Veterans who had served on a submarine. To get into the submarine you have to climb down the same ladder the submariners had to - so you have to be slim. I don't mean any disrespect - but an obese person could not make it",
          "We visited the Cod on 09/05/2016, It was late in the afternoon. We walked through the Sub listening to the 5 presentation given at each section. If the aft bunk section, we met Frank, Frank is one of the many workers on the ship. Frank",
          "As a submarine veteran myself, the USS Cod made me proud to say I served. Tim at the ticket booth was wonderful. He spent time telling sea stories that were funny and informative. I would highly recommend taking some time to visit this beauty. Thank you to those who served on",
          "My husband and two sons enjoyed the tour of the sub. Unlike other subs, this one does not have an access door cut into the side so guests enter and exit from the portholes at opposite ends of the ship. The gun on top moves and rotates and the periscope can be used before or",
          "The USS Cod Submarine is an experience unlike any other. Because it is the only in tact WWII submarine in existence, this is a MUST SEE for anyone interest in WWII, or for that matter, anyone interested in US History, or just something fun and different to do. The people there",
          "This was such a great experience. It is amazing to see how the submarines were back then and how they worked. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. We are really glad we visited!",
          "How awesome to walk back in time through an actual WWII submarine! Very little has been done to make it accessible to the public so you really get a feel for what it was like for our sailors.",
          "Very surprising and great tour. The volunteers there are just outstanding. They are very knowledgeable about the submarine. Tim took us around and added so much to our tour. So appreciative to take the extra time to give a tour. Added to the experience! Well worth the trip to",
          "This tour may not be good for all individuals because it does not have an installed access door on the outside, as I've heard some tour submarines have. So you will need to crawl through the opening, just like the crew had to do, and it is steep. And you have to crawl back out",
          "To those who lost their lives while serving on a submarine. The staff is very knowledgeable about the USS COD and other submarines. The staff takes pride in telling the history of the USS COD.",
          "It was interesting to see just how sailors live in these tiny submarines for months. I don't think I could do it but was def cool!",
          "Great tour of a WWII Submarine given by Veterans and Audio. You do have to do some climbing and it might be difficult for folks with claustrophobia but a great look at a perfectly maintained Sub. They have a Deck Gun firing demonstration too.",
          "This is REAL! a real submarine. not something from television or movies. You really get the feel of life as it would be in a real submarine. First you have to be small. Getting in the main hatch even for a fit 5'11'' guy is slow and precise. you need to watch all your",
          "My family and I visited the sub during our vacation. It was really neat inside and even the kids wanted to go thru it again. I will say if you have a hard time going up and down stairs, you might not want to try it. I found it educational and interesting. I don't think I",
          "If you have any interest in WWII or mechanical stuff this is a tour for you. You can defiantly get a real feel for what it was like to be on a WWII sub. Now you can walk through on your own but if you get the right guide it's much better. You can access most areas on the main",
          "These folks have done a wonderful job of restoring this ship. Very educational. The tour can be taken at your own pace. The guys that were staffing the attraction were very hospitable and seemed to know a great deal about the ship. We thoroughly enjoyed it",
          "This is a great way to see what it was like on a submarine during the war. You enter and leave the submarine using the same ladders and hatches that were used by the submarine's crew. It has a deck gun that you can rotate to get the total experience. Overall a great memorial!",
          "I don't normally write reviews about attractions that I visit but I feel that I need to make an exception for this one. I had sussed out this attraction before visiting Cleveland and decided that I would like to check it out. Upon arriving at the submarine my first thought was",
          "It was really because my husband wanted to go that I dragged along, however, I too, was very impressed. Very knowledgeable guy at door. He had been a submariner. Was able to touch things and it was very interactive. Spent much more time there than I expected. It is a",
          "As a former Submariner and history buff, I gotta say this is a terrific Submarine Memorial. anyone who has an interest in the history of the Navy and world war two definitely need to visit the US.S. Cod",
          "well worth the visit very informative tour to see what life was like on a submarine during WW2 , a must see if you enjoy military history or are just curious about what it was like to serve on a sub, tour is not guided but they have audio tours in different areas to explain how",
          "Visiting the USS Cod gives you firsthand experience of what it was like to be at sea on a Submarine. I was not able to go down in the submarine but learned all about it from the guide",
          "The sub is an interesting throwback into history, if you like that kind of thing. They have buttons throughout that give you narratives, which is a nice touch. It is much better done that other sub tours. The downside is that this is a older, smaller sub. So you have some minor",
          "We had a guided tour, and it was well worth the price of admission. You don't really have an idea of what the sailors endured until you see how tightly packed the quarters are and how they maximize the limited space. Near the end of the tour (stern to bow) there is a photo of",
          "The price was reasonable and the history lesson was great. I like that you tour on your own, at your own pace, and their is no time limit. I went on a day that wasn't busy, so I didn't have to deal with many other tourists. It is worth the small admission fee.",
          "The way in and out ISN'T EASY! Even for a Child/Adult who is Young/Athletic or Flexible!! The USS-COD IS NOT Handicap/Wheelchair accessible!!!",
          "Our tour of the USS Cod gave me a new appreciation and understanding of our service members in the military. What a great first hand experience of what these dedicated members of the Navy endured for the sake of freedom. The kids as well as my husband and myself enjoyed this",
          "What a treasure. This WWII submarine, I believe, is privately owned and operated - meaning it is not a US Military installation. It is staffed by very friendly, funny and knowledgeable guys who worked / served on the USS Cod while it was still in commission. The museum is a",
          "Visiting the USS Cod is a perfect activity for any days, especially for a rainy one. You can take a unique trip back in time just by walking through all the different areas of the submarine. It's really recommended for everyone who has an interest in WW II ! You will hear and",
          "You can spend as much or as little time as you want here. It was a little claustrophobic for me, but very interesting to experience a part of history. It was very cool to see this!",
          "If you are going to the Rock-N-Roll Hall of Fame during the summer walk over and go through the USS Cod. If your a history buff you will love it. It was closed for the season but my husband was invited on board to look around.",
          "The story of the USS Cod is an interesting one and should be shared. For a very fair price you can journey back in time with a self guided tour of the WWII era sub. They have audio guides built into the ship and the crew is very friendly.",
          "Really enjoyed visiting the sub with my family while visiting Cleveland. Very well kept and maintained. We were the only people there so there was no rush! Would definitely come back next time we're in the area.",
          "My family had never been on this before, so it was really nice to see how it was for the seaman who used this sub. My family enjoyed this a lot.",
          "go just because you it there how many times will you get to see the inside of a sub also you can see if you could live in one great family thing to do",
          "Visited this memorial on a Friday evening and it was one of the coolest thing we've done in a long time. The stories are really neat to hear and the way the submarine is preserved is amazing. One of the best attractions in Cleveland!",
          "Having never seen a submarine up close, I found this really neat! It costs $10 per adult, with free parking. You are able to walk around on top of the USS Cod, as well as through the inside. There are audio tours and lots of photos all throughout the sub. Being claustrophobic, I",
          "Best attraction we saw in Cleveland. Both the self-guided tour & guides were very informative. Everyone is very friendly. Submarine is in excellent condition!",
          "Went to photograph Rhodes HS NJROTC and their Memorial Day salute, it was a moving tribute. A visit inside the sub was also enjoyable, just how did all those sailors work at sea from day to day. All vets should come aboard ~ Thank you for serving!",
          "It's across the street from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame so it would be a shame to miss out on a piece of US History.",
          "I toured the COD during my recent visit to Cleveland. It was a very interesting tour. I can't imagine spending weeks at sea in the cramped quarters with so many other people. One thing to note is that the COD is not accessible to people with mobility problems. Entry and exit",
          "As a retired submariner, from the cold war days, I enjoyed visiting the USS Cod. This boat is a great piece of our WWII combat history. She saw action, by doing its part to defeat the enemy, and survived the cutters torch, when no longer needed. Now the Cod is displayed for all",
          "Not sure what to do with a few hours before we had to leave Cleveland we decided to check out the sub. What a surprise. Watching the likes of Das Boot, Hunt for Red October, even Top Secret, you develop an idea of the submariners life, but being able to jump into their bunk and",
          "Parking is free for visitors. While admission is $10 for adults, if part of that price goes to preserving this WWII sub, the price is worth it. Periscope outside is hands on experience, as is deck gun atop sub. Some agility required to climb up/down ladders and to move between",
          "Took the tour of this interesting ship while in Cleveland this past weekend. Each area of the ship has a button that plays a recording giving you lots of great details on sub life. Makes it easy to take as long or short of a tour as you want!. Nice free parking lot right at the",
          "Great way to spend some time. I don't know what I was thinking but was quite surprised that I had to climb through a hatch and down a ladder to get into the submarine. I would not recommend that ladies take a large purse. It is an amazing tour. Hard to imagine living in such",
          "We were lucky enough to run into the skipper of the USS Cod during our self-guided tour. He spent some time with us sharing his love of the boat and extensive knowledge of its operations and history. We came home wanting to know more and have been watching you tube videos on",
          "This was easily the best attraction we went to in Cleveland. My two 9-year-old boys really got into the sub, touring the ship, laying in the bulks, sitting at the table, seeing the torpedoes, and manning the deck gun. The sub is in fantastic shape, with details galore to",
          "This self guided tour was one of the best I've done and I've toured a lot of retired military equipment. Truly amazing to see how life on a sub was like. Highly recommend whether you're a history buff or just looking for something different to do on your cleveland vaca.",
          "The USS Cod is an interesting experience because of her condition. She is the most authentic WWII submarine remaining. There are a number of other WWII submarine museums available around the US but the USS Cod is in the most authentic WWII condition. She has not been made \"",
          "Enjoyed it Jim, Tim and Darryl were excellent knew there stuff we had fun talking to them over brownies we recommend better signage to get to it so happy it was in my AAA book and we found it something i wouldnt have liked to miss very well maintained submarine museum",
          "My daughter had such a good time exploring the nearby William G Mather museum that we opted to go to the more adventurous USS Cod. It was a ball. From the initial descent into the tight hatch straight down to the torpedo room, we loved it. The condition is incredible and",
          "Almost just like the Cobia in Manitowoc Wisconsin, but no staircase to go down or back out of. You enter and exit through the escape trunks (straight down ladder); not a big deal but if you are disabled or over the age of 70 you might not want to try an entry. Boat is in",
          "Loved this. I have never been to a better subamarine/ship museum. Incredibly cool to see how our sailors lived during WWII if stationed on a submarine. Awesome",
          "Many greater Clevelanders either don't know about the Cod or have little interest in touring it. It's a true WW2 sub that saw considerable action in the Pacific. Tours are available thru the sub usually on Sundays as I recall. The tours are self-guided but there are",
          "It was a great find not really advertised around the area. Cost was more expensive than other small ship museums i have visited but its worth it and the staff are really informative. It is small so it does not take a long time.",
          "If you're a warship buff like me, you need to visit. Only submarine I know of where you enter & exit through the hatches as the did when in service. Was here as a kid, returned some 40 years later. Just wish they would let you in the conning tower like they did when I was a kid.",
          "Well worth the visit! An actual US war submarine that you can tour, touch, climb, etc. A unique experience and a chance for some great photo opportunities.",
          "Visited on Saturday, August 22nd. I was very fortunate to have met Jay, one of the museum curators, outside the boat. Jay was very kind and gracious to talk with me about the USS Cod and then provided me a tour on, and inside the submarine. The USS Cod is a marvel of American",
          "We had a great time touring this submarine. I have toured other subs in the past but this one was the best. We were given full access to the sub and could spend as much time as we wanted. I would definitely recommend taking the tour.",
          "You get to go inside and walk through the submarine. It's a self guided tour but the guides will answer any questions. You must be able to bend low since you will be going thru small openings and climbing.",
          "This was quite a find walking around downtown Cleveland. A well preserved US submarine from WW2. Very well taken care of. From the torpedo tubes, the bridge, to the top mounted guns. My only caution, is that entry and exit is by a steep ladder. Please be careful with kids!",
          "Very good self-guided tour of the old submarine with written explanations and audiotapes of life in the submarine. Squeezed in like sardines in a boat made for war.",
          "Free parking. With paid admission, you can stay as long as you wish. The staff is super friendly. There was a lot of climbing and it could be unsafe if you are not careful. There were audio displays though out to inform you what would have been done in the are you were in at",
          "Great piece of history - right on lake Erie - interesting facts and hands on pieces to read and review",
          "Just found this submarine by accident and you could tour it. It was very interesting seeing what it looks like for servicemen who have to live on a submarine.",
          "If your a Navy man like myself, you'll enjoy going on a tour through this WWII working sub. It's hard to believe that men went down in these incredibly tight spaces.",
          "I've visited a couple of submarines and this was by far the best. The audio overview provided in some rooms allows you to better understand how those areas were used.",
          "This is a well preserved submarine full of naval history. The guides around the ship are very helpful and full of knowledge about not only the Cod's history, but the history of naval warfare. It is a nice way to spend a relaxing couple of hours.",
          "45 years ago the USS Cod was the first submarine I'd ever seen. As a Seaman Recruit at the Naval Reserve Center (then one block away) I marveled at how submariners lived, and was impressed by how much they crammed into that 312 foot hull. 45 years and a full Navy career later",
          "The family and I were expecting a 10 minutes walk inside a submarine; we're we ever wrong. The good ol' Veterans greeted us with the warmest welcome. They took the time to explain everything about their sub. Duration of the visit in the end: about 1h30 min :)",
          "My family and I visited the Cod a couple weeks ago, and we really enjoyed ourselves. It is truly amazing to experience an important piece of our nation's history in such an up-close, personal way. When you take the tour you can take a peak through the periscope and hear the",
          "I went here with a friend of mine during my ongoing historic field-trip of a vacation. I have to say first and foremost, this is an EXCELLENTLY maintained historic boat. I've been on many museum ships and this thing looked and smelled as if it could seal the hatches and dive",
          "Awesome! Discount for veterans a plus. VERY tight to get into and around this sub. If you have any weight issues or mobility challenges, don't attempt it (seriously). This is a fantastic display of an actual submarine - we were just awed by the completeness of the memorial and",
          "We arrived at 4:30 and the guide said we could still come in that he was staying late. He gave us a personal tour for an hour and 45 minutes. We climbed down in the sub using the original ladders. He let my daughter try out a bunk bed. We sat in the \"dining hall\" on the ship. We",
          "lots to do in this busy little area. once you're parked you can walk to the end of the pier and around the Voinovich Bicentennial Park. And the submarine, hot guys in marine uniforms, need i say more? I was hoping they would show you through the sub, but the tour is self guided.",
          "I loved this tour. It's like the sailors walked away yesterday, everything is just like it was in 1944. Also liked that they did not cut public access ramps into side of boat. Going down the hatch is part of the experience. Not for people who are claustrophobic. Although to be",
          "This is a real ww2 submarine only a block from the Rock Hall, take an hour and go see it. It was fun climbing up and down the ladders and going through the hatches. Everything is there as it was when it was retired. It gives you a real look at how those men lived for months at",
          "Nice attraction - good for all ages. We had a great time as a family walking through the passages of the Cod at our own pace. One of the staffers was a Navy veteran who served on a sub of this type - his explanations added a lot. Amazing to see six 21-foot torpedo tubes packed",
          "I felt like a kid again climbing up and down the ladders. You can sit on the gun topside and take a peek through the periscope. Lots of cool historic information and interesting tidbits.",
          "During our visit of Cleveland, we avail the chance of seeing the second world War submarine from inside and outside completely. It is adventurous and unique.",
          "We enjoyed the couple of hours we spent at the Cod. The ladders were a little challenging for my young nephew but he was able to navigate. We enjoyed the audio tour and we're surprised by the tight quarters.",
          "Great hands-on experience. There's friendly volunteers to answer questions and audio presentations inside the boat. Be advised that the ladder wells are steep and spaces are tight. The sub is a cool time capsule to the last world war. Definitely a must see.",
          "Ver interesting to walk through a genuine WW2 submarine. Gives the impression of the scale of the vessel and the claustrophobic working conditions. Torpedoes, bunks, operations areas and engineering aspects are all on display. The kids particularly liked the deck gun which",
          "It was fun and interesting. Tall people or those prone to fear of small spaces best to stay on land. Kids love this place.",
          "We wanted to see this over 15 years ago when we were in Cleveland but there was a retirement ceremony going on and it was closed. Finally made it and it was well worth seeing! Guides are friendly and well informed having served on submarines. The displays are well done and you",
          "This is a hidden gem in the city. Kids will love being able to actually climb in and out of the sub through the hatches and swinging through the airlock doors from chamber to chamber\u2026 Also this museum is one of the most hands on military museums I\u2019ve ever been too. You can sit",
          "You can actually go into a world war 2 submarine, from port to stern. Look thorough the periscope, see the torpedo rooms and the quarters that the crew lived in while at sea.",
          "Visit this on our recent trip to cleveland. Wanted to see what it was like for my grandfather on a ww2 submarine. I can tell you if you don't like confined space it's not for you. You have to climb down the hatch to get inside. Our tour guide was amazing he was on a submarine",
          "Such a great place to learn about submarine history and experience for yourself what it's like to be in the cramped quarters - it's hands on and you can even try out one of the bunks. It's easy to get to - right off I90 - and the friendly, helpful, humorous staff make every",
          "I was most impressed with the staff and their knowledge of the Cod, as well as their knowledge of what it was like working on a submarine. They are all former US Navy sailors with time on actual submarines. I encourage you to ask any questions, and sit and ask them to share",
          "My son is fascinated by WWII so we came to visit here. The gentlemen who work here were so great! They answered all of my son's questions and talked with him for a long time. Touring the sub was neat especially when you get to see how tight the quarterse really were.I would",
          "A really fascinating place! It was great to see and feel the history of this submarine. She sank 12 enemy vessels and was awarded seven battle stars during her seven patrols. On the boat you really get a feeling of how cramped life was for these sailors. If you are",
          "We talked about our USS Cod visit all day after we went! Being a history buff, I kind of dragged my husband and son to this memorial. To say that we were amazed would be an understatement. For the tour we had to climb down a ladder, it was steep, but once we got into the",
          "Remembering the fallen who served our country at sea. A much larger wreath laying ceremony than I remember. It was good to see Cleveland's Young Marines in uniform taking part.",
          "Fun view of this US NAVY WWll sub. The guys in charge are great to talk to. Play with a telescope on shore, or mess with the 5 inch deck gun. Walk through the sub and get a hands on the subs different crew areas. Climb up the ladder part way into the conning to see the",
          "Pretty cool experience! The tour was long and very informative. Didn't even know it existed in Cleveland. Most of the tour guides were knowledgeable and kind, with the exception of one who was rather condescending when you asked questions and rude (reason for 4 star and not 5",

          "If you've seen a Sub on TV you know there are stair and hatch challenges! But it's a real Sub! Kids will love it! Someone was available for any and all questions. What a wonderful way to introduce some aspects to children. Need to be able to negotiate ladders and hatches! I",
          "I loved the tour of the USS Cod! It's a submarine that was used in WWII. Very interesting and incredible to see how our Navy vets lived during wartime. If you're into history, don't miss it!",
          "I remember visiting this as a child, and it was even better than I remember. My dad is a World War 2 history buff, so we took this trip more for his sake. He was telling me it is one of the only (or only) submarines that hasn't been modified with stairs. You literally have to",

          "I always wanted to go inside a submarine and this tour was it. They weren't very big in the 1940's and if you are claustrophobic, this isn't a trip for you but it is really cool to be on a warship that isn't a Disney ride, but a real warship.",
          "This is another stop in Cleveland that I have visited several times. I had never been on a submarine before and this was a unique experience. It is so enlightening to see how sailors live on a submarine. I can only imagine what it must be like to spend so much time in such",
          "The tour was very well done and it was very interesting. The tour guide was extremely knowledgable about the boat. I highly recommend, however, if you are unable to climb down the hatch to enter (ie overweight, afraid of heights or disabled) then skip this one because it is very",

          "Short walk from Rock and Roll hall of fame, the tickets are inexpensive compared to the experience we had. The attractions allows you to experience the submarine from inside. There are audio areas for a self guided tour. The history it carries and the stories told, salute to the",
          "I have eleven grandsons and only two granddaughters. When any of them are in town a visit to the USS Cod is warranted. Do not try to take the tour with a baby in hand. Difficult entry and exit! There are picnic tables to sit at and parking is free.",
          "Very cramped and a little difficult to stumble through - hard to imagine living on a submarine for any extended period of time. Walk the deck and see the deck guns as well. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "It's hard to believe men lived in such cramped quarters. If you visit, be sure to duck or you'll hit your head. Was an educational visit.",
          "You don't get a chance to visit a real active (in her past life) WWII hunter killer sub. Manned by volunteers and ex sub Mariners completes your experience. As original in condition as she could be without live ordnance :-)! Great fun seeing how the crew lived in a a small",
          "Ok, I am a guy and guys like this sort of thing. The USS Cod is worth visiting on a regular basis, just to savor the experience and think back to the men that served on this vessel near 70 years ago. The quarters are small, where the men lived, fought and survived. To look at",
          "while at a submarine reunion in Cleveland, our group visited the USS COD, everyone had a good time and we would recommend to others",

          "I have attended the last two annual Halloween programs and they were great. This year's program on Friday and Saturday, Oct. 17 & 18, 7 to 9:30 p.m., tells spooky but true tales from Cod's amazing history with the added bang of deck gun firing demonstrations every 30 min. That",
          "It was great to climb down into the sub just like the men who served on the Cod. All the docents clearly love the sub and sharing the history with visitors. The Cod is a great way to experience what life was like on a submarine. It was very interesting to see where they slept",
          "Interesting, but for less agile people hard to manoeuvre how did those sub mariners do it. Items on board could be explained better and better lighting as well",
          "From the time you climb down the hatch into the Cod you can imagine yourself among the crew. Loading torpedos, hitting your head on a pipe fitting just two inches above you head while you lie in your bunk. Smelling the bread baking in the galley. The audio tour is informative,",
          "Great experience. After initially climbing into this submarine, it was a very informative journey. Information stations give useful facts and the guys who have rebuilt this make sure you can imagine what it was like. I sure would have preferred the captains quarters, this was",
          "Days number six and seven of our Circle Lake Erie trip were spent discovering Cleveland. After lunch on our first day, we stopped and toured the USS Cod, a submarine responsible for sinking over 30,000 tons of enemy water craft during WWII. I quite enjoyed being able to go",

          "a must visit if in Cleveland. but its a squeeze so be prepared for a tight fit when moving around the sub",
          "The guy at the entrance where you buy your tickets could be little more friendly. Wife and I had a great time walking around and seeing this sub. They have audio buttons you press in different areas, to tell you a little bit about what you are looking at and life on the sub.",
          "I recently visited the USS Cod whilst in Cleveland and was very impressed with the whole experience. The volunteers do a fantastic job in keeping her in tip top condition,her conning tower was being repainted on the day and below decks was spotless. At each station there were",

          "The USS Cod submarine museum is top notch and also a true historic national treasure. For all history fans and anyone who appreciates military hardware, the USS Cod tour is a must! The USS Cod is located near the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and admission includes parking. This was",
          "WE enjoyed our vist to the USS Cod. This submarine is well taken care of and it shows in the volunteer crew that is aboard this submarine.",

          "Great fun for our teens,education and informative. We certainly saw more on this sub than other military boats we've toured.",
          "Very interesting and informative. Don't do this if your afraid of tight places. The audio narrative gives you an idea of what life was like on the sub during the war.",
          "This was really fun for my family. The two older kids (8&10) really enjoyed climbing down into the submarine and seeing all the different parts of it. The audio tour was really fun and they talked just like they were crew members of the submarine during World War II. We had",
          "We took our kids aged 14 & 17 and they loved it as much as we did. We were there for almost two hours poking around and asking questions. It was a great way for all of us to really get a better understanding of how life aboard a submarine would be.",
          "If you are looking for something fun and educational to do - this is it. I was a little skeptical about going inside the sub but I am so glad we did. Is it small? Yes is it cramped? Yes does it smell like diesel? Yes. But it is so worth seeing what our veterans went thru when",
          "Superb, guys tending the museum were ex submariners. yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada smells likea diesel engine on a nuke boat. heavenly!",
          "Playing with the 'Big Guns', pretending to shoot my friends was so fun topside! Going down the very narrow ladder 'backward' was heart-pounding until I reached 'below'. The close-quarters of the submarine made the tour feel very personal, and I had chances to ask",
          "This was a neat experience and I plan to take our son soon. You get to tour the inside of an actual world war 2 submarine. Vets are nearby to answer questions.",
          "My son loves submarines. This submarine is an actual WWII original. We found it on a cloudy blustery day with the waves crashing over the embankments near the US Coast Guard station. I liked the fact that you could park almost on top of the site. This is a self guided tour",

          "Neat experience! Climbed into/out of original hatches and straight up/down ladders. Have a whole new respect for those that served on submarines! Worth the 10 dollar admission fee. There was a child in front of us-about 10 years old. He was too frightened to go down the narrow",
          "I have never been down in a sub before. You really need sneakers for this stop, you want to make sure your feet are on safely on the ladder when you go down the hatch. The men that work there have a world of information about life on a sub. You can walk on the deck.",
          "we visited this USS Cod Submarine and it was very interesting. a good family event . there is a well done audio tour. If you dont mind small spaces and ladders this is a good trip",
          "This was a great attraction 10 bucks to get in butas a very nice learning experience it w now I can say I have been in a Sub. I do wish they would of had a more organized tour,they guy that was giving the tour seemed to only want to talk to the first few people on the boat",
          "This sub tour gives you a vivid idea of what being on a submarine was really like. The menus, how space was creatively conserved, what life is like on such a ship. To tour, you have to climb down the manhole just as those who lived on it did. Definitely worth the trip if you",
          "Excellent WW2 submarine museum. Hard to get into and out of as you have to climb in and out, but once in a great view of life aboard a submarine.",
          "This sub is the real thing, no hull cutouts like other subs to make it easy in and out. you want to get in, you do it just like the guys in 1944: down a tight hatch through the pressure hull on a narrow ladder. Makes you appreciate the Greatest Generation even more, especially",
          "While in Cleveland recently for some training at the world famous Cleveland Clinic I had some free time so I took the Med Line bus to downtown, got off at East 9th Street and walked (20-25 minutes) to the water front and toured the World War Two submarine USS Cod. The thing that",

          "The weather was perfect and so was my tour of the USS Cod. My guide was interesting, knowledgeable, and knew what I was going to ask about before I did. The submarine was amazing from front to back and there were many young people and children in my tour group, The grounds",
          "We took a quick stop at the USS Cod and were so happy we did. We had a tour guide that gave us the ins and outs of living on a submarine. Great tour!",
          "Can't thank Mr. Paul enough! the tour was beyond anything. The history, the stories, the one on one time you took with my boys was amazing! This is worth the time people!!!! Check it out!!! I highly recommend it for young and old. We will remember this trip! :) -P.Parks",
          "Very cool to walk through a sub that has had very little altered to it. You have to climb in and out of the hatches. Most of the vets are awesome and accommodating to answer questions. A great piece of history.",
          "We went to Cleveland for other reasons but read about this WWII submarine. It is about a block away from the Rock n Roll HOF and easily overlooked. This is a self guided tour with a nominal cost. You can move through the sub at your own pace. There are several spots where you",
          "This was a place that my husband had to see. He's interested in WW2 history and technology. It was with the trip to see how he was a kid in a candy store! It was neat to learn about how the crew would have lived their daily lives in those very cramped quarters. It was an",
          "USS Cod Submarine is really REALLY cool! To think that I have lived in northeast Ohio for decades and that I didn\u2019t discover this historical treasure until last year. Since then, I have returned to it with all my able-bodied out-of-town guests and every one of them have been",
          "My father and I arrived in Cleveland at about 2pm and checked into the hotel. There wasn't enough time to go to the rock and roll hall of fame that day, so we went to this submarine instead. Excellent tour. The sub is very well maintained and Chuck at the ticket booth was",
          "Don't miss this amazing piece of floating history. The kids loved touring the sub, using the periscope, and sitting in the seat of the artillery gun. The tour is educational for both kids and adults. The volunteers were very informative and took the time to answer lots of",
          "While visiting Cleveland, we visited the USS Cod Submarine and it was really cool. It is a self-guided tour but you can ask one of the former sub sailors if they could walk you through it (would definitely recommend). Our tour guide pointed out many attributes of the boat, how",
          "A blast from the past! in the lives of sea heroes who fought for freedom! seems to have to set sail from moment to moment! very good veterans who keep the memories alive!",
          "If you like historical museum pieces this one is great. It is actually in the water, you get to clamber through the whole sub, and the vet volunteers are delighted to talk about any part of it with you! Pick a nice warm day and you will have a good time.",

          "To go back in time into a WWII submarine is quite an experience. I brought with me an engineer who loves WWII history and he was absolutely in love. We could have been in there for the whole day if I didn't move him along. It was a special commemorative day when we were there",
          "Our tour guide who was an ex-submariner, really described to us what it was like to live in a submarine. Great tour guide, truly knew what he was talking about. Definitely something you should see when in town.",
          "We were so fortunate that a volunteer ( Tim and ex torpedo vet ) just happened to be there when we wanted to see the sub . He was so patient and explained things to us that we never would have thought of . Yes ! You may tour the sub on your own but it would not be as",
          "I went on the Sub Sept. 2, 2013 on Labor Day so it was pretty crowded. We waited in line about 15 minutes. I do not like tight spaces, but this was ok. The scariest part was climbing down into the sub and there was a narrow area near the end -- about 10' long. I just waited",
          "It was fun going down into a real submarine. The guide gave us much info about the history of the sub. This was not handicap accessible. If you are clostrophobic this might not be for you. You have to climb down a ladder to reach the interior of the submarine.",
          "My boys and I went on this self guided tour and had a really good time. The sub is very well kept both inside and out, and the audio information available by pressing buttons in the different spaces in the sub was well done and informative. Much of the sub is available to tour",
          "Our Labor Day/VJ Day visit to the USS Cod was an outstanding experience! This was a special day because they had new fuel in the tanks and fired up the engines every two hours, along with firing the 5\" guns on the hour all day. The tour was self guided, with former",

          "Great visit for family and friends. This is a self guided tour of the USS Cod, a WWII Submarine. There is no pressure taking this tour, take your time. Speak with former submariners and ask all the questions you want. Former Submariners can tour for free, and remember to",
          "This exhibit was a self-guided tour of the U.S.S Cod Submarine. The gentleman at the ticket counter made us very aware of that when we were paying - \"If you can't find the answer to a question in the recordings throughout the boat, read the brochure as the answer is probably in",
          "Holy smokes this was cool. I'm not even a fan of boats, but this memorial lets you crawl through the ship, play with the buttons, sit on the seats...a must see if you're in Cleveland. Probably want to enjoy this one from a distance if you ever feel claustrophobic, as some of",
          "We enjoyed climbing aboard a real submarine, both above and below deck! It showed us how tight the quarters are and how difficult it is to move around in. Very enducational experience. We have a new appreciation for the men and women who serve on these vessels. We salute",
          "This is not a museum. Everything inside feels so real. You get to see the submarine as it was during WWII. A very cool experience.",
          "The people who run it are very knowledgeable. Fascinating experience. Take your time to explore. Some of the spaces are more than tight so if you're claustrophobic, that might be a factor. Shows how people had to live in a very tight space.",
          "My 2 grandsons loved their unfettered access to this Pacific war combat veteran, and my wife and I were allowed to sit in lawn chairs free while they explored above and below deck. A 24-year employee who is a military vet explained to us all the markings, armaments, etc. as we",
          "We saw this walking over to the RnR HOF so we decided to stop in and see. The admission was a little steep ($10 for adults). You are able to actually walk on the sub and interact with many of its features. Getting down into the belly of the sub was tricky was a small child",
          "First I have to say it is amazing how much effort the veterans and their asociates put into making the \"Cod\" one of the city's top attractions. The level of expretise and knowledge our guide had was amazing, and I felt like I could join in on the crew after a long but very",
          "The USS COD Submarine was a great place to visit. We now have even more respect for the great work all the people in our military do to protect us and our country. We learned a lot about the way Sub operated and what life was like living on this vessel. The self guided tour",
          "Located very close to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Great Lakes Science Center and other more famous attractions, this is a great addition to your next family trip. It is a real submarine - you climb in through the hatches/ladders so not for handicapped, large or infirm people.",
          "If you are lookign to see what the inside of a real submarine looks like this would def. be of interest to you. If you are tall with a bad back you may want to steer clear however as you will spend a lot of time crouching down due to low clearances inside the vessel.",
          "This submarine not only has impressive history it's really fun to tour. Be advised, really small children or physically impaired will have a difficult time climbing down into the quarters and back up onto the deck. Little kids, big kids, teenagers and adults all enjoy this.",
          "We CANNOT say enough about how wonderful this attraction is!! There were lots of veterans there to answer our questions. The kids had the ability to crawl into bunks, sit in the mess, and check out the torpedo chambers. The story of how the USS Cod rescued a Dutch submarine",
          "Recommended for military/history buffs or anyone else wishing to experience of military history. Get a glimpse into what life must have been like for WWII submariners and appreciate their sacrifices.",

          "Definitely recommend this for people of any age. It is very interesting, as you you can literally go through it and even lay on the beds and sit at the tables. My favorite thing to do in Cleveland.",
          "Accompanied by three friends, I went to my first trip to see this WW2 submarine, docked near the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The process for entry is quick, with a small fee to enter, and a mainly self guided touring structure. We were fortunate to have one of the senior",
          "This is a must-do for anyone who has been interested in WWII submarines for over 50 years, read dozens of novels and true-life stories about them, and harbored a bucket-list desire to actually get into one that hasn't been stripped, chopped, and commercialized beyond",
          "A must see piece of WWII history. Take a trip back in time and see how the brave sailors fought during the war. This is a well kept, original sub which participated in combat. Not set up for easier access so be prepared to climb ladders through hatches and tight passageways.",
          "We were pleasantly surprised with this self-guided tour. My understanding is this is the only WWII submarine that is open for tours that has not been remodeled for tour access. You have to climb down the hatch just like the sailors did. We had to climb through the hatches (maybe",
          "We went on a Halloween Tour of this sub. The volunteers shared a lot of information about their experiences on the sub. They explained hot it operated in times of war. The kitchen areas and sleeping quarters are very interesting if you have never been on a submarine. It is",
          "We enjoyed our visit here. You get to go into the sub on a self-guided tour. The exhibits have good explanations and we learned a lot. The sub is in very good condition. Very much worth the trip. Note: not for people who have trouble getting around. Climbing into the sub",
          "I did visit on a warm summer evening and they had food and drinks outside. The view of downtown Cleveland is a uniqe look at the buildings. Inside life on a Sub must be tough. First you will want to be in small size clothes that fit. Big does not really work down under. This",
          "The USS Cod is a marvelously maintained WWII submarine. Many of the staff are former submariners who work hard and really care about preserving this ship. The self-guided tour is comprehensive and interesting, but be prepared for tight spaces and climbing ladders to enter and",
          "USS Cod's caretakers have done an amazing job restoring and maintaining this floating treasure. The tour gives one a real sense of life aboard a sub, plus a first-hand appreciation for the skill and sacrifice of those sailors in the submarine service. The guides really know",
          "Check for seasonal hours. We visited on the last day the USS Cod was open for this season. We thought, well we'll do this, bc it's here.\" Oh my, it was awesome! We don't know many, if any people who have been on an actual submarine but we recommend it. To see how soldiers",
          "My adult son and I were in town for a Reds game and were looking for a few interesting sights during the day (which are very limited in Cleveland). But, the Cod is outstanding. Visitors can move at their own pace as they literally roam the submarine. Outstanding, don't miss it.",
          "We vsited the USS Cod a World War II sub and what an experience. I have always wanted to go inside a sub but never had the opportunity and what an experience. It is in tact and just as it would have been in the war. This means that there is no fancy cut away stairs you have to",
          "Take a tour of this ship with one of the docents. They are willing to point out all of the highlights. You come to appreciate how cramped it must have been for the guys who sailed on these ships. This sub is in beautiful condition and worth visiting. There are a few other",
          "First of all, best thing I did in Cleveland. It was fairly inexpensive, I paid 6 or so with a college ID. I think I got 2 dollars off or so. It was so much fun! You can walk freely in the submarine trying on old jackets, aprons, etc. from the time period to take photos. you",
          "This is an actual World War 2 sub. I believe that it did see action. The sub is cramped and can be tough for seniors to navigate, but it true to the way it was during the war. This is an awesome educational experience for people.",
          "I liked the USS Cod because you get to climb aboard a real sub and get to tour it at your leisure. Most of the sub controls are within your grasp and going aboard it gives you a sense of how tight and cramped it must have been for the young men on board. It is worth seeing if",
          "It's next to the Rock and Roll HOF it takes no more than an hour and if you have any interest in naval history or even just curious to see how these men lived it is well worth the visit.",
          "Love this attraction. I've visited it before but went this Labor Day weekend with my almost four year old son. My son is an observer--he watched everything and everyone as there were volunteers inside and outside the submarine and was mesmerized. The volunteers were very",
          "At $7.00 for an adult it's a great deal and who wouldn't like to see the inside of a submarine. The people who take care of this boat for others to enjoy are doing a great job. The Cod has a story to tell and it\u2019s one that we can enjoy. It\u2019s kind of hard to in and out of. You",
          "For only $7, you get to go inside of a REAL WWII submarine. you have to climb down a ladder to get into it, but if you can get over that, which I did, then you will be SO HAPPY. You get to see what it was like to live inside of a submarine. It has enough beds for 97 people. You",
          "Travelling with a 20 and 15 year old is sometimes a challenge. Trying to find that certain something that captures everyones's interest is hard to find. Well, we did find it - right after the RRHoF. We walked over to the sub, paid our very reasonable entry fee and then headed",
          "If you are going to the Rock and Roll Hall of fame this is next door and inexpensive to walk on a ship that is quite famous in our history",
          "I went to the USS COD expecting the usual run of the mill attraction complete with just the basic information and limited access to the naval vessel. What a surprise! It was by far the best most complete attraction I have ever been on. You put yourself in the bow torpedo room",
          "awesome tour of the sub, so much to see and learn and imagine what it was like being a submarine sailor !!! great audio presentation in each section. well done!!!",
          "This was surprisingly interesting. For $7 we highly recommend it. BTW You must be able to climb down a ladder to get into the sub.",
          "I took my grandson to look at the USS Cod and they were closed. As he had his little nose poking throught the fence, an elderly gentleman came out and took my grnadson on board to see the submarine and guns. He was so excited. That was an experience he will never forget.",
          "We didn't expect more than just looking at it sitting there in the water and taking a photo; we were really impressed with what we got. A self-guided tour allows you first onto the deck, then down into the sub at the bow, and all the way through it to the stern - with several",
          "I've been to the USS Cod three times, once on my own and twice with school groups. I can't think of anything in the Cleveland area that equals a tour of this WWII submarine if you want to honor U.S. history and our veterans. This is an authentic experience, and as such you",
          "My grandsons thought it was so very cool..We needed to have a little more time because it was the end of the day. Next time we will go there first.",
          "What a great display of a submarime. I was a little claustraphobic but that didn't stop my enjoyment.",
          "This was a highlight of our trip. The submarine is awesome and totally accessible to touch and sit down. Our tour guide was the curator and he knew everything about the ship! I gained a better appreciation for what our soldiers have given for our country.",
          "Overall, this attraction is great! The only downside is the fact that the main deck of the ship only has a rope to stop anyone from going overboard. It's just not a safe attraction to take young kids (ages 1-3) who want to run around on deck and don't know any better. Also, the",
          "This was a hidden gem in Cleveland. It is a submarine from World War 2. It is just down the road from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. For a small admission fee you can walk on and in this awesome submarine. One word of warning though.. if you are not in somewhat good",
          "This is an interesting place to visit. I would suggest everyone go at least once. Be careful if your really tall, its all very low ceilings.",
          "We stopped by here during our recent trip and were surprised at the fun we had. It was a nice attraction and the folks have done a great job renovating the sub. We didnt do the tour as the children were a little obnoxious, but the guide was extremly knowledgeable and attempted",
          "Visiting the Cod was a phenomenal experience. Every time I have been there several volunteer veterans work to help give you a personal tour through the sub. They are friendly and have lots of knowledge and pride in the ship. It is a great experience and makes you proud to be an",
          "We walked by and decided to take a look and found it so interesting. I think it was $7 each and self guided. The submarine is unchanged from when it was in active duty so it feels like the crew have just come off and you are able to explore. Nothing really is off limits and",
          "An excellent value for the price. Self guided tour. We lucked out and got a full tour by the curator who stopped in while we were there. Filled with history and a fascinating look at life on a WW 2 submarine. Designed to look as it was in 1952. Can fill a whole afternoon if that",
          "USS Cod and personnel provide a unique opportunity to experience what it was like to serve on the most lethal warship of WW2. Restored to original condition you will experience the environment of the Submarine sailor, Crowded conditions, spartan living, tight camaraderie of",
          "My son and I hit the USS Cod during a recent visit to Cleveland. Parking is free, so make sure you pull into their parking lot instead of using one of the adjacent pay lots. We hit the sub right after it opened, and as there was a small class trip there, the volunteer's had my",
          "Near the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, this is a great lakefront pitstop for families, even with younger children. You will need some physical skills to climb up and down the inside ladders and the weight-challenged might want to stay on land instead of tackling the tight quarters",
          "enjoyed the tour. Would visit again. Very knowledgeable staff.",
          "My sister and I stopped in at the Memorial on our way back from the Air Show. There were a lot of people set up on the grounds with tents and rifles displays to show the public some of the military experiences. Then we went on the tour of the submarine. I thought everything",

          "I'll be frank: Cleveland is not a terribly interesting city from a tourist's standpoint. Sure, you can spend three days or something like that and be perfectly entertained but beyond that, you're hard pressed to find activities. The USS Cod, however, is one of the most",
          "Came here with my husband and his teenage son......this took some coaxing, but in the end he had a great time. Lots to learn and see here, nice to see so much of the original stuff intact. Nice history lesson with a self guided tour, little tight to manuver in some spaces but",
          "I was impressed with how much they left it intact. You can even aim the deck gun. well preserved and worth a look",

          "If your a history buff this is a great place to actually climb into an WWII GATO class submarine. You have to be able to navigate ladders and tight spaces to view the inside of the sub. Also the submarine is only open during the months from May til September. Check thier",

          "Took my inlaws here and really enjoyed crawling through this massive sub and imagining what life must have been like on it. Definitely a must see during the warm months. Very close to the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame, so you can do them both in the same day.",
          "This submarine gives a good idea of what it was like to serve on one of these during WW II. The vessel is even stocked with various items from the period to show how the ship was stocked. With the Merchant Ship Museum, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and this Memorial, you are",
          "Although a bit over priced - the kids really loved the submarine! I enjoyed listneing to the history.",
          "I have toured several WWII era submarines and this one is the best preserved, most original and authentic of any of them. The best part is that a couple of the guides actually served on the Cod during WWII and if you are lucky enough to get one as your guide, it is even more",
          "One would not think of a permanently moored submarine as being a destination worthy of boarding and touring. The only problem with the sub is that it is not of interest to many people, simply due to the fact that they cannot relate to it. It is fascinating in its own way, and",
          "Return at least once a year just for the reminder of the history",
          "Very interesting. Great to see how submariners had to live (exist?) in such tight quarters. Not easy to climb through.",
          "This is a really interesting exhibit. The ship has not been altered to make it more user friendly so you have to climb down the ladder to get inside. The interior is stocked just as it would have been when it was in service. If you are claustrophobic this one might not be for",
          "I jus' found it very interesting to see what so many brave men had to live and work in. Putting their lives on the line, for our freedom. Just a note, the exit if I remember was like a ladder straight up that you had to climb. You might not wanna wear a lil' too short skirt...",
          "How they ever fit in there to sleep under pipes, in corners, and forget anyone who is claustrophobic. People touring freaked out after 10 minutes in there.",
          "Wonderful piece of history for everyone to see. You climb down a hatch into the torpedo portion of the sub to start your tour. The inside is so interesting and insightful as to how these men spent months underwater. Please go see this gem!!!",
          "The USS Cod ended up being one of our favorite stops on our week long vacation. Going into the submarine and getting to see where the sailors slept, ate, worked, and hung out was amazing. It gave me an even greater respect for those in uniform. You not only go to go into the",
          "We combined with a visit to the Great Lakes Science Center. What a great experience! The submarine is as authentic as it can be. Our kids loved it so much, we went through it twice! The history is amazing. We could explore the sub at our own pace and check out everything.",
          "Climb down the hatch, touch, look, feel, open drawers, lay in a rack--this is the best tour of a ship/sub I have ever been on. You know without a doubt that those who make this possible put ever bit of blood, sweat and tears into making this the most authentic tour you will go",
          "first of all i was very impressed that the sub wasn't touched for tourist. you have to climb down a hatch to get around the boat. I felt like a kid in a club house. there are many rooms to walk into. this sub is very well maintained and very helpful people outside to answer any",
          "The USS COD submarine museum was a great stop for us while in Cleveland. My 9 yr old nephew is very interested in WWII and my 7 yr old niece enjoyed it too. However, because you have to climb down through the actual hatch it was not suitable for Grandma. It is a self-guided",
          "I didn't know anything about submarines before visiting, but decided to make a short trip out of it per the recommendations of everyone on this site. I spent about 45 minutes on the sub and was absolutely awe-struck by its grandeur and complexity. It's a real eye opener and",

          "WW2 submarine is so cool & amazing. I am 26 year old, female & loved every mintue of it. Yes, you have to duck your head, climb up & down ladders, fit through tight places but just imagine having the sub underwater moving, as you run through these small holes & work your butt",
          "If you are in the Cleveland area and you have plans to go to the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame and/or the Sceince Center, you must see this. This is a block away from both of the mentioned attractions. You can spend as little or as much time as you would like. Plan on 30 minutes.",
          "My family visited the USS Cod during a June vacation to Niagara Falls. The self-guided tour of the submarine was amazing. Reading and listenting to how the sailors lived on the submarine was very interesting. There are very steep ladders and many arease where an adult would",

          "I've been to most of the WW2 submarines still open for visitors in this country.  The Cod in my opinion is among the best persevered and most functional of them all.

          "Very educational",
          "Very cool sub to explore and learn about via a self guided tour",
          "Great piece of history that you tour at your own pace. You must be able to climb down a ladder in the forward hatch to enter the sub and climb back up a ladder in the aft hatch to exit. A rare experience to see what our veterans fought in to preserve our freedom.",

        "wiki": "Cleveland ( KLEEV-l\u0259nd), officially the City of Cleveland, is a major city in the U.S. state of Ohio, and the county seat of Cuyahoga County. The city proper has a population of 381,009, making it the 53rd-largest city in the United States and the second-largest city in Ohio. Greater Cleveland is ranked as the 33rd-largest metropolitan area in the U.S., with 2,057,009 people in 2018. A Gamma + city, Cleveland anchors the Cleveland\u2013Akron\u2013Canton Combined Statistical Area, which had a population of 3,515,646 in 2010 and is ranked 15th in the United States.\nThe city is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie, across the U.S. maritime border with Canada and approximately 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of the Ohio-Pennsylvania state border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River by General Moses Cleaveland. It became a manufacturing center due to its location on both the river and the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy relies on diversified sectors such as manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, biomedicals, and higher education, and the city ranks 31st in the nation per economic output, with a GDP of $134 billion in 2018.The city's major cultural institutions include the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Cleveland Orchestra, Playhouse Square, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Known as \"The Forest City\" among many other nicknames, Cleveland serves as the center of the Cleveland Metroparks nature reserve system.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nCleveland was established on July 22, 1796, by surveyors of the Connecticut Land Company when they laid out Connecticut's Western Reserve into townships and a capital city. They named the new settlement \"Cleaveland\" after their leader, General Moses Cleaveland. Cleaveland oversaw the New England-style design of the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on Public Square, before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first permanent settler in Cleaveland was Lorenzo Carter, who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River.The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814. In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, the town's waterfront location proved to be an advantage, giving it access to Great Lakes trade. It grew rapidly after the 1832 completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal. This key link between the Ohio River and the Great Lakes connected it to the Atlantic Ocean via the Erie Canal and Hudson River, and later via the St. Lawrence Seaway. Its products could reach markets on the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. The town's growth continued with added railroad links.In 1831, the spelling of the town's name was altered by The Cleveland Advertiser newspaper. In order to fit the name on the newspaper's masthead, the editors dropped the first \"a\", reducing the city's name to Cleveland, which eventually became the official spelling. In 1836, Cleveland was officially incorporated as a city.  That same year, Cleveland, then only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring Ohio City over a bridge connecting the two communities. Ohio City remained an independent municipality until its annexation by Cleveland in 1854.\n\n\n=== Growth and expansion ===\n\nCleveland served as an important center for the Union during the American Civil War. After the war, the city witnessed rapid growth. Its prime geographic location as a transportation hub between the East Coast and the Midwest played an important role in its development as a commercial center. Cleveland served as a destination for iron ore shipped from Minnesota, along with coal transported by rail. In 1870, John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in Cleveland. In 1885, he moved its headquarters to New York City, which had become a center of finance and business.By the early 20th century, Cleveland had emerged as a major American manufacturing center. Its businesses included automotive companies such as Peerless, People's, Jordan, Chandler, and Winton, maker of the first car driven across the U.S. Other manufacturers in Cleveland produced steam-powered cars, which included White and Gaeth, as well as the electric car company Baker.\n\nKnown as the \"Sixth City\" due to its position as the sixth largest U.S. city at the time, Cleveland counted major Progressive Era politicians among its leaders, most prominently the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson, who was responsible for the development of the Cleveland Mall Plan.  The era of the City Beautiful movement in Cleveland architecture, this period also saw wealthy patrons support the establishment of the city's major cultural institutions. The most prominent among them were the Cleveland Museum of Art, which opened in 1916, and the Cleveland Orchestra, established in 1918.Cleveland's economic growth and industrial jobs attracted large waves of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Ireland.  African American migrants from the rural South also arrived in Cleveland (among other Northeastern and Midwestern cities) as part of the Great Migration for jobs, constitutional rights, and relief from racial discrimination.By 1920, the year in which the Cleveland Indians won their first World Series championship, Cleveland had grown into a densely-populated metropolis of 796,841 with a foreign-born population of 30%, making it the fifth largest city in the nation. At this time, Cleveland saw the rise of radical labor movements in response to the conditions of the largely immigrant and migrant workers. In 1919, the city attracted national attention amid the First Red Scare for the Cleveland May Day Riots, in which socialist demonstrators clashed with anti-socialists.Despite the immigration restrictions of 1921 and 1924, the city's population continued to grow throughout the 1920s. Prohibition first took effect in Ohio in May 1919 (although it was not well-enforced in Cleveland), became law with the Volstead Act in 1920, and was eventually repealed nationally by Congress in 1933.  The ban on alcohol led to the rise of speakeasies throughout the city and organized crime gangs, such as the Mayfield Road Mob, who smuggled bootleg liquor across Lake Erie from Canada into Cleveland. The Roaring Twenties also saw the establishment of Cleveland's Playhouse Square and the rise of the risqu\u00e9 Short Vincent entertainment district. The Bal-Masque balls of the avant-garde Kokoon Arts Club scandalized the city. Jazz came to prominence in Cleveland during this period.\n\nIn 1929, the city hosted the first of many National Air Races. Construction of the Terminal Tower skyscraper commenced in 1926 and, by the time it was dedicated in 1930, Cleveland had a population of over 900,000.  The era of the flapper also marked the beginning of the golden age in Downtown Cleveland retail, centered on major department stores Higbee's, Bailey's, the May Company, Taylor's, Halle's, and Sterling Lindner Davis, which collectively represented one of the largest and most fashionable shopping districts in the country, often compared to New York's Fifth Avenue.Cleveland was hit hard by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. A center of union activity, the city was aided by major federal works projects sponsored by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 at the city's North Coast Harbor, along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived by Cleveland's business leaders as a way to revitalize the city during the Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937.On December 7, 1941, Imperial Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and declared war on the United States. One of the victims of the attack was a Cleveland native, Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd.  The attack signaled America's entry into World War II.  A major hub of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\", Cleveland under Mayor Frank Lausche contributed massively to the U.S. war effort as the fifth largest manufacturing center in the nation.  During his tenure, Lausche also oversaw the establishment of the Cleveland Transit System, the predecessor to the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority.\n\n\n=== Late 20th and early 21st centuries ===\nAfter the war, Cleveland initially experienced an economic boom, and businesses declared the city to be the \"best location in the nation.\" In 1949, the city was named an All-America City for the first time and, in 1950, its population reached 914,808.  In sports, the Indians won the 1948 World Series, the hockey team, the Barons, became champions of the American Hockey League, and the Browns dominated professional football in the 1950s. As a result, along with track and boxing champions produced, Cleveland was declared the \"City of Champions\" in sports at this time. The 1950s also saw the rising popularity of a new music genre that local WJW (AM) disc jockey Alan Freed dubbed \"rock and roll.\"\n\nHowever, by the 1960s, Cleveland's economy began to slow down, and residents increasingly sought new housing in the suburbs, reflecting the national trends of suburban growth following federally subsidized highways.  Industrial restructuring, particularly in the railroad and steel industries, resulted in the loss of numerous jobs in Cleveland and the region, and the city suffered economically. The burning of the Cuyahoga River in June 1969 brought national attention to the issue of industrial pollution in Cleveland and served as a catalyst for the American environmental movement.Housing discrimination and redlining against African Americans led to racial unrest in Cleveland and numerous other Northern U.S. cities. In Cleveland, the Hough riots erupted from July 18 to 23, 1966 and the Glenville Shootout took place from July 23 to 25, 1968. In November 1967, Cleveland became the first major American city to elect an African American mayor, Carl B. Stokes, who served from 1968 to 1971.In December 1978, during the turbulent tenure of Dennis Kucinich as mayor, Cleveland became the first major American city since the Great Depression to enter into a financial default on federal loans. By the beginning of the 1980s, several factors, including changes in international free trade policies, inflation, and the Savings and Loans Crisis, contributed to the recession that severely affected cities like Cleveland. While unemployment during the period peaked in 1983, Cleveland's rate of 13.8% was higher than the national average due to the closure of several steel production centers.The city began a gradual economic recovery under mayor George V. Voinovich in the 1980s. The downtown area saw the construction of the Key Tower and 200 Public Square skyscrapers, as well as the development of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex\u2014consisting of Progressive Field and Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse\u2014and the North Coast Harbor, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, FirstEnergy Stadium, and the Great Lakes Science Center. The city emerged from default in 1987.By the turn of the 21st century, Cleveland succeeded in developing a more diversified economy and gained a national reputation as a center for healthcare and the arts. Additionally, it has become a national leader in environmental protection, with its successful cleanup of the Cuyahoga River. The city's downtown has experienced dramatic economic and population growth since 2010. In 2018, the population of Cleveland began to flatten after decades of decline. However, challenges still remain for the city, with economic development of neighborhoods, improvement of city schools, and continued encouragement of new immigration to Cleveland being top municipal priorities. Despite such challenges, Cleveland has become increasingly recognized by national media as a city on the upswing. This trend has been accompanied by major victories in sports, most prominently the victory of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals, the first major professional sports championship won by a Cleveland team since 1964.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 82.47 square miles (213.60 km2), of which 77.70 square miles (201.24 km2) is land and 4.77 square miles (12.35 km2) is water.\nThe shore of Lake Erie is 569 feet (173 m) above sea level; however, the city lies on a series of irregular bluffs lying roughly parallel to the lake. In Cleveland these bluffs are cut principally by the Cuyahoga River, Big Creek, and Euclid Creek.\nThe land rises quickly from the lake shores elevation of 569 feet. Public Square, less than one mile (1.6 km) inland, sits at an elevation of 650 feet (198 m), and Hopkins Airport, 5 miles (8 km) inland from the lake, is at an elevation of 791 feet (241 m).Cleveland borders several inner-ring and streetcar suburbs.  To the west, it borders Lakewood, Rocky River, and Fairview Park, and to the east, it borders Shaker Heights, Cleveland Heights, South Euclid, and East Cleveland. To the southwest, it borders Linndale, Brooklyn, Parma, and Brook Park. The city also borders Newburgh Heights, Cuyahoga Heights, and Brooklyn Heights to the south, and Warrensville Heights, Maple Heights, and Garfield Heights to the southeast. To the northeast, along the shore of Lake Erie, Cleveland borders Bratenahl and Euclid.\n\n\n=== Cityscapes ===\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nCleveland's downtown architecture is diverse. Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including City Hall, the Cuyahoga County Courthouse, the Cleveland Public Library, and Public Auditorium, are clustered around the open Cleveland Mall and share a common neoclassical architecture. Built in the early 20th century, they are the result of the 1903 Group Plan. They constitute one of the most complete examples of City Beautiful design in the United States.The Terminal Tower, dedicated in 1930, was the tallest building in North America outside New York City until 1964 and the tallest in the city until 1991. It is a prototypical Beaux-Arts skyscraper. The two newer skyscrapers on Public Square, Key Tower (currently the tallest building in Ohio) and the 200 Public Square, combine elements of Art Deco architecture with postmodern designs. Cleveland's architectural treasures also include the Cleveland Trust Company Building, completed in 1907 and renovated in 2015 as a downtown Heinen's supermarket, and the Cleveland Arcade (sometimes called the Old Arcade), a five-story arcade built in 1890 and renovated in 2001 as a Hyatt Regency Hotel.Running east from Public Square through University Circle is Euclid Avenue, which was known for its prestige and elegance as a residential street. In the late 1880s, writer Bayard Taylor described it as \"the most beautiful street in the world\". Known as \"Millionaires' Row\", Euclid Avenue was world-renowned as the home of such major figures as John D. Rockefeller, Mark Hanna, and John Hay.Cleveland's landmark ecclesiastical architecture includes the historic Old Stone Church in downtown Cleveland and the onion domed St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Tremont, along with myriad ethnically inspired Roman Catholic churches.\n\n\n=== Parks and nature ===\n\nKnown locally as the \"Emerald Necklace\", the Olmsted-inspired Cleveland Metroparks encircle Cleveland and Cuyahoga County. The city proper is home to the Metroparks' Brookside and Lakefront Reservations, as well as significant parts of the Rocky River, Washington, and Euclid Creek Reservations. The Lakefront Reservation, which provides public access to Lake Erie, consists of four parks: Edgewater Park, Whiskey Island\u2013Wendy Park, East 55th Street Marina, and Gordon Park. Three more parks fall under the jurisdiction of the Euclid Creek Reservation: Euclid Beach, Villa Angela, and Wildwood Marina. Bike and hiking trails in the Brecksville and Bedford Reservations, along with Garfield Park further north, provide access to trails in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The extensive system of trails within Cuyahoga Valley National Park extends south into Summit County, offering access to Summit Metro Parks as well. Also included in the system is the renowned Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, established in 1882. Located in Big Creek valley, the zoo has one of the largest collection of primates in North America.The Cleveland Metroparks provides ample opportunity for outdoor recreational activities. Hiking and biking trails, including single track mountain bike trails, wind extensively throughout the parks. Rock climbing is available at Whipp\u2019s Ledges at the Hinckley Reservation. During the summer months, kayakers, paddle boarders, and rowing and sailing crews can be seen on the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie. In the winter months, downhill skiing, snowboarding, and tubing are available not far from downtown at the Boston Mills, Brandywine and Alpine Valley Ski resorts.\nIn addition to the Metroparks, Cleveland Public Parks District oversees the city's neighborhood parks, the largest of which is the historic Rockefeller Park, notable for its late 19th century landmark bridges, Rockefeller Park Greenhouse, and Cleveland Cultural Gardens, which celebrate the city's ethnic diversity. Just outside of Rockefeller Park, the Cleveland Botanical Garden in University Circle, established in 1930, is the oldest civic garden center in the nation. Located in the historic FirstEnergy Powerhouse in the Flats, the Greater Cleveland Aquarium is the only independent, free-standing aquarium in the state of Ohio.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nDowntown Cleveland is centered on Public Square and includes a wide range of districts. It contains the traditional Financial District and Civic Center, as well as the Cleveland Theater District, which is home to Playhouse Square Center. Downtown also historically included the lively Short Vincent entertainment district, which emerged in the 1920s and reached its height in the 1940s and 1950s. Today the former Short Vincent forms part of the Financial District. Mixed-use neighborhoods, such as the Flats and the Warehouse District, are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units, in the form of condominiums, lofts, and apartments, has been on the increase since 2000 and especially 2010. Recent developments include the revival of the Flats, the Euclid Corridor Project, and the developments along East 4th Street.\n\nClevelanders geographically define themselves in terms of whether they live on the east or west side of the Cuyahoga River. The East Side includes the neighborhoods of Buckeye\u2013Shaker, Central, Collinwood, Corlett, Euclid\u2013Green, Fairfax, Forest Hills, Glenville, Goodrich\u2013Kirtland Park (with Asiatown), Hough, Kinsman, Lee\u2013Miles, Mount Pleasant, Nottingham, St. Clair-Superior, Union\u2013Miles Park, University Circle (with Little Italy), and Woodland Hills. The West Side includes the neighborhoods of Brooklyn Centre, Clark\u2013Fulton, Detroit\u2013Shoreway, Cudell, Edgewater, Ohio City, Tremont, Old Brooklyn, Stockyards, West Boulevard, and the four neighborhoods colloquially known as West Park: Kamm's Corners, Jefferson, Bellaire\u2013Puritas, and Hopkins. Three neighborhoods in the Cuyahoga Valley are sometimes referred to as the South Side: Industrial Valley, Broadway\u2013Slavic Village, and Tremont.\nSeveral neighborhoods have begun to attract the return of the middle class that left the city for the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. These neighborhoods are on both the West Side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit-Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the East Side (Collinwood, Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy). Much of the growth has been spurred on by attracting creative class members, which in turn is spurring new residential development. A live-work zoning overlay for the city's near East Side has facilitated the transformation of old industrial buildings into loft spaces for artists.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTypical of the Great Lakes region, Cleveland exhibits a continental climate with four distinct seasons, which lies in the humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfa) zone. Summers are warm and humid while winters are cold and snowy. The Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east\u2013west from the mouth of the Cuyahoga west to Sandusky, but at the mouth of the Cuyahoga it turns sharply northeast. This feature is the principal contributor to the lake effect snow that is typical in Cleveland (especially on the city's East Side) from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, usually in late January or early February. The lake effect also causes a relative differential in geographical snowfall totals across the city: while Hopkins Airport, on the city's far West Side, has only reached 100 inches (254 cm) of snowfall in a season three times since record-keeping for snow began in 1893, seasonal totals approaching or exceeding 100 inches (254 cm) are not uncommon as the city ascends into the Heights on the east, where the region known as the 'Snow Belt' begins. Extending from the city's East Side and its suburbs, the Snow Belt reaches up the Lake Erie shore as far as Buffalo.The all-time record high in Cleveland of 104 \u00b0F (40 \u00b0C) was established on June 25, 1988, and the all-time record low of \u221220 \u00b0F (\u221229 \u00b0C) was set on January 19, 1994. On average, July is the warmest month with a mean temperature of 73.5 \u00b0F (23.1 \u00b0C), and January, with a mean temperature of 28.1 \u00b0F (\u22122.2 \u00b0C), is the coldest. Normal yearly precipitation based on the 30-year average from 1981 to 2010 is 39.1 inches (990 mm). The least precipitation occurs on the western side and directly along the lake, and the most occurs in the eastern suburbs. Parts of Geauga County to the east receive over 44 inches (1,100 mm) of liquid precipitation annually.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 396,698 people, 167,490 households, and 89,821 families residing in the city. The population density was 5,107.0 inhabitants per square mile (1,971.8/km2). There were 207,536 housing units at an average density of 2,671.0 per square mile (1,031.3/km2). The racial composition of the city was 53.3% African American, 37.3% White, 0.3% Native American, 1.8% Asian, 4.4% from other races, and 2.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.0% of the population.There were 167,490 households of which 29.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 22.4% were married couples living together, 25.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 6.0% had a male householder with no wife present, and 46.4% were non-families. 39.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.29 and the average family size was 3.11.\nThe median age in the city was 35.7 years. 24.6% of residents were under the age of 18; 11% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.1% were from 25 to 44; 26.3% were from 45 to 64; and 12% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.0% male and 52.0% female.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $27,349, and the median income for a family was $31,182. The per capita income for the city was $16,302. 31.0% of the population and 22.9% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 37.6% of those under the age of 18 and 16.8% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line. Of the city's population over the age of 25, 13.1% held a bachelor's degree or higher, and 75.7% had a high school diploma or equivalent.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Cleveland saw a massive influx of immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and the Austro-Hungarian, German, Russian, and Ottoman Empires, most of whom were attracted by manufacturing jobs. As a result, Cleveland and Cuyahoga County today have substantial communities of Irish (especially in Kamm's Corners and other areas of West Park), Italians (especially in Little Italy and around Mayfield Road), Germans, and several Central-Eastern European ethnicities, including Czechs, Hungarians, Lithuanians, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Rusyns, Slovaks, Ukrainians, and ex-Yugoslav groups, such as Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs. The presence of Hungarians within Cleveland proper was, at one time, so great that the city boasted the highest concentration of Hungarians in the world outside of Budapest. Cleveland has a long-established Jewish community, historically centered on the East Side neighborhoods of Glenville and Kinsman, but now mostly concentrated in East Side suburbs such as Cleveland Heights and Beachwood, home to the Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage.The availability of jobs also attracted African Americans from the South. Between 1920 and 1970, the black population of Cleveland, largely concentrated on the city's East Side, increased significantly as a result of the First and Second Great Migrations. Cleveland's Latino community consists primarily of Puerto Ricans, while the city's Asian community, centered on historical Asiatown, consists of Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese, and other groups. Additionally, the city and the county have significant communities of Albanians, Arabs (especially Lebanese, Syrians, and Palestinians), Armenians, French, Greeks, Scots, Turks, and West Indians.There are many ethnic festivals held in Cleveland throughout the year, such as the annual Feast of the Assumption in Little Italy, the Harvest Festival in Slavic Village, Russian Maslenitsa in Rockefeller Park, the Cleveland Puerto Rican Parade and Festival in Clark\u2013Fulton, and the Cleveland Asian Festival in Asiatown. Vendors at the West Side Market in Ohio City offer many ethnic foods for sale. Cleveland hosts an annual parade on Saint Patrick's Day that brings hundreds of thousands to the streets of downtown. The Cleveland Thyagaraja Festival held annually each spring at Cleveland State University is the largest Indian classical music and dance festival in the world outside of India. Since 1946, the city has annually marked One World Day in the Cleveland Cultural Gardens in Rockefeller Park, celebrating all of its ethnic communities.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe influx of immigrants in the 19th and early 20th centuries drastically transformed Cleveland's religious landscape.  From a homogeneous settlement of New England Protestants, it evolved into a city with a diverse religious composition. The predominant faith among Clevelanders today is Christianity (Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox), with Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist minorities.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nAs of 2010, 88.4% (337,658) of Cleveland residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 7.1% (27,262) spoke Spanish, 0.6% (2,200) Arabic, and 0.5% (1,960) Chinese. In addition 0.9% (3,364) spoke a Slavic language (1,279 \u2013 Polish, 679 Serbo-Croatian, and 485 Russian). In total, 11.6% (44,148) of Cleveland's population age 5 and older spoke a language other than English.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 1920, Cleveland proper boasted a foreign-born population of 30% and, in 1870, that percentage was 42%. Although the foreign-born population of Cleveland today is not as big as it once was, the sense of identity remains strong among the city's various ethnic communities, as reflected in the Cleveland Cultural Gardens.  Recent waves of immigration have brought new groups to Cleveland, including Ethiopians and South Asians, as well as immigrants from Russia and the former USSR, Southeast Europe (especially Albania), the Middle East, East Asia, and Latin America.  In the 2010s, the immigrant population of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County began to see significant growth, becoming one of the fastest growing centers for immigration in the Great Lakes region. A 2019 study found Cleveland to be the city with the shortest average processing time in the nation for immigrants to become U.S. citizens, and a 2020 analysis found Cleveland to be the most ethnically and racially diverse city in Ohio. The city's annual One World Day in Rockefeller Park includes a naturalization ceremony of new immigrants.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nCleveland's location on the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie has been key to its growth. The Ohio and Erie Canal coupled with rail links helped the city become an important business center. Steel and many other manufactured goods emerged as leading industries. The city has since diversified its economy in addition to its manufacturing sector.\nEstablished in 1914, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is one of 12 U.S. Federal Reserve Banks. Its downtown building, located on East 6th Street and Superior Avenue, was completed in 1923 by the Cleveland architectural firm Walker and Weeks. The headquarters of the Federal Reserve System's Fourth District, the bank employs 1,000 people and maintains branch offices in Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. The chief executive officer and president is Loretta Mester.\n\nThe city is also home to the corporate headquarters of many large companies such as Aleris, American Greetings, Applied Industrial Technologies, Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc., Eaton, Forest City Enterprises, Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, KeyCorp, Lincoln Electric, Medical Mutual of Ohio, NACCO Industries, Nordson, Parker-Hannifin, PolyOne, Progressive, RPM International, Sherwin-Williams Company, Third Federal S&L, TransDigm Group and Travel Centers of America. NASA maintains a facility in Cleveland, the Glenn Research Center. Jones Day, one of the largest law firms in the U.S., was founded in Cleveland.The Cleveland Clinic is the largest private employer in the city of Cleveland and the state of Ohio, with a workforce of over 50,000 as of 2019. It carries the distinction as being among America's best hospitals with top ratings published in U.S. News & World Report. Cleveland's healthcare sector also includes University Hospitals of Cleveland, MetroHealth medical center, and the insurance company Medical Mutual of Ohio. Cleveland is also noted in the fields of biotechnology and fuel cell research, led by Case Western Reserve University, the Cleveland Clinic, and University Hospitals of Cleveland. The city is among the top recipients of investment for biotech start-ups and research.Technology is another growing sector in Cleveland. In 2005, the city appointed a \"tech czar\" to recruit technology companies to the downtown office market, offering connections to the high-speed fiber networks that run underneath downtown streets in several \"high-tech offices\" focused on Euclid Avenue. Cleveland State University hired a technology transfer officer to cultivate technology transfers from CSU research to marketable ideas and companies in the Cleveland area. According to Forbes, Cleveland could be the next tech hub. 180 tech companies have started in the local area. Local observers have noted that the city is transitioning from a manufacturing-based economy to a health-tech-based economy.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nThe Cleveland Metropolitan School District is the second largest K\u201312 district in the state of Ohio. It is the only district in Ohio under direct control of the mayor, who appoints a school board. Approximately 1 square mile (2.6 km2) of Cleveland, adjacent the Shaker Square neighborhood, is part of the Shaker Heights City School District. The area, which has been a part of the Shaker school district since the 1920s, permits these Cleveland residents to pay the same school taxes as the Shaker residents, as well as vote in the Shaker school board elections.Private and parochial schools within Cleveland proper include Benedictine High School, Birchwood School, Cleveland Central Catholic High School, Eleanor Gerson School, Montessori High School at University Circle, St. Ignatius High School, St. Joseph Academy, Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School, Urban Community School, St. Martin de Porres, and The Bridge Avenue School.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nCleveland is home to a number of colleges and universities. Most prominent among these is Case Western Reserve University, a world-renowned research and teaching institution in University Circle. A private university with several prominent graduate programs, CWRU was ranked 40th in the nation in 2020 by U.S. News & World Report. University Circle also contains Cleveland Institute of Art and the Cleveland Institute of Music. Cleveland State University (CSU), based in Downtown Cleveland, is the city's public four-year university. In addition to CSU, downtown hosts the metropolitan campus of Cuyahoga Community College, the county's two-year higher education institution.\nOhio Technical College is also based in Cleveland. Cleveland's suburban universities and colleges include Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, John Carroll University in University Heights, Ursuline College in Pepper Pike, and Notre Dame College in South Euclid.\n\n\n=== Public library system ===\n\nEstablished in 1869, the Cleveland Public Library is one of the largest public libraries in the nation with a collection of 10,559,651 materials as of 2018. Its John G. White Special Collection includes the largest chess library in the world as well as an impressive collection of folklore and rare books on the Middle East and Eurasia. Under head librarian William Howard Brett, the library adopted an \"open shelf\" philosophy, which allowed patrons open access to the library's bookstacks. Brett's successor, Linda Eastman, became the first woman ever to lead a major library system in the world. She oversaw the construction of the library's main building on Superior Avenue, designed by Walker and Weeks and opened on May 6, 1925. The Louis Stokes Wing addition was completed in April 1997. Between 1904 and 1920, 15 libraries built with funds from Andrew Carnegie were opened in the city. Known as the \"People's University,\" the library presently maintains 27 branches. It serves as the headquarters for the CLEVNET library consortium, which includes over 40 public library systems in the Greater Cleveland Metropolitan Area and Northeast Ohio.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nCleveland is home to Playhouse Square, the second largest performing arts center in the United States behind New York City's Lincoln Center. Playhouse Square includes the State, Palace, Allen, Hanna, and Ohio theaters within what is known as the Cleveland Theater District. Playhouse Square's resident performing arts companies include Cleveland Play House, Cleveland State University Department of Theatre and Dance, the Great Lakes Theater Festival, and the Cleveland Ballet. The center hosts Broadway musicals, special concerts, speaking engagements, and other events throughout the year. A city with strong traditions in theater and vaudeville, Cleveland has produced many renowned actors and actresses, most prominently comedian Bob Hope.Outside Playhouse Square, Cleveland is home to Karamu House, the oldest African American theater in the nation, established in the 1920s. On the West Side, the Gordon Square Arts District in Detroit-Shoreway is the location of the Capitol Theatre, the Near West Theatre, and an Off-Off-Broadway Playhouse, the Cleveland Public Theatre. Cleveland's streetcar suburbs of Cleveland Heights and Lakewood are home to the Dobama Theatre and the Beck Center for the Arts respectively.Cleveland is home to The Cleveland Orchestra, widely considered one of the world's finest orchestras, and often referred to as the finest in the nation. It is one of the \"Big Five\" major orchestras in the United States. The Orchestra plays at Severance Hall in University Circle during the winter and at Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls during the summer. The city is also home to the Cleveland Pops Orchestra, the Cleveland Youth Orchestra, the Contemporary Youth Orchestra the Cleveland Youth Wind Symphony, and the biennial Cleveland International Piano Competition which has, in the past, often featured The Cleveland Orchestra.\nOne Playhouse Square, now the headquarters for Cleveland's public broadcasters, was initially used as the broadcast studios of WJW (AM), where disc jockey Alan Freed first popularized the term \"rock and roll\". Cleveland gained a strong reputation in rock music in the 1960s and 1970s as a key breakout market for nationally promoted acts and performers. Its popularity in the city was so great that Billy Bass, the program director at the WMMS radio station, referred to Cleveland as \"The Rock and Roll Capital of the World.\" From 1974 through 1980, the city hosted the World Series of Rock at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The cult rock band Mushroomhead was formed in Cleveland in 1993.\nJazz has a long history in Cleveland. Many major figures in jazz, including Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Goodman, and Billie Holiday performed in the city, and legendary pianist Art Tatum regularly played in Cleveland clubs during the 1930s. Gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt gave his U.S. debut performance in Cleveland in 1946.

Examples of these can particularly be found in neighborhoods such as Little Italy, Slavic Village, and Tremont.\nLocal mainstays of Cleveland's cuisine include an abundance of Polish and Central European contributions, such as kielbasa, stuffed cabbage and pierogies. Cleveland also has plenty of corned beef, with nationally renowned Slyman's, on the near East Side, a perennial winner of various accolades from Esquire Magazine, including being named the best corned beef sandwich in America in 2008.

Former owner Art Modell's relocation of the Browns after the 1995 season (to Baltimore creating the Ravens), caused tremendous heartbreak and resentment among local fans. Cleveland mayor, Michael R. White, worked with the NFL and Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to bring back the Browns beginning in the 1999 season, retaining all team history.

Since the city's industrialization, the Cuyahoga had become so affected by industrial pollution that it \"caught fire\" a total of 13 times beginning in 1868. It was the river fire of June 1969 that spurred the city to action and played a key role in the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 and the National Environmental Policy Act later that year. Since that time, the Cuyahoga has been extensively cleaned up and, in 2019, the American Rivers conservation association named the Cuyahoga River \"River of the Year\" in honor of \"50 years of environmental resurgence.\"In addition to continued efforts to improve freshwater and air quality, the city is now exploring renewable energy. Cleveland's two main electrical utilities are FirstEnergy and Cleveland Public Power.

From 1924 to 1931, the city briefly experimented with a council\u2013manager government under William R. Hopkins and Daniel E. Morgan before returning to the mayor\u2013council system.The office of the mayor has been held by Frank G. Jackson since 2006. Previous mayors of Cleveland include progressive Democrat Tom L. Johnson, World War I-era War Secretary and BakerHostetler founder Newton D. Baker, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harold Hitz Burton, two-term Ohio Governor and Senator Frank J. Lausche, former U.S. Health, Education, and Welfare Secretary Anthony J. Celebrezze, two-term Ohio Governor and Senator George V. Voinovich, former U.S. Congressman Dennis Kucinich, and Carl B. Stokes, the first African American mayor of a major U.S. city.Another nationally prominent Ohio politician, former U.S. President James A. Garfield, was born in Cuyahoga County's Orange Township (today the Cleveland suburb of Moreland Hills). His resting place is the James A. Garfield Memorial in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery.From the Civil War era to the 1940s, Cleveland was primarily dominated by the Republican Party, with the notable exceptions of the Johnson and Baker mayoral administrations. Businessman and Senator Mark Hanna was among Cleveland's most influential Republican figures, both locally and nationally. In addition to the established support of organized labor, the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, led by former mayor Ray T. Miller, was able to secure the support of the city's ethnic European and African American communities in the 1940s. Beginning with the Lausche administration, Cleveland's political orientation shifted to the Democratic Party and, with the exceptions of the Perk and Voinovich administrations, it has remained dominated by the Democrats ever since.Today, while other parts of Ohio, particularly Cincinnati and the southern portion of the state, support the Republicans, Cleveland commonly produces the strongest support in the state for the Democrats. At the local level, elections are nonpartisan. However, Democrats still dominate every level of government. During the 2004 Presidential election, although George W. Bush carried Ohio by 2.1%, John Kerry carried Cuyahoga County 66.6%\u201332.9%, his largest margin in any Ohio county. The city of Cleveland supported Kerry over Bush by the even larger margin of 83.3%\u201315.8%. As a result of the 2010 Census, Ohio lost two Congressional seats, which affected Cleveland's districts in the northeast part of the state. Today, Cleveland is split between two congressional districts. Most of the western part of the city is in the 9th District, represented by Marcy Kaptur. Most of the eastern part of the city, as well as most of downtown, is in the 11th District, represented by Marcia Fudge. Both are Democrats, two of four representing the state of Ohio.\nCleveland hosted three Republican national conventions in its history, in 1924, 1936, and 2016. The city also hosted the Radical Republican convention of 1864. Cleveland has not hosted a national convention for the Democrats, despite the position of Cuyahoga County as a Democratic stronghold in Ohio.\nFounded in 1912, the City Club of Cleveland provides a platform for national and local debates and discussions. Known as Cleveland's \"Citadel of Free Speech,\" it is one of the oldest continuous independent free speech and debate forums in the country.\n\n\n== Public safety ==\n\n\n=== Police and law enforcement ===\n\nLike in other major American cities, crime in Cleveland is concentrated in areas with higher rates of poverty and lower access to jobs. In recent years, the rate of crime in the city has seen a significant decline, following a nationwide trend in falling crime rates. Cleveland Police statistics published in 2019 showed that rates for violent crimes and property crimes in Cleveland dropped substantially in 2018. The rate of property crimes specifically fell by 30% since 2016.Cleveland's law enforcement agency is the Cleveland Division of Police, established in 1866. The division has 1,444 sworn officers as of 2016. Cleveland has five police districts. The district system was introduced in the 1930s by Cleveland Public Safety Director Eliot Ness (of the Untouchables), who later ran for mayor of Cleveland in 1947. The division has been recognized for several \"firsts,\" including the \"first criminal conviction secured by matching a palm print lifted from a crime scene to a suspect.\" The current Chief of Police is Calvin D. Williams.\n\n\n==== Consent decree with Department of Justice ====\nIn December 2014, the United States Department of Justice announced the findings of a two-year investigation, prompted by a request from Mayor Frank Jackson, to determine whether the Cleveland Police engaged in a pattern of excessive force. After reviewing nearly 600 use-of-force incidents from 2010 to 2013, the investigators found systemic patterns, insufficient accountability mechanisms, inadequate training, ineffective policies, and inadequate community engagement. As a result of the Justice Department report, the city agreed to a consent decree to revise its policies and implement new independent oversight over the police force.The consent decree, released on May 26, 2015, mandates sweeping changes in training for recruits and seasoned officers, developing programs to identify and support troubled officers, updating technology and data management practices, and an independent monitor to ensure the decree's goals are met. At least some of the provisions have been identified as unique to Cleveland. On June 12, 2015, Chief U.S. District Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. approved and signed the consent decree, beginning the process of police reform.\n\n\n=== Fire department ===\n\nCleveland is served by the firefighters of the Cleveland Division of Fire, established in 1863.

The current Chief of Department is Angelo Calvillo.\n\n\n=== Emergency Medical Services ===\n\nCleveland EMS is operated by the city as its own municipal third-service EMS division. Cleveland EMS is the primary provider of Advanced Life Support and ambulance transport within the city of Cleveland, while Cleveland Fire assists by providing fire response medical care. Although a merger between the fire and EMS departments was proposed in the past, the idea was subsequently abandoned.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Print ===\nCleveland's primary daily newspaper is The Plain Dealer. Defunct major newspapers include the Cleveland Press, an afternoon publication which printed its last edition on June 17, 1982; and the Cleveland News, which ceased publication in 1960. Additional newspapers include: The Morning Journal, which serves suburbs bordering directly on the western Cleveland border; the News-Herald which serves the smaller suburbs in the East Side; the Thursdays-only Sun Post-Herald, which serves a few neighborhoods on the city's West Side; and the Call and Post, a weekly newspaper that primarily serves the city's African American community. The city is also served by Cleveland Magazine, a regional culture magazine published monthly; Crain's Cleveland Business, a weekly business newspaper; Cleveland Jewish News, a weekly Jewish newspaper; and Cleveland Scene, a free alternative weekly paper which absorbed its competitor, the Cleveland Free Times, in 2008. In addition, nationally distributed rock magazine Alternative Press was founded in Cleveland in 1985, and the publication's headquarters remain in the city. The digital Belt Magazine was founded in Cleveland in 2013. Time magazine was published in Cleveland for a brief period from 1925 to 1927.\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\nCombined with nearby Akron and Canton, Cleveland is ranked as the 19th-largest television market by Nielsen Media Research (as of 2013\u201314).

In 1987, Playboy named WMMS DJ Kid Leo (Lawrence Travagliante) \"The Best Disc Jockey in the Country\".\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\nCleveland is home to a number of leading hospital systems, several of which are in University Circle. Most notable is the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic, which is supplemented by University Hospitals and its Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital. On the city's West Side is the main campus of the MetroHealth System, which operates a level one trauma center in northeast Ohio, and has various locations throughout greater Cleveland.

It runs along Euclid Avenue from downtown through University Circle, ending at the Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland. In 1968, Cleveland became the first city in the nation to have a direct rail transit connection linking the city's downtown to its major airport. In 2007, the American Public Transportation Association named Cleveland's mass transit system the best in North America. Cleveland is the only metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere with its rail rapid transit system having only one center-city area rapid transit station (Tower City-Public Square).\n\n\n=== Private automobiles ===\nThe city of Cleveland has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2016, 23.7 percent of Cleveland households lacked a car, while the national average was 8.7 percent. Cleveland averaged 1.19 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nCleveland's road system consists of numbered streets running roughly north\u2013south, and named avenues, which run roughly east\u2013west. The numbered streets are designated \"east\" or \"west\", depending where they lie in relation to Ontario Street, which bisects Public Square. The numbered street system extends beyond the city limits into some suburbs on both the West and East Sides. The named avenues that lie both on the east side of the Cuyahoga River and west of Ontario Street receive a \"west\" designation on street signage. The two downtown avenues which span the Cuyahoga change names on the west side of the river. Superior Avenue becomes Detroit Avenue on the West Side, and Carnegie Avenue becomes Lorain Avenue. The bridges that make these connections are often called the Detroit\u2013Superior Bridge and the Lorain\u2013Carnegie Bridge.\n\n\n=== Freeways ===\nThree two-digit Interstate highways serve Cleveland directly. Interstate 71 begins just southwest of downtown and is the major route from downtown Cleveland to the airport. I-71 runs through the southwestern suburbs and eventually connects Cleveland with Columbus and Cincinnati. Interstate 77 begins in downtown Cleveland and runs almost due south through the southern suburbs. I-77 sees the least traffic of the three interstates, although it does connect Cleveland to Akron. Interstate 90 connects the two sides of Cleveland, and is the northern terminus for both I-71 and I-77. Running due east\u2013west through the West Side suburbs, I-90 turns northeast at the junction with and I-490, and is known as the Innerbelt through downtown. At the junction with the Shoreway, I-90 makes a 90-degree turn known in the area as Dead Man's Curve, then continues northeast, entering Lake County near the eastern split with Ohio State Route 2. Cleveland is also served by two three-digit interstates, Interstate 480, which enters Cleveland briefly at a few points and Interstate 490, which connects I-77 with the junction of I-90 and I-71 just south of downtown.Two other limited-access highways serve Cleveland. The Cleveland Memorial Shoreway carries State Route 2 along its length, and at varying points also carries US 6, US 20 and I-90. The Jennings Freeway (State Route 176) connects I-71 just south of I-90 to I-480 near the suburbs of Parma and Brooklyn Heights. A third highway, the Berea Freeway (State Route 237 in part), connects I-71 to the airport, and forms part of the boundary between Cleveland and Brook Park.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nCleveland Hopkins International Airport is the city's major airport and an international airport that once served as a main hub for United Airlines and Continental Airlines. It holds the distinction of having the first airport-to-downtown rapid transit connection in North America, established in 1968. In 1930, the airport was the site of the first airfield lighting system and the first air traffic control tower. Originally known as Cleveland Municipal Airport, it was the first municipally owned airport in the country. Cleveland Hopkins is a significant regional air freight hub hosting FedEx Express, UPS Airlines, United States Postal Service, and major commercial freight carriers.\nIn addition to Hopkins, Cleveland is served by Burke Lakefront Airport, on the north shore of downtown between Lake Erie and the Shoreway. Burke is primarily a commuter and business airport.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nThe Port of Cleveland, at the Cuyahoga River's mouth, is a major bulk freight terminal on Lake Erie, receiving much of the raw materials used by the region's manufacturing industries. In addition to freight, the Port of Cleveland also welcomes regional and international tourists who pass through the city on Great Lakes cruises. Currently docking at Dock 28, just west of First Energy Stadium. The cruises currently run from mid-May through mid-October.\n\n\n=== Railroads ===\n\nCleveland has a long rich history as a major railroad hub in the United States.  Today, Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Cleveland, via the Capitol Limited and Lake Shore Limited routes, which stop at Cleveland Lakefront Station. Additionally, Cleveland hosts several inter-modal freight railroad terminals, for Norfolk Southern, CSX and several smaller companies. There have been several proposals for commuter rail in Cleveland, including a study into a Sandusky\u2013Cleveland line.  Cleveland was also identified as a hub for the now-suspended Ohio Hub project, which would bring high-speed rail to Ohio.\n\n\n=== Inter-city bus lines ===\nNational intercity bus service is provided at a Greyhound station, just behind the Playhouse Square theater district. Megabus provides service to Cleveland and has a stop at the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Transit Center on the east side of downtown. Akron Metro, Brunswick Transit Alternative, Laketran, Lorain County Transit, and Medina County Transit provide connecting bus service to the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority. Geauga County Transit and Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA) also offer connecting bus service in their neighboring areas.\n\n\n=== Hyperloop proposal ===\nOn February 15, 2018, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies announced that it had signed an agreement with the North Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency and the Illinois Department of Transportation to conduct a feasibility study for a planned Great Lakes Hyperloop system connecting Cleveland to Chicago in a half hour. In June 2019, Congress approved $5 million to the U.S. Department of Transportation to explore safety standards for this project.\n\n\n== Sister cities and international relations ==\nAs of 2019, Cleveland maintains cultural, economic, and educational ties with 23 sister cities around the world.  It concluded its first sister city partnership with Lima, Peru in 1964. Cleveland is home to the Consulate General of the Republic of Slovenia, which, until Slovene independence in 1991, served as an official consulate for Tito's Yugoslavia. In addition, the Jewish community of Greater Cleveland maintains an unofficial supportive relationship with the State of Israel. During the Cold War, Cleveland industrialist Cyrus Eaton, an apprentice of John D. Rockefeller, played a significant role in promoting dialogue between the US and the USSR.Sister cities\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nConnecticut Western Reserve\nCuyahoga County\nGreater Cleveland\nList of people from Cleveland\nList of references to Cleveland in popular culture\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCondon, George E.

          "We had so much fun exploring the museum!! My boys (3 and 6) are high energy and they had lots of things to keep them active. Kelsey, the education director, was enthusiastic and wonderful with children. She manages to keep them all entertained and listen to her as well. They",
          "The kids exploring the rooms seemed to be having a great time. But there seemed to be too many large strollers and adults to move around safely. I wish I could give this children\u2019s space more stars based on the amount of money poured into it. I was disappointed to find",
          "Many activities to keep the kids occupied on three floors. Dollhouses on the third floor were interesting for adults and some of the kids.",
          "This new and improved Children's Museum is wonderful. I visited for the first time with my 4 year and twin 9 year old grandchildren. The museum is totally geared for 6 and under crowd. The nine year old enjoyed the craft room and playing checkers. If they did not have their 4",
          "This was my first time here and I was so impressed. A big thank you goes out to all the wonderful donors for each of the play areas. They are well thought out, fun and the kids played forever. The free 100 parking places really add to the experience. I felt the $12 admission",
          "The facility was well staffed. The staff were friendly and maintained the play areas well. The restrooms and cafe were both well kept. The play areas were fun for all of our age range of children. Our play group of seven kids ranged in age from 20 months to 9 years old. Everyone",
          "Took my 10 and 8 year old granddaughters for a 2 hour visit. This was their 2nd trip since relocation to this fabulous mansion. They loved it! Just loved it!",
          "Although I think it would be too babyish for kids over 7 maybe but our 5 year old grandson had so much fun, we bought a year's membership. The Wonder lab water room is clearly the star of the show here but we were surprised at how engaged this rough and tumble boy was with the",
          "We'd been to the old location, but my kids are older now (8-14) and I wasn't sure this would be worth it. However, I'm really into dollhouses and wanted to see the collection that they have on the top floor here so we went anyways and my kids had a blast - even my teen.",

          "My 4.5 year old son loved the time here. It's like an indoor playground with a big climbing structure, toys, water exploration room, foam tube wall, play auditorium, and more. Upstairs is a bunch of doll houses to be seen and not touched. Cool and probably the only reason I'd",
          "Took my 3 year old Grandson and he didn't know which way to go. He had so much fun in the gerbil case (jungle gym) and they have a store area, kitchen area, doctor's office, etc. Great for their imagination. There is a screen that you go behind and other's can see you",
          "The Children's Museum offers a variety of fun activities for young children. It's very clean and the staff is great. The parents are also usually very attentive.",
          "On the first Thursday of each month, from 11:00 am - noon, you can go \"Behind the Scenes\" at the Children's Museum of Cleveland with an Adults Only Tour. Wanting to know more about the history of the building and the thinking behind the exhibit designs, this was the perfect",
          "Really great experience with our 16 month old boy today. Saw prior reviews that recommended to do the basement level last. Great advice. It's definitely the cherry on top. The main level had a huge fully stocked arts and crafts room that our Son was too young to enjoy, and",
          "From The Wonder Lab with all sorts of water play experiences and the noodle room to The Meadow, which allows for a toddler to use every one of his senses and expanding motor skills, The Children's Museum of Cleveland is a not-to-be-missed play experience for children. This",
          "This is a magical place!!! Our son is two, and he could have spent all day in the Meadow area, which is designed for ages 0-3 - it was so perfect & low-key for the little.ones! He also really enjoyed the other play areas as well - the water room was amazing, and the giant play",
          "At the front gate looking at the Children\u2019s Museum, was like being \u201cCharlie\u201d in \u2018Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.... waiting for the gate to open. Ahead is a large green space to play with benches, tables and large puzzle pieces along the way. At the end of the walk is",
          "What a wonderful museum for children! The BEST of its kind we have ever visited. We had our 2 yr old grandson and arrived soon after it opened. Well supervised in all rooms for \u201crowdies\u201d, nice changing areas, and age signing. Might max out at 5 yrs in most areas. Definitely",
          "Great new addition to the Cleveland area. This museum features the best water table room I've ever seen with many features includes ones that shoot balls with water and a vacuum wall that you can put scarves into. The museum also has a great pretend play area with areas to play",
          "The old museum was ok but the new one is absolutely fantastic. We were there with kids from 1 to 9 and all were fully engaged the entire trip. We ran out of time because the kids didn\u2019t want to leave any exhibit to move on to see the next. We can\u2019t wait to go again and I hear",
          "My grandchildren really enjoy visiting here. They splash in the water room, play pretend in the climbing areas, and always make some kind of craft. We especially appreciate the sensory room for our little autistic 5 year old who spends at least 30 min. in that room. And they",
          "We had high hopes after reading the reviews on this newly located attraction in Cleveland's Mid-town. For the cost of admission ($12/pp), we went expecting interactive, learning exhibits similar to those offered at the Great Lakes Science Center or Explora in Albuquerque, NM.",
          "Both my 2 and 6 year old really enjoyed the Children's Museum. The water room was definitely a hit with them and adults can't help but get involved too. My eldest loved making her craft (a crown) and was a great take-home souvenir for her. The hours flew by and we had a great",
          "Utter madness, but still extremely worthwhile. The play areas were incredible and well-built. Safety conscious staff were always walking around, eyes on the children and friendly.",
          "This children\u2019s museum is an upgrade from the last one. However, we hoped to see things in addition to what was in the last museum but most if not all was missing. If you decide to take your kids down in the basement first just know that that is the highlight. The kids loved the",
          "We visited this museum while in town visiting family. The kids just loved it and had a great time. They got soaking wet FYI to the parents, we had to buy them shirts in the gift shop!",
          "It is important to note that the Children's Museum just reopened in a brand-new space in Cleveland's Midtown neighborhood (on Euclid Ave kind of halfway between University Circle and Cleveland State). The new museum is awesome - my kids are on the older end (9 and 7) and they",
          "Finally after being closed for over a year, the Cleveland children\u2019s museum opened its marvelous new building!!! It looks like a fairytale castle from outside, really cool venue! Inside everything is brand new, exhibits are sure to please! From pretend plat galore, to water-lab",

          "There is currently NO Children's museum in Cleveland. One can only hope eventually they will finish and reopen the new location.",

          "I took my grandfather to an appointment at Cleveland clinic today. While I waited for him, I took my 3 small children here to play since it was only a few blocks away. My children are 5,3 and 2. They had a wonderful time. I wouldn't drive 2 hours for them to play here but would",
          "They tell you at the door that it's geared for Toddler to 8 years old. I would say more like toddler to 5 or 6. Took my 9 year old nephew this past weekend. It was ok. Don't really think it was worth the $8 admission price.",
          "We were underwhelmed by the lack of activities at this museum. Having been to children's museums in different cities, this one could definitely use an update and more activities. The plus side, it gave us something to do on s rainy day.",
          "We were slightly underwhelmed when we arrived, expecting it to be bigger, but it was worth the drive anyway. Our toddler enjoyed playing in the water table, the farm area, and dancing on the stage. Enjoyable thing to do in Cleveland, but not an all day activity for a toddler.",
          "GOOD for kids, as long as they are 12 and under. Lots to do and see. Well maintained. Educational. A small museum, but nice.",
          "My little cousins love to come and play in the sand here. Even though they get dirty a lot... but they have fun. and the water table here is a lot of fun for them... i just wish the water was a little bit warmer on the table. There is not a lot of parking space... but i do admit",
          "The Children's Museum has been a wonderful place for me to go with my 3 children. They have great exhibits where children can learn through play.",
          "I think this is a great place to take kids to blow off some steam and energy. The kids seem to love it and some of the activities are fun for adults too. I have been there numerous times and some of exhibits get changed. The price is also pretty cheap so that's always a plus",
          "We were so pleasantly surprised by the Children's Museum! TOO much to see/do in the time you can expect with toddlers to 4-year-olds. Truly an educational, kid-focused museum, our 5 kiddos were completely engaged for our entire 3-hour visit. That's tough to say of anything, let",
          "We went to the Children's museum of Cleveland for the first time on Tuesday and were so pleasantly surprised! The building doesn't look very impressive and certainly doesn't show what you can expect inside! We took our 5 year old twins and almost 3 year old. Wow! What a",
          "I\u00b4ve never been to another children\u00b4s museum, so we were very pleased with this one. I have nothing to compare it to, but our 4 yr old really enjoyed his time there, and we were there for a few hours. He loved the Egyptian Sands, a room FULL of sand, complete with sand",
          "Not worth the admission, in my opinion. Very outdated and the water play area is so yucky. A good friend of mine took her kids to play in the sand exhibit and her kid came home with a bug in her hair. Gross. I hope a philanthropist can help revive this place!",
          "Very interesting place , cheap if you buy the annual membership .. The kids are happy there Cleveland is very cold , so this place is the best for weekends and free days for kids to enjoy their time and discharge energy",
          "Nice place for young kids to have fun. Don't bring older kids because there is not much to do for them and they get bored quickly. I brought my 4 and 10 y.o. kids and my oldest one told me she doesn't want to come back and 4 y.o. was very happy and didn't want to leave :)",
          "I've been here twice so far with my 1 year old.. he has so much fun every time! Gets to interact with other kids, get involved in the different displays, learns and explores.. this place is great! There is also a little gift shop area and a place to purchase some snack items.",
          "Took six children here on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Ages ranged from 18 months to 15 years old--and they all loved it. Interactive rooms--especially the water table--kept the kids entertained. (They supply raincoats, but bring a change of clothes for little ones--the",
          "We took our 2 year old to celebrate his birthday! I'd been here as a child - but didn't know what to expect - but from the website\u2026 I wasn't expecting much. I believe the temporary exhibit is called Abracadabra\u2026 which I thought he'd have no interest in! Quite the contrary\u2026 I",
          "The museum is small but has a nice selection of play for young children (under the ages of 8). There is a great area for little ones to crawl and explore and an area for temporary exhibits. This is a nice once or twice place to visit on a rainy day.",
          "We have been to the Children's Museum many times and the kids always enjoy themselves. I do believe that they outgrow it though around age 9-10 but for younger kids it's a lot of fun!",
          "Very reasonable price. Going in it looked so small I couldn't imagine how we were going to fill the day. But fill the day we did! My boys (3 & 5) had hours of fun. They of course loved the giant sandbox (on temporary display), water table, & rope climber. My 3 yr old really",

          "We drove a bit over an hour to visit this place but luckily we had other things on the to do list while in Cleveland. While it was very clean it did not have what I would call museum qualities about it. It was like a large play area for children. The main floor that we were",
          "I've visited the children's museum once before a few years back when my son was a toddler and wasn't that impressed. Now that I have three very busy kids and I'm desperate for winter activities, I decided to give it another try. The cost of admission is very overpriced for what",
          "We took 7 of our grandchildren and their parents to this wonderful museum! WOW!! We had so much fun. The sand room kept them digging, building and playing for over an hour, while the adults sat in the sand talking...so enjoyable. We then divided up and some took their",
          "The Children's Museum of Cleveland was a great place to take our two grandsons while near the Cleveland area. They have free parking too. The museum is made for kids and it gives adults a chance to watch kids play and play and play while indoors. There is so much to do from",
          "Went there on the spur of the moment with our 7y.o. and his 6 y.o. buddy.The price was reasonable.They had a ball playing in the \"Big Sandbox\"...they probably could have played and interacted for hours,however after we left that exhibit there really was little else to do.We live",
          "My kids love it but it doesn't have anything that other children's museums around the country don't have. There should be a section that has some type if focus on the city of Cleveland. There have been talks of a new location. Hopefully bigger and better",
          "This attraction for young children is located in heart of the University Circle in Cleveland, Ohio. The admission price is very reasonable for all of the entertainment our girls got. We had no problem spending 2 - 3 hours there and the girls would've stayed longer if we had",
          "I went to the Museum with my wife, Aunt, 9 year old cousin, 6 year old son, and 2 year old son. We all had a great time. We got their first thing in the morning on a Friday. It was very clean and not too busy. The people there mostly seemed to be regulars and there was one",
          "I never like reviewing anything. It takes time I don't have out of my busy day. However, I'll make a exception for this place because I feel like it gets more flack than it should. I visited The Children's Museum of Cleveland a few weeks ago, with my 2 kids, during the opening",
          "We went with a 5 year old and 18 month old. It was fun shopping, climbing on the structure and water table. There was a little area to explain how children lived over the years with some interesting props and toy but you can hardly call it a museum. Make sure your child walk",
          "My kids were actually disappointed when I told them they were too old for the Museum, they have such fond memories. My grandkids love it. A great place to spend a hot summer day, a cold winter morning, or a rainy day. Exhibit's constantly change. You can interact or send the",
          "having been to the childrens museum in Greenville southcarolina, that was my benchmark. I hear there are others which are even better. regardless, the one in Cleveland is small and old looking and not very well maintained. we went through it in less than 2 hrs and that's with",
          "When I was small, I would visit the children's Museum all of the time! it was so much fun, and I learned so much about so many things! The children's museum was pretty much responsible for the teaching me the life cycle of a raindrop :)",
          "It's a poorly constructed playroom. In a pinch with very small children you could use it to kill some time, but the use of the word museum baffles me. Too many good museums and attractions near the University Circle are to waste time here. Move along.",
          "The Children's Museum of Cleveland is a welcome reprieve for weary travelers and snow bound locals. As a local, I took my kids to the museum for years, until they were about 5 or 6. It offers some permanent exhibits (like the farm, RTA and weather station) and large room of",

          "Certainly recommend this awesome fun paxked eduxational and hifhly entertaining place! There is so much to do and learn! We're definitely going over and over again! If we lived in Ohio we'd have definitely gone for a membership. The sandasaurus exhibit is great where kids can",
          "We recently visited the museum with my 3 year old and 3 month old children. It was a great place for a cold snowy day. I question the use of the term \"museum\" as it was more like a giant indoor play area, but it was great for the three year old. There was an RTA bus and a car",
          "As a child, I myself grew up with a many play dates spent in the Childrens museum, so when I learned that I would become a parent, I knew right away that I wanted to share this special place with my child. My son was weeks old his first time there. He is now 4 and in love with",
          "We took our 16 month old grandson to the museum. First, there was no way to take a stroller from one floor to the next without dragging it up and down the stairs. Second, although our grandson had fun, there was very little for him to do, the place was dirty, the older kids were",
          "The museum kept our 2 and 4 year old grandsons happy for hours. There are learning tools and climbing areas and a water area which enthralled the two year old. Conestoga wagon and pioneer activities, drive a bus, drive a boat, oar a canoe, play with babies and the hit for both",
          "I remember when this location housed the Howard Johnson Hotel back in the 70's and often wondered why they never changed the color surrounding the office. I still don't but it's perfect for what's inside. The museum is set up to keep children and their parents interested for",
          "The museum has loads of activities that kids can become engaged in. There is now a special exhibit about what people did and how they did them when they arrived in America. Although children may not understand the concept of time/history, the activities are interesting for",

          "My kid had a good time, but I wasn't impressed. It was kind of pricey for my family of 3 to get in. There's not much to do. The place seemed a little run down. I've been to lots of other children's museums in different cities and this is by far the worst.",
          "I was very excited to take my young nieces to the Children's Museum. I have been to other child-oriented learning places and have been impressed. However, this was dirty, small, old, outdated...everything but the gift shop was so worn out and dirty I felt like the kids were",
          "Not as large as I thought it would be. And the some of the staff members weren't exactly friendly. It has a cute little snack area (including silk chocolate soy...yum) made especially for short people and three floors of rooms built like a small town i.e doctors office, city",

          "I was sad when I visited the Childrens Museum. I have been to Cosi centers and other equal places. I have never left those places feeling like I was just in a germ fest. I am generally not overprotective of my daughter and germs, but this place was icky. Lots of stuffed animals,",
          "The museum is best for children under 6. This place could be really great if they could make improvements. They have several different toy centers, one is a house filled with babies and kitchen for playing house, a grocery store for shopping, water play area etc.. The toys are",
          "I thought the museum was too hyped up for what it was. The main part of the museum was a \"play town\" where kids can visit the doctor, grocery store, daycare, etc. Really? This is our real day, I don't need to pay admission so my kid can \"play\" grocery store. Another",
          "This is a great place to take young children. My children loved going to the children's museum when they were younger. Lots of different activities and opportunities for imaginative play. It's a smaller space than some other children's museums, but they make the most of the",

          "I walked in with my twin boys and was immedietly blown away by the stench of bleach. I just had a feeling that my kids would walk out of there with something that they didn't have when they entered (if you know what I mean). If you don't care about the general feeling of",
          "This is a great museum for children under the age of 8. there is nothing for adults to do but if you are interactive with your children you will have a great time working with them on the exhibits. parking is bear because this museum is located in the heart of cleveland, you",
          "This is not a museum. It's a glorified indoor playground that is in fact very dirty and shoddy. The parking lot is small and full of potholes. It's pricey-$7 or $8 a kid, and extra if you want to do any art stuff. We were hugely disappointed. We will not be returning.",
          "This museum is expensive yet the whole place is dingy and not well cared for at all. I have been to other children's museums in other states and they have been much nicer. What are they doing with all the monies from the admission fee. The toys were dirty and many of the",

          "This is a nice little museum. Could be in a better area and have more exhibits.",
          "My daughter loved this place. It was very hands on. We spent all day here and she never got bored. I think it's a place for a 5 year old and under....maybe 6.",
          "We haven't been in years, but my children loved this place when they were 3-5. Any older and it's just too small and boring for them.",
          "I took my 1 year old to The Children's Museum last fall. I was not overly impressed with the place but she seemed to have a nice time. The basement is an elaborate water table. It was so high off the ground my daughter couldn't reach it. The middle floor was nice but extremely",
          "I bring my 3 youngest cousins to the museum about once a month. They are 4, 6, and 8. As a teacher, I love the fact that they are learning by playing. Its like giving them hidden vegetables in cake. This is definitely a hands on place! My cousins hate going to regular museums",
          "We were in Cleveland and needed something to do before we could check into our hotel room. I found a site on my smartphone that listed children's attractions and the description sounded like a good fit for my two-year-old son. I wish I had read these reviews and stayed away.",
          "I have a three yr old son and we couldn't drag him away when it was time to go. It isn't your traditional museum setting, but I've never been to a children's museum that is. I think that while others claim there isn't any learning going on here, my son experienced a great deal",
          "Had a great time at the children's museum! so much for the little ones to do and play with. Everything is hands on and kids could explore on their own. Spent about 3 hours and that was more than enough to see the whole place. We also participated in one of the programs and",
          "We were very excited to go to the Cleveland Children's Museum after lookig at the website. What a disappoinment when we actually arrived. For the pricey cost of $7 per person, what we got were a bunch of dirty garage sale toys in dirty rooms with peeling paint and chipped walls.",

          "To call this place a museum is a complete stretch of the imagination. It's a playground for kids... and not a very clean one at that. The $7.00 per person fee is way overpriced for this place. There is no learning going on here whatsoever.",

          "A great place for children off all ages. My sons, ages 6, 3, and 2 found something to enjoy. The cost was only $5 per person which is pennies for a couple hours of fun."

        "wiki": "The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (RRHOF) is a museum and hall of fame located in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States, on the shore of Lake Erie. The museum documents the history of rock music and the artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have influenced its development.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Ahmet Ertegun, founder and chairman of Atlantic Records. After a long search for the right city, Cleveland was chosen in 1986 as the Hall of Fame's permanent home. Architect I. M. Pei designed the new museum, and it was dedicated on September 1, 1995.\n\n\n== Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation ==\nThe RRHOF Foundation was established in 1983 by Ahmet Ertegun, who assembled a team that included Rolling Stone publisher Jann S. Wenner, record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods, and attorneys Allen Grubman and Suzan Evans. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of Bill Haley and American Bandstand), Memphis (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records), Detroit (home of Motown Records), Cincinnati (home of King Records), New York City, and Cleveland.Cleveland lobbied for the museum, with civic leaders in Cleveland pledging $65 million in public money to fund the construction, and citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term \"rock and roll\" and heavily promoted the new genre\u2014and that Cleveland was the location of Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball, often credited as the first major rock and roll concert. Freed was also a member of the hall of fame's inaugural class of inductees in 1986. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, including David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush among many others.Cleveland business leaders and media companies organized a petition demonstrating the city's support that was signed by 600,000 Northeast Ohio residents, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 USA Today poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Author Peter Guralnick said the hall should have been located in Memphis in a 2016 interview. Cleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As The Plain Dealer music critic Michael Norman noted, \"It was $65 million ... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money.\"\nDuring early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered a site along the Cuyahoga River in downtown Cleveland. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium. At one point in the planning phase, when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200 ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162 ft (49 m) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2).\n\n\n== RRHOF and Museum building ==\nThe groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Billy Joel, Sam Phillips, Ruth Brown, Sam Moore of Sam and Dave, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum all appeared at the groundbreaking.The museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at Cleveland Stadium. It featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.In addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.Since 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986\u201392, 1994\u201396, 1998\u20132008, 2010\u201311, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and five times in the hall of fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018). As of 2018, the induction ceremonies alternate each year between New York and Cleveland.The 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a public\u2013private partnership between the City of Cleveland, the State of Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies at Public Hall.Millions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in the events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.\n\n\n=== Layout ===\n\nThere are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm & blues and folk, country and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London, Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, hip hop music, Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes a theatre that features films on various subjects such as American Bandstand.The first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called \"Backstage Stories.\" The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips and the evolution of audio technology.Visitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes \"The Power of Rock Experience,\" which includes one of Jonathan Demme's final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies. Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.Finally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, the Grateful Dead, Bruce Springsteen, Women Who Rock, and the Rolling Stones.\nCleveland area musicians/bands who have performed at the Hall of Fame include The Pretenders (with Chrissie Hynde from Akron) in 1995 at the Hall's opening (they performed \"My City Was Gone\"), James Gang (with Joe Walsh) in 2001, Foo Fighters (with Warren-native Dave Grohl) in 2001, Velvet Revolver (with one-time Cleveland resident Scott Weiland) in 2007, The Raspberries in 2009, Bobby Womack in 2009, and Machine Gun Kelly in 2014.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nDesigned by I. M. Pei and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. It is a combination of geometric forms and cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass \"tent\" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.\nThe building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a caf\u00e9.\n\"In designing this building,\" Pei said, \"it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.\"\n\n\n=== New York City Annex ===\n\nIn 2006, the RRHOF partnered with three entertainment production companies to create a branch museum in New York City. On November 18, 2008, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Annex NYC opened in Manhattan's SoHo district. Located at 76 Mercer Street just off Broadway, the Annex occupied an underground space of 25,000 square feet. The branch museum operated in much the same way as its Cleveland parent, featuring archetypal display pieces like Prince's coat from Purple Rain, David Byrne's \"big suit\" from Stop Making Sense, and Elvis Presley's motorcycle jacket and his Bible. But from its start the Annex also had a distinct New York area focus that made plenty of space for big items like the phone booth from CBGB, layered thick with band stickers over the decades; Bruce Springsteen's own 1957 Chevrolet; a special gallery reserved for the city's musicians; and an intricate 26-foot scale model of Manhattan highlighting sites of rock history.Jann Wenner served as chairman of the board of the Annex. At its opening night gala, he inadvertently created a controversy after he told a reporter, \"One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place.\" He later expressed regret for his remark which he said had been misconstrued, and clarified that \"I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.\"The Annex closed on January 3, 2010, its quick demise reportedly due to the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 and a subsequent downturn in the city's tourism. The museum closed with a final major exhibition on John Lennon and his years in New York City.\n\n\n== Exhibit history ==\nSince 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.\nThe museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965\u20131969. It included memorabilia from numerous artists including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as items related to the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and 1969's Woodstock.That exhibit was followed by Elvis is in the Building, which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley\u2014the \"King of Rock and Roll\" and the first inductee into the RRHOF, in 1986. Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career.  Next, the museum curated Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story. That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by Rock Style, an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, from Ray Charles to David Bowie and from Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, Rock Style traveled to other museums in the U.S.\nOther temporary exhibits have included Lennon: His Life and Work, which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2 and then Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection. A major exhibition titled Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics was on display during the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland.Other large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash), the Doors (Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors), the Who's Tommy (Tommy: The Amazing Journey), and Bruce Springsteen (From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. A major temporary exhibit in 2017 told the story and impact of Rolling Stone magazine.The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock's 40th and 50th anniversaries, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Motown's 50th anniversary, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, John Mellencamp, and Geddy Lee's basses.\nThe museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Linda McCartney, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford, and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.\n\n\n=== Public programs ===\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll.\nEvery February, the museum celebrates Black History Month by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.\nAnother program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl \"DMC\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Martha Reeves, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Mary Wilson of the Supremes, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, Dennis Edwards of the Temptations, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane.\nA similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.\nThe American Music Masters series began in 1996 with Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008), Janis Joplin (2009), Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011), Chuck Berry (2012), The Everly Brothers (2014) and Johnny Cash (2017). In 2019, the concert series' format was retooled and the event was renamed the Rock Hall Honors, in which the honored performer is joined in concert by guests of their choice. The first Rock Hall Honors concert, featuring Mavis Staples, was performed in Cleveland in September 2019.The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame won the 2020 Webby People\u2019s Voice Award for Cultural Institution in the category Web.\n\n\n=== Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll ===\n\nHall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with \"the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts\", created an unordered list of  \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\". The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995. It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The oldest song on the list is \"Wabash Cannonball\", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 160 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as \"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\". The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley's \"Crazy\" and My Chemical Romance's \"Welcome to the Black Parade\", both released in 2006. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 660-song list, with eight songs each.\n\n\n==== Artists with four or more songs ====\n\n\n=== 25th anniversary concert ===\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Simon & Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony & the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.\n\n\n== Inductees ==\n\nArtists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years.\nGenerally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters.\nThe first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences, John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.\n\n\n=== Performers ===\nA nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the \"Performers\" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly 500 experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. Block approval voting is used, with those nominees who receive the most votes being inducted, subject to a minimum of 50% approval. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.In 2012, six additional groups, the Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Crickets, were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. \"There was a lot of discussion about this,\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question \u2013 it was so long ago ... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\"\n\n\n=== Early Influences ===\nEarly Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily country, folk, jazz, and blues, whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny & The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musicians Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the \"rock era\".\n\n\n=== Ahmet Ertegun Award for Lifetime Achievement ===\nFormerly the \"Non-Performers\" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters and music journalists. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.\n\n\n=== Award for Musical Excellence ===\nFormerly the \"Sidemen\" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the \"Award for Musical Excellence\" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, \"This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.\"\n\n\n== Library and archives ==\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's Campus District.\nThe Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.\nThe library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.\nThe archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founders Jann Wenner and Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that \"At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today.\" Sister Rosetta Tharpe is often considered \"The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock & Roll\", but was not chosen for induction until 2017. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the \"Hall of Lame\".There was also criticism of the opacity in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of The New York Times wrote:\n\nWith fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders \u2013 and committee members say they want to keep it that way.\nJon Landau, the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. \"We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room.\"According to Fox News, petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all. The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres. According to author Brett Milano in 2007, \"entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, '60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and a whole lot of black music.\"Another criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted. A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted, although the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped. The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.Members of the British punk rock band The Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \"a piss stain\" and \"urine in wine.\"In BBC Radio 6 Music's Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, the singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, \"Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth's part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.\" In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%. Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which 61 have been women.2016 inductee Steve Miller directed a litany of complaints at the hall, both during his induction speech and, especially, in interviews after it. His criticisms included his opinions that there is a general lack of female inductees, that there is not enough support by the hall for music education, and that inductees are treated poorly at the award ceremony.In 2018, Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden criticized the Hall of Fame by calling it \"an utter and complete load of bollocks ... run by a bunch of sanctimonious bloody Americans who wouldn\u2019t know rock 'n' roll if it hit them in the face.\" Dickinson has also expressed an overall distaste for the Hall of Fame entity, arguing that \"if you put [music] in a museum, then it's dead.\" Iron Maiden had been eligible for induction since 2004. Hard rock and heavy metal website Blabbermouth.net observed how it had taken Kiss 15 years to be inducted and Deep Purple 23 years. Regarding his band's non-induction into the Hall, Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill stated in a 2019 interview, \"I don't think they like heavy metal music in general.\"  In 2018, when British rock band Dire Straits were inducted, Grammy award winner and band leader Mark Knopfler did not attend the ceremony and offered no official explanation.  Several people criticized the 2020 nominations because Dave Matthews Band were not part of the class, despite them topping the fan vote.\n\n\n=== Dave Clark Five ===\nOn March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article claiming that the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say that Jann Wenner availed himself of a technicality on the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt \"we couldn't go another year without a rap act.\"The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation responded \"There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.\" The Dave Clark Five was subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.\n\n\n=== The Monkees ===\nIn June 2007, Monkee Peter Tork complained to the New York Post that Wenner had blackballed the Monkees, commenting:\n\n[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, \"What's the big deal? Everybody else does it.\" [Uses studio artists or backing bands.] Nobody cares now except him. He feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007.\nIn a Facebook post, fellow Monkee Michael Nesmith stated that he did not know if the Monkees belonged in the Hall of Fame because he could only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and went on to say: \"I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.\"Various magazines and news outlets, such as Time, NPR radio, The Christian Science Monitor, Goldmine magazine, Yahoo Music and MSNBC have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees\nList of music museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

      "name": "West Side Market",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The West Side Market is the oldest operating indoor/outdoor market space in Cleveland, Ohio. It is located at the corner of West 25th Street and Lorain Avenue in the Ohio City neighborhood. On December 18, 1973, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe market began operating in 1840, across the street from its current location. Josiah Barber and Richard Lord, prominent businessmen and both former mayors of Ohio City before it was incorporated into Cleveland, donated land to Ohio City's government, stipulating that the tract be used for an open-air neighborhood market. The market space became a center of the Ohio City community for the next three decades and other benefactors donated adjacent lands allowing the marketplace to expand. In 1868, a one-story, wooden framed building was erected on the site, and the newly christened Pearl Street Market was opened.\nThanks to brisk population growth in Cleveland and Ohio City in the latter part of the 19th century, the market outgrew its space again. In 1902, lands were purchased across the street from the Pearl Market site to allow for market expansion and eventual construction of additional indoor market space. Cleveland architectural firm Hubbell and Benes was contracted to create the new indoor space and, after nearly a decade of planning and construction, the current West Side Market building was completed in 1912 at a cost of nearly $680,000. The Neo-Classical/Byzantine building is a brick construct with a large interior concourse that provides nearly 100 stalls for sellers and an 85-stall outdoor produce arcade that wraps around the side and rear of the main building. In addition, the building has a large clock tower, easily visible from most of Ohio City in the building's early days.\n\nIn 1915, the permanent building spurred sellers to establish the West Side Market Tenants' Association, a coalition founded to help maintain the market and organize for future improvements and additions. This organization exists at the Market today.\nPeriodic upgrades accommodated more tenants and maintained and improved the overall conditions. A fuller, $1.1 million modernization was undertaken in 1953 to add lower-level storage areas and upgrade stalls in the arcade. Another renovation, this one for $5 million, took place after the Market was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nThe aarket's profile rose in the latter 20th century. Politicians passing through Cleveland often stopped in to sample the array of foods sold at the market on any given day. The market also began sponsoring major food festivals in the neighborhood which drew people from Cleveland and the rest of the world. Despite the successes of the 1980s, however, the market began to face financial straits as Cleveland itself was experiencing monetary struggles. A large portion of the aarket's subsidies from the city dried up, leaving tenants facing higher rents to keep the market open. Yet the market expanded and was renovated throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century.\nA 2004 project enclosed and added space heating to the arcade portion of the aarket, as well as completed major interior and architectural renovations to the main building. The market's centennial was celebrated in 2012.\n\nMost residents of the neighborhood and many Clevelanders still do a large portion of their shopping at the market. The market is open to customers Mondays and Wednesdays from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays from 7:00 a.m to 6:00 p.m., and Sundays from 12 p.m to 4:00 p.m.The market attracts tourists from all parts of the United States, who visit and learn about its history. Guided tours are offered. Its national profile has been boosted in recent years by coverage on various programs produced by the Travel Channel and Food Network.\nMany stalls have remained under individual family control for much of the life of the market, several dating to 1912. The market's tenants and sellers reflect the cultural diversity of the surrounding neighborhood and Cleveland as a whole. The current roster of tenants includes those of Irish, German, Slovene, Italian, Hungarian, Greek, Polish, Russian, and Middle Eastern descent, among others.\nIn the September 2010 issue of Food Network Magazine, the West Side Market was named America's \"Best Food Lovers' Market.\"\n\nOn January 30, 2013, the market was temporarily closed after a fire left smoke and soot damage.In 2016 city officials announced that starting April 3 of that year the market would add regular Sunday hours for the first time in its history.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nCity of Cleveland: West Side Market Profile\nCrain's Cleveland Business: Cleveland Landmarks Page\nWest Side Market livecam",

          "My favorite stand is Forster Meats, I love the high quality meats and great customer service and wide selections of rare finds (i.e. bison burgers, goat meat)",
          "I purchased the best smoked ham ever from Sebastian\u2019s Meats! All through dinner there was nothing but compliments on the excellent ham. It made the meal a total success!",
          "I love coming here. I am from Atlanta and we don\u2019t have anything like this. You don\u2019t have to buy anything, but I bet you end up buying something! A must see",
          "Must visit if you are in Ohio City. I think one of the best markets I have ever been to. Good meat selection and a lot of brewerys and restaraunt in the area.",
          "Number one tip I always reccomend is getting to this place early. Parking is not good around Ohio City and the lot fills up quickly plus backs up with people trying to get out. If you go early you will also have less than a 15 minute wait at Steve's Gyro. If you go",
          "If you have even an hour of time, please take the time to walk through the west side market. The Ohio City Pasta is fantastic. The Campbell\u2019s cupcakes are delicious. I look forward to when I can go back!",
          "We stopped here on a Sunday morning and most of the vendors were open. The one bakery was closed that I wanted to buy a Bishops Cake from, but found another. Wish I lived in the area, because there was so much fresh food!",
          "Totally enjoyed the atmosphere - and out of the cold. Good variety with a lot of buzz going on. I'll be back",
          "Stopped in before lunch in Ohio City. I was surprised with all The bakeries and wonderful breads and baked goods. Everything looked fresh and appetizing and reasonable. The meat stands looked beautifully displayed and clean. If in the area it\u2019s worth a stop.",
          "My husband and I visited the West Side Market this weekend. We went on Saturday. It was bright and sunny here in Cleve.!! We bought freshly made spinach linguini from Ohio Pasta Company!! Amazing...it reminded me of the pasta we ate while vacationing in ITALY. Lots of fish,",
          "A lot of empty vendor spaces in the Market and the Produce Hall. So far our favorites are still open. Looking forward to our next trip in December and Christmas decorations and Goodies.",
          "In town for a concert and spent an hour or so walking around here after lunch. The market is in a really cool area. Lots of great food to buy at the market.",
          "There are a good variety of produce, but not a lot of organic options. Inside there were a lot of dairy and meat options, but not a dedicated vegan stand. There were no vegan cheeses. We were able to find falafels and Middle Eastern stands that served vegan options. The bakeries",
          "What's there to say about the WSM! basically grew up shopping there. If your looking for it they probably have it. Unfortunately it's kinda become a tourist destination and the city is doing absolutely nothing to listen to the vendors' suggestions to keep the place sustainable.",
          "Great variety, good service clean place. Reasonable parking is available. Shopping in the area provides a nice variety of shops and dining.",
          "Fun place to visit for breakfast. Small dining room, but the pastries, meats, cheeses, and such look amazing. Check dates and times before visiting.",
          "We read reviews aboyhow great this place was, but our experience was not good. Mostly a grocery related market: fresh meat, bakery, etc. Not many prepared foods, the only hot cooked food was dogs/ sausages or gyros (which were on hold, would have to wait a while for them to be",
          "It is a great market for the city, but if you live in a rural area where has supply of fresh meat, it is not really a place for you. I prefer my local meat place. There is no fresh produce there, Only meat and bakery.",
          "Great place year round!! You have a wide variety of items that you can to eat while you walk and or buy to take home and enjoy later. You can grab a sandwich, something to drink, some pastries, and just walk around and enjoy the smells and ambiance of the market. I love to go",
          "This is a great place to pick up fresh meats of all kinds, fruits & vegetables, fresh and dried, prepared foods, baked goods and more. If it was near where I lived I would be there all the time. Free parking for 90 minutes too.",
          "There is soo much here we have to keep coming back to try more. The foods we have found here so far a all of great quality and flavor. You should go at least once.",
          "Fun place to visit, just wish they had more places to actually eat. Very crowded but that is to be expected. Great place if you live locally to buy meats and produce or course they so sell cold bags so you can take things home.",
          "I loved this place. So many choices of food. Different ethnic foods that all looked amazing. And the architecture is amazing. Will definitely be back",
          "I wish we had something like this where I lived! So much wonderful food. We were visiting so weren't able to purchase much but the desserts we got were incredible.",
          "This was a great market. We were also in Seattle this year at Pikes Place so even coming from there I would recommend walking through the West Side Market. There are a few places you could grab a bagel sandwich or a gyro or some hummus if you aren\u2019t staying long enough to cook",
          "I loved walking around this place on a recent weekend trip to Cleveland. I consider myself a \u2018foodie\u2019 so this place was a dream come true. We got enchiladas, an apple fritter, coffee, and baklava from the different vendors. The only disappointment was the baklava from the middle",
          "Very nice market. LOTS of butcher meat options. Several other nice dessert and food options. Short on hot food options, but cold or chilled options a plenty. Next door there were excellent fruit and vegetable options.",
          "This is the closest thing I have seen here in the Midwest to European markets. The lay out is identical to the Buqueria in Barcelona. The place was packed on a Saturday. Vendors were friendly and many were offering free samples. The bathrooms were suprisingly well maintained",
          "Whether you are a long time resident in NE Ohio or just visiting, this market is worth checking out. Located on the near West Side of the city, they have just about any kind of food you can think of including some premade options. There's a place that serves Falafel, Gyro's,",
          "Very cool place to visit. Fresh everything, and just about everything is offered ! Highly recommend the homemade hummus and organic veggie stand.",
          "Conveniently located with plenty options for lunch and dinner; however, the highlight is the wine selection. Recommend if you enjoy markets!",
          "A bit overwhelming but an awesome experience. (we were hungry - LOL!) Wish we would have had more time but the small sample was amazing! Best non traditional cannoli ever. It was rolled in carmel and nuts. Not even sure who baker was-sorry...A MUST SEE ATTRACTION.",
          "Great market place, so many smells and tastes and all in a beautiful old building. Try the pastries and the meat sticks, simply super! Had a wonderful time.",
          "What a great place to buy fresh veggies. The selections are beautifully displayed, the vendors are very helpful, and the prices are good. One suggestion, have a few recipes in mind before you go so you can actually target your purchases. The meats and cheeses are also",
          "Lots of cool food and vendors. This is a great place to get meat and bakery goods. In the long, skinny aisle before you get to the main area the vendors are a little pushy. We tasted cotton candy grapes and asked to purchase them- then were told they were $8! But once you get",
          "Last week I had the pleasure of visiting Westside market for approximately the 10th time in as many years. The combination of fresh produce, savory local meats and home-baked goods is astounding and the purveyors could not be more helpful. All of these impressive vendors add",
          "We go to the market ever time we are in town. The choices are great and fresh. The local meat selections are sometimes worth stopping for. Produce is always fresh and good price. Fun shopping",
          "Keep in mind they are closed tues thurs sun. We stopped mid afternoon on a Monday several vendors choose to not open. Thus I could not buy lamb. We had good experiences at the open vendors. Ate lunch at the west side cafe servers were fun and on top of it. Had a couple",
          "You can get groceries or a meal at this market... or go outside and get a beer. Cool place if shopping, but not so much if you\u2019re vegetarian. The building has great architecture, and you can climb the stairs to get this birds eye view of the entire operation.",
          ".This place is a hub of activity you can buy food to cook and you buy food to eat. It has the best selection of fruit and veggies in the city. The deserts are awesome and beautiful. Had a corn beef sandwich there that was big enough to share.",
          "A typical big city market place. Lots of produce at reasonable prices. Meats and cheese and bakery items. Herbs, spices, nuts, coffees. A fun place to stroll and shop for food. I expected more gift shops...We enjoyed it.",
          "Our visit to Cleveland is never complete without going to the West Side Market. Fresh fruits, breads and pastries, meats, cheeses and more are sold by local vendors. Limited business hours so check before you go.",
          "Awesome old style market place with lots of stands that offer different types of food. Great place to visit and see the ebb and flow of Cleveland.",
          "So many vendors selling everything from meats, desserts, pastas, spices, ethnic foods, etc.............. Had a great time just walking around and taking it all in. But did make some purchases too!",
          "A nice market for fresh fruits and vegetables. Clean and good prices. We thought that it would have more and be bigger. Parking was convenient and free for the first 90 minutes.",
          "The West Side Market was good exposure for my daughter and her friend (ages 15 and 17). They were able to try some new foods and buy a couple small items for themselves. One of the teenagers tried a new fruit and one tried a new Spanish food. I would not suggest that teen",
          "Not sure what the big deal is about this place,maybe just the historic building and neighborhood.The fruits and vegetables are the same brands you buy at Kroger's,the difference is Kroger is less money.The bakery and the meats were better,but still overpriced.Living on old",
          "Went here with a friend to check it out. Great looking food and friendly vendors. We just had a few snacks at the bakery. Great place for anyone hungry.",
          "We rode our bikes to west side market on Saturday. There was entertainment all day in the square. Prices were good on produce in the market",
          "Every time I visit the market I am amazed at the vast selection of foods of all types. Meats, pastries, cheese...it\u2019s all so amazing. Great energy. Don\u2019t miss this place.",
          "What a great market and a great historic building. Hubby and I stopped in to see what everyone was talking about and WOW. The fruit the meats and the bakery. Had fun walking or I should say eating our way through this public market. We stopped in the restaurant for a great",
          "This food market certainly provides for the majority of tastes. A wide variety of danish pastries, cakes, & sweets for the sweet tooths. For savory lovers, there are cheeses from all over the world, smokies and other meats. A food lovers delight.",
          "We went and a Sunday and several of the shops in the market or closed... However there was also a festival going on downtown which may have caused them to close early. The different stores that were open in the market or unique with lots of selection.",
          "The markets own parking is next to the market and is free for the first 90 minutes. This market seems to be frequented by locals buying the food-no souvenir shop in sight only butchers, bakers, fruit and veg, etc. I've been to lots of farmers markets, but nothing on the scale of",
          "Place was so warm couldn\u2019t stay and enjoy it food smelled good but between the pushing patrons and heat it was unbearable , also if it\u2019s that hot how is the food staying fresh",
          "Such an interesting experience! A great place for fresh produce at amazing prices. Lots of unique items to choose from.",
          "Amazing Place! So many venders..... meat, cheese, fish, and bakery filled to the brim and arranged beautifully! Everything looks Amazing! The fruit, vegetables and baked good looks fake, they were so perfect! Everyone is so nice which really adds to the experience. A Must",
          "This place had so many things that didn't even know existed. If your in Cleveland you gotta go to this place.",
          "Everybody was SUPER friendly. My mother and brother and I used to there weekly when I was little. Although the vendors change the place is still G-R-E-A-T!",
          "A National Register of Historic Places member, Cleveland's West Side Market is one of only a handful of markets in the USA under continuous operation for more than 100 years. A visit is like stepping back in time with more than 100 Euro-centric meat, cheese, fish, and bakery",
          "Fresh fruit and vegetables at great prices. My husband and I really enjoyed sampling all the different fruits. So many different varieties you cant get a at regular grocery store. We also enjoyed walking around inside visiting each vendor.",
          "Fresh fruit and vegetables on one side with meaty delectables, cheesy awesomeness and crumbly sweet sweets on the other. I walked in and waddled out. Amazing produce at a reasonable price.",
          "Not many US cities I\u2019ve been to have open fresh markets and this one is not to be missed. Even if you can\u2019t buy much because you\u2019re traveling it\u2019s worth it to see this clean and organized market and grab a bite for a snack.",
          "We went there early Sunday afternoon. They open from 10am to 4pm on Sundays. Vegetable and fruits shops are located at the separate building. Meat, fish and others are in the main building. Majority of places only accept cash. There are about 100 shops and fun to look at",
          "The West Side Market is a Cleveland landmark and is well worth a visit. It is a very large indoor market with every kind of treat you could want. There are bakery stands, chocolate stands, tons of every kind of fresh meat imaginable, sausage, steaks, seafood, cheese, gourmet",
          "This market is amazing. Go thru the produce section to the building with everything! The sausage sandwich was amazing from Franks. I wish we had stopped sooner instead of our last day. Be prepared to cook in your Airbnb or I flew home with an elk burger on ice.",
          "We came here fairly early on the weekend and it wasn't too crowded yet. They have a parking lot that is free for a few hours, then you have to pay. This place is huge--has everything from baked goods to meat (kosher too!) to tea and coffee. We walked around a few times to make",
          "The extensive offerings of meats, baked goods and more make this a must visit experience. This is a marketplace from a bygone era, and it really is amazing. The line at Steve\u2019s Gyros is long, but worth the wait. The neighborhood around the market has really come on strong as a",
          "The market has an array of stores selling fresh meat, including organs, pastries, cooked food, crepes, pasta and so much more. They even have a vendor exclusively selling hot sauces. The quality of all the food they sell here isn\u2019t great but if you are in the area and don\u2019t have",
          "If you\u2019re looking for a fun afternoon shopping fresh fruits, meats, breads and many other ethnic foods this is the place. Add to that the other fun restaurants and shops on West 25th Street makes for a very fun afternoon.",
          "The West Side Market is a foodie experience off the beaten path in Cleveland. If you have the time and you enjoy the neat little places locals like to go then this place is for you. We left with a box of (hand made to order) cannolis.",
          "Nice market but can get very crowded and parking can be difficult. I suggest picking a few items to make into a picnic.",
          "We swing through the market with our daughter who lives nearby right before it closed so crowds weren't bad and we were able to grab some fruit and vegetables at a good price. I wouldn't want to tour the market as I'm not a cook but my husband is and he enjoyed seeing all of the",
          "We were on vacation in Cleveland and stopped here for a late lunch on our way back from the zoo. Very few places to eat, but the many food stalls had tasty looking ingredients if you were going to cook it yourself. Reminded me of Soulard market in St Louis. As a tourist I",
          "West Side Market is a real gem. Its unique history and wide variety of quality goods is unbeatable. It's truly enjoyable to walk through, provided it isn't overwhelmingly crowded. The first time I went was on a weekend (I think a Sunday) morning, and it was so crowded that I",
          "It was a beautiful day in Frankenmuth, Michigan. The riverboat tour was relaxing and informative. A nice break from hustle and bustle of shopping. And the best part is that the company is family-owned and family-operated.",
          "This is the classic big city market with lots of stalls where you can buy all sorts of food products. Very old school. Not very big, a great place to shop for food. Parking is an issue.",
          "This place was a disappointment to us. Many of the vendors were closed. Had a difficult time getting something to eat. The food was pricey",
          "We always go to the West Side Market when we are in Cleveland, but it is starting to become more of a giant eagle to us. Prices are crazy and the products are not what they used to be.",
          "We love the Italian food the best, but there are great bakeries, creameries, and butchers. We always bring great selections home and find new things each time we visit.",
          "It was very overwhelming seeing all the different stops with very similar products. There were several bake shops, meat markets with jerky and kielbasa and sausage, meat markets with fresh meats - pork, lamb, etc.; cheese shops, fish spices. I thought there would be more",
          "We've never been to a market like this ever before. There are only 4 in the US & this one is the largest in the country. They have any type of you can imagine. And there are all types of desserts you can imagine We wish we had a cooler to purchase the different foods they",
          "The West Side Market has beautiful architecture and is in a wonderful area of Cleveland. The market has tons of bakery items and lots and lots of meat. If you are a vegan/vegetarian, this market might be tough for you as meat was everywhere. I even saw a guy push a dead pig on a",
          "Make your eyes, ears, nose, and tongue happy. Easy to spend an hour shopping here and when your done plenty of microbrew pubs within walking distance.",
          "First of all the architecture for the building is gorgeous. But, all the different vendors make this place so cool to stroll through. You get a great idea of the cultures in Cleveland. Lots of local meats, cheeses and tons of yummy desserts. I wish I had not eaten before I went.",
          "Unique place to visit. Lot of produce and different meats. The gyros at Steve's are awesome. Great place to stock up.",
          "We didn't have much time to spend here. Just came in and grabbed some delicious food for lunch and of course some awesome baked goods for dessert.",
          "Very busy, lots of different foods to see and people watching. Really worth a visit though the parking nearby can be hectic.",
          "Unparalleled selection of terrific tasting cheeses. But their buttermilk when used in your homemade pancake recipe cannot be compared..their buttermilk makes a huge difference in the flavor. Meisters stand is THE BEST in the entire market. Kaufmann\u2019s Has Bell & Evans",
          "After Market Garden we strolled around the West Side Market for about 30 minutes buying meat and cheese. It was good to see so many vendors open and prices so reasonable. This place is huge and in two buildings so it takes a while to get around. I used the restrooms and they",
          "Out of all the markets i have visited, this one by far was the prettiest. For some reason a lot of the display cases were decorated with flowers snd pretty colors. The meat and poultry in all cases looked so fresh, you just wanted to buy everyrhing. Lots of pastries,",
          "Not bad, but have seen better, and we hit it late in the day without any food vendors. Very close to where we stayed, so we stopped by.",
          "My grandparents were immigrants who used to market at the West Side Market in the 1930s. So when I visited Cleveland, I wanted to see the place where they used to shop. It is a grand old building built 100 years ago. You can buy a variety of great ethnic food. I was on a",
          "I buy honey, brats, falafel, smokies, pierogis, and a loaf o bread every time I come here. All the vendors here reflect Cleveland nicely. I could spend hours just walking around, looking at the stalls, and looking at them again, then taking a gander at the beautiful architecture",
          "This market place is a gem for food lovers......great meat selections, bakery delicacy's, as well as fruits and vegetables. The ability to try and taste so many different food items is almost overwhelming but what a nice challenge! We arrived shortly after lunch and decided to",
          "A carnivore's dream. Dozens of purveyors with sausages, roasts, ribs as well as bakeries and various ethnic foods. Several long aisles of fruits and vegetables including rarely seen items...think rambutans and other tropical fruits.",
          "Besides the historical view, the tradition and the diverse products, there is delicious options on the german, greek, irish, mexican and merican cook and bakery traditions,",
          "The gem of Cleveland! Such a fun experience. It's an overload of the senses. So many things to taste, smell and see!",
          "So much to browse.. for those of us who live far from a major city, this is a fun experience. If we lived closer we\u2019d shop here regularly. Enjoyed the opportunity to taste before buying.",
          "Enjoyed the experience, mostly meat but looked and was priced great. Because we were visiting, we could not partake but I would highly recommend if you live in the area. The cannolli's were to die for!",
          "If I resided in Cleveland, this would DEFINITELY be a weekly trip. Offerings of raw & cooked meats, sweets, fish, vegetables, and other goods are outstanding. It's fun and has another country market experience. Go see and buy tasty offerings.",
          "My husband and I really enjoyed our first visit to West Side Market. We loved all the vendor choices! We bought huge apple fritters, jerky, meat pies, roasts and bakery items. Lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. This is a must do if you are in Cleveland.",
          "Came here with relatives who live in the area. This market is a class example of sensory overload. Everywhere you look there is something more interesting to eat. The variety of products, be they meats, produce, or baked goods, is amazing. I felt bad we didn't live closer as",
          "This Landmark demonstrates through food the diversity of the city of Cleveland. Whether your shopping for pierogies,lemongrass, collard greens or smoked Gouda, headcheese or veal chops, this market reflects the melting pot that is Cleveland. Warm and friendly merchants,",
          "Went with friends to the market Many booths with exceptional number of vendors Great pricing and variety Would recommend",
          "It was very busy but amazing food!! We spent 30 minutes browsing and trying food. There was also lots of other places around it so it was at least worth the time.",
          "Really loved this market though for fresh produce May was a bit early in the season. The vendors do a beautiful job displaying their fruits and veggies. Given there was a lack of produce we spent most of our time in the main building. The main building is a beautiful hall",
          "It was well worthwhile visiting this market. Nice stalls (many butchers and pastry shops as well as fruit and vegetables in the building across). Quite a nice building and very clean.",
          "We love coming here every time we visit Cleveland. It is relaxing to walk by the vegetable and fruit stalls, taking in the beautifully arranged produce. Then, walk into the building to experience food that is unique to this market with lots of free samples. There are benches",
          "The West side market features some excellent products from vegetables to meat to deserts, but they come at a price. If you are willing to pay that price you end up with some top of the line ingredients for your special dishes. We also liked the pre-cooked food, and thought",
          "Was so excited to visit this market but was disappointed. Plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in one building, lots of baked goods, breads, meats, cheeses, etc. in another building. No crafts of any type available during our visit. Easy to find, plenty of parking on street",
          "We wished we lived downtown because we would go to the West Side Market everyday- great food and reasonable prices! A must do if visiting Cleveland",
          "We stopped here due to my daughter bragging about how neat of place this was. This was my first time in a market of this sort and I was overly enthused about what foods could be bought not to mention pretty good prices for a big city. Its really neat to check out and buy some",
          "This restored wonderful old market has just about everything you could possibly want or need. Fresh produce, meat, pasta, and pierogies are so tempting you will want to buy some of each. There\u2019s also bakery, cheeses and coffees. Plan to spend some leisurely time perusing the",
          "Got a chance to pop into the West Side Market while in Ohio City with some local friends. Extensive selection of various meats, cheeses, desserts, baked goods, etc. Whatever good item you\u2019re looking for, I\u2019m sure you could find it here. That said, the market is inside so it can",
          "An interesting old building full of delicious and fresh foods. I\u2019ve bought from quite a few vendors inside including Kate\u2019s fish. The fish has always been fresh. I\u2019ve tried a variety of chicken, pork, bread vendors and I\u2019ve had nothing bad. Even though all the vendors I\u2019ve tried",
          "Been in much better markets before. Not many places to try the food and eat in the market, lots of similar bakeries and expensive fruits",
          "Yes, this is a classic example of an early 20th century food market. And today there are third generation vendor stands. Here you can find all the good stuff not in your local super market. Fresh off the plane fish, multiple produce vendors vieing for your business, spice",
          "I just love everything about this market. So much food: meats, cheeses, cakes, pastries... I was visiting Cleveland as a tourist (not there to buy groceries) and really enjoyed walking around the market with some hot coffee and cannoli. If you want a sit-down meal, the West Side",
          "A visit to Ohio City has to include the sweet Side Market. Once an open air place to one that is reminiscent of the amazing food halls or markets in Europe (on a smaller scale). The tiled ceilings and variety of venders make this a fun stop.",
          "I would come here often! Amazing variety and much to discover. In our plastic world, be sure to bring cash- some places don't do plastic. I'll be coming back a couple more times before I leave.",
          "I say to not eat before going to Westside because you will be stuffed in short order. I was visiting my sister that lives about an hour away from Cleveland and did the driving. We parked in a lot about one block away and it was $5 for the entire day. Can't beat that for price",
          "Tuff parking but a fantastic place. Tons of things to look at and so much food to choose from. Will do again.",
          "I had heard sooo much about this market that I made sure that we made time to visit. Well it was a total let down. Most of the vendors were selling the same thing. They weren't very polite or helpful. I asked one sausage seller about cheese and parsley sausage and she proceeded",
          "A must see in Cleveland located close to downtown on the rapid line west 25 stop. 100 vendors inside and out if you can\u2019t find it here it does not exist",
          "We've been coming here for a long, long time. The store slots change hands every so often, but a lot of long-time workers that bend over backwards to help and point out items. We usually hit the outside stalls first (fruits, vegetable), load those into the vehicle and then go to",
          "This historical landmark is a must see. You can find all types of fresh foods from fruits, vegetables, fresh meat, seafood, bakery, pasta, and spices from local family run businesses and ethnicities. I suggest Dohor's for some of the best Hungarian smoked meats and Theresa's",
          "This was a fun deviation from typical trip sights. Situated in an old \"warehouse\"? the market was bubbling with vendors of fresh veggies, meats and sweets. There were several stands where you could order lunch and a few tables to sit and eat. It is obviously a regular shopping",
          "My wife and I were in Cleveland for a visit and heard about the Westside Market. If you are a foodie it may have the largest selection of meats, cheeses and breads you will ever see in one location. If I lived here I would come every weekend.",
          "This place reminds me of the Market in Philadelphia. It has all kinds of food (meat, sweets, bread). There is no place to sit and eat, so it's more of a grab and go local market. Totally worth it though.",
          "Lots of fresh meats, anything you can imagine. Some fresh fruits and vegetables. Well organized and clean.",
          "It reminds me of the market in Budapest, but not quite as huge. I haven't seen anything quite like this market anywhere else in this country.",
          "There are so many unique foods here! The sky is the limit when it comes to different flavors of sausage. Look forward to my next trip so we can visit West Side Market again !",
          "I grew up going to the Westside Market every Saturday morning with my mom. This was my husband and kids' first experience. They were intrigued and impressed. When you're away from such a place for such a long time, or experience through the eyes of first timers, you don't",
          "I'm glad I went, but actually ended up buying nothing at the market because Pierogi Palace only had uncooked pierogi (glad they told us) and the large majority of stalls didn't have prepared foods nor were the places to sit down to eat prepared foods that we could find. There",
          "In my time, I have enjoyed many an afternoon perusing marketplaces in various locales. The West Side Market was visited twice on my recent Cleaveland trip (once with my husband, SiL, and nieces and another time with gang of friends). The market sells a variety of things,",
          "This one is an old market in Cleveland , I visited once and liked the produce they have there. Also there are some bakeries and fish and meat shops. Overall its very different from the supermarket shopping experience and I liked it",
          "What a surprise! The market is much bigger than I expected. So much variety. Meat, baked goods, ethnic foods of all types as well as some cafes too. I only had a short visit. I plan to return to see more.",
          "Stopped with our Cleveland friends on a Monday morning as vendors prepared for another day after the weekend rush. All vendors and shoppers were friendly - wide variety of food items. While I enjoyed a pastry from Vera's, our local friends made their usual stop at Boutros",
          "Seemed a little heavy on the meat vendors but a great selection nonetheless. Make sure to visit the market gardeners in the adjoining hall. Beautiful produce. Locals should be able to get all they need to prepare a great meal.",
          "A great place to spend some time buying fruits and vegetables. We bought apples, berries, and donuts before going to eat at the diner.",
          "Going to the Westside Market is a true delight. Fresh fruit and vegetables from several vendors. Walk up to one, chose an item, hesitate and the price will drop. There is so much competition negotiating is worth the time. Go into the inner building. Food! Baked goods, fresh",
          "We stopped here while visiting Cleveland. There is lots of interesting and delicious food to eat and buy to take home. The prices were great.",
          "A great stop with very friendly shop keepers and terrific food. Still trying to figure out what those eastern european pastries were so I can try to recreate them at home!",
          "The Westside Market is apart of Cleveland's history and culture. The vendors have amazing offerings. Top quality meat, cheese bread, pastry, fruits and vegetables.",
          "I\u2019d liken this to Borough market in London but a bit more down to earth. Clearly a place that people come on a repeat basis to buy good quality produce. Butchers, bakers, fruit, international foods and all housed in an amazing building. A great place to wander and take photos as",
          "Be careful of what you buy!! I bought macarons from two different vendors. Both were horrible, stale, hard and inedible!",
          "This is a great stop if you are a fan of fresh food markets. This market seems to be frequented by locals buying the food-no souvenir shop in sight only butchers, bakers, fruit and veg, etc. The markets own parking is next to the market and is free for the first 90 minutes.",
          "The size and colour of the fresh veggies was incredible. we saw veggies we had only heard of before. What an experience",
          "This would be my go to shopping place for all vegetables, fruits and every meat and fish. Fresh, fresh, fresh and the Italian desserts were amazing.",
          "Wow what a place if your in town visit this market, but have plenty of room in your bag when you come cause you will leave with more then what you came with, but you won't be disappointed and while your in here get a smoked italian sausage sandwich from franks you won't be",
          "Walking through the West Side Market is an amazing experience. The sights sounds and smells really tease your senses. So much to see and buy. I love the apple fritters and always get one.",
          "A huge variety of meats, bakery goods, fruits and vegetables. The architecture and history are amazing and just a great overall experience.",
          "Just visited Cleveland for a weekend. I wish I lived here just to shop here. The meat and produce looked so fresh ! What a cool building and an organized if not chaotic place.",
          "Purchased fruit from a vendor based upon what he had on display. However, he pulls the fruit we got from behind the counter. Turned out to be far less than the amounts in the containers on display. When we got it home we discovered some of it was rotten. Despite the charm of",
          "It has a lot of stalls selling fresh produce and meats. There are a variety of counters that serve cooked dishes for lunch ranging from tamales to Mac and cheese and Vietnamese dishes. There are also so amazing bakeries and dessert counters.",
          "Anything you could want and so much more was available! Fruit, fish, meat, spices, and bakery goods! And even better - free parking for 90 minutes!",
          "This market is much like the ones I visited in SE Asia and South America, only much cleaner. There are lots of vendors selling their wares from a broad selection of ethnic foods to many local fruits and vegetables.",
          "Love this place! Whatever you want, from fresh local produce to European meat markets from all over. If you are a sausage lover, you'll have your desires on display from a variety of ethnic butchers.",
          "The first time my wife and I went was when we were visiting Cleveland for a job interview. It instantly made an impression. We go there often because it's a beautiful place with wonderful food. There are too few places like it left in the US. Whatever you want, it is likely",
          "Frindly People, nice and fresh Food from Country side and from the sea. Smal Restaurants around this Location",
          "Went to the market,it was very nice, but just wasn't for us!! We were on vacation,but if we lived in the area,it would be more beneficial!!! I would definitely be shopping there if we lived here!!",
          "My husband and I went over to the market to eat lunch and were very confused which vendors provided lunch and which didn't. There is a wonderful variety of fresh foods, but we couldn't tell who cooked.",
          "If you buy fruit at the fruit market make sure you get the correct number of items. Was short changed. It\u2019s a fun place to browse, the crepe place was excellent thigh the guy running it was a miserable person.",
          "Outstanding selection of fresh food indoor location and well stocked and easy to get around Baked goods were to die for",
          "If you\u2019re looking for premade food, this is great. Ohio city pasta, lots of good baked goods & sweets, Orale, the crepe place & coffee spot next to it are good. Use the produce vendors on the east side only! The north side is bad & not local! Not one thing is grown in Ohio. I\u2019ve",
          "This is a fun place to visit and shop. Some of the shops have been here for more than a hundred years. You c an get pretty much anything you want. A few tables to eat at would be nice, but sitting on a bench in the balcony was fun.",
          "Heard it was bigger than Pikes place market but I would disagree. Wonderful choices of different foods and all sorts of foods to take home. Harder to find something for lunch. Great pastries and sweets",
          "Absolutely amazing! Hundreds of stalls in the main building and fresh fruits and vegetables in the annex. Packed shoulder to shoulder on a Saturday morning with every imaginable food choice on display. The booths are essentially small stores staffed by the same vendor week after",
          "We stopped in around 3pm before we were leaving to head back home because i knew i was going to buy sweets & wanted them on ice for the drive home so i knew we'd have to get there later in the day. We got there & ended up in the building that had the produce so we asked a",
          "Two large halls filled with every kind of vegetable or fruit you can think of. Many stalls offer samples. Prices were very reasonable, if I lived in town all my produce shopping would be here.",
          "I try to visit the West Side Market every time I'm in Cleveland, it never disappoints me. They have such diverse booths filled with the best meats, cheeses, decadent pastries, & ready made sandwiches, it's similar to Reading Market in Philadelphia., just not as large. Parking",
          "I grew up in Cleveland and wanted my boys to see this place. They fell in love with it! It was a nice way to spend a couple of hours. Highly recommend it.",
          "My two teenagers and I went shopping here in preparation for Easter Sunday dinner. Our day started at 9:00 for breakfast at the West Side Market Caf\u00e9. The menu had something for each of our tastes and the total bill was $35 and change. We were all more than happy with our",
          "Yes, you can get some great cuts of meat and seafood, but skip the fresh fruit and veggies as much of it is over ripe and about to go bad.",
          "WOW...what a difference..the Market was bustling with a lot of families and shoppers. All that you can imagine for food choices were available. From fresh meats to bakery products. It was very clean and the vendors were very friendly...also there are many restaurants nearby for",
          "This is our go to place for polish foods, french pastry, and unique and unusual vegetables and fruits!",
          "Best produce, spices, meat, anything you need. Highest quality with the best prices. Have moved to Boston but really miss this market. We have nothing like it here.",
          "If you need anything not found in the grocery stores, this is the place to be. Meats, bakery items, fresh pasta, fresh enchiladas, salsa and tortillas. Need I say more?",
          "It's a great experience for shopping, eating, people watching or looking at architecture. You'll get some of the best food you can find in Cleveland. Either to take home and cook or to eat as you walk through the crowds. It's a cool, old school, eclectic, ethnic market that",
          "We go about once a year more-so for the experience, but we always go home with fresh pastries, breads, fruit and sometimes meats, if we\u2019re going right back home. I love the variety of fruits and vegetables that are always there.",
          "What a fun place! The produce in the first section is great, the ppl are a little pushy. The main hall is awesome! There is a little restaurant tucked away in the corner that had delicious food, I had the Cuban it was pretty good (doesn\u2019t beat an original) friend had shrimp and",
          "Very nice market. The main building was beautiful and all of the displays were well done. Very clean.",
          "As I pulled up, my family was making fun that we were visiting a market while on vacation. Well, at the end - everyone really enjoyed it - and we left with bags of snacks for the 3-hour ride home. We also tried - and liked - some new fruits. We really liked the cotton candy",
          "This was such a fun, interesting place to visit. I wish we lived closer to visit more often. Fresh products and great prices!",
          "We\u2019ve never been to anything like it! If you never have, you really must go. The architecture of the building alone was worth the visit. It really is a market, with pushy fruit vendors on the outside, and all kinds of meat and bread and baked goods and etc vendors inside. The",
          "If you have never been to the West Side Market you must go! They have everything from prepared foods to baked goods to cheeses to meats to various ethnic foods, fruits and vegetables..etc.. All in a huge architecturally gorgeous building that looks like a train station.",
          "Rainy Saturday afternoon, it was still very busy. The Market is over 100 years old. It\u2019s has aisles of the freshest most beautiful displays of produce! Many common and many unusual items... hard to choose! Inside the brick building are many isles of booths with many",
          "This gorgeous historic building is full of wonderful food vendors in this fun Cleveland neighborhood of eateries and breweries. Fresh produce, meats cheeses and beautifully prepared local foods and desserts. You can\u2019t go wrong!",
          "There are two sections to the market: the outdoor produce area and the indoor meat and specialties. The outdoor portion is a traditional farmers market. Fruits and vegetables are sold by about a dozen stands. Some will give samples. You may get some deals towards the end of",
          "If you\u2019re in Cleveland you have to stop. If you live in the area you have to shop. Great food and as fresh as it gets the bake goods are as good as it gets.",
          "Have been here several times in last few years, sure wish it was closer to us. The food offerings are amazing, from ethnic baked goods and breads to fresh fish and seafood. The produce is unlike any other places I have shopped, so appealingly arranged and always tastes just",
          "Took my little People & they got all the strange fruit you don't normally see in the store. We tried all kinds of things & when they saw a Pigs Head in one of the cases they were like Ewe & screams. We also ate in the little Diner which was so old but yet a walk back in time.",
          "It\u2019s one of the best places for weekends visitors but I went super early on a Friday morning and you can really walk around freely without the crowds! Always a wonderful place to behold, everyone is super friendly.",
          "Been going here for over 40 years. Would go weekly when I lived in Cleveland. Go here and savor the best of Cleveland and the world. Go hungry and eat from the vendors. Don\u2019t forget you can order ahead and they will freeze it and sometimes pack it for you to take with you.",
          "I absolutely enjoyed my visit there! It had a little bit of everything and many places/stalls to choose from. I spent over an hour wandering around just looking at the vast different stalls. Go with a open mind to try new things!",
          "The West Side Market is like stepping back in time. You truly get a feeling of being in place where time moves slowly. Which is amazing because it's high energy, always moving. We love shopping there for our produce basics and more specialty items like meat, cheese and fish.",
          "West Side Market is amazing. The building is beautiful. The array of fruits, vegetables, meats, seafood, baked goods, spices, etc is unbelievable. Everything was very fresh and looked delicious.",
          "It's an institution here and should be on your list of places to visit. You will get discounts at the end of the day though many close early. Try them before you buy them because not all of them are as good but this is a food lover's paradise.",
          "Like a vacation in our home town. Worth a visit, but spend some money too. The venders are in business and need your support",
          "Don't go in hungry, you will want to buy everything! Stopped on our way home from Cleveland. Packed a cooler and took it home. The veggies and fruit were beautiful, but since I live in a smaller midwest town, I have access to produce, but took home all kinds of special meats,",
          "I shop here for high quality produce and meats twice a month or so. I buy enough meats to last my family for about a week. The quality is great! Super fresh. I have been going here for decades and truly find it the best place to shop for my family. PS don\u2019t forget to get bakery!",
          "Love this place. West side market has such a cool atmosphere. There are soo many great food options. If you go home empty handed it\u2019s because you don\u2019t eat food. Love the pierogi palace, there are soo many flavors including mashed potatoes and corn! I also always grab a few",
          "We stooped in here to met a friend while in Cleveland. It was very fun. We started in the fruits and veges building, which really felt a bit like the county fair with everyone calling out greetings \"Hey Joe,need strawberries?\" The bigger market building had everything else. The",
          "Needed something different to do... did I find the place. You need it it is here. Ended up with a huge verity of food and snacks for the rest of the week!",
          "I could just eat here! So many choices, so many that looks sooooo good! The fruit stands looked amazing too and the selection is fantastic! I so wished we had one of these back home! There is a parking lot, but you must pay. It can get pretty crowded. I would not bring a",
          "I had so much fun walking around and around this great building sampling vendors' offerings. The produce vendors occupy a building next door. The best idea was to get deli food for lunch and take it up to the second floor where many customers were competing for space atop the",
          "The west side market has many different vendors and tons of things to look at. Vendors are selling anything from fresh meat to spices to lattes and delicious sweet baked treats. If interested in architecture go to the second level with a treat or coffee and look down on the",
          "What a cool place! Just remember you can barter with the vendors. We got totally ripped off on some fruit, but it was a really fun place and we will be back. Parking is free if you are there under 90 mins. Awesome!",
          "This is an amzing market. They have a vast variety of boths with all the food choices that you can imagine. I love it because there are a ton of ethnic boths where the folks do an excellent job show casing there items. It is tasteful but isnt fancy.They had a great variety of",
          "Although the market is supposedly open until 4 pm, they began packing up about 3 pm. We were tourists so we weren't looking for \"end of day\" bargains. Admittedly, we have been spoiled by visiting markets in Europe and Asia. We also arrived thinking we might have a late lunch",
          "Had fun strolling the stalls. You can buy food to take home or eat at the market. Because it was late in the day some of the vendors had discounts on buying several items together for take home food.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our impromptu visit to the West Side Market! So many things to see and smell. Stop in you wont regret it.",
          "There is a very reasonable parking lot just behind it. We were there sunday morning. The first hour is free and then its a dollar every hour. There is fresh produce on the periphery of the main building. Wonderful variety. Fresh. On the inside there is a whole range of cookies,",
          "This was our second trip to the West Side Market and the food vendors were awesome. The bakery, meats and cheese selections were out of this world. Then we made the mistake of going over to the produce section. The vendors pull you in by placing the best selection of produce",
          "My wife and I had a great time at this market - a great place for fresh food and the restaurants in-house are good as well.",
          "Variety of food booths awas very interesting. Most food booths were open and clerks behind counters were friendly and helpful. Always recommending different food articles to try.",
          "The first time I visited this market was with my grandfather. He sold eggs from his farm to a vendor. At that time the stalls outside were open air, not enclosed as they are now. There is a lot of history here. The building it self is worth a trip, beautiful arched ceiling and a",
          "We make this a regular visit at least once every few weeks! Wiencek\u2019s meats are the best! Always get a great cut of meat and great friendly service",
          "This market is a good reason to visit Cleveland. It is an old fashioned market filled with stalls selling distinctive foods, mostly made by the owners. It is quite similar to the Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia. Come here for a taste of the Cleveland of the late 19th",
          "Enjoyed all of the different types of fruit, vegetable, and meat selections at this establishment. It was fun to price compare. Yes, some were overly aggressive but you just walk away. The cinnamon apple fritters were the size of a paper plate! Don't forget to take a cooler bag",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed my visit to West Side Market...great variety of vendors (although the overly aggressive produce vendors in the separate building irked me). Had the best gyro ever from Steve's Gyros and a fantastic strawberry and Nutella crepe from the crepe stand. Wish",
          "The market was very busy on a Saturday afternoon. Really nice visit, after the polar vortex broke, it felt like spring outside. Plentiful treats, fruit, bread, spices, and meat. I ate my way through the place. Side note, my wife lost her appetite, she did not like seeing whole",

          "From Pasta to Pierogis, Mango to Macarons, this place has something for everyone! Summer months bring the outdoor farmer's market. All year round the indoor vendors bring a variety of tastes, and smells from the many diverse neighborhoods of Cleveland. It is wheelchair",
          "Love going to get fresh locally grown produce and meat.. The local area also has a lot of local favorites.",
          "So Fresh... enough said. If you are staying in a hotel that offers a kitchenette. Stop by the market for some tasty items to fill your lil\u2019 kitchen. It was fun just to go in and see all the fresh foods, and to see how the locals shop day to day. I would absolutely love it if I",
          "It is a lovely experience to venture into this building and to wonder through the many food, desert, meat and other stands. A lot of things are very reasonable priced and the whole place offers you a lot of variety. You can buy something to eat and then walk up to the second",
          "We stopped in for a few hours on our way home from a road trip. We could have spent the whole day there. All the vendors had beautifully displayed food. It was hard to decide what not to get. So many lovely breads, meats, cheeses, pastas, baked goods, veggies, fish. We enjoyed",

          "We always take visitors here for the experience, and to grab a bite. If its a food item, it\u2019s here. From produce, meats, cheeses and fish - its a great place to plan a dinner, buy the stuff, take it home and enjoy fresh food at its best. The only disappointment at our last",

          "Meats, cheeses, fruits and veggies...oh my! And don't forget the desserts! Step into another world when entering the West Side Market with the Cleveland skyline in the background. Find the clock tower and head into these buildings in Ohio City. This entire area has been a market",
          "Our friends from Pittsburgh recommended we stop by the West Side Market on our way back to Michigan. We took their advice and were not disappointed. We were particularly impressed by the friendliness of the vendors, many of whom were more than happy to explain their products and",

          "Offers fresh bread, cheese, meats, fish, and vegetables. I particularly like the baked goods and cheese. There are also some drinks and hot foods for sale. It\u2019s nice to have the chance support local merchants, but the hours are limited ( it\u2019s currently closed on Tuesday and",

Don't look for restaurants inside like many markets, but do go and look around. If you have a means of eating the food presented, buy, eat, and enjoy!",
          "Four stars instead of 5 simply for lack of variety, and the barely-there but wafting odor of something spoiled.  There are empty stalls, and putting something other than a butcher, bakery or cheese shop would be great.  Sure, there are \u2026",

          "Some products are really good and great quality. What brings it down is fruit vendors who will try to get rid of old or moldy produce by selling it at a low price. The last time I went someone sold me berries without showing them to me \u2026",

          "They have everything I need love going there",
          "I always love coming down here and walking around the market.  I just really hate this new parking system they have setup now.  Lights are backed up and traffic is backed up just trying to get in here.  I thought this was supposed to make it easier?",

      "name": "Lake View Cemetery",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Lake View Cemetery is a privately owned, nonprofit garden cemetery located in the cities of Cleveland, Cleveland Heights, and East Cleveland in the U.S. state of Ohio. Founded in 1869, the cemetery was favored by wealthy families during the Gilded Age, and today the cemetery is known for its numerous lavish funerary monuments and mausoleums. The extensive early monument building at Lake View helped give rise to the Little Italy neighborhood, but over-expansion nearly bankrupted the burial ground in 1888. Financial recovery only began in 1893, and took several years. Lake View grew and modernized significantly from 1896 to 1915 under the leadership of president Henry R. Hatch. The cemetery's cautious management allowed it to avoid retrenchment and financial problems during the Great Depression.\nTwo sites within the cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The first is the James A. Garfield Memorial, erected in 1890 as the tomb of assassinated President James A. Garfield. The second is Wade Memorial Chapel, which began construction in 1898 and was completed in 1901. It honors the memory of Jeptha Wade, one of the cemetery's co-founders, and was donated by his grandson.\n\n\n== Founding of the cemetery ==\n\n\n=== Creation of the Lake View Cemetery Association ===\n\nIn 1868, prominent Cleveland businessmen Jeptha Wade, Henry B. Payne, and Joseph Perkins began discussing the need for a new cemetery for the city of Cleveland. They believed that the city's then-preeminent burial ground, Woodland Cemetery, was too small for the growing city as well as overcrowded, ill-maintained, and not scenic enough. They issued an invitation on May 8, 1869, to about 40 of the city's other leading businessmen, asking them to meet at the end of the month to discuss the organization of a new cemetery. Thirty of them showed up to the meeting on May 24.The group of 30 formed the nonprofit Lake View Cemetery Association on July 28, 1869. The trustees were William Bingham (owner of the W. Bingham Co. hardware company), Hinman B. Hurlbut (banking executive), Henry B. Payne (railroad investor), Joseph Perkins (banking and railroad executive), U.S. District Court Judge Charles Taylor Sherman, Amasa Stone (steelmaker and railroad investor), Worthy S. Streator (railroad executive and investor), Jeptha Wade (co-founder of Western Union), and Stillman Witt (railroad investor). Wade was named president, and Liberty E. Holden (owner of The Plain Dealer newspaper) the association clerk. The group resolved to build a garden cemetery in the style of Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston, Massachusetts, or Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Judge Sherman chose the name: Lake View Cemetery. Lake View was \"non-sectarian\" and open to all, which (in the 19th century) meant that its intended clientele were Protestant.The group sold 7 percent annual interest bonds in the association, hoping to raise $150,000 ($2.88 million in 2019 dollars). Within six weeks, they'd raised the money and set a new goal of $200,000 ($3.84 million in 2019 dollars), which was also reached. Selah Chamberlain (ironmaker, railroad investor, banker), Payne, Perkins, Stone, Wade, and Witt held $60,000 ($1.15 million in 2019 dollars) in bonds, while another 11 individuals held $55,000 ($1.06 million in 2019 dollars) in bonds.\n\n\n=== Site selection, design, and construction ===\nA committee was formed to choose a site for the new cemetery. Its members consisted of Holden, Payne, Perkins, Sherman, and J.C. Buell (a local banking executive). The committee wanted a location on the lake shore, but found nothing suitable. While traveling on Euclid Avenue, Holden came upon the cemetery site by chance. The area was known as \"Smith Run\". Beginning on the Erie Plain in the northwest, the site rose into the foothills of the Portage Escarpment. Dugway Brook (which bisected the site) and several small streams ran south-to-north through the area, carving out a number of ravines The Dugway Brook ravine was particularly deep, and Euclid bluestone (a bluish-colored sandstone) had once been quarried there.By late September 1869, the Lake View Association had purchased 175 acres (71 ha) of land on this ridge adjacent to Euclid Avenue. (Within a year, the cemetery encompassed 211 acres (85 ha).) This gave the cemetery about 0.75 miles (1.21 km) of frontage on the avenue. The combined cost of the two purchases was $148,821.84 ($3.01 million in 2019 dollars). Located in what was then East Cleveland Township, the site was somewhat isolated. With the city pushing eastward at a swift pace, city and county government officials were already planning additional roads in the area, several of which would reach the new cemetery.Landscape architect Adolph Strauch, who designed Cincinnati's celebrated Spring Grove Cemetery, was hired in October 1869 to design Lake View. Joseph Earnshaw of Cincinnati was the civil engineer, and O.D. Ford was hired as the first superintendent. During the winter of 1869\u20131870, work crews began grading and laying down roads and paths, terracing part of the site for in-ground plots and mausoleums, and removing underbrush and unwanted trees. By February 1870, two sections were being laid out with a total of about 500 plots.The 300 plots in the first section went on sale on June 23, 1870, according to The Plain Dealer newspaper. The cost of a standard size in-ground grave was set at $4.00 ($81 in 2019 dollars). Larger sites for families, monuments, or mausoleums went for 20 cents ($4 in 2019 dollars) a square foot. The cemetery's distance from Cleveland's population center and the price of its plots meant that only those with a middle class income or better could afford to be buried at Lake View.\n\n\n== Early years: 1869 to 1880 ==\n\nIt's not clear when the first interments at Lake View Cemetery were made, but several plots were in use by October 21, 1870.Improvements to and expansion of the cemetery continued over the next few years. The first ravine was bridged in November 1870, and in December the association purchased an unspecified number of acres that doubled the length of its frontage on Euclid Avenue. The cemetery sold $400,000 ($8.54 million in 2019 dollars) in bonds in 1871 to pay for more improvements. To secure the bonds, the cemetery pledged all but sold lots, roads, and water features. By August 1871, six sections of the cemetery were laid out and the receiving vault for use by plot-holders, designed by local architect Joseph Ireland, was almost finished. A superintendent's lodge at the front gate on Euclid Avenue was finished at the end of the year. By this time, several large, artistic funerary monuments had been erected at Lake View. The association purchased another 41 acres (17 ha) of land in October 1872 and 2.17 acres (0.88 ha) in January 1873. By June 1873, the cemetery had a total of 266 acres (108 ha). It had spent $65,643 ($1.4 million in 2019 dollars) on landscaping, with eight sections landscaped, plotted, and open for burials. The cemetery even dammed Dugway Brook in places to create ponds.Plots at Lake View Cemetery in its first three years sold for half the average price of plots in established cemeteries. Plot sales generated little income initially. At the close of the 1872-1873 fiscal year, the cemetery was technically bankrupt, with more debt (about $198,000 [$4.23 million in 2019 dollars]) than assets. Plot sales were brisk, however, and the cemetery was proving extremely popular with local residents. As much as 40 percent of all burials at Lake View Cemetery between 1870 and 1873 were removals from Woodland Cemetery. Another 21.8 acres (8.8 ha) of land were purchased in August 1873, and the cemetery's acreage totalled 304 acres (123 ha) in 1876.Euclid Avenue was paved up to Lake View Cemeteryn in 1874. Lake View Cemetery purchased another 100 acres (40 ha) of land in 1875, issuing $150,000 ($3.49 million in 2019 dollars) in 6 percent annual interest bonds to pay for it.By 1877, The Plain Dealer estimated, more than $100,000 ($2.4 million in 2019 dollars) in funerary monuments dotted the landscape at Lake View Cemetery. These included the highly visible obelisks and shafts over the Doan, Kelley, McDermott, Potter, and Tisdale plots; the Goodrich and Jaynes memorials; the Keynes column (topped with a funerary urn); the Jeptha Wade shaft, which was topped by an angel; and the Hurlbut pillar topped with a weeping figure. There were also a number of monuments with well-designed, expertly carved bas-relief or freestanding sculptures. These included the angel atop the Truman P. Handy memorial, the weeping woman atop the Bucher and Hanna monuments, the group of angels supporting a cross atop the Cross grave, figures carved on the upright slabs over the Johnson and Garretson plots, a sculptural group named \"Hope\" atop the Perkins monument, and another sculptural group atop the Chamberlain monument. Although a number of large mausoleums had been built in the cemetery, the newspaper noted that the most elaborate of these was the tomb being erected by H.J. Wilcox. Wilcox had visited Italy, where he employed artisans to design a vault that mimicked the look of an Italian Renaissance chapel.With lots selling quickly, cemetery officials used the revenue to redeem debt. By 1878, only $10,000 of the 1871 bond issue remained unredeemed, and just $30,000 of the 1875 bond issue. The trustees decided to retire both debts by issuing $40,000 ($1.06 million in 2019 dollars) in new bonds at 7 percent annual interest. Although the new bonds were sold, the old debt was inexplicably not retired.\n\n\n== Expansion: 1881 to 1890 ==\n\n\n=== Building the Garfield Memorial ===\n\nPresident James A. Garfield, a resident of nearby Mentor, Ohio, was shot in Washington, D.C. on July 2, 1881. He died on September 19, 1881. Garfield himself had expressed the wish to be buried at Lake View Cemetery, and the cemetery offered a burial site free of charge to his widow, Lucretia Garfield.Mrs. Garfield agreed to bury her husband at Lake View. Garfield was temporarily interred in the cemetery's public vault on September 26, 1881, then transferred on October 22 to an empty mausoleum owned and designed by noted local architect Levi Scofield. Even before Garfield's funeral, plans were laid by his friends and admirers for a grand tomb to be erected at the highest point in the cemetery.The popularity of the garden-like cemetery and the public's desire to see Garfield's resting place were such that large crowds began thronging Lake View every Sunday. Roughly 50,000 people a year were visiting the monument. Although the memorial charged an entry fee of 10 cents per person to defray its maintenance costs, the cemetery received no portion of this revenue despite the wear and tear on its property. Cemetery officials began requiring tickets in the summer of 1882 to enter the grounds in order to control the crowds and maintain a suitable atmosphere for mourning. Relic hunters were so willing to vandalize the Scofield tomb (they even ripped up the grass around it) that a wire fence had to be erected to keep them away. In 1891, the cemetery barred all non-lotholding visitors from the cemetery on Sundays unless they had a pass. With only about 230 Sunday passes available, hundreds of people were turned away.The Garfield Memorial Committee selected the highest point in the cemetery in June 1883 for the president's final resting place. Lake View Cemetery built a road around the memorial in early 1885, and began work on cutting a road from the Euclid Gate to the memorial site in the fall of that year. The cemetery also began work on making improvements to the landscape, water, and drainage around the site. The Garfield Memorial was dedicated on May 30, 1890. Lucretia Garfield, the president's widow, died on March 13, 1918, and was interred in the Garfield Memorial on March 21.\n\n\n=== Rise of Little Italy ===\nLittle Italy largely owes its inception to funerary monument maker Joseph Carabelli. In 1870, 20-year-old northern Italian journeyman stonecarver emigrated to the United States. He spent 10 years in New York City, where he dressed stone and carved the statue Industry for the Federal Building and Post Office in Brooklyn. Carabelli relocated to Cleveland in 1880, establishing the Lake View Granite and Monumental Works on Mayfield Road adjacent to the cemetery. Carabelli began encouraging other Italian sculptors, stonecutters, and artisans to settle in Cleveland near his works, and by 1885 a substantial enclave of Italians, mostly immigrants, had grown up there.By 1892, the neighborhood adjacent to the cemetery's southwestern corner had become known as Little Italy. It was largely inhabited by Italian immigrants who worked as groundskeepers at Lake View or who worked in the funeral monument companies making headstones or memorials for placement in the cemetery. 1892 also saw the city of Cleveland annex Little Italy. The annexation included all of Lake View Cemtery west of a line running from the end of Brightwood Avenue south to Mayfield Road.\n\n\n=== Streetcar access ===\nLake View, Collamer & Euclid Railway, a streetcar line, proposed a line to reach Lake View's main gate in July 1874. However, as built in 1876, the line followed Superior Avenue to Euclid Avenue before proceeding east\u2014reaching Euclid east of Lake View Cemetery.The first streetcar to reach Lake View Cemetery was the East Cleveland Railway's Euclid Avenue Line in 1886. The company extended its tracks from its existing terminus at E. 107th Street up Euclid Avenue to Rosedale Avenue in East Cleveland (just short of the major thoroughfare of Noble Road). The East Cleveland Railway opened a second set of tracks, an extension of its Cedar Avenue Line, in 1889. This line began at the company's car barn at the intersection of Euclid Avenue and Coltman Road. The line traveled south on Coltman to reach Mayfield Road, then south down Murray Hill Road to Cedar Avenue. A year after the Cedar Avenue Line extension opened, the Cleveland Electric Railway Company opened its Mayfield Road Line. This line went past Lake Views Mayfield Road gate. The line began at the East Cleveland Railway's car barn, went south down Coltman to Mayfield, and then east on Mayfield to Lee Road. This line closed in 1907.In 1902, Lake View Cemetery gave permission for the Cleveland Electric Railway to build a spur into the cemetery so that the streetcar firm's funeral car could be used to transport caskets and funeral parties to the cemetery.\n\n\n== Financial difficulties ==\n\n\n=== Emergence of the financial crisis ===\nAs of 1888, Lake View Cemetery had 300 acres (120 ha) of land. About 70 acres (28 ha) had been laid out, but only half had been sold. The cemetery association had spent $800,000 ($22.8 million in 2019 dollars) buying land and improving it. By the end of 1888, about 14 percent of Lake View's 300 acres (120 ha) had been sold, bringing in $406,000 ($13.1 million in 2019 dollars). The price of a single-burial lot had more than doubled since the cemetery opened, to ($11 to $14 in 2019 dollars) a square foot.By late 1888, Lake View Cemetery was nearing bankruptcy. Mismanagement was part of the problem, and The Plain Dealer newspaper said the cemetery's financial records were in \"deplorable\" shape. Lake View had outstanding debt of $432,980 ($12.3 million in 2019 dollars), and interest on the debt consumed $23,031 a year ($700,000 in 2019 dollars). Maintenance of the few open sections cost another $9,676 ($300,000 in 2019 dollars) a year, yet income was only $23,875 ($700,000 in 2019 dollars) a year on average. The cemetery superintendent had spent $150,000 to $200,000 ($4.27 million to $5.69 million in 2019 dollars) on improvements, a figure officials privately admitted was too much. Lot sales fell below expectations, and the cemetery had never established a reserve fund to see the organization through difficult economic times. Cemetery trustees were aware of the worsening deficit many years earlier, and believed the cemetery should stop paying interest on its bonds to bring its finances back in order. This step was not taken because the trustees believed many bondholders relied on interest for income. The cemetery began quietly borrowing money from the Citizens Savings and Loan Association, a local bank, in order to pay interest on its bonds.The association paid out only 4 percent of the 7 percent annual interest due on its bonds at the end of 1888, creating a severe financial hardship for bondholders who relied on the interest for their living expenses. Bonds which formerly sold for $108 to $110 (the par value was $100) now began selling at $50 to $75. Angry bondholders protested the move, but were assured that the cemetery's financial problems were temporary. Bondholders representing about $50,000 out the bonds formed a committee in late March 1889 to seek more information about the cemetery's financial status.Quietly, the cemetery began accepting bonds as payment for lots. Usually, purchasers held few bonds, with those holding large amounts of bonds refusing to sell. Although the exchange of bonds for lots would impact revenues, cemetery officials believed that only $7,000 to $8,000 in bonds would be redeemed.\n\n\n=== February 1889 proposed rescue plan ===\n\nThe initial plan to save Lake View Cemetery, proposed by association officials, paid bondholders 3 percent of interest due in cash and the remainder in scrip. The cemetery would also create a sinking fund to redeem scrip. To generate revenue, the cost of lots would be halved to just 25 cents ($7 in 2019 dollars) a square foot; the surge in lot-buying, it was believed would raise $2 million ($56.9 million in 2019 dollars). In addition, spending on cemetery improvements would be cut back sharply. The reaction of the bondholders was not reported, but area businesspeople began suggesting that the city of Cleveland purchase the cemetery.The plan was amended at the end of April 1889 so that all interest coming due that year was paid in scrip. Interest due after 1889 would be paid 3 percent in cash, 4 percent in scrip. The cemetery agreed to pay 6 percent annual interest on scrip, to devote all income first to maintaining the cemetery and second to paying cash interest, and to create a second sinking fund dedicated to redeeming bonds at maturity. Excess income (after expenditures for maintenance and cash interest) would go toward the sinking funds, redemption of scrip, a fund to pay the next year's cash interest, and to pay other debts. Significant bondholder opposition to the plan began to emerge.In June 1889, the Lake View Cemetery Association paid only 3 percent of the 7 percent annual interest due in cash, the remainder in scrip. The cemetery was forced to redeem $11,000 ($300,000 in 2019 dollars) in bonds at par that month alone as payment for lots. The redemption of bonds significantly impacted the cemetery's cash flow, and by the end of 1889 it could not pay any interest in cash. Income was so negatively impacted by the exchange of bonds for lots that cemetery trustees admitted on June 1, 1889, that no cash interest would be paid at the end of the year; all interest would be paid in scrip. The trustees also warned that scrip might not be issued unless bondholders agreed to the cemetery's financial rescue plan. Angry bondholders began to threaten lawsuits to personally hold the trustees responsible for the payment of interest.The bonds-for-lots exchange program proved financially disastrous. Lake View sold lots worth $12,000 in September 1889 but received only $1,000 in cash as the remainder was paid in bonds. In the same month, maintenance expenses amounted to $5,000. At the beginning of October 1889, the association stopped accepting the full amount of bonds for the purchase of lots, and said it would accept bonds for only one-third of the lot sale price. The cemetery also agreed to accept scrip for up to a third of a lot's cost as well.\n\n\n=== November 1889 proposed rescue plan ===\nLocal banker and cemetery trustee Daniel P. Eells proposed in November 1889 to form a syndicate to raise $200,000 ($5.69 million in 2019 dollars) and redeem two-thirds of all outstanding bonds at the current market price. A trustee would hold the redeemed bonds until January 1, 1893, paying interest on them from net cash income. The trustee would distribute the bonds on a pro rata basis on January 2, 1893. Subscribers to the redemption fund were essentially betting that the price of the bonds in 1893 would have risen more than enough to not only cover their investment but also offset the loss of income from the reduced interest payments. Eells said the cemetery faced bankruptcy if the syndicate scheme was not adopted.Gaining acceptance from the bondholders was complicated. C.F. Houghton, a banker and bond dealer based on the East Coast, held all $10,000 of the outstanding 1871 bonds and $7,000 of the 1875 bonds. Samuel E. Williamson, a local judge, held $13,000 of the 1875 issue. Another 331 individuals held the remaining $10,000 of the 1875 and all $40,000 of the 1878 issue. Houghton claimed to have been given misleading information on the amount of outstanding debt by Lake View officials, and he threatened to sue the cemetery to force it into receivership (a process which would take about six years to accomplish). Support for the cemetery's plan among the miscellaneous bondholders was about evenly split. Those in opposition argued it was unethical for the cemetery to create a financial crisis which caused bond interest to cease and bond prices to collapse, and then turn around and offer to buy those bonds back at the new low price.A recession hit the U.S. economy in 1890 followed by a brief depression in 1891, further depressing lot sales.By 1892, the grounds at Lake View Cemtery were seriously neglected. Sections ready for sale were unmown, weeds and other plants grew wild, and erosion and drought had left some areas bare of vegetation. Only a small percentage of the cemetery's roads were paved, and the remainder, all dirt roads, were heavily eroded and rutted. Lake View's finances were so poor that many residents believed it was close to bankruptcy. The association needed revenue so badly that its trustees considered lowering the price of lots so that the poor could afford to be buried there. The cemetery generated so little revenue that it had incurred about $365,700 ($10.4 million in 2019 dollars) in debt above and beyond interest and principal owed on bonds.\n\n\n=== 1892 approved rescue plan ===\n\nWith revenues extraordinarily low and the association not having paid any interest in cash since 1889, cemetery trustees formed a committee consisting of Daniel P. Eels, Henry R. Hatch, and Edwin R. Perkins to see what level of cash interest could be sustained. The committee proposed a new plan in February 1892: All 1871 and 1878 bondholders could turn in their bonds and receive a new \"refunding bond\" paying lower annual interest. To cover all outstanding debt, about $400,000 ($11.4 million in 2019 dollars) in \"refunding bonds\", back-dated to December 1, 1891, would be issued. They would have a $1,000 par value, and be payable in 50 years.Interest for the last six months of 1892 would be paid in cash at a 7 percent annual rate. The new bonds would carry coupons for all other past-due interest, to be paid at a 6 percent annual rate. Additionally, redeemed bondholders would receive an income debenture equal to 20 percent of the bond's face value. Only $100,000 ($2.85 million in 2019 dollars) in income debentures would be issued, carrying a 7 percent (or less) annual interest rate. To ensure payment of the interest on the deentures, the cemetery agreed to establish a sinking fund whose proceeds would pay the interest.Lake View Cemetery agreed that revenues would go toward maintenance and cemetery expenses first. Excess revenues would be applied first to the income debentures, second to interest on the 1878 and refunding bonds, third to sinking fund payments, and lastly to any reasonable improvements to be made to the cemetery. The cemetery staff believed that only about $4,000 ($100,000 in 2019 dollars) a year was needed to maintain the cemetery. Interest on the 1875 bond issue (of which only $35,000 was outstanding) amounted to $2,100 a year ($100,000 in 2019 dollars), while interest on the refunding bonds would amount to $16,000 a year ($500,000 in 2019 dollars).About half the outstanding bondholders approved of Lake View's plan, but it needed 90 percent to do so before the financial recovery plan could be implemented. The cemetery association tried and failed to get bondholder approval for its plan, and then turned for assistance to Harry A. Garfield, son of President James A. Garfield and a local attorney who represented several cemetery bondholders. Garfield felt the association's plan was needed to ensure the cemetery's financial stability, and began sending personalized and form letters to all the bondholders in December 1891. The cemetery's plan was tweaked to provide for even smaller par values for the refunding bonds. In total, $500,000 ($14.2 million in 2019 dollars) in refunding bonds were proposed, 350 at $1,000 par value, 50 at $500 par value, and 1,250 at $100 par value. Five months after Garfield began his lobbying effort, 75 percent of bondholders approved the plan. The remaining approvals were received in June 1892, and the LVCA board of directors authorized issuance of the refunding bonds. Legal work took longer than usual, however, and it was not until December that the bonds were finally issued.The cemetery's financial condition improved significantly over the next few years. Although some board members felt the cemetery should still be sold to the city of Cleveland, the board rejected this proposal overwhelmingly in June 1895. The cemtery board approved the erection of a crematorium in 1900, but no action was taken on the plan.\n\n\n== Renewed improvement ==\nIn 1896, Lake View Cemetery's entrance was unprepossessing. Located next to Mayfield Road about 200 feet (61 m) southwest of the current entrance, it consisted of a small wooden gate, a two-room office in a wooden shack just inside the gate, and a small wood-frame home for the superintendent adjacent to the office.Henry R. Hatch was elected Lake View's president in June 1896. Lake View was in dilapidated condition, with nearly all monuments and headstones sinking or out of plumb. The cemetery's financial problems had hindered its development for years now, and Hatch implemented new, modern financial and recordkeeping systems to further improve accounting and cash flow. A new system of gravedigging orders was also implemented, and cemetery engineering was improved. Lake View had long laid out lots according to the contour of the ground. Steep slopes were avoided, and roads with storm drains laid out before a section was plotted. The new engineering standards required that all sections have a 3-foot (0.91 m) wide infrastructure border around them. The outermost tier of graves was intended for monuments, and lots were 12 feet (3.7 m) deep. All other tiers had lots just 9 feet (2.7 m) in length, with a 3-foot (0.91 m) walkway between tiers. Any section deeper than 150 feet (46 m) in depth also need to have a 8-foot (2.4 m) wide service road bisecting it. All ground was roughly graded before the construction of infrastructure and roads; wet ground was drained after rough grading. Section and lot corners were marked with cornerstones, and all permanent fixtures were recorded on the cemetery engineer's maps.With the Long Depression ending in the United States, the board believed lot sales would rise significantly. With the board's backing, Hatch began making new improvements to the cemetery and converting undeveloped land into sections 4, 10, and 26 at a cost of $10,000 ($300,000 in 2019 dollars). Realizing that lot sizes were too large and expensive for middle-class purchasers, Hatch ordered that lots in what is now Section 26 be small and affordable like those at Woodland Cemetery. Unsold large lots in what is now Section 1 were subdivided into smaller lots as well. Terra cotta markers were placed to mark section boundaries, and new maps of the cemetery produced for the first time in several years. Cemetery-wide improvements included the laying of 600 feet (180 m) of fresh water pipe for irrigation purposes, 2,400 feet (730 m) of drainage pipe to reclaim soggy land for burial purposes, 800 feet (240 m) of new fencing around the exterior of the cemetery, 1,017 feet (310 m) of new concrete sidewalks, and extensive graveling of dirt roads. Cemetery staff were given uniforms to wear for the first time, and a marquee purchased to provide cover for funeral attendees during inclement weather. In sections with large lots intended for funerary monuments, Hatch ordered that lot corners by marked with a 6 by 6 inches (150 by 150 mm) piece of polished dark Quincy granite with lot numbers carved into each corner. Where section lots contained just two to six graves, corners were marked with a 3 by 3 inches (76 by 76 mm) piece of Georgia marble or slate.Hatch also hired landscape architect Ernest W. Bowditch to finish laying out the cemetery's 300 acres (120 ha). Bowditch retained the garden cemetery design begun in 1869, and began planting large numbers of ornamental trees, including bald cypress, copper beech, gingko, oriental plane, pin oak, and purple beech. Importantly, he also planned a new entrance for Lake View Cemetery on Euclid Avenue, with a new circle just inside the cemetery gate. The new office building at the entrance was designed by noted local architect Charles F. Schweinfurth, and the cost of its construction donated by Hatch. Neoclassical in style, it was faced with Ohio sandstone. The $6,000 ($200,000 in 2019 dollars) rectangular structure was 25 by 51 feet (7.6 by 15.5 m) in size. The floors and wainscoting were hardwood. Ground for the new office building was broken on October 21, 1897, and it was completed in April 1898.\n\n\n=== Construction of Wade Memorial Chapel ===\n\nIn 1896, Jeptha H. Wade II decided to fund the construction of a new receiving vault and chapel, dedicated to the memory of his father, at Lake View Cemetery. Wade asked the newly-founded Cleveland architectural firm of Hubbell & Benes to create a preliminary design. He was so happy with their work that he chose this concept as the design for the chapel and commissioned Hubbell & Benes to finalize the blueprints. The association did not formally accept the new chapel until the plans were done.The site chosen for the chapel was between two existing lakes, diagonally across a road from the existing public vault. The exterior walls were clad in near-white Barre granite from Barre, Vermont. The interior decor was designed and manufactured by Tiffany & Co. The commission was considered so important that Louis Comfort Tiffany personally contacted Hubbell & Benes to win the job. The chapel featured a massive stained glass window at the rear and mosaics on each side wall. The stained glass window, titled Resurrection or Flight of the Soul, was designed by Tiffany artisan Agnes Northrop. Tiffany artist Frederick Wilson designed the wall mosaics. The Favrile glass and gold tile mosaics depicted the passage of life to death. The left side mosaic became known as \"The River of Life\", while the other had the title \"The River of Death\". The chapel featured a casket pedestal in place of an altar. This pedestal could be lowered mechanically through the floor into crypt, where the receiving vault was located. The \"public\" portion of the crypt could hold as many as 96 coffins. Two private receiving vaults also existed on the crypt level, closed off by marble doors.Ground for the new chapel was broken on February 19, 1898. The hillside was excavated 25 feet (7.6 m) down to bedrock, and the foundations and crypt level finished in late December 1898. Completing the interior took much longer than expected, and the chapel was not finished until 1901. The cost was variously reported to be $350,000 ($10.8 million in 2019 dollars), $150,000 ($4.61 million in 2019 dollars), $140,000 ($4.3 million in 2019 dollars), and \"more than $100,000\" ($3.07 million in 2019 dollars).\n\n\n=== Erecting the Rockefeller Monument ===\n\nIn 1898, John D. Rockefeller, the co-founder and largest stockholder in Standard Oil and one of the wealthiest men in the United States, began the erection of a funerary monument in Lake View Cemetery. Some time before 1882, Rockfeller purchased a 17,000-square-foot (1,600 m2) family plot on one of the cemetery's highest points, slightly northeast of the Garfield Memorial. Three people were buried in the John D. Rockefeller plot. Two of them were children of Frank Rockefeller, John's brother. They were William Scofield Rockefeller (81 days old, died on March 17, 1878) and Myra Rockefeller, 2 years and 81 days old, died on August 23, 1886). Rockefeller's mother, Eliza Rockefeller, died on March 28, 1889, in New York City. She was buried in the Rockefeller plot at Lake View on March 30.Construction began on the Rockefeller Monument in 1898. Quarried in Barre, Vermont, by the Wetmore and Morse Granite Co. of Montpelier, Vermont, several hundred tons of rock had to be blown before a piece of rock big enough for the obelisk could be found. The Egyptian-style obelisk alone was 51 feet 9 inches (15.77 m) high with a bottom 5 by 5 feet (1.5 by 1.5 m) square. It was the largest granite shaft ever quarried in the United States, and the second-largest single-piece shaft to be erected in the United States after Cleopatra's Needle in Central Park in New York City. The Plain Dealer newspaper believed it to be the tallest shaft ever erected over a private grave anywhere in the world. The first base of the pedestal was 14 by 14 feet (4.3 by 4.3 m) square and 3 feet (0.91 m) high. The second base was 9 feet 2 inches (2.79 m) by 9 feet 2 inches (2.79 m) and 3 feet 8 inches (1.12 m) high. The die was 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m) by 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m) and 7 feet (2.1 m) high. The total height of the monument was 65 feet 10 inches (20.07 m).The Rockefeller obelisk was dressed in Vermont. It had mininal if graceful ornamental elements on the base, with the name \"Rockefeller\" on the second base. The New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (the \"Nickel Plate\") transported the shaft and other elements of the monument from Vermont. The shaft alone weighed 80 short tons (73 t); combined with the bases and die, the monument's total weight was 135 short tons (122 t). The obelisk was the heaviest item the railroad could move without straining its bridges. Even so, the railroad had to design and build special rail cars to carry the load, and build a heavy-duty spur from its main line to the quarry.The Rockefeller monument arrived in Cleveland on Sunday, February 11, 1899. A house moving company used horses and a windlass to move the obelisk from the railroad tracks along Mayfield Road to the cemetery's Mayfield Road entrance. By March 3, the obelisk had only moved four blocks to reach Mayfield Place (now E. 124 Street), and was beginning to make its way up the steep hill which Mayfield Road climbed. At that time, the movers believed it would take only three weeks for the obelisk to make it the up 1,800-foot (550 m) hill. Weather and other delays hindered the shaft's progress, however, and it was up the hill and only halfway through the cemetery\u2014and still 600 feet (180 m) short of its final destination\u2014by June 25. A derrick to erect the obelisk was rented by W. F. Howland (the firm to which the Carabelli monument company had subcontracted the erection work), but the delays in moving the obelisk meant the derrick's use was required elsewhere. The derrick was erected again at Lake View about August 26. The first base was put in place on August 31. The second base was cemented to it on September 1 using a special French cement, and the die cemented to the second base on September 2. The obelisk was hoisted upright on September 11. The derrick's wooden superstructure proved too weak to lift the obelisk into the air, and had to be reinforced. The shaft was finally lifted into and cemented in place on September 12 while a large crowd of onlookers watched. Stoneworkers applied the finishing touches to the monument on September 13, 1899.The Rockefeller Monument cost $50,000 ($1.54 million in 2019 dollars) to quarry and erect, and another $10,000 ($300,000 in 2019 dollars) to move.\n\n\n== Continued improvement: 1900 to the Great Depression ==\n\nIn 1900, Lake View Cemetery had just over 10 percent (34 acres (14 ha)) of its land developed into cemetery plots. Lakes, streams, roads, and other features took up another 68 acres (28 ha). Undeveloped land remained heavily forested, with beech, elm, maple, and oak trees predominating.\n\n\n=== Financial prosperity ===\nLot sales were extremely high in 1895, 1896, 1897, and 1898, helping to improve the cemetery's financial condition and making its bonds well-regarded for investment purposes. Lot sales declined significantly in 1899 and early 1900, but the cemetery still grossed $35,500 ($1.09 million in 2019 dollars) in sales revenue and counted more than 6,000 total interments by 1901. It had assets worth $1,119,302 ($34.4 million in 2019 dollars) and debts of just $626,290 ($19.2 million in 2019 dollars) Lake View was paying interest on its debt every six months, and the sinking fund was ample. The cemetery created an endowment fund in 1900, and put $7,207 into it ($200,000 in 2019 dollars). In July 1900, John D. Rockefeller gave Lake View Cemetery a gift of $10,000 ($300,000 in 2019 dollars), the first of several donations. Rockefeller's gift was used to open a section for the poor, to lay fresh water pipes in several sections, and for other improvements. The cemetery received another $15,000 ($500,000 in 2019 dollars) in other cash donations during year as well.Lake View Cemetery reported lot sales of $40,778 ($1.25 million in 2019 dollars) in 1901, assets of $1.19 million ($36.6 million in 2019 dollars), and debts of just $626,290 ($19.2 million in 2019 dollars). The following year, lot sales increased and the cemetery spent $25,000 ($700,000 in 2019 dollars) to make an unusually large number of improvements, rebuilding old roads, adding new roads, draining some land, and opening a number of new sections. John D. Rockefeller made another $10,000 donation ($300,000 in 2019 dollars), and the cemetery received another $12,272 ($400,000 in 2019 dollars) in donations from other sources. Lot sales rose again in 1903. Rockefeller made a third donation of $10,000 ($300,000 in 2019 dollars), and other donations totaled about $7,000 ($200,000 in 2019 dollars).Lake View Cemetery continued to see lot sales rise in 1904, generating $55,230 ($1.57 million in 2019 dollars). Donations brought in another $8,186 ($200,000 in 2019 dollars). The cemetery made $20,040 ($600,000 in 2019 dollars) in improvements during the year, adding fresh water pipes, stormwater sewers, and building three tool houses (each with a telephone) in the cemetery. With expenses and supplies requiring just $22,148 ($600,000 in 2019 dollars), the cemetery had more than enough cash on hand for interest payments, the sinking fund, and scrip interest and redemption. Lot sales and associated revenues were even higher in 1905 ($63,201 [$1.8 million in 2019 dollars]), with expenses and supplies rising to $37,915 ($1.08 million in 2019 dollars) and improvement spending dropping to $14,840 ($400,000 in 2019 dollars). Lake View was so flush with cash that it made an extraordinary $10,000 ($300,000 in 2019 dollars) payment to the sinking fund. For the first time in years, Lake View Cemetery Association trustees discussed opening a number of new sections, and began discussing setting aside sections solely for the construction of large, expensive mausoleums.\n\n\n=== Section 23 experiment and the death of Hatch ===\nThe 1910s and 1920s continued to be years of prosperity for Lake View Cemetery. Its maintenance staff had grown so much that it built an addition to its maintenance shop in 1909. It opened Section 23 in 1913. This section was \"pre-designed\" by cemetery staff, architects, landscape architects, and sculptors, many of them associated with the Cleveland School of Art. The landscaping around the lot's borders and at strategic points in its interior was designed to accommodate and complement only certain types of funerary monuments. In 18 of the 32 lots in these areas, the cemetery issued highly specific, narrow rules regulating the size and type of monument which could be erected. In the remaining 14 key lots, the cemetery \"strongly suggested\" to buyers that only certain kinds of funerary monuments be used in these locations (explicitly ruling out funerary vases). Headstones were allowed to rise only 4 inches (100 mm) above the surface of the earth. All local funerary monument companies were furnished with a booklet on monument design to assist them in designing gravestones appropriate for Section 23, and for all other sections at Lake View.Lake View Cemetery suffered two setbacks in 1915. On January 28, the cemetery's old two-story wood office building burned to the ground. Maps, plot plans, and the blueprints for hundreds of mausoleums and monuments were lost. On May 20, Henry R. Hatch died suddenly, depriving Lake View of the energetic and visionary president who had led the organization since 1896.Hatch left a cemetery in excellent financial condition. Lake View was making so much money that cemetery was able to purchase $50,000 ($1,000,000 in 2019 dollars) worth of Liberty Loan bonds in 1917 to support the American cause in World War I. In a snapshot of the cemetery's financial success, the trustees reported that it made a surplus of $62,165 ($900,000 in 2019 dollars) in 1922. It had assets totaling $3,021,888 ($30.5 million in 2019 dollars), which included an endowment and sinking fund of $1,704,737 ($25.6 million in 2019 dollars). Its outstanding debts were $2,016,192 ($30.3 million in 2019 dollars).\n\n\n=== Modernization, ownership of the Garfield Memorial, and push east ===\n\nPart of the cemetery's success was attributed to its use of modern technology. For years, Lake View maintenance staff had used 50 lawn mowers and 30 hand-held scythe lawn trimmers. In 1917, the cemetery purchased a two-ton truck from the Acme Motor Truck Co. of Cadillac, Michigan. The truck was used to haul materials from Lake View's quarry around the cemetery for the construction of buildings and macadam roads and the setting of headstone foundations. By 1922, the cemetery also used Fordson tractors to dig graves, place monuments, clear snow, and maintain roads. About 1923, Lake View purchased two one-ton Ford trucks for general-duty use around the cemetery. Cemetery shops manufactured a \"tent wagon\", a \"grave wagon\" and both metal- and concrete-lined \"dump carts\". Originally developed in 1913, the dump carts were used to carry earth from graves. Up to six carts could be attached to a single Ford truck.In late October 1923, the Garfield National Monument Association turned the Garfield Memorial over to Lake View Cemetery. Most of the Monument Association's members had died, and its charter did not permit for a self-perpetuating board. After accepting title to the memorial and its land, Lake View Cemetery immediately ended the practice of charging a 10 cent ($2 in 2019 dollars) admission fee to the memorial. Lake View also began cleaning, repairing, and rehabilitating the memorial.Increasingly, Lake View Cemetery turned its attention to its Mayfield Road border and entrance. The city of Cleveland Heights, incorporated as a hamlet in 1901, included within its boundaries the southern portion of Lake View. Cleveland Heights grew very rapidly. Its population rose from 1,564 at the time of incorporation to 2,576 in 1910, a 64.7 percent increase. By 1920, Cleveland Heights had 15,264 residents, a six-fold increase. Cleveland Heights incorporated as a city in 1921. Lake View Cemetery was the burial ground of choice for the upper-middle class suburb. Although the Mayfield Road gate was locked, the cemetery gave keys to the gate to those Cleveland Heights residents who were lotholders.\n\n\n== Great Depression and war: 1929 to 1945 ==\nThe Great Depression put significant financial stress on Lake View Cemetery. Those who had purchased large lots often failed to keep up payments. Cemetery officials allowed them to sell back a portion of their lots in order to retain at least some burial ground. When the owners of large lots defaulted on their purchase contracts completely, Lake View threatened to disinter the bodies in the plot and move them to single-grave lots in another part of the cemetery and re-sell the large plot. The cemetery responded to the economic crisis with retrenchment as well. It lowered the price of a single grave by 20 percent, to $60 ($920 in 2019 dollars). The cemetery also cut wages for all maintenance workers and grave diggers making more than 55 cents an hour ($8 in 2019 dollars), and laid off 10 men. In response, workers organized a trade union in 1937 under the auspices of the Arborists and Landscapers Union, LIUNA Local 344, AFL.Manpower shortages hit Lake View Cemetery during World War II as laborers enlisted in the military or were drafted. To assist in the war effort, the cemetery allowed large portions of unused land to be converted into Victory gardens. Wartime inflation and the rapidly declining number of wealthy families in the Cleveland area hurt lot sales. The cemetery subsequently shifted its marketing efforts to focus on middle and working class families.\n\n\n== Latter half of the 20th century ==\nAs more people chose cremation as a burial option in the latter half of the 20th century, Lake View Cemetery responded by constructing and opening a cremains mausoleum in 1990. Any member of the public may purchase a niche in the mausoleum for cremains.\n\n\n== 21st century ==\nLake View Cemetery has been under persistent financial stress since the start of the new millennium. Operating deficits are common, and the LVCA has occasionally cut back services and staff. Even though the cemetery is a significant tourist attraction and the site of a presidential memorial, Lake View received no local, state, or federal funding as of 2017.In 2006, the Lake View Cemetery Foundation made education and tourism its top priorities. From 2001 to 2010, the number of individuals participating in officially sponsored foundation tours increased to 10,000 from 3,000, while the number of sponsored educational programs nearly doubled from 10 to 19.\n\n\n== About the cemetery ==\nThe garden cemetery is located in the \"heights\" area of Greater Cleveland, with a view of Lake Erie to the north. The burying ground had 285 acres (1.15 km2) of land in 2007, with more than 104,000 burials. There are two entrances, on Euclid Avenue and Mayfield Road.\n\n\n=== Governance ===\nThe nonprofit Lake View Cemetery Association owns and governs the cemetery. Originally, membership in the association was open to anyone who purchased a lot, making the association akin to a church or a club. Members elected a 20-member board of trustees (with four seats up each year), and a board secretary. The board met quarterly, while a five-member executive committee of the board met monthly. The board appointed the cemetery's president, vice president, and superintendent. Income from lot sales was used primarily to pay for staff salaries and the maintenance and improvement of the grounds. Among the many board and executive office positions, only the superintendent and the board secretary received pay.The Lake View Cemetery Association reincorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1926, with the LVCA now acting as a nonprofit association for the benefit for lotholders. Annual meetings of lotholders to elect directors and officers were no longer held. Instead, a self-perpetuating board of directors was elected which continues to own and govern the cemetery.\nLake View's annual budget in 2012 was $6.1 million ($6.79 million in 2019 dollars). Income from lots sales and services to families made up 60 percent of all cemetery revenue in 2001, and 80 percent of all revenue in 2012. Charitable contributions make up much of the remaining income. The Lake View Cemetery Foundation provides a significant portion of this charitable income. Foundation donations were 6 percent of all cemetery revenue in 2001, rising to 16 percent of all revenues in 2011. As of 2017, roughly half of the cemetery's annual costs were spent on maintaining the grounds, headstones, monuments, and mausoleums. The other half goes to staff and office operations.\n\n\n=== Leadership ===\nFollowing is a partial list of the presidents of the Lake View Cemetery Association. The president oversaw the day-to-day operations of the cemetery along with the superintendent.\n\nJeptha H. Wade, 1869 to 1879\nJoseph Perkins, 1879 to 1885 (his death)\nJeptha H. Wade, 1885 to 1890 (his death)\nWilliam Edwards, 1890 to 1893\nTimothy Doane Crocker, 1893 to 1896\nHenry R. Hatch, 1896 to 1915\nDouglas Perkins, 1915 to 1921 (his death)\nJerome B. Zerbe, 1921 to 1924\nFrancis F. Prentiss, 1925 to 1926\n\n\n=== Lake View Cemetery Foundation ===\nThe Lake View Cemetery Foundation was established by the Lake View Cemetery Association in 1986 as a 501(c)(13) organization. The foundation was originally chartered to raise money to repair and restore the James A. Garfield Memorial and to establish a fund for its ongoing maintenance. After the renovation was completed, the foundation expanded its goals to include enhancing, maintaining, and preserving the botanical gardens, buildings, horticulture, landscape, monuments, and areas at Lake View Cemetery to benefit the general public. The foundation's new mission specifically embraced education and outreach programs.Although the foundation provides assistance to the cemetery in maintaining historic buildings and monuments and historic or horticulturally significant aspects of the grounds, it is both separately governed and administered from the cemetery. The foundation's 2012 annual budget was $567,000 ($600,000 in 2019 dollars). Foundation assistance is not unrestricted, but targeted to meet the goals established by the foundation's board of directors and its strategic plan. Charitable donations make up roughly half of the foundation's annual income, although these can vary widely from year to year. Donations provided 65 percent of income in 2013. Investment income also varies considerably over time, but has averaged about 30 percent of all foundation revenues between 2002 and 2012. Service fee income is a relatively negligible 2 percent of all revenues.\n\n\n=== Notable sites and funerary monuments ===\nThe James A. Garfield Memorial is the most prominent point of interest at Lake View Cemetery. The ornate interior features a large marble statue, stained glass, bas relief, and various historical relics from Garfield's life and presidency. The monument also serves as a scenic observation deck and picnic area. President and Mrs. Garfield are entombed in the lower level crypt, their coffins placed side by side and visible to memorial visitors.\nLake View Cemetery is home to the Wade Memorial Chapel, which features an interior designed by Louis Tiffany. Behind the chapel is a large pond.\nThe cemetery is famous for its numerous statues of angels, sculpted in a Victorian style. A well-known memorial, the Angel of Death Victorious at the gravesite of the Haserot family, was created by sculptor Herman Matzen.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe cemetery is among those profiled in the 2005 PBS documentary A Cemetery Special.Scenes of the 2014 film Captain America: The Winter Soldier were filmed at the flood control dam at the cemetery.\n\n\n== Notable interments ==\nNotable people buried at Lake View Cemetery include:\n\nNewton D.

        "wiki": "The Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA) is an art museum in Cleveland, Ohio, located in the Wade Park District, in the University Circle neighborhood on the city's east side. Internationally renowned for its substantial holdings of Asian and Egyptian art, the museum houses a diverse permanent collection of more than 61,000 works of art from around the world. The museum provides general admission free to the public. With a $755 million endowment, it is the fourth-wealthiest art museum in the United States. With about 770,000 visitors annually (2018), it is one of the most visited art museums in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art was founded as a trust in 1913 with an endowment from prominent Cleveland industrialists Hinman Hurlbut, John Huntington, and Horace Kelley. The neoclassical, white Georgian Marble, Beaux-Arts building was constructed on the southern edge of Wade Park, at the cost of $1.25 million. Wade Park and the museum were designed by the local architectural firm, Hubbell & Benes, with the museum planned as the park's centerpiece. The 75-acre (300,000 m2) green space takes its name from philanthropist Jeptha H. Wade, who donated part of his wooded estate to the city in 1881. The museum opened its doors to the public on June 6, 1916, with Wade's grandson, Jeptha H. Wade II, proclaiming it, \"for the benefit of all people, forever\". Wade, like his grandfather, had a great interest in art and served as the museum's first vice-president; in 1920 he became its president. Today, the park, with the museum still as its centerpiece, is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n=== Mid to late 20th century expansion ===\n\nIn March 1958, the first addition to the building opened, doubling the museum's floorspace. This addition, which was on the north side of the original building, was designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Hayes and Ruth. They designed new gallery space and a new art library.\nThe museum again expanded in 1971 with the opening of the North Wing. With its stepped, two-toned granite facade, the addition designed by modernist architect Marcel Breuer provided angular lines in distinct contrast with the flourishes of the 1916 building's neoclassical facade. The museum's main entrance was shifted to the North Wing. The auditorium, classrooms, and lecture halls were also moved into the North Wing, allowing their spaces in the Original Building to be renovated as gallery space.\nIn 1983, a West Wing, designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Dalton, van Dijk, Johnson, & Partners, was completed. This provided larger library space, as well as nine new galleries.\nBetween 2001 and 2012, the 1958 and 1983 additions were demolished. A new wrap-around building, and east and west wings were constructed. Designed by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, this $350 million project doubled the museum's size to 592,000 square feet (55,000 m2). To integrate the new east and west wings with the Breuer building to the north, a new structure was built along the south side of the 1971 addition, creating extensive new gallery space on two levels, as well as providing for a museum store and other amenities. Vi\u00f1oly covered the space created by the demolition of the 1958 and 1983 structures with a glass-roofed atrium. The east wing opened in 2009, and the north wing and atrium in 2012. The West Wing opened on January 2, 2014.\n\n\n=== Expansion in the 21st century ===\n\nThe museum's building and renovation project, \"Building for the Future\", began in 2005 and was originally targeted for completion in 2012 (though it was not completed until 2013) at projected costs of $258 million. The museum celebrated the official completion of the renovation and expansion project with a grand opening celebration held on December 31, 2013, and additional activities that continued through the first week of 2014. The $350 million project\u2014two-thirds of which was earmarked for the complete renovation of the original 1916 structure\u2014added two new wings, and was the largest cultural project in Ohio's history. The new east and west wings, as well as the enclosing of the atrium courtyard under a soaring glass canopy, have brought the museum's total floor space to 592,000 square feet (55,000 m2) (an increase of approximately 65%).\nThe first phase of the project had $9.3 million in cost overruns; the opening was delayed by 9 months. Museum director Timothy Rub assured the public that the increase in quality would be worth both the wait and expense. In June 2008, after being closed for nearly three years for the overhaul, the museum reopened 19 of its permanent galleries to the public in the renovated 1916 building main floor.\nOn June 27, 2009, the newly constructed East Wing (which contains the Impressionist, Contemporary, and Modern art collections) opened to the public.\n\nOn June 26, 2010, the ground level of the 1916 building reopened. It now houses the collections of Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Sub-Saharan African, Byzantine, and Medieval art.\nThe expanded museum includes enhanced visitor amenities, such as new restrooms, an expanded store and caf\u00e9, a sit-down gourmet restaurant, parking capacity increased to 620 spaces, and a 34,000 square feet (3,200 m2) glass-covered courtyard.\n\n\n== Wade Park ==\n\nWade Park includes an outdoor gallery displaying part of the museum's holdings in the Wade Park Fine Arts Garden. The bulk of this collection is located between the original 1916 main entrance to the building and the lagoon. Highlights of the public sculpture include the large cast of Chester Beach's 1927 Fountain of the Waters; a monument to the Polish expatriate and American Revolutionary War-hero Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko; and the 1928 bronze statuary sundial by Frank Jirouch, Night Passing the Earth to Day, which sits across Wade Lagoon from the museum, near the park's entrance on Euclid Avenue.\nAuguste Rodin's The Thinker is installed at the top of the museum's main staircase. After being partially destroyed in a 1970 bombing (allegedly by the Weathermen), the statue was never restored. Art historians knew that Rodin was involved in the original casting of this sculpture. The 1970 damage (noted on a plaque since mounted at the base of the statue's pedestal) is considered to have made this casting unique among the more than twenty original large castings of this work.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art divides its collections into 16 departments, including Chinese Art, Modern European Art, African Art, Drawings, Prints, European Art, Textiles and Islamic Art, American Painting and Sculpture, Greek and Roman Art, Contemporary Art, Medieval Art, Decorative Art and Design, Pre-Columbian and Native North American Art, Japanese and Korean Art, Indian and Southeast Asian Art, and Photography. Artists represented by significant works include Olivuccio di Ciccarello, Botticelli, Giambattista Pittoni, Caravaggio, El Greco, Poussin, Rubens, Frans Hals, Gerard David, Goya, J.M.W. Turner, Dal\u00ed, Matisse, Renoir, Gauguin (The Call), Frederic Edwin Church, Thomas Cole, Corot, Thomas Eakins, Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Picasso, and George Bellows. The Museum has been active recently in acquiring later 20th-century art, having added important works by Warhol, Jackson Pollock, Christo, Anselm Kiefer, Ronald Davis, Larry Poons, Leon Kossoff, Jack Whitten, Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Chuck Close, Robert Mangold, Ching Ho Cheng, Mark Tansey and Sol LeWitt, among others.\nThe museum's African art collection consists of 300 traditional, sub-Saharan works from the Bini, Congo, Senufo, and Yoruba peoples, mostly donated by Cleveland collector Katherine C. White. The museum is especially strong in the field of Asian art, possessing one of the best collections in the U.S.In June 2004, the museum acquired an ancient bronze sculpture of Apollo Sauroktonos, believed to be an original work by Praxiteles of Athens. Because the work has a contested provenance, the museum continues to study the dating and attribution of the sculpture. In 2011, Michael Bennet, the Greek and Roman arts curator, announced that he had dated the piece to 350 B.C. to 250 B.C. In 2013, the museum held a focus exhibition on the statue. It announced reattribution of the work as Apollo the Python-Slayer, and said that the statue was almost certainly an original work by Praxiteles himself, and that laboratory investigations and expert testimony conclusively show the bronze was neither a recent discovery nor recovered from the sea.In 2008, the United States Postal Service selected the Cleveland Museum's famed Botticelli painting entitled Virgin and Child with the Young John the Baptist as the Christmas stamp for that year.\n\n\n=== Modern European Painting and Sculpture ===\n\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art's Modern European Painting and Sculpture collection holds pieces dating from 1800 to 1960, and contains about 537 pieces. The collection contains Impressionism and Post-impressionism works, avant-garde art styles, and German Expressionism and Neuesachlichkeit art.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== European Painting and Sculpture ===\nThis collection holds pieces dating from 1500 to 1800, with major works representing Italian Baroque, Spanish Baroque, Italian Renaissance, as well as significant French, British, and Dutch paintings.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== American Painting and Sculpture ===\nThe collection is concise, containing about 300 paintings and 90 sculptures. Major attractions in the collection include William Sideny Mount's The Power of Music, Frederich Edwin Church's Twilight in the Wilderness, and Albert Pinkham Ryder's The Racetrack (Death on a Pale Horse). A number of Cleveland-based artists are also included in the museum's holdings, placing an emphasis on local art.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Photography ===\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art contains a small collection of fine art photography, dating back to 1893. What makes the collection are the pieces from photography's first contributors, particularly French, English, and American photographers. Other highlights of the collection are \"photography with complete sets of The North American Indian by Edward S. Curtis and Camera Work; surrealist photography created primarily between the two world wars; and Cleveland-specific subject matter produced by regional and national photographers\".\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Decorative Art and Design ===\nAn internationally renowned collection, the Decorative Art and Design collection \"consists of useful objects in which the form and decoration are the primary focus, not objects intended purely as sculpture\"\n\n\n=== Ingalls Library ===\nIn addition to its comprehensive collection of fine art, the Cleveland Museum of Art is also home to the Ingalls Library, one of the largest art libraries in the United States. As part of the initial 1913 plan by the museum's founders, a library of 10,000 volumes was to be assembled, to include photographs and archival works. By the 1950s, the collection of books alone had surpassed 37,000 and the photographic collection neared 47,000. By the 21st century, the library had more than 500,000 volumes (and 500,000 digitized slides); renovation of the library space was one of the focal points in the museum's $350 million expansion.\n\n\n=== ARTLENS Gallery ===\n\nThe ARTLENS Gallery is a series of interactive displays and a mobile app that allow visitors to view and interact with the museum's digitized collection. ARTLENS is divided into four components:\nThe ArtLens Wall is a 40-foot display that lets visitors browse and scale all works that are displayed in the museum, as well as some artworks that are not. The wall rotates through artworks in groups organized by criteria such as type, shape, and color.\nThe ArtLens Exhibition is a rotating selection of artworks that are showcased through digital gesture-based games and activities. Examples of these activities are automatically matching the shape of a user's hand gestures to an artwork, or having the user imitate poses found in various works, which are then scored for accuracy.\nThe ArtLens Studio is a series of digital studios for visitors to make their own artwork, such as creating digital pottery by mimicking a potter's movements, or creating collages from images provided by the museum.\nThe ArtLens mobile application provides information about the museum and lists of all its artworks. The app is able to communicate via Bluetooth to beacons located throughout the museum to determine the user's location, and allows the user to mark and save artworks they come across. The app connects to the previously mentioned ArtLens Exhibition and Wall.Following the launch of ARTLENS, the Cleveland Museum of Art conducted a two-year study to see how the gallery impacts visitor engagement. Surveys from November 2017 and January 2018 of 438 ARTLENS visitors found that 76% of viewers felt that the gallery \"enhanced their overall museum experience\"; 74% felt that it \"encouraged them to look closely at art and notice new things\"; and 73% said that it \"increased their interest in the museum's collection.\" Museum visitors born between 1981 and 1996 were 15% more likely to visit the gallery compared to older individuals. The ARTLENS system also gathers analytical data; the time patrons spent looking at artworks went from an average of two-to-three seconds to fifteen seconds.\n\n\n== Programs ==\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art also maintains a schedule of special exhibitions, lectures, films and musical programs. The department of performing arts, music and film hosts a film series and the museum's Performing Arts Series, which brings the creative energies of internationally renowned artists into Cleveland.\nThe department of education at CMA creates programs for lifelong learning from lectures, talks and studio classes to outreach programs and community events, such as Parade the Circle\", Chalk Festival and the \"Winter Lights Lantern Festival\". Educational programs include distance learning, \"Art to Go\", and the \"Educator's Academy\". The museum is also home to the Ingalls Library, one of the largest art museum libraries in the United States with over 500,000 volumes.\n\n\n=== Open Access collection materials ===\n\nIn January 2019, the Cleveland Museum of Art announced that it was waiving its rights to \"roughly 30,000 of the 61,328 objects in its permanent collection considered to be in the public domain\". They are using the Creative Commons \u2013 Zero license for high-resolution images and data about its collection. Additionally, metadata for more than 61,000 pieces in its collection have been made available. The Open Access material is available on a special section of the museum website.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== Attendance ===\nThe museum reported attendance of 597,715 during the period between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014, the highest total in more than a decade. In 2018, the museum had a record 769,435 visitors, replacing the previous record of 719,620 in 1987.\n\n\n=== Finance ===\nIn 1958, a $35-million bequest by industrialist Leonard C. Hanna Jr. vaulted the Cleveland Museum of Art into the ranks of the country's richest art museums. Today, the museum receives operating support from the Ohio Arts Council through state tax dollars. It is also funded by Cuyahoga County residents through Cuyahoga Arts and Culture. The museum derives around two thirds of its $36 million budget from interest on its endowment, which was reported as $750 million in 2014. The museum has an acquisition fund of $277 million, from which it draws about $13 million a year for purchase of works for its collections.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe museum has also taken an active role in presenting music concerts and lectures. These include performances by Chanticleer (ensemble), Roomful of Teeth, and John Luther Adams among others.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Directors ===\nWilliam M. Griswold (2014\u2013)\nFred Bidwell (2013\u20132014, interim director)\nDavid Franklin (2010\u20132013)\nDeborah Gribbon (2009\u20132010, interim director)\nTimothy Rub (2006\u20132009)\nKatharine Lee Reid (2000\u20132006)\nKate Sellars (1999\u20132000, interim director)\nRobert P. Bergman (1993\u20131999)\nEvan H. Turner (1983\u20131993)\nDr. Sherman E. Lee (1958\u20131982)\nWilliam M.

It takes 20 minutes to go through the entire museum, maybe 40 if you're really pausing to enjoy and digest the artwork. Not worth the money. Go to the Cleveland Museum of art instead much more worth it.",
          "Receptionist was very helpful, other staff members were awkward. The gallery was great. I'm a biologist and the items on display were primarily themed to the great lakes so this was even more enjoyable for people like myself.",
          "1st time in Museum!! Very interesting and visually delightful!! One particular visual digitalization of satellite images of the region that are magnified down to street level!!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Thought provoking neuvo art pieces;mind stimulation!!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
          "Ended up heading here on a gray mother's day afternoon. Brought the family and moCa ended up making the day much less gray. Fun exhibits, live singer, and we all walked away a little enlightened. Keep up the good work moCa, we'll certainly visit again soon.",
          "The yellow staircase is awesome and the room with all of the drawings with the great playlist",
          "Always have a great time at MOCA!",
          "Great Gallery, on the Museum reciprocity list also. The structure itself you do not want to miss!",
          "I'll give it 4 ,because of the staff working there  .\nWhat happened to the art ? \nNot sure  .\nThe building is amazing outside  , courtyard is spacious, though looking above to the apartments be careful not to overreact when seeing what can be described as eye catching, not sure if appropriate for kids  so looking first is recommended  .",
          "This a a great musuem with a variety of exhibits and ways to bring it's guests into the conversation and expland the experience. Love the events like Think Like An Artist. We just keep exploring and experiencing the mixture of classic and \u2026",
          "Great collection of pieces, had a great experience overall. Didn't feel over crowded like you would in most art museums, able to admire and take it all in at your own pace.",
          "Its alright. Nice looking in the outside. Not much on the inside. Parking is a hassle & not really field trip friendly.",
          "A very different look at gallery space cery angular",
          "Contemporary art is definitely something you either really like or you don't care for at all and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Cleveland is no exception. If you know you like modern art, then I would highly recommend the museum, but if \u2026",
          "It's modern art, big gallery of confusion",
          "Great space, we really loved mingwei Lee's lecture and exhibits. Wonderful that entry is free, making art accessible to all!",
          "Wonderful time at an event held at this venue.  Great city vibe. So much to do, so little time.",
          "It was cool but the art works were a little underwhelming. The architecture of the building was cooler to me than some of the pieces",
          "This is a great museum. Some people might complain about the price considering it is a very small space, but it is worth it. There are two floors of exhibits. There is also a very nice children's area with some books and activities. The staff was very nice and helpful.",
          "Small and simple places",
          "This is such a joy. family day was great. Kids painted they had activitys for everyone. Free pizza and salad and Greg and his staff were warm and they made us feel like family.",

          "I can't tell you how much I love this place I go here with my best friend for silent discos and they are always on point. There is super friendly the music is always chill the artwork that they have whatever season it is is amazing I highly recommend this place",
          "This is a wonderful museum with ever changing exhibits. I don't always love everything but there's always something to appreciate. The building is very interesting architecturally and there are plenty of open spaces for events. They also have free first Saturdays and a free party at the beginning of the season. Wonderful.",
          "The exhibit we were very excited to see was closed for repairs.  Incredibly misleading and nobody there seemed concerned about our disappointing experience. We comforted ourselves with retail therapy.  Thankful there was some beautiful jewelry in the gift shop.",
          "Can't belive how big it was. We could have spent 2 days there. Looking at the art. All the people working there were very knowledgeable and always had fun facts to share with us.\nJust a reminder... No back packs. Kids must be close by.\nYou can take photos just no flash.\nI would go back and spend more Time there",
          "I love the visit",
          "Loved this place.  It was beautiful and unique inside and out. The staff was friendly and helpful.  Well worth the visit.",
          "An interesting museum ....NO CHARGE",
          "Had a lovely time walking around the gallery. During my visit there was a workshop with a teacher and clothed figure model. How wonderful such an opportunity was available for the community! It wasquite a suprise that a contemporary muesum \u2026",
          "Really nice place. Its new to the University Circle area. The shape of the building it the very first thing that steals your attention. I was there for a party. Really nice building.",
          "This is yet another great place to visit in Cleveland!",
          "Worth the trip,  fun and stimulating.",
          "Liked what we saw. However, there was very little on display.",
          "Fun place to stop in and spent an hour or so!",
          "An awesome place with some interesting art. I wish there was a bit more to it, but it's a nice place to stop in for small trip. It's in a very nice location that being a small trip is sort of nice. Get food, drinks, then swing by for some art!",
          "They're a little hit or miss on their AR experience and despite being quite large and imposing on the outside, this particular museum doesn't have many exhibits. It really only had 4 or 5 exhibits, albeit, all of them were large scale. I \u2026",
          "Lots of space not used  - weried square toilet seats",
          "I really enjoyed the different installations of art. Easy space to navigate.  I wanted to buy everything in the museum store.  Liked that you could produce some art of your own on the third floor in response to the installations.",
          "Good place to kill some time.",
          "Building was cool. I just like a little more soul in my art. Also small gallery space, was expecting so much more, I've been to museums that have had less space and packed in tons of works.",
          "I know some people love opera, while others prefer gangsta rap. I personally love lots of styles of music but don't like either of those two styles. I guess fine art is the same. I love the impressionists, the masters, and enjoy cubist and \u2026",
          "The paintings that were available were beautiful but I expected more displays the building is too big you have such small display",
          "Guess contemporary art is just not my thing",
          "Really nice place for you to go see artwork",
          "One of the better museums in the US.",
          "Best free art museum in the country.",
          "Third floor has a great hands on art lab for children to create and display their work",
          "The building itself is incredible. A good mix of multimedia contemporary art to view.",
          "Great exhibit but sparse for admission",
          "Overall a great experience! Parking can be found right behind from Mayfield Road, however it's only free for an hour.",
          "Ok, but not great. The guides/staff are not always the best, and while the architecture of the building is interesting, it doesn\u2019t lend itself that well to having a large amount of gallery space inside.  Parking can be a bit difficult if not familiar with the area.",
          "What a big disappointment! I had so much expectation to see cool contemporary arts but literally there was only 5-6 art pieces and that\u2019s it! I was shocked! What a waste of such a great building. Thankfully, I did not pay for admission! First Saturday of every month admission is free.",
          "Nice art work just not a lot art",
          "Free 1st Saturdays! What a great idea to see contemporary art.",
          "Interesting things inside",
          "Beautiful building in a beautiful part of town. Underwhelmed by the lack of exhibits. Cleveland museum of art is much better and free.",
          "Great building and wonderful collection of art. Came during the kusama exhibit and was very impressed with the setup, ease of waiting in line for each infinity room, and staff friendliness and knowledge when explaining specific pieces.",
          "This place was seriously magical for my kids!",
          "Give the museum a big hand, it was great!",
          "My trip to MOCA happened earlier this year during the month of June 2018. As soon as I entered the museum, I was welcomed by their staff and I was given a brief introduction to the museum. Then, I started to explore the museum on my own. As \u2026",
          "I have been there twice this year and plan to go again.  I had a fun time. My son told me about it. It is tops about 2 hours.  I love the small gift shop.  They have some really cool stuff!!  It is also great to have lunch at one of the unique local restaurants.  Easy, close parking.",
          "Great time! My toddler really enjoyed herself! I would definitely return.",
          "It was terrible and had no art!!! Go to the original Cleveland Art Museum",
          "Free admission and free to leave. Galleries were kinds empty only one floor really had anything and for the most part not that great.",
          "I like MOCA!  Let's be realistic:  if you buy a beer and fries, that's $8.  I've seen stupendous installations there, just one floor can make the trip worthwhile.  It hosts a revolving display of contemporary international art that \u2026",
          "Okay as far as museums go. Didn't hold my attention long. Also I wish there was more info on each exhibit.",
          "If a person on the street asks me how to get to MOCA I point in its direction and say \"It's the building that looks like an ancient space cube filled with women wearing very unique handmade ear rings\". I like to go to the rascal house pizza \u2026",

          "Love the gift shop! They always have products that relate to the shows",
          "Definitely very modern.",
          "Refreshing to be surrounded  by art & people who are truly interested in it. People watching was at the top of my list, wasn't  disappointed. Found out they will accommodate  weddings receptions.Nice. Dance  ensembles  practice outside, you can get in a free preformance!",
          "Although this is a small museum, their collection is not permanent, and travels. This means that there will usually always be something new when you go. I was able to see Lu Yang's Delusional Mandala, and much more. I've been to the \u2026",
          "The architecture of MoCa inspired to create these drawings!  Thank you for inspiring my art!  I plan on visiting again soon!",

          "Great interactive exhibits",

          "Wow! Less than nothing worth seeing.",
          "Not a whole lot of art to see and enjoy.  Rather deceptive based on the building size",

          "Nice but not worth the money not enough art",
          "First of all, the exhibition was very good. MOCA didn't have much to show but everything they displayed was of very high quality. But what makes me give it 5 star is what they did after I left my camera there. \n\nI left my camera in an \u2026",

          "It was very nice I truly enjoyed myself",
          "I saw Mark Mothersbaugh's exhibition there. It was free admission for the museum and the concert area just outside the building, which has a very interesting architecture. I'd definitely recommend anyone to check it out.",
          "Very trendy art space we love the outdoor concerts  on the loading doc on Fridays",
          "We got in free and still felt cheated! The museum store was infinitely better than the museum itself. Stop in at Mitchel's Icecream afterwards and you'll feel less bad.",
          "Amazing space!",

          "The experience in MOCA Cleveland was unique.",
          "Not impressed by any means.  I have been to many museums across the country and this one does not do anything impressive.  It's empty and some of the artwork that is there (from the art school or local) looks like it was done by a 5yr old.  People are drawn to the look of the place and that's it",

        "wiki": "Cleveland ( KLEEV-l\u0259nd), officially the City of Cleveland, is a major city in the U.S. state of Ohio, and the county seat of Cuyahoga County. The city proper has a population of 381,009, making it the 53rd-largest city in the United States and the second-largest city in Ohio. Greater Cleveland is ranked as the 33rd-largest metropolitan area in the U.S., with 2,057,009 people in 2018. A Gamma + city, Cleveland anchors the Cleveland\u2013Akron\u2013Canton Combined Statistical Area, which had a population of 3,515,646 in 2010 and is ranked 15th in the United States.\nThe city is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie, across the U.S. maritime border with Canada and approximately 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of the Ohio-Pennsylvania state border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River by General Moses Cleaveland. It became a manufacturing center due to its location on both the river and the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy relies on diversified sectors such as manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, biomedicals, and higher education, and the city ranks 31st in the nation per economic output, with a GDP of $134 billion in 2018.The city's major cultural institutions include the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Cleveland Orchestra, Playhouse Square, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Known as \"The Forest City\" among many other nicknames, Cleveland serves as the center of the Cleveland Metroparks nature reserve system.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nCleveland was established on July 22, 1796, by surveyors of the Connecticut Land Company when they laid out Connecticut's Western Reserve into townships and a capital city. They named the new settlement \"Cleaveland\" after their leader, General Moses Cleaveland. Cleaveland oversaw the New England-style design of the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on Public Square, before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first permanent settler in Cleaveland was Lorenzo Carter, who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River.The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814. In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, the town's waterfront location proved to be an advantage, giving it access to Great Lakes trade. It grew rapidly after the 1832 completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal. This key link between the Ohio River and the Great Lakes connected it to the Atlantic Ocean via the Erie Canal and Hudson River, and later via the St. Lawrence Seaway. Its products could reach markets on the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. The town's growth continued with added railroad links.In 1831, the spelling of the town's name was altered by The Cleveland Advertiser newspaper. In order to fit the name on the newspaper's masthead, the editors dropped the first \"a\", reducing the city's name to Cleveland, which eventually became the official spelling. In 1836, Cleveland was officially incorporated as a city.  That same year, Cleveland, then only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring Ohio City over a bridge connecting the two communities. Ohio City remained an independent municipality until its annexation by Cleveland in 1854.\n\n\n=== Growth and expansion ===\n\nCleveland served as an important center for the Union during the American Civil War. After the war, the city witnessed rapid growth. Its prime geographic location as a transportation hub between the East Coast and the Midwest played an important role in its development as a commercial center. Cleveland served as a destination for iron ore shipped from Minnesota, along with coal transported by rail. In 1870, John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in Cleveland. In 1885, he moved its headquarters to New York City, which had become a center of finance and business.By the early 20th century, Cleveland had emerged as a major American manufacturing center. Its businesses included automotive companies such as Peerless, People's, Jordan, Chandler, and Winton, maker of the first car driven across the U.S. Other manufacturers in Cleveland produced steam-powered cars, which included White and Gaeth, as well as the electric car company Baker.\n\nKnown as the \"Sixth City\" due to its position as the sixth largest U.S. city at the time, Cleveland counted major Progressive Era politicians among its leaders, most prominently the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson, who was responsible for the development of the Cleveland Mall Plan.  The era of the City Beautiful movement in Cleveland architecture, this period also saw wealthy patrons support the establishment of the city's major cultural institutions. The most prominent among them were the Cleveland Museum of Art, which opened in 1916, and the Cleveland Orchestra, established in 1918.Cleveland's economic growth and industrial jobs attracted large waves of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Ireland.  African American migrants from the rural South also arrived in Cleveland (among other Northeastern and Midwestern cities) as part of the Great Migration for jobs, constitutional rights, and relief from racial discrimination.By 1920, the year in which the Cleveland Indians won their first World Series championship, Cleveland had grown into a densely-populated metropolis of 796,841 with a foreign-born population of 30%, making it the fifth largest city in the nation. At this time, Cleveland saw the rise of radical labor movements in response to the conditions of the largely immigrant and migrant workers. In 1919, the city attracted national attention amid the First Red Scare for the Cleveland May Day Riots, in which socialist demonstrators clashed with anti-socialists.Despite the immigration restrictions of 1921 and 1924, the city's population continued to grow throughout the 1920s. Prohibition first took effect in Ohio in May 1919 (although it was not well-enforced in Cleveland), became law with the Volstead Act in 1920, and was eventually repealed nationally by Congress in 1933.  The ban on alcohol led to the rise of speakeasies throughout the city and organized crime gangs, such as the Mayfield Road Mob, who smuggled bootleg liquor across Lake Erie from Canada into Cleveland. The Roaring Twenties also saw the establishment of Cleveland's Playhouse Square and the rise of the risqu\u00e9 Short Vincent entertainment district. The Bal-Masque balls of the avant-garde Kokoon Arts Club scandalized the city. Jazz came to prominence in Cleveland during this period.\n\nIn 1929, the city hosted the first of many National Air Races. Construction of the Terminal Tower skyscraper commenced in 1926 and, by the time it was dedicated in 1930, Cleveland had a population of over 900,000.  The era of the flapper also marked the beginning of the golden age in Downtown Cleveland retail, centered on major department stores Higbee's, Bailey's, the May Company, Taylor's, Halle's, and Sterling Lindner Davis, which collectively represented one of the largest and most fashionable shopping districts in the country, often compared to New York's Fifth Avenue.Cleveland was hit hard by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. A center of union activity, the city was aided by major federal works projects sponsored by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 at the city's North Coast Harbor, along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived by Cleveland's business leaders as a way to revitalize the city during the Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937.On December 7, 1941, Imperial Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and declared war on the United States. One of the victims of the attack was a Cleveland native, Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd.  The attack signaled America's entry into World War II.  A major hub of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\", Cleveland under Mayor Frank Lausche contributed massively to the U.S. war effort as the fifth largest manufacturing center in the nation.  During his tenure, Lausche also oversaw the establishment of the Cleveland Transit System, the predecessor to the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority.\n\n\n=== Late 20th and early 21st centuries ===\nAfter the war, Cleveland initially experienced an economic boom, and businesses declared the city to be the \"best location in the nation.\" In 1949, the city was named an All-America City for the first time and, in 1950, its population reached 914,808.  In sports, the Indians won the 1948 World Series, the hockey team, the Barons, became champions of the American Hockey League, and the Browns dominated professional football in the 1950s. As a result, along with track and boxing champions produced, Cleveland was declared the \"City of Champions\" in sports at this time. The 1950s also saw the rising popularity of a new music genre that local WJW (AM) disc jockey Alan Freed dubbed \"rock and roll.\"\n\nHowever, by the 1960s, Cleveland's economy began to slow down, and residents increasingly sought new housing in the suburbs, reflecting the national trends of suburban growth following federally subsidized highways.  Industrial restructuring, particularly in the railroad and steel industries, resulted in the loss of numerous jobs in Cleveland and the region, and the city suffered economically. The burning of the Cuyahoga River in June 1969 brought national attention to the issue of industrial pollution in Cleveland and served as a catalyst for the American environmental movement.Housing discrimination and redlining against African Americans led to racial unrest in Cleveland and numerous other Northern U.S. cities. In Cleveland, the Hough riots erupted from July 18 to 23, 1966 and the Glenville Shootout took place from July 23 to 25, 1968. In November 1967, Cleveland became the first major American city to elect an African American mayor, Carl B. Stokes, who served from 1968 to 1971.In December 1978, during the turbulent tenure of Dennis Kucinich as mayor, Cleveland became the first major American city since the Great Depression to enter into a financial default on federal loans. By the beginning of the 1980s, several factors, including changes in international free trade policies, inflation, and the Savings and Loans Crisis, contributed to the recession that severely affected cities like Cleveland. While unemployment during the period peaked in 1983, Cleveland's rate of 13.8% was higher than the national average due to the closure of several steel production centers.The city began a gradual economic recovery under mayor George V. Voinovich in the 1980s. The downtown area saw the construction of the Key Tower and 200 Public Square skyscrapers, as well as the development of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex\u2014consisting of Progressive Field and Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse\u2014and the North Coast Harbor, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, FirstEnergy Stadium, and the Great Lakes Science Center. The city emerged from default in 1987.By the turn of the 21st century, Cleveland succeeded in developing a more diversified economy and gained a national reputation as a center for healthcare and the arts. Additionally, it has become a national leader in environmental protection, with its successful cleanup of the Cuyahoga River. The city's downtown has experienced dramatic economic and population growth since 2010. In 2018, the population of Cleveland began to flatten after decades of decline. However, challenges still remain for the city, with economic development of neighborhoods, improvement of city schools, and continued encouragement of new immigration to Cleveland being top municipal priorities. Despite such challenges, Cleveland has become increasingly recognized by national media as a city on the upswing. This trend has been accompanied by major victories in sports, most prominently the victory of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals, the first major professional sports championship won by a Cleveland team since 1964.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 82.47 square miles (213.60 km2), of which 77.70 square miles (201.24 km2) is land and 4.77 square miles (12.35 km2) is water.\nThe shore of Lake Erie is 569 feet (173 m) above sea level; however, the city lies on a series of irregular bluffs lying roughly parallel to the lake. In Cleveland these bluffs are cut principally by the Cuyahoga River, Big Creek, and Euclid Creek.\nThe land rises quickly from the lake shores elevation of 569 feet. Public Square, less than one mile (1.6 km) inland, sits at an elevation of 650 feet (198 m), and Hopkins Airport, 5 miles (8 km) inland from the lake, is at an elevation of 791 feet (241 m).Cleveland borders several inner-ring and streetcar suburbs.  To the west, it borders Lakewood, Rocky River, and Fairview Park, and to the east, it borders Shaker Heights, Cleveland Heights, South Euclid, and East Cleveland. To the southwest, it borders Linndale, Brooklyn, Parma, and Brook Park. The city also borders Newburgh Heights, Cuyahoga Heights, and Brooklyn Heights to the south, and Warrensville Heights, Maple Heights, and Garfield Heights to the southeast. To the northeast, along the shore of Lake Erie, Cleveland borders Bratenahl and Euclid.\n\n\n=== Cityscapes ===\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nCleveland's downtown architecture is diverse. Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including City Hall, the Cuyahoga County Courthouse, the Cleveland Public Library, and Public Auditorium, are clustered around the open Cleveland Mall and share a common neoclassical architecture. Built in the early 20th century, they are the result of the 1903 Group Plan. They constitute one of the most complete examples of City Beautiful design in the United States.The Terminal Tower, dedicated in 1930, was the tallest building in North America outside New York City until 1964 and the tallest in the city until 1991. It is a prototypical Beaux-Arts skyscraper. The two newer skyscrapers on Public Square, Key Tower (currently the tallest building in Ohio) and the 200 Public Square, combine elements of Art Deco architecture with postmodern designs. Cleveland's architectural treasures also include the Cleveland Trust Company Building, completed in 1907 and renovated in 2015 as a downtown Heinen's supermarket, and the Cleveland Arcade (sometimes called the Old Arcade), a five-story arcade built in 1890 and renovated in 2001 as a Hyatt Regency Hotel.Running east from Public Square through University Circle is Euclid Avenue, which was known for its prestige and elegance as a residential street. In the late 1880s, writer Bayard Taylor described it as \"the most beautiful street in the world\". Known as \"Millionaires' Row\", Euclid Avenue was world-renowned as the home of such major figures as John D. Rockefeller, Mark Hanna, and John Hay.Cleveland's landmark ecclesiastical architecture includes the historic Old Stone Church in downtown Cleveland and the onion domed St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Tremont, along with myriad ethnically inspired Roman Catholic churches.\n\n\n=== Parks and nature ===\n\nKnown locally as the \"Emerald Necklace\", the Olmsted-inspired Cleveland Metroparks encircle Cleveland and Cuyahoga County. The city proper is home to the Metroparks' Brookside and Lakefront Reservations, as well as significant parts of the Rocky River, Washington, and Euclid Creek Reservations. The Lakefront Reservation, which provides public access to Lake Erie, consists of four parks: Edgewater Park, Whiskey Island\u2013Wendy Park, East 55th Street Marina, and Gordon Park. Three more parks fall under the jurisdiction of the Euclid Creek Reservation: Euclid Beach, Villa Angela, and Wildwood Marina. Bike and hiking trails in the Brecksville and Bedford Reservations, along with Garfield Park further north, provide access to trails in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The extensive system of trails within Cuyahoga Valley National Park extends south into Summit County, offering access to Summit Metro Parks as well. Also included in the system is the renowned Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, established in 1882. Located in Big Creek valley, the zoo has one of the largest collection of primates in North America.The Cleveland Metroparks provides ample opportunity for outdoor recreational activities. Hiking and biking trails, including single track mountain bike trails, wind extensively throughout the parks. Rock climbing is available at Whipp\u2019s Ledges at the Hinckley Reservation. During the summer months, kayakers, paddle boarders, and rowing and sailing crews can be seen on the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie. In the winter months, downhill skiing, snowboarding, and tubing are available not far from downtown at the Boston Mills, Brandywine and Alpine Valley Ski resorts.\nIn addition to the Metroparks, Cleveland Public Parks District oversees the city's neighborhood parks, the largest of which is the historic Rockefeller Park, notable for its late 19th century landmark bridges, Rockefeller Park Greenhouse, and Cleveland Cultural Gardens, which celebrate the city's ethnic diversity. Just outside of Rockefeller Park, the Cleveland Botanical Garden in University Circle, established in 1930, is the oldest civic garden center in the nation. Located in the historic FirstEnergy Powerhouse in the Flats, the Greater Cleveland Aquarium is the only independent, free-standing aquarium in the state of Ohio.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nDowntown Cleveland is centered on Public Square and includes a wide range of districts. It contains the traditional Financial District and Civic Center, as well as the Cleveland Theater District, which is home to Playhouse Square Center. Downtown also historically included the lively Short Vincent entertainment district, which emerged in the 1920s and reached its height in the 1940s and 1950s. Today the former Short Vincent forms part of the Financial District. Mixed-use neighborhoods, such as the Flats and the Warehouse District, are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units, in the form of condominiums, lofts, and apartments, has been on the increase since 2000 and especially 2010. Recent developments include the revival of the Flats, the Euclid Corridor Project, and the developments along East 4th Street.\n\nClevelanders geographically define themselves in terms of whether they live on the east or west side of the Cuyahoga River. The East Side includes the neighborhoods of Buckeye\u2013Shaker, Central, Collinwood, Corlett, Euclid\u2013Green, Fairfax, Forest Hills, Glenville, Goodrich\u2013Kirtland Park (with Asiatown), Hough, Kinsman, Lee\u2013Miles, Mount Pleasant, Nottingham, St. Clair-Superior, Union\u2013Miles Park, University Circle (with Little Italy), and Woodland Hills. The West Side includes the neighborhoods of Brooklyn Centre, Clark\u2013Fulton, Detroit\u2013Shoreway, Cudell, Edgewater, Ohio City, Tremont, Old Brooklyn, Stockyards, West Boulevard, and the four neighborhoods colloquially known as West Park: Kamm's Corners, Jefferson, Bellaire\u2013Puritas, and Hopkins. Three neighborhoods in the Cuyahoga Valley are sometimes referred to as the South Side: Industrial Valley, Broadway\u2013Slavic Village, and Tremont.\nSeveral neighborhoods have begun to attract the return of the middle class that left the city for the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. These neighborhoods are on both the West Side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit-Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the East Side (Collinwood, Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy). Much of the growth has been spurred on by attracting creative class members, which in turn is spurring new residential development. A live-work zoning overlay for the city's near East Side has facilitated the transformation of old industrial buildings into loft spaces for artists.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTypical of the Great Lakes region, Cleveland exhibits a continental climate with four distinct seasons, which lies in the humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfa) zone. Summers are warm and humid while winters are cold and snowy. The Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east\u2013west from the mouth of the Cuyahoga west to Sandusky, but at the mouth of the Cuyahoga it turns sharply northeast. This feature is the principal contributor to the lake effect snow that is typical in Cleveland (especially on the city's East Side) from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, usually in late January or early February. The lake effect also causes a relative differential in geographical snowfall totals across the city: while Hopkins Airport, on the city's far West Side, has only reached 100 inches (254 cm) of snowfall in a season three times since record-keeping for snow began in 1893, seasonal totals approaching or exceeding 100 inches (254 cm) are not uncommon as the city ascends into the Heights on the east, where the region known as the 'Snow Belt' begins. Extending from the city's East Side and its suburbs, the Snow Belt reaches up the Lake Erie shore as far as Buffalo.The all-time record high in Cleveland of 104 \u00b0F (40 \u00b0C) was established on June 25, 1988, and the all-time record low of \u221220 \u00b0F (\u221229 \u00b0C) was set on January 19, 1994. On average, July is the warmest month with a mean temperature of 73.5 \u00b0F (23.1 \u00b0C), and January, with a mean temperature of 28.1 \u00b0F (\u22122.2 \u00b0C), is the coldest. Normal yearly precipitation based on the 30-year average from 1981 to 2010 is 39.1 inches (990 mm). The least precipitation occurs on the western side and directly along the lake, and the most occurs in the eastern suburbs. Parts of Geauga County to the east receive over 44 inches (1,100 mm) of liquid precipitation annually.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 396,698 people, 167,490 households, and 89,821 families residing in the city. The population density was 5,107.0 inhabitants per square mile (1,971.8/km2). There were 207,536 housing units at an average density of 2,671.0 per square mile (1,031.3/km2). The racial composition of the city was 53.3% African American, 37.3% White, 0.3% Native American, 1.8% Asian, 4.4% from other races, and 2.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.0% of the population.There were 167,490 households of which 29.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 22.4% were married couples living together, 25.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 6.0% had a male householder with no wife present, and 46.4% were non-families. 39.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.29 and the average family size was 3.11.\nThe median age in the city was 35.7 years. 24.6% of residents were under the age of 18; 11% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.1% were from 25 to 44; 26.3% were from 45 to 64; and 12% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.0% male and 52.0% female.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $27,349, and the median income for a family was $31,182. The per capita income for the city was $16,302. 31.0% of the population and 22.9% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 37.6% of those under the age of 18 and 16.8% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line. Of the city's population over the age of 25, 13.1% held a bachelor's degree or higher, and 75.7% had a high school diploma or equivalent.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Cleveland saw a massive influx of immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and the Austro-Hungarian, German, Russian, and Ottoman Empires, most of whom were attracted by manufacturing jobs. As a result, Cleveland and Cuyahoga County today have substantial communities of Irish (especially in Kamm's Corners and other areas of West Park), Italians (especially in Little Italy and around Mayfield Road), Germans, and several Central-Eastern European ethnicities, including Czechs, Hungarians, Lithuanians, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Rusyns, Slovaks, Ukrainians, and ex-Yugoslav groups, such as Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs. The presence of Hungarians within Cleveland proper was, at one time, so great that the city boasted the highest concentration of Hungarians in the world outside of Budapest. Cleveland has a long-established Jewish community, historically centered on the East Side neighborhoods of Glenville and Kinsman, but now mostly concentrated in East Side suburbs such as Cleveland Heights and Beachwood, home to the Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage.The availability of jobs also attracted African Americans from the South. Between 1920 and 1970, the black population of Cleveland, largely concentrated on the city's East Side, increased significantly as a result of the First and Second Great Migrations. Cleveland's Latino community consists primarily of Puerto Ricans, while the city's Asian community, centered on historical Asiatown, consists of Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese, and other groups.

Businessman and Senator Mark Hanna was among Cleveland's most influential Republican figures, both locally and nationally. In addition to the established support of organized labor, the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, led by former mayor Ray T. Miller, was able to secure the support of the city's ethnic European and African American communities in the 1940s. Beginning with the Lausche administration, Cleveland's political orientation shifted to the Democratic Party and, with the exceptions of the Perk and Voinovich administrations, it has remained dominated by the Democrats ever since.Today, while other parts of Ohio, particularly Cincinnati and the southern portion of the state, support the Republicans, Cleveland commonly produces the strongest support in the state for the Democrats. At the local level, elections are nonpartisan. However, Democrats still dominate every level of government. During the 2004 Presidential election, although George W. Bush carried Ohio by 2.1%, John Kerry carried Cuyahoga County 66.6%\u201332.9%, his largest margin in any Ohio county. The city of Cleveland supported Kerry over Bush by the even larger margin of 83.3%\u201315.8%. As a result of the 2010 Census, Ohio lost two Congressional seats, which affected Cleveland's districts in the northeast part of the state. Today, Cleveland is split between two congressional districts. Most of the western part of the city is in the 9th District, represented by Marcy Kaptur. Most of the eastern part of the city, as well as most of downtown, is in the 11th District, represented by Marcia Fudge. Both are Democrats, two of four representing the state of Ohio.\nCleveland hosted three Republican national conventions in its history, in 1924, 1936, and 2016. The city also hosted the Radical Republican convention of 1864. Cleveland has not hosted a national convention for the Democrats, despite the position of Cuyahoga County as a Democratic stronghold in Ohio.\nFounded in 1912, the City Club of Cleveland provides a platform for national and local debates and discussions. Known as Cleveland's \"Citadel of Free Speech,\" it is one of the oldest continuous independent free speech and debate forums in the country.\n\n\n== Public safety ==\n\n\n=== Police and law enforcement ===\n\nLike in other major American cities, crime in Cleveland is concentrated in areas with higher rates of poverty and lower access to jobs. In recent years, the rate of crime in the city has seen a significant decline, following a nationwide trend in falling crime rates. Cleveland Police statistics published in 2019 showed that rates for violent crimes and property crimes in Cleveland dropped substantially in 2018. The rate of property crimes specifically fell by 30% since 2016.Cleveland's law enforcement agency is the Cleveland Division of Police, established in 1866. The division has 1,444 sworn officers as of 2016. Cleveland has five police districts. The district system was introduced in the 1930s by Cleveland Public Safety Director Eliot Ness (of the Untouchables), who later ran for mayor of Cleveland in 1947. The division has been recognized for several \"firsts,\" including the \"first criminal conviction secured by matching a palm print lifted from a crime scene to a suspect.\" The current Chief of Police is Calvin D. Williams.\n\n\n==== Consent decree with Department of Justice ====\nIn December 2014, the United States Department of Justice announced the findings of a two-year investigation, prompted by a request from Mayor Frank Jackson, to determine whether the Cleveland Police engaged in a pattern of excessive force. After reviewing nearly 600 use-of-force incidents from 2010 to 2013, the investigators found systemic patterns, insufficient accountability mechanisms, inadequate training, ineffective policies, and inadequate community engagement. As a result of the Justice Department report, the city agreed to a consent decree to revise its policies and implement new independent oversight over the police force.The consent decree, released on May 26, 2015, mandates sweeping changes in training for recruits and seasoned officers, developing programs to identify and support troubled officers, updating technology and data management practices, and an independent monitor to ensure the decree's goals are met. At least some of the provisions have been identified as unique to Cleveland. On June 12, 2015, Chief U.S. District Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. approved and signed the consent decree, beginning the process of police reform.\n\n\n=== Fire department ===\n\nCleveland is served by the firefighters of the Cleveland Division of Fire, established in 1863. The fire department operates out of 22 active fire stations throughout the city in five battalions. Each Battalion is commanded by a Battalion Chief, who reports to an on-duty Assistant Chief.The Division of Fire operates a fire apparatus fleet of twenty-two engine companies, eight ladder companies, three tower companies, two task force rescue squad companies, hazardous materials (\"haz-mat\") unit, and numerous other special, support, and reserve units. The current Chief of Department is Angelo Calvillo.\n\n\n=== Emergency Medical Services ===\n\nCleveland EMS is operated by the city as its own municipal third-service EMS division. Cleveland EMS is the primary provider of Advanced Life Support and ambulance transport within the city of Cleveland, while Cleveland Fire assists by providing fire response medical care. Although a merger between the fire and EMS departments was proposed in the past, the idea was subsequently abandoned.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Print ===\nCleveland's primary daily newspaper is The Plain Dealer. Defunct major newspapers include the Cleveland Press, an afternoon publication which printed its last edition on June 17, 1982; and the Cleveland News, which ceased publication in 1960. Additional newspapers include: The Morning Journal, which serves suburbs bordering directly on the western Cleveland border; the News-Herald which serves the smaller suburbs in the East Side; the Thursdays-only Sun Post-Herald, which serves a few neighborhoods on the city's West Side; and the Call and Post, a weekly newspaper that primarily serves the city's African American community. The city is also served by Cleveland Magazine, a regional culture magazine published monthly; Crain's Cleveland Business, a weekly business newspaper; Cleveland Jewish News, a weekly Jewish newspaper; and Cleveland Scene, a free alternative weekly paper which absorbed its competitor, the Cleveland Free Times, in 2008. In addition, nationally distributed rock magazine Alternative Press was founded in Cleveland in 1985, and the publication's headquarters remain in the city. The digital Belt Magazine was founded in Cleveland in 2013. Time magazine was published in Cleveland for a brief period from 1925 to 1927.\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\nCombined with nearby Akron and Canton, Cleveland is ranked as the 19th-largest television market by Nielsen Media Research (as of 2013\u201314). The market is served by 10 full power stations, including: WEWS-TV (ABC), WJW (Fox), WKYC (NBC), WOIO (CBS), WVIZ (PBS), WUAB (The CW), WVPX-TV (Ion), WQHS-DT (Univision), WDLI-TV (Ion Plus), and the independent WBNX-TV.The Mike Douglas Show, a nationally syndicated daytime talk show, began in Cleveland in 1961 on KYW-TV (now WKYC), while The Morning Exchange on WEWS-TV served as the model for Good Morning America. Tim Conway and Ernie Anderson first established themselves in Cleveland while working together at KYW-TV and later WJW-TV (now WJW). Anderson both created and performed as the immensely popular Cleveland horror host Ghoulardi on WJW-TV's Shock Theater, and was later succeeded by the long-running late night duo Big Chuck and Lil' John.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nCleveland is directly served by 32 AM and FM radio stations, 22 of which are licensed to the city. Commercial FM music stations are frequently the highest rated stations in the market: WAKS (contemporary hit radio), WDOK (adult contemporary), WENZ (mainstream urban), WGAR-FM (country), WHLK (adult hits), WMJI (classic hits), WMMS (active rock/hot talk), WNCX (classic rock), WNWV (modern adult contemporary), WQAL (hot adult contemporary), and WZAK (urban adult contemporary). WCPN public radio functions as the local NPR affiliate, and sister station WCLV airs a classical music format. College radio stations include WBWC (Baldwin Wallace University), WCSB (Cleveland State University), WJCU (John Carroll University), and WRUW-FM (Case Western Reserve University).News/talk station WTAM serves as the AM flagship for both the Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland Indians. Sports oriented stations include WKNR (ESPN Radio), WARF (Fox Sports Radio) and WKRK-FM (CBS Sports Radio). WKNR and WKRK-FM are also co-flagship stations for the Cleveland Browns. As WJW (AM), WKNR was once the home of Alan Freed \u2212 the Cleveland disc jockey credited with first using and popularizing the term \"rock and roll\" to describe the music genre. News/talk station WHK was one of the first radio stations to broadcast in the United States and the first in Ohio. Its former sister station, rock station WMMS, dominated Cleveland radio in the 1970s and 1980s and was at that time one of the highest rated radio stations in the country. In 1972, WMMS program director Billy Bass coined the phrase \"The Rock and Roll Capital of the World\" to describe Cleveland. In 1987, Playboy named WMMS DJ Kid Leo (Lawrence Travagliante) \"The Best Disc Jockey in the Country\".\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\nCleveland is home to a number of leading hospital systems, several of which are in University Circle. Most notable is the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic, which is supplemented by University Hospitals and its Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital. On the city's West Side is the main campus of the MetroHealth System, which operates a level one trauma center in northeast Ohio, and has various locations throughout greater Cleveland. Cleveland's Global Center for Health Innovation opened with 235,000 square feet (21,800 m2) of display space for healthcare companies across the world. To take advantage of the proximity of universities and other medical centers in Cleveland, the Veterans Administration moved the regions VA hospital from suburban Brecksville to a new facility in University Circle.\nDuring the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine reported the earliest cases of the virus in the state to be in the Greater Cleveland Metropolitan Area, specifically Cuyahoga County. In response, the Cleveland Clinic engaged in a historic partnership with University Hospitals to offer free testing for COVID-19 and to stop the spread of the virus in the metropolitan area and the state.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Walkability ===\nIn 2011, Walk Score ranked Cleveland the seventeenth most walkable of the fifty largest cities in the United States. As of 2014, Walk Score increased Cleveland's rank to being the sixteenth most walkable US city, with a Walk Score of 57, a Transit Score of 47, and a Bike Score of 51. Cleveland's most walkable and transient areas can be found in the Downtown, Ohio City, Detroit-Shoreway, University Circle, and Buckeye-Shaker Square neighborhoods.\n\n\n=== Urban transit systems ===\n\nCleveland has a bus and rail mass transit system operated by the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA). The rail portion is officially called the RTA Rapid Transit, but local residents refer to it as The Rapid. It consists of three light rail lines, known as the Blue, Green, and  Waterfront Lines, and a heavy rail line, the Red Line. In 2008, RTA completed the HealthLine, a bus rapid transit line, for which naming rights were purchased by the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals. It runs along Euclid Avenue from downtown through University Circle, ending at the Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland. In 1968, Cleveland became the first city in the nation to have a direct rail transit connection linking the city's downtown to its major airport. In 2007, the American Public Transportation Association named Cleveland's mass transit system the best in North America. Cleveland is the only metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere with its rail rapid transit system having only one center-city area rapid transit station (Tower City-Public Square).\n\n\n=== Private automobiles ===\nThe city of Cleveland has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2016, 23.7 percent of Cleveland households lacked a car, while the national average was 8.7 percent. Cleveland averaged 1.19 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nCleveland's road system consists of numbered streets running roughly north\u2013south, and named avenues, which run roughly east\u2013west. The numbered streets are designated \"east\" or \"west\", depending where they lie in relation to Ontario Street, which bisects Public Square. The numbered street system extends beyond the city limits into some suburbs on both the West and East Sides. The named avenues that lie both on the east side of the Cuyahoga River and west of Ontario Street receive a \"west\" designation on street signage. The two downtown avenues which span the Cuyahoga change names on the west side of the river. Superior Avenue becomes Detroit Avenue on the West Side, and Carnegie Avenue becomes Lorain Avenue. The bridges that make these connections are often called the Detroit\u2013Superior Bridge and the Lorain\u2013Carnegie Bridge.\n\n\n=== Freeways ===\nThree two-digit Interstate highways serve Cleveland directly. Interstate 71 begins just southwest of downtown and is the major route from downtown Cleveland to the airport. I-71 runs through the southwestern suburbs and eventually connects Cleveland with Columbus and Cincinnati. Interstate 77 begins in downtown Cleveland and runs almost due south through the southern suburbs. I-77 sees the least traffic of the three interstates, although it does connect Cleveland to Akron. Interstate 90 connects the two sides of Cleveland, and is the northern terminus for both I-71 and I-77. Running due east\u2013west through the West Side suburbs, I-90 turns northeast at the junction with and I-490, and is known as the Innerbelt through downtown. At the junction with the Shoreway, I-90 makes a 90-degree turn known in the area as Dead Man's Curve, then continues northeast, entering Lake County near the eastern split with Ohio State Route 2. Cleveland is also served by two three-digit interstates, Interstate 480, which enters Cleveland briefly at a few points and Interstate 490, which connects I-77 with the junction of I-90 and I-71 just south of downtown.Two other limited-access highways serve Cleveland. The Cleveland Memorial Shoreway carries State Route 2 along its length, and at varying points also carries US 6, US 20 and I-90. The Jennings Freeway (State Route 176) connects I-71 just south of I-90 to I-480 near the suburbs of Parma and Brooklyn Heights. A third highway, the Berea Freeway (State Route 237 in part), connects I-71 to the airport, and forms part of the boundary between Cleveland and Brook Park.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nCleveland Hopkins International Airport is the city's major airport and an international airport that once served as a main hub for United Airlines and Continental Airlines. It holds the distinction of having the first airport-to-downtown rapid transit connection in North America, established in 1968. In 1930, the airport was the site of the first airfield lighting system and the first air traffic control tower. Originally known as Cleveland Municipal Airport, it was the first municipally owned airport in the country. Cleveland Hopkins is a significant regional air freight hub hosting FedEx Express, UPS Airlines, United States Postal Service, and major commercial freight carriers.\nIn addition to Hopkins, Cleveland is served by Burke Lakefront Airport, on the north shore of downtown between Lake Erie and the Shoreway. Burke is primarily a commuter and business airport.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nThe Port of Cleveland, at the Cuyahoga River's mouth, is a major bulk freight terminal on Lake Erie, receiving much of the raw materials used by the region's manufacturing industries. In addition to freight, the Port of Cleveland also welcomes regional and international tourists who pass through the city on Great Lakes cruises. Currently docking at Dock 28, just west of First Energy Stadium. The cruises currently run from mid-May through mid-October.\n\n\n=== Railroads ===\n\nCleveland has a long rich history as a major railroad hub in the United States.  Today, Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Cleveland, via the Capitol Limited and Lake Shore Limited routes, which stop at Cleveland Lakefront Station. Additionally, Cleveland hosts several inter-modal freight railroad terminals, for Norfolk Southern, CSX and several smaller companies. There have been several proposals for commuter rail in Cleveland, including a study into a Sandusky\u2013Cleveland line.  Cleveland was also identified as a hub for the now-suspended Ohio Hub project, which would bring high-speed rail to Ohio.\n\n\n=== Inter-city bus lines ===\nNational intercity bus service is provided at a Greyhound station, just behind the Playhouse Square theater district. Megabus provides service to Cleveland and has a stop at the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Transit Center on the east side of downtown. Akron Metro, Brunswick Transit Alternative, Laketran, Lorain County Transit, and Medina County Transit provide connecting bus service to the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority. Geauga County Transit and Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA) also offer connecting bus service in their neighboring areas.\n\n\n=== Hyperloop proposal ===\nOn February 15, 2018, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies announced that it had signed an agreement with the North Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency and the Illinois Department of Transportation to conduct a feasibility study for a planned Great Lakes Hyperloop system connecting Cleveland to Chicago in a half hour. In June 2019, Congress approved $5 million to the U.S. Department of Transportation to explore safety standards for this project.\n\n\n== Sister cities and international relations ==\nAs of 2019, Cleveland maintains cultural, economic, and educational ties with 23 sister cities around the world.  It concluded its first sister city partnership with Lima, Peru in 1964. Cleveland is home to the Consulate General of the Republic of Slovenia, which, until Slovene independence in 1991, served as an official consulate for Tito's Yugoslavia. In addition, the Jewish community of Greater Cleveland maintains an unofficial supportive relationship with the State of Israel. During the Cold War, Cleveland industrialist Cyrus Eaton, an apprentice of John D. Rockefeller, played a significant role in promoting dialogue between the US and the USSR.Sister cities\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nConnecticut Western Reserve\nCuyahoga County\nGreater Cleveland\nList of people from Cleveland\nList of references to Cleveland in popular culture\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCondon, George E.

        "wiki": "The Arcade in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, is a Victorian-era structure of two nine-story buildings, joined by a five-story arcade with a glass skylight spanning over 300 feet (91 m), along the four balconies. Erected in 1890, at a cost of $867,000 ($24,700,000 in 2019 dollars), the Arcade opened on Memorial Day (May 30, 1890), and is identified as one of the earliest indoor shopping malls in the United States. The Arcade was modified in 1939, remodeling the Euclid Avenue entrance and adding some structural support.  It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Arcade was built in 1890 by Detroit Bridge Co., run by Stephen V. Harkness. Designed by John Eisenmann and George H. Smith, the Arcade is one of the few remaining arcades of its kind in the United States. Modeled after the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II located in Milan, the Arcade comprises two nine-story towers with a skylight, 100 feet (30 m) high, made of 1,800 panes of glass spanning over 300 feet (91 m). The construction was financed by John D. Rockefeller, Marcus Hanna, Charles F. Brush and several other wealthy Clevelanders of the day.\n\nThe Arcade is a cross between a lighted court and a commercial shopping street. The building is a complex of three structures: two nine-story office buildings facing out to Euclid and Superior Avenues, connected via the five-story iron-and-glass-enclosed arcade. The Richardsonian arched entrance along Superior Avenue is original, but the Euclid Avenue front was remodeled in 1939 by the firm of Walker and Weeks. The level of the Superior Avenue entrance is about 12 feet (3.7 m) lower than the Euclid entrance, so that there are two bottom arcade floors, joined by staircases at each end. Since Euclid and Superior avenues are not parallel, a passage leads, at a 23-degree angle, off the Euclid entrance to a rotunda at the southern end of the Arcade. The arcade itself is a 300-foot (91 m)-long covered light court, ringed by four levels of balconies, which step back above the Euclid Avenue level. The vertical lines of the columns, rising nearly 100 feet (33 m) to the glass roof, create a spacious domed interior.In 2001, the Hyatt corporation redeveloped the Arcade into Cleveland's first Hyatt Regency hotel. The Hyatt Regency occupies the two towers and the top three floors of the atrium area. The two lower floors of the atrium area remain open to the public with retail merchants and a food court. In addition, the Hyatt's lobby and offices are located near the Superior Avenue entrance. That same year, the skylight was also replaced.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBurlington Arcade\nGalleria Vittorio Emanuele II\nPaddock Arcade\nPassage des Panoramas\nQueen Victoria Building\nWestminster Arcade\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Arcade\nImages and architectural information",

          "This Arcade is Gorgeous! A beautiful place for a Reception, the service was excellent and the food was quite good , for a crowd this size. I am Handicappef and sometimes need to excuse myself and take a rest. Hopping on the elevator and getting to my room was genius! The room",
          "We stumbled upon this building while riding scooters and decided to go in. Very cool building but not much inside. We order hot chocolate from a coffee shop and just enjoy the architecture.",
          "This place was built in 1890,s one of America\u2019s first indoor shopping mall. Updated and renovated over the years, this place is incredible, multi levels of shopping, a bunch of restaurants and eateries all around. The Arcade is attached to the Hyatt Regency for even more",
          "When you visit Cleveland, this is the place to stay and enjoy the city! Plus the East 4th Street row of places to visit is across the street!",
          "This arcade has the beauty that only exists in something that was built when there were artists that took the time to add details to the structure that is missing from the straight lines of today's buildings. The fact that the south entrance is 12 feet higher than the north",
          "The very FIRST USA Indoor Mall ! What a gem of a place to stay & visit. The restoration has made this a crown jewel.",
          "Amazing architecture of this building with ornate railings and full length skylights. Beautiful to see at Christmas time. A Cleveland gem.",
          "Beauty from another century. Magnifient. Classy. Historic. Why not visit it and admire it? You may sit and have your lunch there , in one of the free tables all around. There are some shops, a restaurant , a coffee shop and a good hotel. I think that the peaceful beauty is",
          "This is a stunning place with beautiful interior. It\u2019s a pity we visited when all the shops were closed but the mall was still open for public. It\u2019s definitely worth visiting if you\u2019re in town.",
          "The structure is worth checking out if you\u2019re nearby, but there are very few businesses open inside, so it has a strange feel to it.",
          "Not sure why you would visit the arcade unless you are staying at the Hyatt. Feels like you are in an historic cruise ship",
          "NIce place to stop as you walk in downtown Cleveland. We stopped and admired the amazing architecture",
          "We stopped by because of Campbell\u2019s being in the same building. As others have noted, it\u2019s pretty quiet inside, but the beauty of this place is unparalleled. The space would be much better used as an amazing wedding venue instead of some stores.",
          "So this turned up as a shopping activity in cleveland well thats not the case. It is a beautiful glass building so its worth a look for the glass enclosure and the interior. However, visiting on the weekday and there was nothing open on the first floor and looked like offices on",
          "What a beautiful building! It\u2019s like stepping out of this century. Also, I had the opportunity to meet a very nice lady at the store \u201cProsperity\u201d who could easily be an ambassador for Cleveland. She took the time to share information about the building and Cleveland. Great",
          "Our Cleveland architectural tour stopped here. It is located in downtown Cleveland and close to Soldiers Monument. This building is actually a hotel (The Hyatt Regency) but the lobby has some shops and a food court. It's very beautiful inside with a unique architecture style.",
          "This arcade is gorgeous. It's such a shame that it is so empty. They should rent the stores in artisans to try to encourage a cooler vibe. Right now it's just some empty hotel rooms and a few boring stores. Such a shame because it's truly an amazing building.",
          "From an historical perspective, this is a really interesting place, beautifully done. But there are very few shops inside, so all one does is walk through.",
          "Toured the arcade while a wedding reception was enjoyed on the lower level so we couldn't stroll that level. The Arcade is a very nicely done redo of an older building that had fallen on bad times.",
          "The location is near a strip of bars and food joints. The arcade is neat but the 216 pizza is good along with the chocolate bar. Cathies cookie is also good. The rest is hit or miss and the 1890 is just so-so.",
          "We were out on the town for a walk today and we came across this. It was nice and the architecture from the past was so beautiful.",
          "We stumbled in this lovely old building downtown. Sure hope they fill the empty slots. Having the Hyatt attached to it may help.",
          "This is a beautiful architectural building. But for us that was about all we could say. We walked in and looked around and walked back out. Nothing as far as an attraction to see.",
          "This is a very pretty building, but not really an attraction to see. The architecture is beautiful though. We were across the street and walked in, but there really wasn't anything to see.",
          "I have come here all of my life to marvel at the gorgeous turn-of-the-century iron and glass architecture. This is a classic and worth a diversion. Much of the arcade is now devoted to the hotel here, but at one time it was a vibrant shopping area full of quirky shops. Bring",
          "Absolutely beautiful old building that has been very well preserved. I was in awe the whole time just strolling thru and looking at all the details of the building. So glad that some paces are kept vs the tear down and rebuild we do so much. There is just something about being",
          "My wife I and kids stayed here 3 different times. Excellent service! Friendly people! Rooms r great! Shopping is great. Great Location if u want to have downtown fun! Or just a nice weekend in Cleveland. We will be back!",
          "This is just a very beautiful piece of architecture, and a remnant of how we used to design our shopping areas. It's worth seeing for the building and the history, but there isn't much there now except a few restaurants and a couple of shops.",
          "Worth a quick walk through this beautiful arcade . What a shame That not many shops are open as feel this would improve the atmosphere. Nevertheless worth having a quick look at the architecture.",
          "What a gorgeous building. Loved how it's been maintained. There was an event while we were in the Chocolate Bar, it was beautiful",
          "If you are in downtown Cleveland, take a few minutes to visit the Old Arcade also know as the Crystal Place because of its all glass ceilings. It is a beautiful piece of architecture. I was impressed that the building was renovated and maintains its original charm. There is a",
          "Amazing architecture! Wander through but that\u2019s about all there is to do. It\u2019s a site to see though!",
          "We actually came here to get breakfast at the boney fingers restaurant. We walked in & we were stunned at how epic this place looks. The first 2 floors are a mall & the top floors are a hotel. We were there on a Tuesday morning but hardly any of the stores were open. So i can't",
          "You don't have to stay at the hotel to see the arcade-- some good restaurants are here (Pizza 216 for instance) and many of the stores inside are just store fronts, but stroll around and enjoy the lovely architecture. Picture it from the time of the 1890's.",
          "Currently it is a part of a hotel (upper floors are rooms). Yet it is still open for shopping and dining to the public. The place is really beautiful, especially the glass ceiling.",
          "This is still a beautiful and historic venue, but since hotel rooms have replaced most of the small businesses and the restaurants and food court largely have closed, it is no longer anywhere near as fun or interesting as it was years ago. Some of the storefronts sit empty,",
          "Fun & Silly shopping places to go into & play! A kind lady from one of the stores let us play with the fancy frame for pictures! Great place to eat & drink.",
          "Do yourself a favor and stay in the hotel in here. It is a lovely architectural building. I remember when it was filled with individual shops with thriving businesses and patrons.",
          "Gorgeous architecture with many cool little specialty shops. Bummed that the steampunk shop was closed. The gourmet popcorn was amazing! Special thanks to the environmental services engineer for letting us use the bathroom.",
          "I had to see how this attraction competed with our similar arcade in Milwaukee. This place was gorgeous. Stunning architecture. Great photo location. We unfortunatel visited before all of the shops opened for the day.",
          "It's absolutely beautiful in the Old Arcade. Unfortunately, there really are not any retail places to visit here. The Hotel is located at far end and on many weekends wedding receptions are held in Arcade. Very good place to get some pictures, but you don't need much time to",
          "Stay at the Hyatt right at the Arcade. Great photo opps all over the building. Good central location!",
          "The Arcade is a must for any visitor to Cleveland. This architectural gem is an example of Cleveland when the city was an influential player on the national scene of industry,finance and politics. Notice that the lake side entry is five stories while the other side is four",
          "The Arcade is a jewel that should be preserved and maintained. Kind of heartbreaking that there aren't more businesses within The Arcade. What's the matter with you Cleveland? Why aren't you making better use of this architectural gem???",
          "Great 1910s building that is well worth a quick visit. Sad that it hasn't become more appealing as an office/retail location since the building is spectacular. Makes you feel like you're in a shopping arcade in London or Paris.",
          "This is a special visual treat especially near Christmas. Be sure to stroll over a few short blocks to Heine\u2019s grocery to see that renovation.",
          "I recommend for a view of the glory of days gone by. Unfortunately I found this space rather sad now that is barely used at all for retail space. Or any thing else actually. Thankfully I can imagine what it must have been like when it originally and the enjoyment it must",
          "Even after several trips through the place, I'm still amazed by the architecture of the Old Arcade. It's a must see stop if you visiting downtown Cleveland!",
          "The architecture is stunningly beautiful and the endless marble is quite the sight to.behold. Although many of the shops are empty it's worth coming just to see this gorgeous building and read about its history.",
          "This is such a beautiful Mini indoor mall. Many shops and different levels. The brass and marble are awsome",
          "While I loved the architecture of the arcade.... it is a sketchy neighborhood and only a few shops were open. Many booths were empty, and some of the stores had nothing truly put into it... as in I have seen better displays at a yard sale. It is a pity.",
          "Wow did we love this building. The look of it, the feel of it, just going in there felt like you went back in time where the rich and famous may have shopped and dined. It felt high end especially for \"in the day. Some restaurants in there that seemed higher end. High end",
          "Just an update... to everyone this is classic shopping mall to be visit. Remind me how prosper Cleveland used to be.",
          "This place too small for shopping or having a good time but if you are running from the cold, this is the warm place",
          "1890 the Arcade was built to be the first indoor mall of it's kind. Today, there are two floors of stores and the remaining is now the Hyatt Hotel. Very beautiful. The trolley stop is right out side your front and back door of the Arcade.",
          "We had a wander through one morning -- what a beautiful, peaceful space, so well preserved! the domed skylight and railings are lovely. Worth a look if you are in the area.",
          "Worth a visit to walk through even if you don't stay at the hotel. The smaller food establishments at the south entry are good. The hotel restaurant is disappointing and mediocre at best.",
          "I wasn't impressed with the outside of the building and almost didn't go in. However, once you open the doors there is beautiful architecture to behold. There are a few stores inside but nothing impressive.",
          "Step back into the previous century (or earlier) by waling through this gallery with wonderful metalwork all throughout. A wonderful example of the gilded age still functioning well today",
          "Great place to visit, quite close to a high budget, but it looks so nice and has such an important past, that it is worth to stop 10 minutes there to visit it This place offers an ATM, Public bathrooms, and some shops",
          "Very nice produce market. Products were very fresh and the vendors were very nice. Great cheese shop. Many meat shops and a variety of other groceries.",
          "I saw this place in the guest book in the room and had to seek it out. It was just a short walk from my hotel and it did not disappoint. Excellent architecture. I posted a black and white picture of it on 500px.com and received my highest rating! Oh, by the way, there were",
          "This is truly a magnificent space. It is very majestic and beautiful to walk around in. It is a shame that it is not more of a destination for great shops and fine dining. But, very worthwhile taking the time to see",
          "A walk through this historic shopping area that is now a hotel. The way it is laid out with brass and wrought iron the various floors resemble something in New Orleans!",
          "Have seen pictures from friends who have visited and wanted to see the history and grandeur ourselves. We were not disappointed. Place has such history and very beautiful. Would have been nice for the shops to be open while we where there but they weren't.",
          "Stayed here for my visit to Cleveland. Lovely renovation in a great location. Loved looking at this view each time I came in.",
          "This Arcade is absolutely beautiful - I admit we need to fill the shops/little restaurants but if you are downtown, it is worth a pop in!",
          "Architecturally beautiful. Had excellent coffee at the adjacent Pour Cleveland. Had breakfast at the nearby Jack Flaps (also good). Not much was open at 10:00 am on a Friday. Most shops opened at 11:00. Basically did a stroll through as a photo op. Worth the trip for that alone.",
          "The architecture and age of the building is beautiful. If you love old buildings stop by. Note there are \u201cstores\u201d inside but nothing of interest for a tourist. It is not a shopping destination. I\u2019m glad I got to see how beautiful it still is.",
          "Being close to our hotel, we walked through the Arcade a couple of times. For some reason it reminded me of New Orleans. I think it was the street lamps...even though they were a few floors up.",
          "Not much happening in this old building, however, it is still a beautiful building to check out and admire.",
          "Back in its day this place was a destination with great shops and eats and all. Seems a shell of its former glory now.",
          "Beautiful old Victorian building from the early 1900's. Unfortunately some of the little take away food places downstairs have closed. There are a few shops inside and some folks have their weddings in the building. It is definitely worth seeing and photographing. Also across",
          "This building is so gorgeous yet always so empty. I have been here a few times and each time there has never been more than 5 other people in the place. It is just so gorgeous.",
          "We went on a Sunday morning and lots of businesses were not open. it was quiet and gorgeous! Worth it just to see the beautiful details!",
          "The Old Arcade is absolutely beautiful. I love that it was built in the late 1800's and so much of the original architecture is still present. This would be a beautiful place for wedding pictures or a cocktail party. It's too bad the shops inside it aren't more lively though",
          "It looks like there are a lot of really nice shops here, but don't go on a Sunday, 90% of them are closed.",
          "We found the arcade online and publicized as shops and various eateries. So we paid 15 dollars to park and walked over. To nothing. There's nothing in it but 2 shops and everything else is being converted to hotel space. It's beautiful but just really disappointing compared to",
          "Stopped in for pics and the place is just stunning There was a wedding going to take place It was decorated beautiful",

          "The Arcade is breathtaking. It is a stunning place. It is architecturally spectacular. Though given that it is one of the first indoor malls in America it sure did seem to lack shops. Though I wasn't there to shop, I was there to take photos of something I'll never forget.",
          "This is one of the earliest indoor shopping mall in the US. Opened in 1890, this beautiful Victorian style shopping mall reflects the old glory history of Cleveland. The architecture and buildings of 9 stories as well as the glass skylight of 300 feet (91 meters) high are",

          "what little shopping there is ,this really can be avoided, lots of shops closed, however very nicly maintained and reuse of an old building.",
          "The Olde Arcade is now The Ritz Hotel complex. It is a centenary Cleveland treasure and should be ranked among the finest nationwide. It has five or six levels, some of which are businesses and others are hotel rooms.",
          "It is such a beautiful old building. I remember coming here to shop as a kid. While wandering around Euclid before our dinner reservations we stopped in to take a look. I love the grand balcony open area. Unfortunately we didn't get very far. They were getting ready for a",

          "As you walk in, it feels like you've entered an era of days gone by. It is really gorgeous! It feels very empty and I recall saying to my husband that it felt like as though something were missing. There is no life and energy in the place, like it's waiting for shops to open and",
          "There is nothing worthing stopping for. Neat building but no businesses. If you want shopping go to beachwood.",
          "Reputedly the oldest mall in the US, this is a beautiful building and well worth seeing. Don't expect shopping excellence however: the mall is mostly vacant. Stay as long as the building itself with its stunning finishes can hold your attention.",
          "Wow this building is amazing! I kept walking around and took photos of every angle of this place. There are a couple places to shop and eat but don't count of spending much time here. I walked around for about 10 minutes. I hope more business and restaurants come to The",
          "Cost: Free to public to walk around. Worth it: I would say Yes, just for the view. Gluten free available: I wouldn't eat here. Modern/ clean: Yes Different: Something different to see. Seating: Yes lower level Employees friendly: No one around when we went. Size of place:",
          "Stopped in and took a few photos. They were setting up for a wedding downstairs. My only complaint would be that they need to put in more stores. Still, it's a great place to spend a little time on a sunny afternoon. Perfect location, easy walking distance from our hotel",
          "I went here looking for a place to shop for women's clothing. I was very disappointed in the number of shops in a place that would be so great for shopping but I did pull out my phone and take pictures. This place is so beautiful! Great place to walk and get some steps in.",
          "We stayed at the Hyatt in the Arcade. The Arcade itself needs to get some more stores and attractions in it, but as a place to visit, just to look at all the architecture, it's a fun walk-through. The Hyatt is a great place to stay if you're into staying in historic buildings,",
          "Only has a chance to view it from the peripheral as there was a wedding but it was an incredible view and great pictures",
          "Truly a beautiful building. Pretty sad that it's almost empty. A couple of food options, a few stores, post office and hotel lobby. That's pretty much it. Worth a walk through if you're in the area.",

          "This beautiful Arcade built in the late 1800's is a mainstay in the city of Cleveland. On a recent visit to Cleveland, I was able to walk through it and once again enjoy the beautiful architecture as I did 40 years ago when I worked in the downtown area. It is a gorgeous",
          "We accidentally found the arcade. We stopped at the Martini Bar that is attached to the 2nd floor. We saw some activity going on and decided to investigate. There was a private wedding going on downstairs which was gorgeous! The upstairs was set up for cocktails and the wedding",
          "A shocking, but wonderful, surprise once you open the doors. Numerous small shops and restaurants. Most were closed when we visited on Sunday. Aging, but well worth the effort that has been expended on its restoration and maintenance. A must-see if you're staying downtown.",
          "If you've seen the cool photos of the lights and ceiling, you've seen pretty much the coolest part of this place. I'm sure it was awesome in its day, but now some of the shops are closed or run down. Still some cool small boutique shops and restaurants though!",
          "Lovely building!! Very cool definitely stop in and check it out!! There is a lot of empty space would have been cool to seen it back in day filled with shopping and food!!",
          "Stunning building, an early version of a shopping mall. Amazing use of iron and glass. Not as much shopping or dining as there used to be, but worth a visit. Now mostly a hotel.",
          "Great place to visit and enjoy the indoor beauty of the levels of shops and hotel. Beautiful all glass ceiling letting in natural sunlight. Well maintained historic arcade. Well worth seeing at Christmas with all the decorations.",
          "Beautiful architecture. Not much else other than that. There are a few places to get food and tables to sit at.",
          "This place is enstilled with history. The views for the inside are breath taking, always was and still is. Has a new hotel attached to it now also. The architecture is astounding",
          "NIce to stop in to view the lovely historic architecture and details but oddly empty of stores. A fast food places and then restaurants on the Euclid side.",
          "The old architecture is phenomenal and something to see. There are a few good restaurants but mainly the place is deserted - just go and walk through it. Nice clean public bathrooms available",
          "This building is an absolute architectural gem but if not staying at the Hyatt there is not much else there. Mostly empty Storefronts.",
          "This building has undergone many transformations over it's life, but it remains a true MUST SEE in the CLE. Look up from the lower level and look down from the upper level, many great views and angles to appreciate in this structure.",
          "This is a beautiful stunning urban space surrounded by an excellent hotel. It was a very early and beautiful version of a modern day mall, but so much nicer. Yet many of the retail spaces are vacant and so it is very quiet. It makes a wonderful space for photography or to",
          "When this place was built in the late 1800's by John D. Rockefeller it was state of the art! People came from all over the world to shop here. Yes NYC came here to shop. Take the historical tour and learn even more about this great building",
          "For those who don't know, this is the first \"shopping mall\" in America, and I believe it was built in the 1890's. Having lived in Cleveland and worked in the city for many years, I have seen this beautiful building come back to life and it is now gorgeous. It truly is a gem",
          "Was a ghost town @ 5 PM, such a shame because it looked interesting. I hope they get more tenants soon",
          "If you are dinning on E.4th street take a few minutes to walk through the Arcade. It is right across the street from east fourth street and all the restaurants. The architecture is magnificent and in great condition. There are some small shops and a Hotel located in the",
          "Check out this site and the gargoyles at the top. Amazing Hotel too, and so close to E. 4 th Street restaurants.",
          "If you love architecture, this is the place for you to go. The revamped arcase is a study of beauty with old and new.",
          "What a beautiful old building. You just cannot find the craftsmanship and artistry that went into this arcade in today's malls. Built in a time when visual appeal meant something special. Even if you are not staying at the attached Hyatt do yourself a favor to take in this gem",
          "Our hotel was on one end. Not a very busy place but such a cool looking arcade. Out the front is the library and out the back is access to all the trendy bars and restaurants. Main hall was closed 2 nights for weddings but did not cause any major issues.",
          "When you are downtown, treat yourself to a walk through the old Arcade just east of Public Square. It has eclectic shops, handmade gifts, and stop for a coffee or a glass of wine and transport yourself back to the early 1900s.",
          "A beautiful retail space that has totally failed, stores are almost all empty except a cleaner/tailors and a post office. The space is the atrium of the Hyatt. I think they are killed by the lack of street access, the Euclid Avenue entrance is where all the street activity is,",
          "My husband and I met here for a walking tour then came back afterwards to look around some more. It has been restored beautifully and the architecture is wonderful! The Hyatt Regency is attached and the rooms actually face the inside of the arcade. It's definitely a place to see",
          "The architecture will amaze you. This is a hidden gem in Cleveland. All of the staff were gracious. The valet greet you and treat you with respect. We had left items in the car. We called them and they quickly brought the car around.. with a smile. The front desk staff were",
          "Besides the west side market, this is really a great look at cleveland history...not so much the center of attention as it once was in the past. It still holds it's own fascination",
          "Kind of a depressing Arcade. Many of the stores are empty and they seem to close early. Not the best place to shop but if you are in the neighborhood you can check it out and see if it has gotten better",
          "disappointing no shops inside.no bathrooms either. Couldn't find any info on the building Took as about 5 minutes to walk through the building",
          "Well actually the arcade is but has it been restored. I went to HS in Cleveland years ago and this gem is a must see.",
          "This building has beautiful architecture throughout. The Hyatt has transformed much of the structure for hotel use. There are several shops and dinning options throughout the structure. While at the hotel, downstairs area was transformed into a wedding reception venue.",
          "The architecture and design is a must see, but how sad that most store fronts are empty. It's understandable that shopping is not how we get our 'stuff' anymore so stores most likely can't afford to rent a space here. I hope the nice looking restaurant and Hyatt Regency",
          "This is a spectacular thing to see- the vaulted ceiling of glass, in 1890s architectural style. The interior is old, heavy construction that you don't find anymore, with so many details- like lion heads that protrude from the sides and have different faces. The staircase is a",
          "Interesting building wort looking at it. The content is not so great but enter at look around worth seeing",
          "The architecture is lovely, but I guess I was expecting a better shopping experience. Looks like some of the stores are still vacant.",
          "There is a hotel inside this arcade. It's very pretty but there aren't many stores inside that are open which is a shame. Take the 10 minute walk through this arcade and admire the ceiling.",
          "it is now a hotel, but it is worth a stroll. a beautiful design, rather unusual for US cities to have such a space.",
          "A cavernous structure with entrances on both Superior and Euclid Avenues. It needs a shot of adrenalin and a few more stores and restaurants to be a happening spot.",
          "Reminded me of the Mall in Georgetown-when it was a happening place in the 90's. This is just a glorious gem that is being kept beautiful. There is a Marriott which I plan to stay at next time I'm in Cleveland.",
          "Well worth the pictures if you are into old historic places and it is beautiful. Only downfall is the everything is closed in downtown Cleveland on a Sunday -not even restaurants opened -- only 2 were open that we found.",
          "Very ornate inside. At Christmas time they put up a huge tree and decorate. Some stores/eateries on bottom floor.",
          "This is the most deserted city I have been to. Waiting for the tumbleweed. This building is again from a bygone age. It is brilliant, but I have not seen so many closed shops since I visited North Wales. Sad, such a decline.",
          "This is what a Victorian Era shopping mall looked like. One end exits onto Euclid Avenue, down the street from what used to be Millionaire's Row when Rockefellers frolicked there, aand the other end opens onto Superior Avenue near the Library, the Money Museum, and some lesser",
          "We enjoyed the view of the Old Arcade building but found that there is not much in the way of shops worth looking at here. I am glad we saw but wouldn't invest anytime to seeing this again unless more storefronts are filled with a variety of fun or unique shops.",
          "With so much else to see and do, place this activity somewhere near the bottom of your list. The shops that were open were not very inviting an other than the unique architecture little else seems worthy.",
          "This is a beautiful building but unfortunately most of the store fronts are vacant. There was a wedding party taking pictures. That was fun to watch. We stopped in to a small store with handmade jewelry which was pretty but pricey. We tried to get pedicures at a spa but they",
          "It's a shame that the retail spaces are ALL vacant. This is a gem and is a terrific place to sit and eat lunch.",
          "We went to the Old Arcade on St. Patrick's Day. It's ceiling is beautiful inside because of the Architecture. Inside are some restaurants and food eateries. There are some interesting shops..",
          "The architecture and beauty of this building is amazing. Look around for details of years past in an easter egg hunt sort of form. Outside of the look through there is very little in the building that is worthwhile. Mostly empty when we went with a couple of restaurants and a",
          "It has the most stunning architecture, and (usually) cool shops. My great-grandma used to take me here as part of our outings to downtown (on the streetcars!!)",
          "So pretty to look at the arcade. The history behind it is amazing being the first mall in America. I will be having my wedding here in 2017\u2764\ufe0f such a lovely place and the people that work for the Hyatt are all very nice.",
          "Stopped by to see the beautiful architecture. They don't make buildings like that anymore. Too bad there wasn't more shops and restaurants there so more people could enjoy this great historical place.",
          "The Arcade is a amazing piece of history and so iconic architecture, This is a must see even tough most of the shops are empty. There is a beautiful Hotel inside and a few shops and a post office.",
          "An amazing building that has been beautifully preserved. 3 stories and a skylight full of turn of 20th century goodness. Sadly, many of the shop fronts are vacant, but the player piano makes up for it. So many cities would have demolished this treasure. Kudos to Cleveland",
          "This is a historical place just to walk around and look at the trim and architecture. It is amazing, they do not build like this any more. You can almost hear the hustle and bustle in the days gone by",
          "This building is awesome. If they can start attracting some more businesses in the building it could prove to be a huge success and improve downtown. The design, natural lighting and attention to detail in the architecture is amazing. It is just a nice place to walk around",
          "old fashion stores with 1800's century look ! the feeling is that you are travelling back in the past...",
          "We stayed at the hotel which is located in the arcade. It would be a great place if they had more of the store fronts full. It's a bit of a ghost town with just a few shops and the post office.",
          "A nice place inside but not much going on. Walking through it is like going back in time but that's about it. Its worth seeing if you are downtown but not worth a trip just to see it.",
          "So we went to the old Arcade in Cleveland for ST Patrick's Day . We ate lunch at The Vintage 51 in the Arcade.We had corn beef of course and it was very enjoyable. The staff was great and very friendly. The place was hopping lots of families and fun goers. The bagpipers came",
          "We didn't even stop in any of the shops, because the highlight was the architecture of this wonderful building. Definitely worth a stroll through if you're in downtown Cleveland.",
          "Beautiful restored space in the heart of downtown Cleveland. We could not resist taking a break just sitting at one of the many cafe tables available throughout just to soak in the atmosphere.",
          "The beauty and architecture is stupendous. Take a stroll through and see this beautiful old shopping Street. Completely enclosed it's just a beautiful beautiful piece of history",
          "Aside from the Hyatt Regency Hotel, there's not a lot more than great architecture to draw you in the doors. But what an amazing structure it is!",
          "Amazing architecture!! Nice stores to shop in..Amazing hotel!! This has some amazing history in here..you will want to stop here on your travels",
          "Teach the kids some history, and take them to the Arcade. It's a glorious spot, once one of America's first shopping malls, and financed by none other than John D. Rockefeller.",
          "What a fantastic, well-preserved specimen of yesteryear. Photos do not do justice to this incredible structure. I highly recommend that you take the 10 minutes from your day to visit this place, as there are few examples left in America. Happily, much is now being used as",
          "Sometimes we get lucky. After parking our car on the street to walk to see the former Cleveland Trust Company building, now Heinen's Grocery Store, we were walking by the Arcade when we glanced in and knew that this also was something worth seeing. This beautiful Victorian era",
          "Any visit to Cleveland is incomplete without visiting the Cleveland Arcade (Hyatt Hotel now). While changing it from a shopping center to a hotel essentially sucked the life out of the building, it is still worth a visit. The restoration is wonderful and light floods the",
          "It's an unassuming entrance off 4th and Euclid that's now part of a Hyatt, but worth a stop. The 300-foot glass arcade was built in 1890 and has been beautifully restored. It's considered one of the first indoor shopping malls in the U.S. Spectacular, and free.",
          "We stopped at the Old Arcade on a recent walking tour of Cleveland. Three of John D. Moore's great granddaughters were on this trip and very proud. He was a carpenter and one of the head contractors on this job. Upon completion he, along with the other head contractors, received",
          "I made a special effort to visit the Arcade, having heard about it from years ago as a bustling mall of shops. It is indeed a spectacular piece of architecture, but when I visited it at noon time, there were now only a few shops and a couple of restaurants. The rest of the",
          "Although many shops within the mall are vacant, this place is about as gorgeous a representation of early 20th century architecture as you will find. Brass everywhere!!! You will not be disappointed here.",
          "An old shopping place. Unfortunately I had very little time to go around as they close early. But if you stayed at Holiday Inn Express on Euclid Avenue you must come and see this historic mall.",
          "The place is still beautiful but all the shops which were thriving 30 years ago are gone and there is virtually nothing left. It is worthwhile taking a walk across as it connects two main avenues.",
          "The structure is beautiful but that's about it. Its connected tonthe Hyatt hotel. Takes about 5 mins to see and then you're done. If you like architecture, you'll like it but it's not going to take long to see it all.",
          "Architecturally this is a very beautiful, classic structure with a historically innovative skylit atrium, elegant stairs, and lovely balcony details. Well-worth visiting. Unfortunately many of the shops have been vacant for years. Hopefully the convention will revitalize the",
          "It is a very nice structure and the craftsmanship that went into its construction is to be commented about. But, when I visited here a few years ago, there were a lot more people and there was a lot more things going on inside.",
          "I had heard about the Old Arcade and when in Cleveland for a weekend wedding my wife and I had a free Sunday afternoon so we stopped by to check the place out. the internal architecture was as promised stunning. Done in the style of Greek Revival it reminded us of the Arcade in",
          "The old arcade is one of my favorite places in the city of Cleveland. Are all the shops full? No they're not, but who cares? This is by far one of the most architecturally beautiful places in the city. In its heyday, back in the late 1800s and throughout most of the 1900s it",
          "Great place to visit while in Cleveland. It also houses the Hyatt and a few shops/restaurants but mostly worthy for its architecture.",
          "We were at the Arcade on June 22. It is a Victorian-era building. One of the first indoor malls. A lot of the stores are empty. It takes you only a few minutes to admire the architecture of the old days.",
          "It's sad really; the architecture is amazing, but nothing can mask the fact that the place is empty and the only people in it are architecture or photo buffs. Not unlike several areas of Cleveland, great architecture, but little happening.",
          "Only a shell of its former self, this historic Arcade (dating from late 1800's), was modeled after the first indoor multi-use facility in Milano Italy (2 centuries ago). It is still spectacular for Architectural history and Photography. The re-birth of downtown has helped bring",
          "Beautiful historical building sadly devoid of shops to lure the tourists. If you are downtown, definitely visit, but it isn't worth planning a trip around The Arcade. Hopefully, The Hiatt will bring new life to venue.",
          "The Arcade building was built in 1890. The architecture is beautiful. The Hyatt Regency is located inside and there are several retail shops on the first floor. Definitely worth a stop when in downtown Cleveland.",
          "A beautiful building and interior but nothing more. Nothing but echoing hallways and a cleaning crew were evident at Noon on a Wednesday when we visited. Don't waste your time. Only one store open...owners of others must agree.",
          "I live in Cleveland and work downtown. At one time this arcade was filled with stores and restaurants, but nearly all of them have vacated the building. A better bet for shoppers and people seeking lunch is the 5th Street Arcades, across the street and a little east of the Old",
          "There are two Arcades on Euclid Ave. almost across the street from each other. One was built in 1890 and has been restored to its original grandeur. Entering from Euclid there is a lower level of stores and offices. The main floor has stores the entire length with the Hilton",
          "Unfortunately, the entire complex is pretty dead inside. The top two floors are devoted to Hyatt Hotel guest rooms, and the bottom two floors largely devoted to hotel related services (restaurant, spa, coffee stand). Go see the arcade for the architectural detail -- and",
          "This place is so empty it is sad. No shopping, little food choices (other than the Chocolate Bar) and not much to do. We were there a a Saturday, and it was very quite.",
          "This is a hidden gem of 19 century architecture in downtown Cleveland. It is absolutely worth a walk-through. Beautiful, beautiful place. Sadly most of the stores are closed. When I was a young boy this was a busy teaming area of activity. Just imagine what the city used to be",
          "Treat yourself and stroll through this arcade. Don't miss the two arcades across Euclid, also! The shopping is not great, but it's worth a stroll through.",
          "This is a very beautiful old building with a lot of detail. I wish there were more shops inside, but it's a lovely place.",
          "I love the architecture in this building, but there's not much else to do there but look around and leave.",

          "outside is deceiving. inside, it's so beautiful! the elegant decor and structures must see this historical icon. well worth a walk.",
          "This used to be my very favorite spot in Cleveland with its incredible skylight and turn of the century brass railing. However a big hotel chain bought the Arcade and in their renovation, spray painted all the antique brass. A tragedy which I can't understand how it was",
          "A must see, restored and architecturally amazing. Many little stores, dining and so rich in the history of Cleveland. Many weddings held at the Arcade. Don't miss it on your next visit to downtown Cleveland.",
          "I attended a New Years Eve wedding at the Old Arcade and it was truly one of the most beautiful locations for a wedding that I've ever seen. The lights and decorated Christmas trees were lovely and made a great background for all the photos.",
          "This is a fun place. A bit of old downtown Cleveland with hip shops and good food. My Chiropractor is there so I get to see it more often than I like.",
          "It's a nice place just to pop in and take a peek, but there's really nothing to do here. A few businesses and offices. There does seem to be a restaurant, but it was closed the day we were there.",
          "Architecturally fascinating, but not much to do once inside. The renovation was very well done. Shops on the first floor, upper floors are now part of the hotel.",
          "We are so glad that this has been restored to the beauty and dignity of earlier years. It is nice that the hotel is right off the arcade & the bar is really nice.",
          "I am rating this as a building, not the individual tennants/shops/restaurants. I've been coming here my entire life. It is one of the most spectacular examples of arcade architecture in the country. I was worried when it was renovated in the late 90s but they really did a",
          "I hope this place remains as a Cleveland landmark. Very cool, like being in a dirigible. A photographer's dream come true!",
          "Beautiful old building, nothing much left store wise but still with a stop! Beautiful hotel still intact in the building as well",
          "Worth a look see... it's across from E 4th Ave which you should visit also. Beautiful building",
          "Attended an evening wedding here so the shops were not open. However it is a beautiful, classy building. Take a stroll around and enjoy all the architectural details. The hotel bar here was also nice.",
          "The Old Arcade is a truly stunning testimony of a sense of style and chic long gone (at least in North-America). The interior provides much pleasure to the eyes and one really has to look carefully not to miss the many beautiful details in the carving and stonework. The way",

          "We visited the Old Arcade in April of 2012, but, unfortunately, the interior stores had just closed. Still, we had a chance to walk around inside the building. I have to say, it was spectacular. It was like something out of the 1930's. The architecture and attention to",

          "On New Years Eve there weren't many shops open and the food court is pretty sparse. But don't go here to shop. Go here to ogle the space. Take a leisurely walk around the ground and second floor public spaces (the upper reaches are rooms for the Hyatt Regency). The space is",

          "Always live this place when we come to stay in Cleveland.  Nice relaxed atmosphere,  cozy stores, good food choices, either here or very close by.  Even just sitting and taking in the marvels of the building itself is worth it.",

The atmosphere and architecture is one you don\u2019t want to miss. The shops are small but they do sell some cool things, mostly clothes and such.",
          "Beautiful place, was nicely decorated for Christmas. A lot of vacant spaces around...would be a bit nicer more full. Has a couple restaurants inside. Was built in 1890 so has some cool history to it. Worth a stop to check ot out",

          "Beautifully detailed architecture. Lots of history and a bit of charm. There are many vacancies here though with regard to the shops.

          "Very nice room with view, but found a few spots that didn't seem like they were cleaned",
          "As a shopping mall.... it's a bust.  Lots of empty store fronts not a lot of great shopping.  As an architectural landmark, its breathtaking.  The metalwork is gorgeous and definitely worth a peek if you're at all interested in the beauty and history.",

Ate at a Potbelly's down the street on the way back to the parking garage. It took all of an hour total. Beautiful inside, to bad nothing to do or see.",

          "Beautiful sight. I didn't even have a room there and I felt emmeraes in the beauty of the arcade",
          "I gave only 3 stars because it was DESERTED on Sunday.  We expected something to be open, maybe a sweets shop or coffee bar...but we were the only people in the place, our footsteps echoing in the vast chamber.",
          "One of the First enclosed malls in the US! Originally built in 1890 for retail and office (Mixed Use!) And now the upper floors are a Hyatt Hotel. Great location to stay in a unique building in the very heart of Cleveland's vibrant night life!",

          "Wow the inside of this building is beautiful! Next time we find ourselves in Cleveland I really want to get a room at the hotel. The top 3 floors are rooms and the rest of the space is open to the public. We walked through on a holiday so most shops were closed but still worth it. Loved learning that Thomas Edison had a shop in here.",

          "Great clean rooms with nice bathrooms and a good restaurant to eat breakfast. I enjoyed my stay here immensely even though some of the guests were less than courteous with their volume.

          "It's very beautiful. I stayed in the Hyatt at the Arcade, so it was nice to have a place to explore. However, there are not a lot of shops. The post office, a nail salon, a barber shop, photography... it's not really a shopping center, more of a place to get errands done.",
          "Beautiful venue. Really great to see it populated with retail space and events.",
          "Very cool building inside. But not a lot of stores or restaurants. Great for pictures and to use the restroom. There is also a hotel attached which would be nice to stay in. We did get Barbecue at Boney Fingers which is delicious.",

There are many shops and places to skip, eat and stay, if that's what you want to do we there is a big name hotel right inside this gargantuan time capsule-esque mall.",
          "Did not like the quality of the good dishes, i mean they look great, but they taste... well you can get better food for the price is all o am saying.  The customer service was okay.  I would not go here again.",

        "wiki": "The James A. Garfield Memorial was built in memory of the 20th U.S. President, James A. Garfield, who was assassinated in 1881. The memorial is located at 12316 Euclid Avenue in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio. The country grieved for his loss almost as much as they had done for Lincoln, 16 years previously. In Washington, 100,000 plus citizens visited his casket, lying in state in the Capitol. Part of the memorial's funding came from pennies sent in by children throughout the country.The caskets of the President and Lucretia Garfield lie in a crypt beneath the memorial, along with the ashes of their daughter and son-in-law, (Mary \"Mollie\" Garfield Stanley-Brown (1867\u20131947) and Joseph Stanley Brown).\nThe tomb was designed by architect George Keller, with reliefs depicting scenes from Garfield's life. All the stone for the monument came from the quarries of the Cleveland Stone Company, and was quarried locally. The exterior sculptures were done by Caspar Buberl. Its construction began in 1885, and it was dedicated on May 30, 1890. Its cost, $135,000 ($3,800,000 in 2019 dollars), was funded entirely through private donations. The round tower is 50 feet (15 m) in diameter and 180 feet (55 m) high. Around the exterior of the balcony are five terra cotta panels with over 110 life size figures depicting Garfield's life and death. The interior features stained glass windows and window like panes representing the original 13 colonies, plus the state of Ohio, along with panels depicting War and Peace;  mosaics; deep red granite columns; and a 12-foot (3.7 m)-tall white Carrara marble statue of President Garfield by Alexander Doyle. An observation deck provides views of downtown Cleveland and Lake Erie. The monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nIt is open to the public daily from April 1 through November 19 from 9am to 4pm.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistoric images from the Cleveland Memory Project",

          "In and of itself this memorial is not one which will teach you a lot about Garfield nor is it particularly attractive, but if you are already a history buff, you'll like it. The view from the top is very nice and the rest of the cemetery has many features including the Wade",

          "This is one of the most stunning Presidential monuments in the USA. Every aspect is amazing. The structure itself from the outside is a work of art - but that is nothing compared to what is on the inside. The murals alone are stunning. The statue of President Garfield is one",

        "wiki": "Jack Cleveland Casino (formerly Horseshoe Cleveland) is a casino in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, owned and operated by Jack Entertainment.\n\n\n== Casino ==\nJack Cleveland Casino is located in the former Higbee Building at Tower City Center in downtown Cleveland. It has 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m2) of gaming space.    The casino has 1,609 slot machines, 119 table games, 28 poker tables, and 35 electronic table games. The casino is accessible from Public Square, but is also accessible from the Terminal Tower and the Tower City Center shopping mall. The casino has teamed with the Renaissance, the Ritz-Carlton, and the Marriott at Key Center to offer rooms to its guests, and Rock Ohio Caesars purchased the Ritz-Carlton from Forest City Enterprises. The casino is open 24 hours a day and is completely smoke-free, compliant with Ohio law.  Since the casino has limited dining options, it has partnered with nearly a dozen downtown Cleveland restaurants.\n\n\n== History ==\nOhio voters approved (53%) a state constitutional amendment in November 2009 authorizing casinos in the state\u2019s four largest cities: Cleveland, Cincinnati, Columbus and Toledo. It was the fifth statewide vote to legalize gambling in Ohio over 20 years.Horseshoe Cleveland opened on May 14, 2012 as the first casino in the state of Ohio.  It was developed by Rock Ohio Caesars, a joint venture between Caesars Entertainment and Dan Gilbert's Rock Gaming, and managed by Caesars.\nHollywood Casino Toledo, developed and operated by Penn National Gaming, opened on May 29, followed by Hollywood Columbus, which opened on October 8, 2012. Rock Ohio Caesars also developed Horseshoe Casino Cincinnati, which opened on March 4, 2013.Gross casino revenues are taxed at 33 percent, one of the highest rates in the nation for a resort casino with this level of investment. Portions of the tax revenue are designated for public school districts; the four host cities; all 88 state counties; the Ohio State Racing Commission; law enforcement training; and research and treatment of problem gambling and substance abuse. The bipartisan Ohio Casino Control Commission was created in 2011 to develop rules for casino gaming in Ohio, to license operators and to regulate and ensure the integrity of operations. It is also funded by casino tax revenue.Rock Gaming acquired Caesars Entertainment's 20% stake in Rock Ohio Caesars in February 2015, and later in the year announced that it would assume management of the properties, including Horseshoe Cleveland. Rock Gaming announced in February 2016 that the company and its casinos would rebrand under the Jack name. The casino closed for 40 hours in May 2016 to undergo its transition to the Jack name and management.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Caesars Entertainment properties\nList of casinos in Ohio\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJack Cleveland Casino",

          "Poker's my game. So I made a run for the poker room on the third floor. Played for a few hours. The table was very spacious, bigger than your average table. The room was also quite spacious. Lots of tables. No waiting though it was a Friday night. Dealers can take 50's or",
          "We were staying at the Drury Plaza downtown and just happened to walk by this place. We stopped in to play some slots. It was a nice clean place and fun to play the machines. Upstairs was more crowded than the first floor level. Won a little money and had a great time.",
          "Slot type machines only. No tables. Had lice music when we were there. Easy and lots of parking. Easy parking. Didn't notice a smoke smell---not sure if they had separate area for smokers. A fod court with a few options. Nothing fancy at all.",
          "Been here a half dozen times or more. I have yet to win anything to talk about. I wish there were more interactive slots like I play in Vegas. My boyfriend plays poker. He enjoys that. We both play the Black Jack tables together. The dealers were good, I can tell you that!",
          "The drinks were very good and the food was excellent. Played for hours on forty dollars and had a good time,",
          "Trash type casino... Cant even save comp for more than 180 days... They take it back... Lol... So crappy and dangerous area.",
          "Didn't win millions but did win a little and games were enjoyable. No smoking and very clean casino.",
          "We stopped by here just to check it out.Its right downtown and can get crowded.The casino is small mostly has older slots.The staff was friendly and helpful.I probably won't return but it's worth a stop if your in the area.You do have to pay for parking unless you can earn 500",
          "Just an ok place. IT seemed a bit dirty inside. There were homeless/beggars lying along the streets when we were there. I felt very unsafe along the outside of the building.",
          "Was smaller than I expected. Was very clean but I wasn\u2019t impressed. Was nice it was walking distance from my hotel though",
          "I skipped eating dinner here after I saw that the 1st floor ladies room was a filthy mess (very unusual). The cleaning lady must have quit! Everyone who works here is nice and the main floors are in good order, clean and well-attended. There used t be more lower priced slots.",
          "Nothing spectacular about Jacks. Same as many casinos. Clean, no smoking allowed so it was easy to breathe. You get free buffet for your birthday so thats a plus!",
          "Did not like the visit...So different from Vegas...I cant believe I was paying so much for drinks when betting so much money...lame",
          "I visited here late Sunday night in August and played craps for just under 2 hours. For the first 20-30 minutes, the entire end of the table kept placing bets after the dice had been pushed to the shooter. Finally, I had to be the jerk and say something or lose my sanity. Of",
          "I have never seen a casino as empty as this one. We stopped by on a weekday afternoon and then in the evening. There didn't seem to be much going on. For example, only one table was operating.",
          "Can't say enough bad things about the way they run this so-called casino. 1. Panhandlers and homeless people greet you as you walk in. The police are busy texting on their phones standing around inside. 2. Name the only casino that checks everyone's ID starting at 2am. Stand in",
          "Some gaming machines not operational and one being maintained while on site. Not many people on Monday afternoon. Unidentifiable bad smell in casino.",
          "Nice place to get some gambling and fun in.Nice brunch buffet on the weekends.Lots of choices on table games and slots.Always very nice staff and place is clean.",
          "We went to this casino for 2 days while in town. The games were fun though it was a little crowded upstairs. Biggest plus is their ventilation system. I did not smell like smoke when we left. Biggest downfall is trying to leave the casino, I'm unsure if there was a bus stop",
          "Our first Ohio casino and we went two separate days. Positives included that my wife won a few bucks and they also offer $10 in free play if you sign up for their card (you have to wait one day to use the free play). It was also clean. On the down side it seemed like their",
          "Many slots and parking They have three floors with table games on second and third floors Would recommend",
          "Fun place to gamble for a day trip. Small with a lack of variety of machines. Very tight at times, especially certain high profile games. Draft Beer is flat most of the time, get bottles. Very nice staff, great bartenders.",
          "I love the fact that they have preserved the wonderful Higbees department store building and some of the old architectural details are still here. It's a big downtown casino with all the casino touches.",
          "Decided to hit the casino up after a comedy show. We found it very difficult to find the ACTUAL casino parking including the valet. Once we finally found it (after asking a cop we passed), we were shocked that the valet was $30 AND you still had to walk to get to the casino.",
          "The staff friendly, many games to choose from. I won for once so of course the Casino was pleasing. Good food upstairs.",
          "Jack Casino is welcoming and clean. The buffet looks great and the bus and trolly drop you right in front. Christmas Story casino.",
          "What a clean casino! It was laid out well and had a good variety of slots. Full table games here too",
          "It has everything that you would want in a casino. The only negative and I hope that the people managing the casino do something about it, is that you can\u2019t leave the place without panhandlers bothering you and they are flocked at the entrances. My girlfriend won\u2019t gamble there",
          "I found the casino to be pretty clean. The service was good. The transition putting money into the slot machines instead of putting it on the casino card first makes it easier to use. The penny machines were fun! It\u2019s connected to a mall so it makes it quick to grab a",
          "Jack doesn't treat all players equally! Some receive rewards while others of the same standing get NOTHING! Or less than others... very unfair",
          "The casino is clean, employees are very friendly. Friday and Saturday nights are especially fun. Lots of music and people. Good atmosphere. Everyone is happy and the place is packed, but plenty of machines and tables to gamble. You can do well and win if you know when to",
          "Before gambling, check out the beautiful atrium and ceiling of the building that houses the casino. We played a bit and then went to Wahlburger's for a bite. It has more than one floor, pretty big casino. Walking distance from many of the hotels, a fun diversion in the",
          "We are not regular gamblers, but have been to Atlantic City. We stopped in Jack's since it was just a couple blocks away from the R&R Hall of Fame. Seemed quite boring on the inside and the folks hanging around the outside were less desirable. We felt uncomfortable and left",
          "I really don\u2019t like buffet style meals, but I was impressed with theirs, It was a good meal for a buffet.",
          "Fun and busy on a Wednesday afternoon. Good service although I had a new dealer at roulette and she made many mistakes.",
          "I was amazed by the automted black jack where one live dealer is dealing to a whole slew of customer seated at video terminals. He handles no money just rolls cards and talks smack through a microphone.",
          "They have to have the stupidest rewards program!!! When you spend ten dollars,you get ten dollars in rewards........to play the next day!!! Would not highly recommend this casino to anyone!!! Won't be going back!!!",
          "We made a random pit stop at the casino to use the restroom while walking around the city. We decided while there let's play a game or 2. Well that's about all they had in these huge building. It could not compare to the casinos we sre used to in our area. I also feel they need",
          "do not gamble at the jack casino, the table games are rigged and will take every dollar from you, the card shufflers no what every card on the table is. BEWARE the table games are rigged do not play at the Jack Casino. WARNING",
          "Not impressed. Definitely will not visit again. We played the video roulette for a while, that was fun... although we didn't win anything. Drinks are more expensive when a server brings them to you at your seat... go to the bar yourself & save $2 per beer.",
          "Stop down before night out at the comedy club. Slot machines don't pay as well as they used to. Not a big fan of the restructuring of your point system for your comps! Every 6 months you get re-evaluated and it's very very hard to be considered a C or K rating.. I guess they",
          "We stopped in here before the concert Saturday, because if you ate the Buffett the parking was free. The Buffett was delicious. Very helpful staff and friendly. The rest of the casino is clean and I felt very safe with the presence of all the security and police. The staff",
          "OMG I loved the disco Roulette... No crowded tables and only 10 bucks to play. My friends and I had a blast.",
          "We just stopped by as we were walking through downtown. I am not a big gambler so we didn't stay long. We played a few slots and then cashed out. Didn't win but didn't lose. An ok place to stop if you are downtown but I wouldn't make a trip just for this.",
          "its a beautiful place to see , don't miss it the old splendor of the higbee compant department has been changed into a casino with all the latest bells and whistles. so many slot machines , and table games - something for everyone",
          "Go to the 3rd for action,nice big poker room (31 tables),and they have tournaments,and a variety of games",
          "Bus day trip for a fun time ! Very clean and neat .You can feel the excitement just walking around fun slots",
          "my husband have never come down to the casino on a weekend night so thought we would give it a chance. I was ready to be disappointed since this was the Saturday night before st Patrick's day but I have to say. we had a great time! we have gone before during daytime and it's a",
          "I come to the casino frequently when I\u2019m downtown. They have really done justice to the original building (Higbees). It is beautiful and comfortable. I would recommend going just to visit the bar on the second floor. It\u2019s really worth the trip!",
          "I visit this casino a few times a month and I have never had a bad experience. The free play they gave me was better than any other casino I have been. The staff is always welcoming and provides excellent customer service. Cheryl and her supervisor, Lou, go above and beyond",
          "I used to live in Columbus and visited the casino often. I\u2019ve recently moved to Cleveland and decided to start playing poker again or so I thought. I never write reviews or complain but felt I had to vent after this highway robbery. I went this Saturday, parked in the casino",
          "Not a nice place. Cheap and dirty. You feel like any door you walk out of you are about to get mugged. Staff are friendly and helpful to be fair it\u2019s just the people inside.",
          "Sad to say, Jack Cleveland's WEBSITE MISINFORMS most of us out here as to the entertainment value OF YOUR CASINO. It is bad enough that YOUR casino is IN the HEART of Cleveland, a very murky and destitute town but IN ADDITION, it is NOTHING to BRAG about. It is an abhorrent",
          "Quick chance to play som Black Jack prior to the Cavs game. Always a good time at the Jack. Tables were open for play and dealers were friendly",
          "We were looking to burn time and a little money, this place certainly was a perfect place for that! So many different slot machine options which was great. Not super busy on a Sunday night so we had our pick of machines. Employees were friendly. The restrooms needed some",
          "We really enjoyed ourselves when we visited here over the holidays. The casino was very exciting and the food at the buffet was great. We will definitely go there again.",
          "By chance, we were walking through the Jack on the way to a birthday dinner. Since the honoree was younger, he was carded each time when entering the casino and both times was told to go to the Club Jack. He received a mug and a card. We then proceed to spend more than a few",
          "Went here with a group of friends while in town. Late nights things to do options can be a bit limited and this stays open. Casino is a little dated, drink selection and prices weren\u2019t that great but will do. Can\u2019t get in or out without going through many people asking for money",
          "It is a nice experience kind of a depressing atmosphere. The workers are all very nice and willing to assist you. It could be jazzed up a little. It is a great location and very easy to get to.",
          "Ok so to be fair, I gave this place 3 visits before adding this review. 1st off security is horrendous to put it mildly! My daughter was getting stalked by some guy to where she was uncomfortable to even leave my side, no security to be found! Young punks loitering smoking",
          "We come to Cleveland from New York at least 3 times a year and always stop at Jack's Casino the staff is friendly the food is good and if you've ever been to a Casino this place does its job I've visited casinos all over the U.S. and Jack's is in my top 3 by far great place to",
          "If you want to be legally robbed in downtown Cleveland, go to the Jack. Promised new facility has been cancelled leaving greedy owners to rake it all in.",
          "Only casino I'm aware of that is right in the center of the city. Former department store converted to a casino. First and second floor table games and slots. Tiny food court on second floor. Small bars on first and second. Third floor has a well run poker room. For what it",
          "I am a local resident and have been to this joke 2 times Staff and dealers were ok. First issue its just weird set up it almost seems temporary and it doesnt feel safe as i found out. I had a young thug try to shake me down during the day on the 2nd floor by the slots",
          "Because the casino will take your money! That is, if you make it through the phalanx of homeless and Street folks who will hit you up for it at the front door. I'm not a fan of the casino. ..",
          "We had 2 hours to fill on a Friday night so we decide to pop in. The staff was very helpful when we asked questions about different games. The layout was easy to navigate. The bartenders were swift & efficent. The bathroom was messy but that is no fault of the staff. We lost",
          "I had an issue with parking but was quickly resolved by customer service. A fun experience visiting in Cleveland Ohio.",
          "I've been going to this casino since it open as the Horseshoe in 2012. So when they switched over to the Jack,they automatically sent out their players cards. Evidently their cards are only good for each individual property. I visit Cincinnati once a year and stopped at their",
          "While in Cleveland we visited the JACK casino on a Saturday night. Being a Saturday night the casino was busy. Slot machines were a plenty with numerous table games. Staff were friendly and informative. There are several dinning options at the casino, but we did not eat",
          "Went there Saturday night with a group of friends while we were in town for the Cleveland Browns game on Sunday. Try to eat up at the food court but we were not able to work any of the kiosk that are available up there. All of them would not complete our purchases. Became",
          "Expensive parking, very tight. Asked a manger for help and he told me to call \"jack\" and walked away.!! Never again. Asked for his name so I could complain and I was asked to leave, after an hour drive to get there. These people are crooks!!!",
          "The casino is like most casinos. The players club though is pretty generous. We made enough points for two parking passes and $50 in match play. The buffet was not good at all. Food was either tough, or had very little flavor. For the price they charge, it should have been",
          "This casino is okay. I didn't really find anything exponential about it except that it was in Cleveland instead of Vegas. It's certainly not Vegas status. Sketchy neighborhood walking from parking to venue. Could use more security since everyone entering has money.",
          "We went with a group of people that were all in Ohio for work. We were there on a Saturday night and the place was pretty busy. We all went our ways and I was still able to find a $5 blackjack table. I played for almost 2 hours until I started losing so I got up and found my",
          "This is a HUGE casino but it's not a very pretty one. If you come to gamble I'm sure it does the job, but I visit casino's just to see the themes and unusual architecture. This has neither. It's just a big \"concrete structure\" with lots of gaming. I didn't every see a",
          "We had some time to waste before heading to the airport so decided to check this casino out. It is located in downtown Cleveland. We are glad we did as we found it easily with a parking garage very convenient to casino. Parking was $6 up to an hour and $10 for 1-2 hrs. So",
          "I went to the Casino just to eat at the buffet. I heard that the food was pretty good. They were right. There was plenty of variety. I am always looking for bread pudding for dessert. This was a lunch bunch thing with some other friends, Since it was buffet, it was great",
          "I haven\u2019t been lucky at blackjack yet but the dealers make it relaxing and enjoyable. Patrick, a dealer, remembers names and always social. I enjoy just sitting down with other players and having a great time talking. I wish the comps were better but other than that no",
          "While visiting the Cleveland area, we had a few hours to spare and wanted to get something to eat. What better place than a buffet at a casino? Well, the quality of the food really wasn't any better than a franchise buffet. The gelato was wonderful. The casino itself was drab",
          "This is a fun place to go have some fun. Two floors of slots and table game. The buffy is on the bottom floor, good food with different ethnic food. Get a card and get a discount. I like the second floor to gamble. This is a smoke free location.",
          "If you've ever been to a casino, even in decaying Atlantic City, you would expect better than this place....dark, uninviting, and definitely not exciting!",

          "Hey, it's a mid-city casino. Nothing special about it. But there was plenty of room and lots of play options. We were looking specifically for a Dean Martin slot machine and asked one of the casino ladies. She looked it up on a computer and took us right to it. Eh,l we lost our",
          "This was a nice casino with 3 different levels! The bars were really great to go and watch a game at. It was connected to our hotel so we didn\u2019t have to walk too far to get there which was really nice.",
          "We stopped in to Jack\u2019s after attending a ball game. This Casino was a fun surprise as this was our first time in Cleveland, and we had no idea that gambling was legal here. The location is great. Right in the heart of downtown. As long as you do not make comparisons to Vegas",
          "I was very disappointed with this casino. Not very good payouts. Pretty well are my money in ten minutes with not even a payout to keep you playing to stay a little longer",
          "+JMJ+ In the old department store from the Christmas Story House Movie, this is a large casino! So many slots and we never even made it to the other floor. A lot of table games and slots. The parking was a little confusing but was free with validation. Would go back again if",
          "No payouts.. not a fun casino.. they got rid of four card poker. And u lose ur points every six months not a fan of this casino i live in cleveland and travel to casino out of cleveland to play 4 card poker.. this casino just takes your money..",
          "I gather they have been voted Best Casino and Best Slots in town; however, I am not a gambler and have no idea how many other options exist. They were a convenient walk from our hotel so the four of us stopped. They are a secure, two floor gambling establishment with slots",
          "No blackjack tables were open. Poor selection of slot machines. Crap tables were open but so crowded that you couldn't get near them.",
          "Wanted to experience a little game of chance with the penny slots. No such luck all the penny slots had a minimum bid of 20 cents. Lots of machines and lot of people playing for a Thursday evening, but I only had $5 to spin for a win. Good spot if you need a fix, but nice",
          "We stopped by the casino to see what we could win. My wife managed to pull a dollar to two from that machines. The interior looks great. Unfortunately the men's bathrooms needed some cleaning. It took me three bathrooms to finally find one that was clean due to other",
          "Visited this casino today. I didn't find it anything special. The usual machines. Most of the employees I dealt with were ok. A couple were rather surely. Won't be back.",
          "This casino is so much nicer than Hard Rock, it clean, comfortable, slots are great, staff was helpful, very enjoyable day. Got free spins on most all of the machines. And the washrooms all worked, clean. We will make another visit soon, and will stay aware from Northfield",
          "Took us 25 minutes to figure out were parking was due to all of the construction. We found Valet but they wanted $30 no way Jose... Nice casino won a little bit but I would say the staff needs to be more friendly",
          "What a plus!!! Nice to enjoy an evening playing slots and table games and being overwhelmed by smoke. I know we stayed longer than normal for that exact reason. The slots were loose and I left with more money than I started with. Didi mention it was non-smoking???\ud83d\ude01",
          "This is a typical casino, they have newer slot machines, they keep it nice and clean. They have 3 different levels which was cool.",
          "Pretty cool place my wife and me go there every 6 months or so, they have a good buffet down stairs and several floors for gaming and have a poker room up stairs, no real live entertainment though but certainly if your in cleveland worth a look",
          "Looking to pass the time before or after game, play this is the place. Always something going on besides gambling.",
          "We did not enjoy the accoustics, They pay poorly on blackjack I believe it was $1 for every five bet. I did not know of anywhere else to go or I would have gone there. We lasted about 1/2 hour on $300",
          "Adequate casino to game at. First floor was empty but 2nd floor had many players and tables. As with many casino's outside of Vegas, odds were certainly in favor of the house. Found many penny slots that were open. Spent a few hours inside and went in with a budget, played",
          "An adequate casino experience, great way to preserve the old Higbees building and boost downtown. The usual table games and machines. Mediocre food court buffet downstairs. A few restaurants. If you play, you get free parking.",
          "I have gone to this casino since opening and recently attended since I became Jack. Not many new slots at all, games seem all the same and not that many to choose from. Seemed very dull there, not the same feel as you can get at other casinos in the area. No entertainment",

Unbeknownst to us, the casino is the site of what was the Higbee Toy Store from the movie. The Soldiers and Sailors Monument, just outside in",
          "Staying at a hotel just down the street, we decided to wander down and check it out. It was large and has a couple of floors, but had very few patrons when we were there.",

          "The casino is ok, nothing special about it at all from what I could tell. I was bored for an hour while my wife played the casinos on mostly older looking machines. The building is the original Higbee's Department Store which is now Jack Casino was featured in the movie \"A",

          "Fun area for adults, not sure if there was an area for kids. We went in for food and gambling, and both the food and gambling were fun. We had hours of entertainment and lost about the same amount if we would have gone to the movies at night.",
          "I had a problem trying to get a replacement players card. The woman working behind the counter May 10, 2018 at 8 pm in her40\u2019s was rude and would not answer questions or listen to my request.

          "Went on a Saturday night and it was not that busy. Walked in without any wait, lots of slots and table games, spaced out so not jammed in like some casino's, beer was $4.00 (cheap) machines were not at all tight.",
          "They won me at Smoke Free! They have all the new games and tables, and excellent staff. The machines seem to pay a hair better tan Las Vegas, but most importantly it was fun. We found out after that this was the filming location for the department store in The Christmas Story",
          "The casino itself was great busy and seemed well kept. My issue is with trying to get into the casino. They are so worried about checking everyone\u2019s iD it took for ever. I mean checking id is fine just need more help. One person at a entrance and lines are long need two people",
          "Great time at Jack Casino! Very cool, art-deco vibe. The site is impressive--plenty of slots & table games. Had a few cocktails which were made quite well and were reasonably priced. Tried the buffet. The food was very good. My only complaint was the wait to get in as that line",
          "Terrible!!! I live in the area. The food is awful. The comps are lowest ever. And i like to shoot craps. When anyone gets a good roll going the pit bosses will start to harrass the shooter resulting in an immediate 7 out. Jacks is just a ghetto. Don't go! Save your money.",
          "has lots of different games, see lots of big winners. Has a great Buffet and other places to eat. it is also connected to shopping which is awesome. There are a bunch of different places to stay downtown and lots to see so the whole experience is worth it",

          "spent an evening at the casino and the dealers and waitresses were all top notch. Will definitely return.",
          "This casino does not give good pay outs in my opinion compared to many casinos I have traveled to. I did see some big winners but appeared to be locals only. Drink service is super slow",

          "Head to the second floor, the action is happening there. Lots of tables and good burgers at Stackd. The first floor is like an old department store converted into a make-shift casino. Oh yeah, head to the buffet if you hit it big!",

          "I continue my consistent reviews of this place by stating it has the worst comp system anywhere. I played more than 6 hours here on a Saturday night. 3 hours of poker earned my $3 in comps which is fine. I played craps for another 3 hours and earned a lousy $4 in comps. There is",
          "Great smoke free casino! Have great bar areas and places to relax while not playing slots. Have a nice time here !",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to this casino. Having a covered walkway from the parking deck to the casino is a big plus, especially in the winter months. The breakfast buffet is fantastic. The casino is nicely laid out and well-maintained. Overall, really enjoyed my time here.",
          "Drinks were average cost, average taste. Polie bartenders. Enjoyed watching people. Did not see any big winners while I was there.",

          "Went on May 30th a Tuesday early evening before Neil Diamond concert. First time there-saw enough to want to go again, in late morning or early afternoon. Since, it is on the smaller size, these times during the week would be good. I can see how it would be very crowded during",
          "Truly enjoyed the atmosphere here. The \"Rewards desk\" staff was very helpful in signing us up for a player's card & answering questions that we had. Ohio has non-smoking casinos which we envy. We live in MI where we have to put up w/ the smoke. I have to say that the slots",
          "Not very impressed by this casino. Very small and dingy. Limited games to play, we left in under an hour. Not worth the visit, wouldn't go back.",
          "I stopped in before game 4 with Boston. The video poker was fun. Drink orders are online again and Judith was outstandingly. The sports area before the overpass was excellent. I don't gamble but it was enjoyable for an hour.",
          "Something to do in downtown Cleveland. Buffet is okay. Almost forget it used to be a department store.",
          "This Casino has tables and the VLT's whereas, the other Cleveland, Ohio casinos only have the VLT's. Weekends and game nights are busy with patrons from these venues wanting to spend their money. So, anticipate longer and more crowded areas. They are 24/7. One can park in",
          "Went to his casino while in Cleveland .. pretty tight on slots .. 2 levels .. Level 2 has much more to offer .",
          "I've been to this casino twice. One time for the buffet which was really good with lots of choices and the other time to use the bathroom when walking around downtown. The inside is super nice and always seems pretty crowded. Definitely looking forward to stopping in again and",

          "If you want a casino to stop in before or after dinner, Indians, Cavs or concerts -- It is crowded and loud on weekends with music playing --- I would rather go to Northfield Rocksino ---- but if you are downtown go here.",
          "My first visit was my last. Save your money for a trip to Vegas. This was the first casino where there were no sounds of anyone having a good time. Depressing!",

          "Nice Casino!!! Located next to Progressive Field and Quicken Loans Arena. I think it's unique because it was the former Higbees Department Store featured in The Christmas Story classic movie. We ate food from Burgers and Brats... delicious hamburger!!! Great food court!!!!",
          "We went to the jack and while there are dinning options they are very expensive also the machines are two close together. I've been to a few casinos and this one by far is my least favorite. Rather travel out of town to PA or Canada",
          "This casino is smoke free which was amazing. It was nice to play the slots and roulette without any chance of lung cancer. It's on two floors and definitely go on a weekday as you've got the place to yourself.",

          "Stopped by the casino on a recent trip Cleveland. The place is kind of dumpy and very small. They have 4 roulette tables two were $25/spin and two were $15/spin. You couldn't get near the $15 table as it was 3 deep around the table. Every table game was packed. The space is so",

          "This place has a great buffet. A little pricey, but for a great buffet it's good if you are a big eater. They used the interior of a historic department store. It has the high decorative ceilings and huge chandeliers. I have friends that go there alot.",
          "When to the buffet dinner since my daughter won some free tickets for it. We were there once before when it was the Horseshoe. It was much better then. This time some food was cold, out of many items, and buffer was a mess. The staff was terrible. We won't go back there again.",
          "This place is no better then the horse shoe casino. Jack's promotions are a joke and all the games are all tight. You lose more then you win. Im a A member and cut my card up this month. I will never step foot in this top off casino again. When this place first opened as horse",
          "I came to the jack hoping that it had improved since it was taken over from the horseshoe . I have been out of town for god past two years and was disappointed that things were no better, but fortunately no worse ! I was saddened that they took my c card away and gave me an a",

          "I didn't find the staff to be very helpful. I had to go through the Jack Club line twice to get instructions on how to use my $5.00 credit. Even then it took me a while to figure it out on the slot machine. The atmosphere was dark and I felt I welcomed. There seemed to be a good",
          "Was there only once. Remodeled former high-end department store in downtown Cleveland. Not that exciting. Parking was difficult though I think they have solved some of that issue. Good starting point to see other attractions such as Indians' stadium, Browns' stadium, Rock &",

          "My husband and I headed to Jack while our daughter was at a concert at the Q. Since there is good parking we were able to work out logistics of picking her up pretty easy which was a major plus for us. We didn't win anything but we had fun. Good amount of wheel of fortune games",
          "We had a really fun night at the casino. It is a great place to see in the city. Fun music, tons of games, great restaurants. The location is perfect also with a lot of attached parking. We love it there.",

          "This is a basic, no frills casino for die hard gamblers that aren't looking for anything fancy. It is in Cleveland right downtown so it's easily accessible from the downtown hotels. But, it is a bit stark inside and depressing. I played 40 dollars and lost it within 10 minutes.",
          "Nothing but an old arcade building and they dumped a bunch of slot machines into it......zero class. The guests in there are dodgy as hell.....I was more concerned about getting beat up or robbed than losing my money to the casino. Staff carry the arrogance like they are",
          "May not be Vegas, but if you live in Cleveland, or are visiting the area, a nice way to spend a few hours. Parking is easy after 5pm, can usually find free parking on the street near Tower City. They have two floors with slot machines, and different cost levels for the tables.",
          "If you love table games, then Jacks could be for you...they have taken out a lot of the slot machines to make room for lots and lots of table games.....I prefer slots, so I just don't get to downtown Jacks very ofter....Good luck",
          "I was a member of the Total Rewards Program with Ceasar Entertainment. So it was well worth it for me to play at the old casino because it built up points for my trips to Vegas. But now that they are not connected, it just seems different. When I went to apply for my Jack Card,",
          "Dealers are fun but comps are lacking. If you are used to churning and earning then you will be disappointed.",
          "I regularly played Blackjack when it was the Horseshoe and could win a little here and there. I played several times a week. Since it has become Jack's the\"random\" blackjack cards are almost predictable. The odds of busting on 13 is 39%, however now when you get 13, nine times",
          "I was a very frequent visitor to Cleveland Horseshoe Casino. It was always fun, win or lose. The Total Rewards Players Club meant point towards a trip to Las Vegas. The combined points of Cleveland and Las Vegas was the best incentive to keep coming back to Cleveland",
          "Visited Jack about 10am on a Tuesday morning. Very dead. Hardly any table or slot play. Just not the same as when it was the Horseshoe. There was always lots of action when it was a Caesars property. The reward play and comps leave a lot to be desired. Really very little",
          "We played 3 slot games and won 1k, 1200 and 700 until the concierge came and introduced herself. She is now known as \"the cooler\" necause she offered nothing and we put 500 back in with ZERO wins. All and all a good night.",
          "We tried this casino and will not be back. The parking at any casino garage should be free with a casino validation ticket. We have NEVER had to pay for parking at any casino in ANY state. If the events around the casino cause a parking issue maybe the owners should have thought",
          "It was definitely better when it was the Horsehoe! The rewards program is not that good, the staff is not very friendly and the drink girls are few and far between! But being downtown needing to kill sometime before or after a game it's not too bad!",
          "This could be the most expensive casino buffet in the United States. To be fair, if you gamble a lot the price is discounted. Most of the food offerings are just average.",

          "Being new to live poker play, i went here to look at the poker room. The floor manager Dennis was amazing, answered every question I had and was a huge help, major 5 star treatment, and i even explained to him I wasn't a big money spender, he still treated me as though I had",
          "We went several time when it was Horseshoe Casino always had a good time. We have been back twice sine it has become JACK and I do not like it at all. It used to be a nice classy place to go on a Friday/Saturday night and not it is full of white trash and homeless people. it",
          "Had a great time here gambling and enjoying the casino scene. I lost my money, but I had fun doing it.",

          "My husband and I visited the casino when it was the Horseshoe, but we just walked around to check it out. This time, we had time to spare while we stayed overnight for the weekend. The casino is beautifully appointed with large chandeliers. The rooms are large and the slot",

          "Had a solid couple of days at Jack. Do NOT gamble on the second floor as the Black Jack payout is less then bottom floor and the service for drinks sucks down there. Overall good experience with dealers and personnel.",
          "When this Casino was The Horseshoe, owned by Caesar's it was GREAT place to take your Friends for Gambling. Only a 3 hour drive from Buffalo, New York. Now that it is owned by someone new, and Its named JACK it is not the same and the machines are so tight! A non-smoking Casino",
          "We had a lot of fun visiting this Casino! It was connected to our hotel -- The Renaissance Hotel. We set a dollar limit on how much we would blow and had a lot of fun playing the machines. We ate pizza in the cafe area and had a couple drinks. We stayed approximately 2 1/2 hrs.",
          "Just not the same since became JACK. Tighter machines Mickey Mouse promotions and much smaller jackpots!",
          "This casino is located on a few floors. There is a nice variety of gaming tables and slots. Buffet on lower level is excellent. They also have a food court and other restaurants to choose from. Casino is clean and smoke free. Location is excellent in the middle of downtown",
          "This is my first time going to a Jack Casino in Cleveland, and it was what is to be expected. It was a nice clean place, with plenty of tables. The staff was professional and helpful. The one complaint is that the staff did not come around for drink orders very frequently.",
          "Recently changed the name since I moved. Just an average casino with nothing that special to make it a must see when you are in town.",
          "Spent a day before Christmas visiting the Jack and downtown Cleveland. It was fun to see some of the old Higbee's decorations. Casino staff was friendly and helpful.",
          "Video poker players will understand what I am about to say: We went there yesterday, for the first time in months (when it was the Horseshoe we went bi-weekly) and we both played video poker. Here is the scenario: Every hand, and I am not exaggerating in the least, went like",

          "I was here the weekend of the Bengals v. Browns game during the Cavs game on Saturday, and I helped bring a bus load of attendees. The process for getting the bus riders registered and ready to gamble was excellent. We had an attendant that boarded the bus and handed out cards",
          "I just revisited this poker room and was shocked to see what was going on. I was a regular player a year ago and thought it was a good poker room. I cam back and could not believe how bad it was. The tournament formats were the worst I have seen. They are set up to reward poor",
          "Crowded. Terrible layout for traffic flow. Too much terrible noise -- can't make out games from muzak, from what. Amateur food options. Casino elevators smell faintly of urine. $10 parking underground sketchy and elevators smell strongly like urine. Once was enough.",
          "Not the cleanest casino I have been in. Very crowded, though, Cavaliers game ended just as I was leaving.",
          "Fun, had good time waitress's were fast and friendly had a good time tables were kinda tight but that's okay! Still had a great time",
          "Very beautiful. Clean.busy. Alot of bums on your way in asking for $$. But once your inside your good. Bars are average price and gambling is decent.",
          "Been here a few times now. First seem to get to exciting. Place never busy and not much going on. Many tables closed a lot. The ones that are open seem sub par. The facility seems very out dated and in need of s major overhaul.",

          "I'm not a gambler. However my friend is and we stopped in after a Cavs game. Jacks is very convenient. Close to downtown close to \"the Q\" and Progressive Field. We played black jack in the down stairs. The real nice part is upstairs which we didn't notice till we were leaving.",

          "A few members of my family and I visited the Cleveland area briefly in December 2016. We were aware that there was a Horseshoe Casino nearby, as we had visited a couple of years before. During this visit, we noticed that the casino had been renamed to JACK. We had a 3-hour",
          "Just recently went to the Jack with friends while in Cleveland for business. Had a great time and was full of energy. Very nicely laid out.",
          "It's obvious this isn't a Vegas casino. The video game choices are ok, the dealers are nice and competent, but the place is not at all old and yet seems tired. I was disappointed most in the table game minimums and the amount of tables open. The lack of a Players Club that",
          "We stopped in because of an offer we received for freeplay. We have had player cards since this was Horseshoe. Cards transferred over to JACK so we still get offers. We actually wanted to visit the gift shop. We have a lot of comp points to spend before the end of the year and",
          "Stopped in to play some blackjack, friendly bouncer, nice clean place. Nice atmosphere, the dealer was a cool guy, I always like when they count it up for you. Once we lost all our money we left. Nice place.",
          "Don't expect to win big at Jack! Guests service desk gave misinformation..they should have someone specifically designated for new members, but the Payouts are so low it's not worth signing up for the Jack rewards anyway.",
          "Have to pay for drinks! Didn't win squat. $10 free slot play was only good for 24 hours. Brunch buffet was good before Browns game. Get a players card to discount the price. Expensive.",
          "Staff was fun loving and friendly. Went with 3 friends and played a ton of roulette and craps. I did very well, but my friends didn't... they don't build these places on winners though.",
          "Pretty casino. A little too crowded on friday night after Cavs game. Could not get 2 of us at the same table. Had fun. Professional staff. Would come back a slower time.",
          "The people are not friendly, The staff is awful the food is great, the buffet is to die for. Jacks is very clean.",
          "average at best....I've been to better...parking was not great...good security though..friendly workers..",
          "This casino is fun. I was there with a friend on a weekday afternoon. We played the machines and then had lunch at the buffet. I felt safe as there's security at the entrance, the facility is crowded but pretty clean.",
          "We didn't play the tables, but the slots were pretty nice. Actually won a bit. The casino itself is very clean. There's no smoking so that's also a bonus. The staff is super nice and helps with any question you may have.",
          "Pretty big spot with lots of machines, quick bar service,really fair drink prices for tasty mixed drinks . Haven't tried buffet yet",
          "blackjack dealers very rude never smiles some cant speak good English hard to understand them hard to play this way",
          "Classic casino, great location and very friendly staff. We went to check it out before heading to 4th Street.",
          "My wife and myself stopped here briefly during our recent stay. Unless we missed something and I think we covered the whole casino, the cheapest blackjack table was $15 per hand while the majority of the slot machines were 1c and 2c with only a handful of $1 slots. Kinda",
          "I have gone to what is now The Jack Casino in Cleveland many times. The new comp/point system is terrible. Parking is no longer comped with just 30 minutes of play time. The payouts on slot machines are the worst I have ever experienced. The casino has the same slot games",
          "Always enjoyed a visit when it was the Horseshoe. Now under new ownership and management, the culture is much different. Love the location and historic building but let's start with parking. Every other casino allows for free surface parking. You will pay to park, typically",
          "Looked like your typical dive casino. Very dirty outside entrance. Littered with garbage and assorted debris.",
          "I'm not much of a gambler but I enjoyed hanging out at the casino. The casino is very pretty and everyone was friendly, but it was a slow night. Not much going on but we did have access to any slot machine we wanted. Definitely a fun time.",
          "Overall a good casino - they do some weird things when cashing out like refusing to cash chips without a players card or photo ID. But the work around is break up the amount and go to different cashiers booths - pit bosses are very nice",
          "We go every other month to play blackjack and have brunch. The casino is just what you would expect from a casino, its clean with no surprises. We love the brunch downstairs. It is a great buffet will all kinds of food from all over the world. They weren't serving the famous",
          "Too much fun. Music and dancing. Great atmosphere. Drinks were very reasonably priced. Definitely a favorite for us!",
          "The casino was clean and super crowded before game day. I ordered a drink that was so weak I told the bartender to keep it. She was a bit rude and not helpful. The ATM machine wasn't working so we had to stand in multiple lines to get cash only to find no open tables.",
          "but I won enough money to buy dinner. Located in a great area downtown. Lots of choices for pubs and restaurants within walking distance. Who knew Cleveland was so cool!",

          "I just played mostly $1 slots and some 25cent slots and I felt they were very fair. My husband and I did walk out with near 3 times what we started with. I will definitely be back. I walked here from hotel. Good Luck! Oh the reuben from the sandwich shop second was the best I",
          "I last visited when it was known as the Horseshoe. To be honest at that time I was not a fan. I did revisit in Sept 2016 and was beyond surprised. I found the atmospere elegant and inviting. The machines all payed out. I didn't win a lot of money but enough to play throughout",
          "the buffet is always good, and the slots are ok like anywhere up and down , great table games, the parking garage is a long walk and away from casino which is hard for the elderly, drop them at the door first!",
          "We played our free slots, black jack, had a visit to the bar and ended our night. The staff was friendly and informative. Parking garage was convenient, but a little pricey.",

          "The parking situation is a disaster and they need to do something about it, good luck getting out of the garage within 20 minutes if there is the slightest rush. After a Cavs or Indians game, forget about it you might as well wait for an \u2026",
          "The place is decent as usual. Nothing spectacular.  Drink orders at the machines dont work. Waited over an hr and drink never came. Place is starting to look a little dingy but its to be expected over time. It's a decent close place but theres room for improvement.",

          "First time ever in a casino and we loved it.  Very spacious place and plenty of games to play.",
          "Casino is great for play but security outside is not great. I have nothing against homeless people but I dont like being harrassed by 15 standing at the front door begging for money. Drink prices fair. Second floor much better than 1st",
          "It makes me mad that when I go thru wanna look in my purse. Now let me say my purse is only big enough for my ID. Bank card and car keys. I can't even fit my phone in there. But they never wanna see anybodys pockets. I had more in my pockets than I did in my purse done make no sense",

          "Fun atmosphere. Some dealers are a bit slow and sloppy, but it\u2019s not Vegas. If you lower your expectations, you\u2019ll have a good time.",
          "What\u2019s disappointment! I was born and raised in Cle.  Was at the casino the week it opened and visited often in the first few years by myself and never felt that it was an unsafe environment. How things have changed! Ever exit including the \u2026",
          "Just like i said before and this is my 5 time down here. You all let all the other people when and i saw it 3 times they set right bye me on the buffalo game and won 75. In 2 minutes and i was sitting there for 2 hours and still nothing. So it is true the front color wins all the time.",

          "Nice casino.  Not all that spectacular.  Could be just me, not a big gambler.  If you have money to blow, give it a try.  To me, it's a big waste of time and money.",

          "They stopped the $5.55 lunches for J card holders. Sad. My coworkers and I used to go there weekly. Now they only have the higher end card holders enjoy this benefit. I wish they would bring this back for all. The casino is missing out on all that business. Dumb.",
          "It was fun, we had the buffet though and I was not impressed. Oh well",
          "Very friendly and accommodating.  Only 3 stars Cuz machines didn't pay out.",
          "An absolute waste of time and money. Tight slots. The only thing I enjoyed was the free buffet and parking if I played enough time or money while there.",

          "Couldn't find Jack anywhere. Casino is nice though. Clean and exciting.",
          "Needs to go back to Caesars. Just cant win there anymore and it's not worth the comps they offer if not tied to Vegas. A trip to vegas is cheaper than a trip to the Jack.6 month renewal is annoying and they take comp $ quite quick if you dont instantly use",

          "I put $20 in a slot machine and won over $1,100! Uncommon luck, sure but definitely a good time!",
          "Nice place with great food and entertainment. It was strange to me that it's non smoking, I'd prefer it wasn't. Very convenient that there's indoor access to the trains. They gave me a free buffet for my birthday and it was phenomenal. \u2026",
          "It was very plasent,and every one was polite....",
          "Misleading and a complete ripoff!!! Casino itself was average at best. Parking was a complete joke. We were from out of town and saw a sign that said free parking if you play at the casino. We went in and played the slots, with cash, for \u2026",
          "DO NOT play table games here. If you happen to win you will be lined up around the corner to cash in your chips. Not just once, I am guilty of coming back hoping the service gets better. It doesn't.",

          "Poor service, no refills on beverages and rude staff. Food is only ok, and overpriced.",
          "Plenty of slots to choose from. They do offer cards, but very little guidance as to what games are running. They host a lot of promotions also. There isn't a smoking patio though you can grab a bite to eat from one of the on site \u2026",
          "I had a good time. They don't have my favorite machines but I found plenty to play. And I enjoyed the buffet",

          "The atmosphere is great and he ppl are awesome",
          "The atmosphere is great but the slots have become a bit scarce in the feature awards and payouts.  MGM almost never hits so this is still the best odds.",
          "I am definitely not a gambler but it's fun to go in and try your luck.  Just remember that these places aren't built on patrons winning.",

          "If you caint find me you know where im at...",
          "I went here on a Saturday evening. It wasn't quiet, but it wasn't exactly energetic either. Our blackjack dealer was friendly and helpful. I hung out with a couple of friends playing craps and was disappointed that the stickman didn't \u2026",
          "Fun card tables. Lots of different games with a range of minimums. Slots vary in each room with lots to choose from. Major popular slots are available. Buffet is pricey but delicious. Parking is screwy. Be sure you use your Jack club card \u2026",
          "Parking stinks, drinks dont taste right half the time, food is average on a good day,  comps are almost non existent, and the hospitality is non existent",
          "In the area so we stopped by.  The patrons looked so sad.  Just sitting at tables with blank stares on their faces.  The building is nice outside more than inside.   Ceilings a little low on all but the main floor.  \nJust cant get over how \u2026",

          "Had a great time at the Casino \ud83c\udfb0 downtown. Cleveland is a big sports city , like my city Baltimore. My family members and I enjoyed the experience. The only thing I hated was the parking fees $$. Been to Casinos all over the country never \u2026",
          "The entrance on Euclid & Ontario is disgusting. They really need to take some time to clean it up.",
          "Mostly clean with good food and affordable drinks. Slots always feel tight. The people asking for money everywhere are annoying. Middle of the road casino experience.",
          "Buffet not a good selection. My wife and I have been there 7 times and food seems to not get better. We are thinking about going back to Northfield because our free play is getting less and less even though we are playing more!!",
          "Convenient if you are already downtown, but not worth a special trip.  For a reasonably new casino, it is already looking shabby, and the bathrooms are atrocious.",
          "Great time, parking is horribly expensive... Definitely park at the Renaissance",
          "I had a wonderful time, and I enjoyed the buffet.",
          "Everyone was super nice from the valet parking to the cashiers, food attendants and the floor mgrs. Very clean and safe. Great mix of slots and tables.",
          "Great place for gamblers to go. Plenty of excitement in the atmosphere.",
          "Love it wish they would send me stuff in the mail so i can come every week !lol",

          "Convenient location. A decent mix of games. Not a bad little casino.",
          "Nice casino but parking could be better an not have to make sure you don't spend all ur money cuz you have to pay for parking by the hr but it's a really nice place to go",
          "Love being there and just watching everyone have fun. Great place to go and hang out and you can watch the sport games.",
          "It's an interesting place, located rather close to where I live.  Dislike how expensive the tables are on Friday nights.",
          "Very nice.  We stopped and had Brunch first downstairs in the Casino and then up to the gaming floor. Not overly crowded when we went so it was nice to be able to move around and get to play the machines or table without having to wait. My \u2026",
          "One of my fav casinos! I love visiting JACK and always have a good time.",
          "Has lots more table games than they used to, slots looks like they have a few choices for a quick bite but everything thing seems so crowded together not much space to move around in certain areas",
          "Food choices were great.  All you can eat steak, salmon and shrimp!",
          "It's been awhile since I was here and they have changed a lot of the machines I will have to wait and see so for now just 4 stars if I win it will get 5",
          "Even though I'm not very good at anything, still a great time. Jay in the poker room is an awesome guy and will really take care of you. Waitstaff is fantastic",
          "Very few waitresses offering beverages, Not many winners in the room and the buffet was gross.  The people that work there are nice though.  We are not going back. The MGM is a better bet.",
          "I always have a good time.",
          "Buffet is sub par. Food was cold and tasteless. Service was slow. Didn't get our beverages until we were almost done with our meal. Very unimpressed.",

          "Lost some money most dealers are helpful on the blackjack tables! Bob is awesome!",
          "I Work here.  The staff is always nice. It's a great work environment. I don't gamble much but majority of people who do, they come back often",
          "Was going there and noticed a pattern with the blackjack dealers. Today confirmed it. They will cheat just to change the cards. Instead of making it right they throw u out. Wasn't able to cash chips in and had to send some1 in there to do \u2026",
          "Coming from jersey close to ac, I have to say this was a really nice casino.",
          "It's terrible going to a casino you have to pay to park at, and if you Uber you get to hangout with a bunch of homeless people right outside the doors. Might be the worst casino I have been to.",
          "Very friendly staff, easy access from hotel and shops with out going outside",
          "Fun place to play a few table games.",
          "I always go in the early morning so it's never really busy it would get 5* if they had some self serv soda machines",
          "Nice casino. Had fun, and dont forget the rewards card.",
          "Best dealers in town, actually best dealers anywhere. Vegas dealers don\u2019t have the consistency nor the training these dealers have. Nothing you can do about paying for drinks, it is what it is in Ohio. Great building. Fun environment. Good entertainment on weekends. You won\u2019t find a better hang in Cleveland.",
          "It would have been nice for staff to properly explain I would need to return to use the $10 play added to my card after spending $10. The procedures of signing up for a Jack card was bogus to only go to the desk after spending $10. The \u2026",

          "Great place if your responsible. 50 dollar parking is comped if you spend 1 hour in poker room.",
          "I.m afraid to go again .  Every time no machines pay out  and it seems after 50 plays on the roulette wheel it knew what I was going to doo..",
          "I just love it for it's location and slot machines.  Oh!  And the food is delicious!",
          "Can never win here unless you drop heavy bills. No self serve drinks. Every room is a smoking room. Went after a Cavs game, DJ was just playing a Spotify playlist. MGM Maryland is best casino by a mile",
          "I always have fun here",
          "Casino was typical as far as being fair with switching dealers when you get a \u201chot hand\u201d...\n\nGetting food at the end of the night is a gamble alone due to long lines.  Although the cook that makes the late night, incredible burgers at \u2026",
          "Lost my Card and had general questions about the Casino. The representative behind the desk, Kita was more than pleasant explaining and helping me with every question i had in a timely and professional matter. If my review matters she deserves employee of the month as well as a pay increase!",

          "Food awesome \ud83d\udc4d upstairs for lunch!",
          "Cleveland's very own casino, Vegas had nothing to fear, but you can scratch that gambling itch right here. Lots and lots of slots, some of the nicest and helpful dealers anywhere. All the table games you've ever heard of and some time never \u2026",
          "Jack's is a great place to visit",
          "Great Casino, loved my time here. Staff is very friendly and the casino is big and has a wide variety of slots and tables and games. The drinks are also priced well. Everytime I visit cleveland I go here.",
          "Great to stop in after an Indians game but there are no craps tables - just those ones with the dice in the bubbles.",
          "Love going here to pass time and have a little fun.",
          "The buffet is great, the casino itself, not so much.",
          "I only love this place because sometimes they give me a little change. Close to home... Downtown Cleveland.",

          "The drink service is horrible but at least I won my money back",

          "Great food and very clean.",
          "If you like watching your money get taken quickly, put it in one of these slot machines.  Even paying the minimum 75 cent spin, you will lose $24.00 before you see any play from the slot.  Greedy and ghetto. Of course they will (or not) \u2026",
          "In town and decided to check out the casino. It felt a little old, but nice. We had the buffet and it wasnt that bad. The parking is something else. It is very confusing to find a spot in the first place then they charged 40 dollars! Its a madness.",
          "Thanks for the link.  To bad the kiosk wasn't working and we had no choice but to pay full parking.  First time ever.  As I said not coming back.  Reach out. Make it right and maybe or just keep pointing me to useless documentation.",
          "Fun place. Nice people.",

          "By far the worst buffet around....every time!! This time we waited forever to pay, people was seated ahead of us, out of order 3 times, the whole place was filthy and the food was disgusting. We only tried it again because we had 1 buffet free and it was still a rip off.",

          "Boring. Took out all the  interconnecting national machines with high payouts. Too many of the same kind machines bought at a discount instead of the new themed fun ones on the market.  Put in game you rarely win on.",

          "We don't gamble, but we had a great experience at the bar. The bartender was personable and made a memorable experience",

          "Odds are of in blackjack only pays 6 to 5. Also 3 card poker flush only 3 to 1 and straight 5 to 1. Terrible odds. Slots also don't seem to ever win. Better odds with max bet but that's like 2.50 a spin at least. Poker room has a high rake \u2026",
          "I don't gamble, but overall the space was nice. Plenty of room to get around and places to eat.",

          "We visited for our Anniversary and had a great time!  All the staff members were friendly and helpful!",
          "It was not good I wish that this place would have kept a regular pai gow poker game instead of making all face up tables by doing this the chance for me to come more often has been eliminated",

          "Could not find one of our favorite wheel of Fortune games \u2639\ufe0f. There have been lots of changes from the parking, especially taking away the senior free parking. We did not realize the points that was on our cards expired that was disappointing also. I will admit it was not all bad.",
          "I'll start by saying that this casino had very friendly staff and an entertaining atmosphere. However, what ever system these machines run on is terrible  if I were to bet $5 and win a small hand of like $2 or something, I would only have \u2026",

When I left the attendant charged me $60 and said that the other side of the sign said that amount. If you treat people that way without entering your establishment I will not bother going inside",

          "This place is not good at all! I been coming here for 5 years and I have lost thousands of dollars.  But it's funny because I have never won. Most casinos I understand you don't win. But five years? Thousands of dollars? I feel like they don't have their odds set corect.",

There are some shady characters due to being right downtown, just keep an eye open and be safe. Otherwise it's a friendly environment and fun (if you're winning)",

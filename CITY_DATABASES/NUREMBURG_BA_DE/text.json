        "wiki": "Nuremberg ( NEWR-\u0259m-burg; German: N\u00fcrnberg [\u02c8n\u028f\u0281nb\u025b\u0281k] (listen); Bavarian: Niamberg; East Franconian: N\u00e4rrnberch or N\u00e4mberch, locally N\u00e4rmberch) is the second-largest city of the German federal state of Bavaria after its capital Munich, and its 511,628 (2016) inhabitants make it the 14th largest city in Germany. On the Pegnitz River (from its confluence with the Rednitz in F\u00fcrth onwards: Regnitz, a tributary of the River Main) and the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal, it lies in the Bavarian administrative region of Middle Franconia, and is the largest city and the unofficial capital of Franconia. Nuremberg forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring cities of F\u00fcrth, Erlangen and Schwabach with a total population of 798,867 (2018), while the larger Nuremberg Metropolitan Region has approximately 3.6 million inhabitants. The city lies about 170 kilometres (110 mi) north of Munich. It is the largest city in the East Franconian dialect area (colloquially: \"Franconian\"; German: Fr\u00e4nkisch), Nuremberg was one of the host cities of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nThere are many institutions of higher education in the city, including the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg). With 39,780 students in 2017, it is Bavaria's third-largest and Germany's 11th-largest university, with campuses in Erlangen and Nuremberg and a university hospital in Erlangen (Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen). Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg Georg Simon Ohm and Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg are also located within the city. Nuremberg Airport (Flughafen N\u00fcrnberg \u201cAlbrecht D\u00fcrer\u201c) is the second-busiest airport in Bavaria after Munich Airport, and the tenth-busiest airport in Germany.\nStaatstheater N\u00fcrnberg is one of the five Bavarian state theatres, showing operas, operettas, musicals, and ballets (main venue: Nuremberg Opera House), plays (main venue: Schauspielhaus N\u00fcrnberg), as well as concerts (main venue: Meistersingerhalle). Its orchestra, Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg, is Bavaria's second-largest opera orchestra after the Bavarian State Opera's Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich. Nuremberg is the birthplace of Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Johann Pachelbel.\nNuremberg was the site of major Nazi rallies, and it provided the site for the Nuremberg trials, which held to account many major Nazi officials.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe first documentary mention of the city, in 1050, mentions Nuremberg as the location of an Imperial castle between the East Franks and the Bavarian March of the Nordgau. From 1050 to 1571 the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade-routes. King Conrad III (reigning as King of Germany from 1138 to 1152) established the Burgraviate of Nuremberg, with the first burgraves coming from the Austrian House of Raab. With the extinction of their male line around 1190, the last Raabs count's son-in-law, Frederick I from the House of Hohenzollern, inherited the burgraviate in 1192.\nFrom the late 12th century to the Interregnum (1254\u201373), however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Hohenstaufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor (German: Reichsschulthei\u00df) from 1173/74. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city.\n \nNuremberg is often referred to as the \"unofficial capital\" of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly because the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg played an important role in the administration of the empire. The increasing demands of the Imperial court and the increasing importance of the city attracted increased trade and commerce in Nuremberg. In 1219 Emperor Frederick II granted the Gro\u00dfen Freiheitsbrief ('Great Letter of Freedom'), including town rights, Imperial immediacy (Reichsfreiheit), the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy - almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves. Nuremberg soon became, with Augsburg, one of the two great trade-centers on the route from Italy to Northern Europe.\nIn 1298 the Jews of the town were falsely accused of having desecrated the host, and 698 of them were killed in one of the many Rintfleisch massacres. Behind the massacre of 1298 was also the desire to combine the northern and southern parts of the city, which were divided by the Pegnitz. The Jews of the German lands suffered many massacres during the plague pandemic of the mid-14th century.\nIn 1349 Nuremberg's Jews suffered a pogrom. They were burned at the stake or expelled, and a marketplace was built over the former Jewish quarter. The plague returned to the city in 1405, 1435, 1437, 1482, 1494, 1520 and 1534.\n\nThe largest growth of Nuremberg occurred in the 14th century. Charles IV's Golden Bull of 1356, naming Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet, made Nuremberg one of the three most important cities of the Empire. Charles was the patron of the Frauenkirche, built between 1352 and 1362 (the architect was likely Peter Parler), where the Imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg. The royal and Imperial connection grew stronger in 1423 when the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg granted the Imperial regalia to be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 1796, when the advance of French troops required their removal to Regensburg and thence to Vienna.In 1349 the members of the guilds unsuccessfully rebelled against the patricians in a Handwerkeraufstand ('Craftsmen's Uprising'), supported by merchants and some by councillors, leading to a ban on any self-organisation of the artisans in the city, abolishing the guilds that were customary elsewhere in Europe; the unions were then dissolved, and the oligarchs remained in power while Nuremberg was a free city (until the early-19th century). Charles IV conferred upon the city the right to conclude alliances independently, thereby placing it upon a politically equal footing with the princes of the Empire. Frequent fights took place with the burgraves - without, however, inflicting lasting damage upon the city. After fire destroyed the castle in 1420 during a feud between Frederick IV (from 1417 Margrave of Brandenburg) and the duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, the city purchased the ruins and the forest belonging to the castle (1427), resulting in the city's total sovereignty within its borders.\nThrough these and other acquisitions the city accumulated considerable territory. The Hussite Wars (1419-1434), a recurrence of the Black Death in 1437, and the First Margrave War (1449-1450) led to a severe fall in population in the mid-15th century. Siding with Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria-Munich, in the Landshut War of Succession of 1503-1505 led the city to gain substantial territory, resulting in lands of 25 sq mi (64.7 km2), making it one of the largest Imperial cities.During the Middle Ages, Nuremberg fostered a rich, varied, and influential literary culture.\n\n\n=== Early modern age ===\n\nThe cultural flowering of Nuremberg, in the 15th and 16th centuries, made it the centre of the German Renaissance. In 1525, Nuremberg accepted the Protestant Reformation, and in 1532, the Nuremberg Religious Peace was signed there, preventing war between Protestants and Catholics for 15 years. During the 1552 revolution against Charles V, Nuremberg tried to purchase its neutrality, but the city was attacked without a declaration of war and was forced into a disadvantageous peace. At the Peace of Augsburg, the possessions of the Protestants were confirmed by the Emperor, their religious privileges extended and their independence from the Bishop of Bamberg affirmed, while the 1520s' secularisation of the monasteries was also approved. Families like the Tucher, Imhoff or Haller run trading businesses across Europe, similar to the Fugger and Welser families from Augsburg, although on a slightly smaller scale. \n\nThe state of affairs in the early 16th century, increased trade routes elsewhere and the ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade. During the Thirty Years' War, frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and League soldiers, the financial costs of the war and the cessation of trade caused irreparable damage to the city and a near-halving of the population. In 1632, the city, occupied by the forces of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, was besieged by the army of Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein. The city declined after the war and recovered its importance only in the 19th century, when it grew as an industrial centre. Even after the Thirty Years' War, however, there was a late flowering of architecture and culture \u2013 secular Baroque architecture is exemplified in the layout of the civic gardens built outside the city walls, and in the Protestant city's rebuilding of St. Egidien church, destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century, considered a significant contribution to the baroque church architecture of Middle Franconia.After the Thirty Years' War, Nuremberg attempted to remain detached from external affairs, but contributions were demanded for the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War and restrictions of imports and exports deprived the city of many markets for its manufactures. The Bavarian elector, Charles Theodore, appropriated part of the land obtained by the city during the Landshut War of Succession, to which Bavaria had maintained its claim; Prussia also claimed part of the territory. Realising its weakness, the city asked to be incorporated into Prussia but Frederick William II refused, fearing to offend Austria, Russia and France. At the Imperial diet in 1803, the independence of Nuremberg was affirmed, but on the signing of the Confederation of the Rhine on 12 July 1806, it was agreed to hand the city over to Bavaria from 8 September, with Bavaria guaranteeing the amortisation of the city's 12.5 million guilder public debt.\n\n\n=== After the Napoleonic Wars ===\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the city's trade and commerce revived; the skill of its inhabitants together with its favourable situation soon made the city prosperous, particularly after its public debt had been acknowledged as a part of the Bavarian national debt. Having been incorporated into a Catholic country, the city was compelled to refrain from further discrimination against Catholics, who had been excluded from the rights of citizenship. Catholic services had been celebrated in the city by the priests of the Teutonic Order, often under great difficulties. After their possessions had been confiscated by the Bavarian government in 1806, they were given the Frauenkirche on the Market in 1809; in 1810 the first Catholic parish was established, which in 1818 numbered 1,010 souls.In 1817, the city was incorporated into the district of Rezatkreis (named for the river Franconian Rezat), which was renamed to Middle Franconia (German: Mittelfranken) on 1 January 1838. The first German railway, the Bavarian Ludwigsbahn, from Nuremberg to nearby F\u00fcrth, was opened in 1835. The establishment of railways and the incorporation of Bavaria into Zollverein (the 19th-century German Customs Union), commerce and industry opened the way to greater prosperity. In 1852, there were 53,638 inhabitants: 46,441 Protestants and 6,616 Catholics. It subsequently grew to become the more important industrial city of Southern Germany, one of the most prosperous towns of southern Germany, but after the Austro-Prussian War it was given to the Prussia as part of their telegraph stations they had to give up. In 1905, its population, including several incorporated suburbs, was 291,351: 86,943 Catholics, 196,913 Protestants, 3,738 Jews and 3,766 members of other creeds.\n\n\n=== Nazi era ===\n\nNuremberg held great significance during the Nazi Germany era. Because of the city's relevance to the Holy Roman Empire and its position in the centre of Germany, the Nazi Party chose the city to be the site of huge Nazi Party conventions \u2014 the Nuremberg rallies. The rallies were held in 1927, 1929 and annually from  1933 through 1938. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 the Nuremberg rallies became huge Nazi propaganda events, a centre of Nazi ideals. The 1934 rally was filmed by Leni Riefenstahl, and made into a propaganda film called Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will).\nAt the 1935 rally, Hitler specifically ordered the Reichstag to convene at Nuremberg to pass the Nuremberg Laws which revoked German citizenship for all Jews and other non-Aryans. A number of premises were constructed solely for these assemblies, some of which were not finished. Today many examples of Nazi architecture can still be seen in the city. The city was also the home of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher, the publisher of Der St\u00fcrmer.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Nuremberg was the headquarters of Wehrkreis (military district) XIII, and an important site for military production, including aircraft, submarines and tank engines. A subcamp of Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp was located here, and extensively used slave labour. The city was severely damaged in Allied strategic bombing from 1943 to 1945. On 29 March 1944, the RAF endured its heaviest losses in the bombing campaign of Germany. Out of more than 700 planes participating, 106 were shot down or crash-landed on the way home to their bases, and more than 700 men were missing, as many as 545 of them dead. More than 160 became prisoners of war.On 2 January 1945, the medieval city centre was systematically bombed by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Army Air Forces and about ninety percent of it was destroyed in only one hour, with 1,800 residents killed and roughly 100,000 displaced. In February 1945, additional attacks followed. In total, about 6,000 Nuremberg residents are estimated to have been killed in air raids.\nNuremberg was a heavily fortified city that was captured in a fierce battle lasting from 17 to 21 April 1945 by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, 42nd Infantry Division and 45th Infantry Division, which fought house-to-house and street-by-street against determined German resistance, causing further urban devastation to the already bombed and shelled buildings. Despite this intense degree of destruction, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent restored to its pre-war appearance, including the reconstruction of some of its medieval buildings. Much of this reconstructive work and conservation was done by the organisation 'Old Town Friends Nuremberg'. However, over half of the historic look of the center, and especially the northeastern half of the old Imperial Free City was not restored.\n\n\n=== Nuremberg trials ===\n\nBetween 1945 and 1946, German officials involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity were brought before an international tribunal in the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union had wanted these trials to take place in Berlin. However, Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trials for specific reasons:\n\nThe city had been the location of the Nazi Party's Nuremberg rallies and the laws stripping Jews of their citizenship were passed there. There was symbolic value in making it the place of Nazi demise.\nThe Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few that had remained largely intact despite extensive Allied bombing of Germany). The already large courtroom was reasonably easily expanded by the removal of the wall at the end opposite the bench, thereby incorporating the adjoining room. A large prison was also part of the complex.\nAs a compromise, it was agreed that Berlin would become the permanent seat of the International Military Tribunal and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg. Due to the Cold War, subsequent trials never took place.Following the trials, in October 1946, several prominent German Nazi politicians and military leaders were executed in Nuremberg.\nThe same courtroom in Nuremberg was the venue of the Nuremberg Military Tribunals, organized by the United States as occupying power in the area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSeveral old villages now belong to the city, for example Grossgr\u00fcndlach, Kraftshof, Thon, and Neunhof in the north-west; Ziegelstein in the northeast, Altenfurt and Fischbach in the south-east; and Katzwang, Kornburg in the south. Langwasser is a modern suburb.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNuremberg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) with a certain humid continental influence (Dfb), categorized in the latter by the 0 \u00b0C isotherm. The city's climate is influenced by its inland position and higher altitude. Winters are changeable, with either mild or cold weather: the average temperature is around \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) to 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F), while summers are generally warm, mostly around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the afternoon. Precipitation is evenly spread throughout the year, although February and April tend to be a bit drier whereas July tends to have more rainfall.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNuremberg has been a destination for immigrants. 39.5% of the residents had an immigrant background in 2010 (counted with MigraPro).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nNuremberg for many people is still associated with its traditional gingerbread (Lebkuchen) products, sausages, and handmade toys. Pocket watches \u2014 Nuremberg eggs \u2014 were made here in the 16th century by Peter Henlein. Only one of the districts in the 1797-1801 sample was early industrial; the economic structure of the region around Nuremberg was dominated by metal and glass manufacturing, reflected by a share of nearly 50% handicrafts and workers. In the 19th century Nuremberg became the \"industrial heart\" of Bavaria with companies such as Siemens and MAN establishing a strong base in the city.  Nuremberg is still an important industrial centre with a strong standing in the markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Items manufactured in the area include electrical equipment, mechanical and optical products, motor vehicles, writing and drawing paraphernalia, stationery products and printed materials.\nThe city is also strong in the fields of automation, energy and medical technology. Siemens is still the largest industrial employer in the Nuremberg region but a good third of German market research agencies are also located in the city. The Nuremberg International Toy Fair is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nNuremberg is Bavaria\u2019s second largest city after Munich, and a popular tourist destination for foreigners and Germans alike. It was a leading city 500 years ago, but 90% of the town was destroyed in 1945 during the war. After World War II, many medieval-style areas of the town were rebuilt.\n\n\n===== Attractions =====\nBeyond its main attractions of the Imperial Castle, St. Lorenz Church, and Nazi Trial grounds, there are 54 different museums for arts and culture, history, science and technology, family and children, and more niche categories, where visitors can see the world's oldest globe (built in 1492), a 500-year-old Madonna, and Renaissance-era German art. There are several types of tours offered in the city, including historic tours, those that are Nazi-focused, underground and night tours, walking tours, sightseeing buses, self guided tours, and an old town tour on a mini train. Nuremberg also offers several parks and green areas, as well as indoor activities such as bowling, rock wall climbing, escape rooms, cart racing, and mini golf, theaters and cinemas, pools and thermal spas. There are also six nearby amusement parks. The city's tourism board sells the Nurnberg Card which allows for free use of public transportation and free entry to all museums and attractions in Nuremberg for a two-day period.\n\n\n===== Culinary Tourism =====\nNuremberg is also a destination for food lovers. Culinary tourists can taste the city's famous lebkuchen, gingerbread, local beer, and N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrstchen, or Nuremberg sausages. There are hundreds of restaurants for all tastes, including traditional franconian restaurants and beer gardens. Also offers 17 vegan and vegetarian restaurants, seven fully organic restaurants. Nuremberg also boasts a two Michelin Star rated restaurant, Essigbr\u00e4tlein.\n\n\n===== Pedestrian zones =====\nLike many European cities, Nuremberg offers a pedestrian-only zone covering a large portion of the old town, which is a main destination for shopping and specialty retail, including year-round Christmas stores where tourists and locals alike can purchase Christmas ornaments, gifts, decorations, and additions to their toy Christmas villages. The Craftsmen's Courtyard, or Handwerkerhof, is another tourist shopping destination in the style of a medieval village. It houses several local family-run businesses which sell handcrafted items from glass, wood, leather, pottery, and precious metals. The Handwerkerhof is also home to traditional German restaurants and beer gardens.The Pedestrian zones of Nuremberg host festivals and markets throughout the year, most well known being Christkindlesmarkt, Germany's largest Christmas market and the gingerbread capital of the world. Visitors to the Christmas market can peruse the hundreds of stalls and purchase local wood crafts, nutcrackers, smokers, and prune people, while sampling Christmas sweets and traditional gluhwein.\n\n\n===== Hospitality =====\nIn 2017, Nuremberg saw a total of 3.3 million overnight stays, a record for the town, and is expected to have surpassed that in 2018, with more growth in tourism anticipated in the coming years. There are over 175 registered places of accommodation in Nuremberg, ranging from hostels to luxury hotels, bed and breakfasts, to multi-hundred room properties. As of 19 April 2019, Nuremberg had 306 AirBnB listings.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nNuremberg was an early centre of humanism, science, printing, and mechanical invention. The city contributed much to the science of astronomy. In 1471 Johannes Mueller of K\u00f6nigsberg (Bavaria), later called Regiomontanus, built an astronomical observatory in Nuremberg and published many important astronomical charts.\nIn 1515, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, a native of Nuremberg, created woodcuts of the first maps of the stars of the northern and southern hemispheres, producing the first printed star charts, which had been ordered by Johannes Stabius. Around 1515 D\u00fcrer also published the \"Stabiussche Weltkarte\", the first perspective drawing of the terrestrial globe.Printers and publishers have a long history in Nuremberg. Many of these publishers worked with well-known artists of the day to produce books that could also be considered works of art. In 1470 Anton Koberger opened Europe's first print shop in Nuremberg. In 1493, he published the Nuremberg Chronicles, also known as the World Chronicles (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated history of the world from the creation to the present day. It was written in the local Franconian dialect by Hartmann Schedel and had illustrations by Michael Wohlgemuth, Wilhelm Pleydenwurff, and Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Others furthered geographical knowledge and travel by map making. Notable among these was navigator and geographer Martin Behaim, who made the first world globe.\nSculptors such as Veit Stoss, Adam Kraft and Peter Vischer are also associated with Nuremberg.\nComposed of prosperous artisans, the guilds of the Meistersingers flourished here. Richard Wagner made their most famous member, Hans Sachs, the hero of his opera Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel was born here and was organist of St. Sebaldus Church.\nThe academy of fine arts situated in Nuremberg is the oldest art academy in central Europe and looks back to a tradition of 350 years of artistic education.\nNuremberg is also famous for its Christkindlesmarkt (Christmas market), which draws well over a million shoppers each year.  The market is famous for its handmade ornaments and delicacies.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n \nGermanisches Nationalmuseum\nHouse of Albrecht D\u00fcrer\nKunsthalle N\u00fcrnberg\nKunstverein N\u00fcrnberg\nNeues Museum N\u00fcrnberg (Modern Art Museum)\nNuremberg Toy Museum\nNuremberg Transport Museum\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nThe Nuremberg State Theatre, founded in 1906, is dedicated to all types of opera, ballet and stage theatre. During the season 2009/2010, the theatre presented 651 performances for an audience of 240,000 persons. The State Philharmonic Nuremberg (Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg) is the orchestra of the State Theatre. Its name was changed in 2011 from its previous name: The Nuremberg Philharmonic (N\u00fcrnberger Philharmoniker). It is the second-largest opera orchestra in Bavaria. Besides opera performances, it also presents its own subscription concert series in the Meistersingerhalle. Christof Perick was the principal conductor of the orchestra between 2006\u20132011. Marcus Bosch heads the orchestra since September 2011  .\nThe Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra (N\u00fcrnberger Symphoniker) performs around 100 concerts a year to a combined annual audience of more than 180,000. The regular subscription concert series are mostly performed in the Meistersingerhalle but other venues are used as well, including the new concert hall of the Kongresshalle and the Serenadenhof. Alexander Shelley has been the principal conductor of the orchestra since 2009.\nThe Nuremberg International Chamber Music Festival (Internationales Kammermusikfestival N\u00fcrnberg) takes place in early September each year, and in 2011 celebrated its tenth anniversary. Concerts take place around the city; opening and closing events are held in the medieval Burg. The Bardentreffen, an annual folk festival in Nuremberg, has been deemed the largest world music festival in Germany and takes place since 1976. 2014 the Bardentreffen starred 368 artists from 31 nations.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nNuremberg is known for N\u00fcrnberger Bratwurst, which is shorter and thinner than other bratwurst sausages.\nAnother Nuremberg speciality is N\u00fcrnberger Lebkuchen, a kind of gingerbread eaten mainly around Christmas time.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nNuremberg offers 51 public and 6 private elementary schools in nearly all of its districts. Secondary education is offered at 23 Mittelschulen, 12 Realschulen, and 17 Gymnasien (state, city, church, and privately owned). There are also several other providers of secondary education such as Berufsschule, Berufsfachschule, Wirtschaftsschule etc.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\nNuremberg hosts the joint university Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, two Fachhochschulen (Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg and Evangelische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg), an art school (Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste N\u00fcrnberg), and a music conservatoire (Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg). There are also private schools such as the Akademie Deutsche POP N\u00fcrnberg offering higher education.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nNuremberg Castle: the three castles that tower over the city including central burgraves' castle, with Free Reich's buildings to the east, the Imperial castle to the west.\nHeilig-Geist-Spital. In the centre of the city, on the bank of the river Pegnitz, stands the Hospital of the Holy Spirit. Founded in 1332, this is one of the largest hospitals of the Middle Ages. Lepers were kept here at some distance from the other patients. It now houses elderly persons and a restaurant.\nThe Hauptmarkt, dominated by the front of the unique Gothic Frauenkirche (Our Lady's Church), provides a picturesque setting for the famous Christmas market. A main attraction on the square is the Gothic Sch\u00f6ner Brunnen (Beautiful Fountain) which was erected around 1385 but subsequently replaced with a replica (the original fountain is kept in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum). The unchanged Renaissance bridge Fleischbr\u00fccke crosses the Pegnitz nearby.\nThe Gothic Lorenzkirche (St. Laurence church) dominates the southern part of the walled city and is one of the most important buildings in Nuremberg. The main body was built around 1270\u20131350.\nThe even earlier and equally impressive Sebalduskirche is St. Lorenz's counterpart in the northern part of the old city.\nThe church of the former Katharinenkloster is preserved as a ruin, the charterhouse (Kartause) is integrated into the building of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum and the choir of the former Franziskanerkirche is part of a modern building.\nOther churches located inside the city walls are: St. Laurence's, Saint Clare's, Saint Martha's, Saint James the Greater's, Saint Giles's, and Saint Elisabeth's.\nThe Germanisches Nationalmuseum is Germany's largest museum of cultural history, among its exhibits are works of famous painters such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Rembrandt, and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner.\nThe Neues Museum N\u00fcrnberg is a museum for modern and contemporary art.\nThe Walburga Chapel and the Romanesque Doppelkapelle (Chapel with two floors) are part of Nuremberg Castle.\nThe Johannisfriedhof is a medieval cemetery, containing many old graves (Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Willibald Pirckheimer, and others). The Rochusfriedhof or the W\u00f6hrder Kirchhof are near the Old Town.\nThe Chain Bridge (Kettensteg), the first chain bridge on the European continent.\nThe Tiergarten N\u00fcrnberg is a zoo stretching over more than 60 hectares (148 acres) in the N\u00fcrnberger Reichswald forest.\nThere is also a medieval market just inside the city walls, selling handcrafted goods.\nThe German National Railways Museum (in German) (an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage) is located in Nuremberg.\nThe Nuremberg Ring (now welded within an iron fence of Sch\u00f6ner Brunnen) is said to bring good luck to those that spin it.\nThe Nazi party rally grounds with the documentation-center.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe city's location next to numerous highways, railways, and a waterway has contributed to its rising importance for trade with Eastern Europe.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nN\u00fcrnberg Hauptbahnhof is a stop for IC and ICE trains on the German long-distance railway network. The Nuremberg\u2013Ingolstadt\u2013Munich high-speed line with 300 km/h (186 mph) operation opened 28 May 2006, and was fully integrated into the rail schedule on 10 December 2006. Travel times to Munich have been reduced to as little as one hour. The Nuremberg\u2013Erfurt high-speed railway opened in December 2017.\n\n\n=== City and regional transport ===\n\nThe Nuremberg tramway network was opened in 1881.  As of 2008, it extended a total length of 36 km (22 mi), had six lines, and carried 39.152 million passengers annually.  The first segment of the Nuremberg U-Bahn metro system was opened in 1972. Nuremberg's trams, buses and metro system are operated by the VAG N\u00fcrnberg (Verkehrsaktiengesellschaft N\u00fcrnberg or Nuremberg Transport Corporation), itself a member of the VGN (Verkehrsverbund Grossraum N\u00fcrnberg or Greater Nuremberg Transport Network).\nThere is also a Nuremberg S-Bahn suburban metro railway and a regional train network, both centred on N\u00fcrnberg Hauptbahnhof.\nSince 2008, Nuremberg has had the first U-Bahn in Germany (U2/U21 and U3) that works without a driver. It also was the first subway system worldwide in which both driver-operated trains and computer-controlled trains shared tracks.\n\n\n=== Motorways ===\nNuremberg is located at the junction of several important Autobahn routes. The A3 (Netherlands\u2013Frankfurt\u2013W\u00fcrzburg\u2013Vienna) passes in a south-easterly direction along the north-east of the city. The A9 (Berlin\u2013Munich) passes in a north\u2013south direction on the east of the city. The A6 (France\u2013Saarbr\u00fccken\u2013Prague) passes in an east\u2013west direction to the south of the city. Finally, the A73 begins in the south-east of Nuremberg and travels north-west through the city before continuing towards F\u00fcrth and Bamberg.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nNuremberg Airport has flights to major German cities and many European destinations. The largest operators are currently Eurowings and TUI fly Deutschland, while the low-cost Ryanair and Wizz Air companies connect the city to various European centres. A significant amount of the airport's traffic flies to and from mainly touristic destinations during the peak winter season. The airport (Flughafen) is the terminus of subway line 2; it is the only airport in Germany served by a subway.\n\n\n=== Canals ===\nNuremberg is an important port on the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n1. FC N\u00fcrnberg, known locally as Der Club (English: \"The Club\"), was founded in 1900 and currently plays in the Bundesliga. The official colours of the association are red and white, but the traditional colours are red and black. They won their first regional title in the Southern German championship in 1916 closely followed by their first national title in 1920. Besides the eleven regional championships they won they were the German championship for a total of seven times. With this they held the record for the most German championship titles until 1986 when the current record holder FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen surpassed them.  The current chairmen are Nils Rossow and Robert Palikuca. They play in Max-Morlock-Stadion which was refurbished for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and accommodates 50,000 spectators. \n\nGerman Champion: 1920, 1921, 1924, 1925, 1927, 1936, 1948, 1961, 1968\nGerman Cup: 1935, 1939, 1962, 2007TuS Bar Kochba is a league that was founded in 1913 as a social-sport club for the Jewish community in N\u00fcrnberg. Established as the \"Jewish Gymnastics and Sports Club Nuremberg\", the league was dissolved by the Nazi party in 1939. It was reformed in 1966. The club plays in the senior A-league of the Bavarian Football Association.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nThe SELLBYTEL Baskets N\u00fcrnberg played in the Basketball Bundesliga from 2005 to 2007. Since then, teams from Nuremberg have attempted to return to Germany's elite league. The recently founded N\u00fcrnberg Falcons BC have already established themselves as one of the main teams in Germany's second division ProA and aim to take on the heritage of the SELLBYTEL Baskets N\u00fcrnberg. The Falcons play their home games at the Halle im Berufsbildungszentrum (BBZ).\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nNuremberg is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Associated cities ===\nApart from the official twin towns (sister cities), there are a number with which Nuremberg maintains \"cordial relations\":\n\n\n=== Cooperation ===\nNuremberg also engages in cooperation with various other cities internationally:\n Bologna, Italy 2006\n Changping, China 2006\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nThe ArtsMichael Wolgemut (1434\u20131519) a German painter and printmaker \nHans Folz (ca.1437\u20131513) a German author and poet\nVeit Stoss (ca.1450\u20131533) a Renaissance German sculptor, mostly in wood \nPeter Vischer the Elder  (ca.1455\u20131529) a German sculptor \nAdam Kraft (ca.1460\u20131509) a German stone sculptor, master builder and architect \nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer (1471\u20131528) a painter, engraver, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance \nHans Leonhard Sch\u00e4ufelein (ca.1480\u20131540) an artist, painter and designer of woodcuts \nAugustin Hirschvogel (1503\u20131553) an artist, mathematician and cartographer\nMichael Sigismund Frank (1770\u20131847) a Catholic artist, rediscovered glass-painting \nLorenz Ritter (1832\u20131921) a German painter and etcher \nPhilipp Rupprecht (1900\u20131975) a German cartoonist of anti-Semitic caricatures\nHermann Kesten (1900-1996) novelist and dramatist\nEliyahu Koren (1907\u20142001) a master typographer, graphic artist and designer\nPeter Angermann (born 1945) a German painter \nChristoph Dreher (born 1952) a German filmmaker, musician and scriptwriter \nKaty Garretson (born 1963) an American TV director and producer \nMartina Schradi (born 1972) author, cartoonist and psychologistMusicConrad Paumann (ca.1410\u20131473) a German organist, lutenist and composer\nHans Sachs (1494\u20131576) a German Meistersinger, poet, playwright, and shoemaker \nSebald Heyden (1499\u20131561) a musicologist, cantor, theologian and hymn-writer\nJohann Pachelbel (1653\u20131706) a composer, organist, and teacher \nHugo Distler (1908\u20131942) a German organist, choral conductor, teacher and composer\nMartha M\u00f6dl (1912\u20132001) a German Wagner soprano/mezzo-soprano\nChaya Arbel (1921\u20132007) an Israeli female classical composer \nSiegfried Jerusalem (born 1940) a German operatic tenor\nKevin Coyne (1944\u20132004) an English musician, singer, composer, film-maker, and writer \nRudi Mahall (born 1966) a contemporary jazz bass clarinet playerActingMargarete Haagen (1889\u20131966) a German stage and film actress \nWolfgang Preiss (1910\u20132002) a German theatre, film and TV actor \nHeinz Bernard (1923\u20131994) a British actor and director and theatre manager \nAnnette Carell (1926\u20131967) an American actress of stage, screen, and television \nGeorge Clooney (born 1961) an American actor, director, producer and filmmaker \nSandra Bullock (born 1964) an American actress, producer, and philanthropist \nTom Beck (born 1978) a German actor, singer, and entrepreneur Science & BusinessAnton Koberger (ca.1440/1445\u20131513) a goldsmith, printer and publisher \nKaterina Lemmel (1466-1533) a patrician businesswoman and Birgittine nun\nPeter Henlein (1485-1542) locksmith and clockmaker, invented the world's first watch\nKunz Lochner (1510-1567), plate armourer, blacksmith and silversmith\nJoachim Camerarius the Younger (1534\u20131598) a physician, botanist and zoologist \nJohann Christoph Volkamer (1644\u20131720) a German merchant, manufacturer and botanist\nMaria Sybilla Merian (1647\u20131717) a naturalist and scientific illustrator\nJohann Philipp von Wurzelbauer (1651-1725), astronomer\nJohn Miller (1715\u2013ca.1792) a German engraver and botanist active in London \nJohann Kaspar Hechtel (1771\u20131799) a brass factory owner, non-fiction writer and designer of parlour games\nErnst von Bibra (1806\u20131878) a German scientist, naturalist and author\nFriedrich Sigmund Merkel (1845-1919) anatomist and histopathologist\nSiegfried Bettmann (1868-1951) bicycle, motorcycle and car manufacturer\nErnst Freiherr Stromer von Reichenbach (1871\u20131952) a paleontologist\nUlrich R\u00fcck (1882\u20131962 collector of musical instruments, chemist and dealer in pianos\nKarl Bechert (1901\u20131981) a theoretical physicist in atomic physics and politician\nPeter Owen (1927\u20132016) a British publisher, founded Peter Owen Publishers \nManfred M.

          "Beautiful fortress, with stone walls. The views over the city are really nice.",
          "It was quite an enjoyable experience walking through Nuremberg just to get to the castle. The walk through the old town was quite enjoyable with unique sculptures and interesting buildings. Although there is an incline to get to the castle, \u2026",
          "Rewarded with a beautiful view after a steep trek up the hill.   Unfortunately under construction so many view points were closed.",
          "Beautiful city sight ... and the garden around are decorated with colourful flowers",
          "Loved Nuremberg in general. It's awesome to walk through the city and the castle was amazing.",
          "Very impressive facade. There was extensive construction work inside and out so we were not able to enjoy the full glory of the site. Maybe next year we will have a chance to return.",
          "Very historical building, interesting exhibition. Well worth a visit.",
          "Very historic castle that was spared from the bombing of WWII so it\u2019s very well preserved. Make sure you have comfortable walking shoes on as it will help get you up the steep hill and with your walk throughout the castle grounds. The tour \u2026",
          "Amazing view from up there. Not too crowded and easy to navigate with a baby stroller. There are no high fencing so keep your little ones close to you. \nImpressive castle and located a short stroll from the main square. \nDoesn\u2019t get 5 stars \u2026",
          "Wonderfully restored, the castle unravels its history through a unique combination of relics and pictures. It is worth having an audio guide. Give yourself half a day to visit the palace and you won't regret it.",
          "I was there during Weihnachten (Christmas) In Nuremberg when I had exchange study for 1 semester. Love the time and Christmas season so much!!! \nYou can enjoy drinking the gluhwein and strolling around the town at night to really feel the moment!",
          "Great place to visit. Be prepared to walk up the hill to get there. It\u2019s no joke!  The walk through the castle was cool. There is a great collection of old swords and spears as well as early guns and cross bows. The ticket includes a tour \u2026",
          "It is one of the best place to see beautiful N\u00fcrnberg city.",
          "Although the weather wasn't so much fun, I had a wonderful time in Nurnberg. The castle is in the city centre, and it worth the time to visit, besides its amazing structure you may have a great sight of the city from here. The Imperial Castle is a one of the nicest medieval fortified buildings in Bavaria.",
          "We didn't visit inside, but it is very beautiful! You can visit the castle itself, the castle museum and the castle well. We bought some interesting souvenirs at the information center. It is possible to walk all around the castle and enter into the main hall. The there are two or three points to see the beautiful landscape of Nuremberg.",
          "Small fortress with stone walls. For the moment there are some construction works, but you can visit it.",
          "Sadly, the weather was not good at all which is why we had to leave very quickly. The whole time while being in Nuremberg however, we felt like we were in the Medieval Age. Very old, interesting buildings. We were two couples and were fascinated by the medieval touch of the city.",
          "Really interesting museum dedicated to the Holy Roman Empire set in the mainly rebuilt Nuremberg Castle. Very good provision of information and the exhibits are very well laid out and maintained. \n\nOur visited listed about an hour and a \u2026",
          "Very pretty and amazing. One thing that will advise is that there was no disabled access. Everyone should have access to these sites so that they can also enjoy. Buggy rides should be available for people who cant walk to the castle courtyard",
          "Love going up to this castle! You can get a great view of Nuremberg from here. Went on the tour 3 years ago and I found it very interesting. This year a but of the castle looks to be under construction.",
          "Great views, castle was closed",
          "The best place in Nuremberg! I went there a lot of time to have the city look, but this time I did Downhill jam bicycling... No words",
          "Very interesting, it has a museum and a chapel inside. It is not a fine castle, it is a castle of boards and strategies of the former Holy Germanic Roman Empire. The views of the city are very beautiful from there, and it has a tower with a water well, also very interesting and a bit interactive.",
          "You get a beautiful view of the city and the castle itself is also great to look at. Even though there is still a lot of construction work going on. Definitely should be checked out!",
          "Definitely worth a visit! I highly recommend including deep well in your ticket as well. It is really deep. After you pour water, it takes 10 seconds to reach the water down there.\nUsed to British castles, Bavarian castles are totally different. You see flowers and bright colours everywhere! Warm and lively.",
          "Very beautiful location! Highest point in the city and great for looking out across the landscape.",
          "Unbelievable cool. You could spend an entire day here and maybe take it all in.   Make sure to see the well. I\u2019d say that was the neatest one thing but again so much to see on the tour.  The tour is self guided but the staff is willing to tell more.",
          "Beautiful place, beautiful people, beautiful city.",

          "If you could reach this castle after a hard climbing, you would get an amazing overlooking of the city....",
          "The castle itself is nice and from the hill you can enjoy a nice view of the city. However, the castle is almost entirely a post world war II reconstruction and the rooms inside are pretty much empty. The chapel, which is original, is really nice. \nA bit expensive for what it is, but very friendly personnel",
          "It was supposed to be a very old and beautiful castle but unfortunately thanks to the bombing most of it is completely new. Great views from the top floors of the museum, nice panorama from the side. The well can be visited only on tours every 30 min.",
          "Excellent for history lovers.\nBeautiful building and knight weapons",
          "Very nice, can always recommend the area. Good for walks be it long or short. Nice ambiente and lots of history. Make sure to take you time to enjoy the view. Highly recommend the place. I always enjoy myself and feel welcome here. Keep up the good work. A piece of history not to be missed",
          "Beautiful old castle with a lot of history. It's situated at the top of a hill so be prepared for a very steep climb. It's certainly worth the climb because the views of Nuremberg are spectacular!",

          "Great view! You can see the whole city. Definitely worth a visit and highly recommended.",
          "There is no audio guide for the Castle.. Tour for Well is a must, we have guide there. He has good sense of humour",
          "Super historical castle.  Really interesting.  One entry currently blocked due to construction. I can't fault them for maintaining the castle to preserve it. The tour is awesome!",
          "Little exhausting to walk up there but the view is worth it. Everyone who visits Nuremberg should go up the castle. Will not gonna be disappointed.",
          "History at its best. Layed out to see that the mind boggles at how things started out from huge to todays smallness. Capabilities shown from middle ages, Renaissance to guide our ways. Very interesting. A must see.",
          "Great architecture, interesting history. You can walk around the outside for free or pay a modest price to go inside, which has a great museum. Most displays are only in German, however, with a few also in English. The tour(s) are only in German. There were also audio tours available that I didn't see until I was halfway through.",

          "The castle was filled with history and shops everywhere! Locating a store with a map was not difficult and the lady we ran into luckily spoke English well enough to help us out. You can walk the entire perimeter of the castle and even look \u2026",
          "Amaizing castle with beautiful view to the city. When you are in N\u00fcrnberg you should visit it. A lot of authentic things in the museum what they have used many centuries and years ago. And please don't touch those things :). People who take \u2026",
          "Impressive. Makes you go back in time and realize how much went into protecting your turf, citizens and king, prince, etc",
          "Amazing.  This is a real castle, not a 'palace' or 1800's build, but an actual medieval  castle.   And admission is very affordable.  Museum kept my interest and the interest of my 12 year old.  Deep Well demo was interesting.  Walk to the \u2026",

          "Really nice visit of the museum. My advice : don't pay to see the deep well, it's not worth it (basically the guide shows how deep it is by throwing water, which takes 5 second to reach the bottom, and explain things mostly in German.\nThe \u2026",

          "Beautiful and clean city!  This is the southern view of the city from the castle tower.  Within the castle walls is the shopping and restaurant district.  The many historic churches and opera houses made for a wonderful experience.",

          "The castle is half the reason you'll go to Nurnberg NOT Nuremberg! Incredible insights into a stern & grizzly past. How these incredible structures were ever completed in such hostile whether & punitive social culture is a thought you can't help but walk away with. A must see!",
          "Very entertaining. Well worth walking around to soak up the local vibe",
          "Definitely pay a visit if you have the time. It is a very charming landmark with amazing view on the city. Plenty to see also without going in.",

          "Really enjoy looking around here.",
          "Nice view from the castle and nice garden. Free to wander around but we paid to go round the museum and see the well which was interesting. If you're in Nuremberg it's a must.",

          "We enjoyed the castle and the museum (weapons and armour). The deep well was not worth the extra fee.  We couldn\u2019t hear the guide over the visitors (the guide should have had a microphone). Also, being a short person, the other (tall) \u2026",

          "This place is really worth a visit for two main reasons: to climb the tower and get fantastic views over Nuremberg; to increase your knowledge of the Holy Roman Empire and Nuremberg's role within it. The museum is also good - especially the arms and militaria.",

          "Nice historical buildings in Nurnberg. Located in the center of Nurnberg, so it can be easily reached by walk. There were no entry fees, if you are not going directly inside the castle.",
          "We toured the site with our local guide who provided an excellent commentary. there is much history related to this site built in many stages and employing a lot of people. The walk down from the castle is most enjoyable (careful is the ground is wet as it was on the day we were",

          "We saw this as part of a guided tour, but only the exterior and the courtyard, not the interior. It\u2019s interesting and picturesque, certainly worth a look. There is some steep walking to get in and out, so not accessible for wheelchairs I think ( which is true of most ancient",
          "On a very warm afternoon, this was a bit of a hike, but worth the view of the city from the top. Not much else to see or do there.",

          "Lovely castle. Surrounds the town. Very well kept and looked after. Looks even better at night time.",
          "Learned more about the Holy Roman Empire than I ever thought I would. Fortification / castle fun to walk around and imagine, Museum particularly well done. My favorite part was the chapel. Take the time to walk up the tower (it's only 100 stairs or so) for the breathtaking",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to this castle and we did it on our own. The castle is very big so plan to spend some time there. Our admission ticket included an audio guide for a self walking tour. We also went to the water well demonstration held every thirty minutes. We went to",
          "On this visit to Nuremberg we decided to walk up a fairly steep incline to Nuremberg Castle (N\u00fcrnberger Burg), consisting of a group of medieval fortified buildings on a sandstone ridge overlooking the center of the city. We were told the castle, together with the city walls,",
          "Our tour of Nurnberg included a trip round the castle, and it was well worth it for the views alone. We only scooted through the gate/moat, up the fortifications and then took in the panorama of the city. You won't get a better view.",
          "Impressive historical monument with great views over the city of Nuremberg. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Visited and purchased the combined ticket for 7 euros; allows you to go in the museum, sinnel tower and the well building. You could just walk around the castle buildings and the gardens for free, however if you have made it up to the castle 7 euros is worth it. The museum is",
          "Walked by konnigstrasse and walked up the castle. Beautiful walk thru the allies and cafes.. you can see all the colourful cafes full of people having beer and wine.. as you reach the top, you get a panoramic view of the city. It is a tough walk uphill for people having health",
          "This castle is beautiful, be prepared for a steep walk and possibly a large quantity of steps. This area of Nuremberg is very picturesque. The museum is worth a look at but a lot of the signs are in Germany only, so unsure of what you are looking at.",
          "Really loved walking around here! DIdn't pay to go into the museum, but just strolling around it was a very pleasant and enjoyable experience. Great view and nice incline workout going up!",
          "A beautiful attraction place which is located just a few meters away from Hauptmarkt. If you are travelling family with kids, your kids may enjoy the surrounding area of Castle and the rocks for climbing",
          "Walked up and around the castle. We didn\u2019t pay to enter any of the rooms. The views were very good from up here. The best part were the gardens. Very peaceful, quiet and beautiful flower beds.",

          "Worth going up to the castle for the views over Nuremberg. We had our packed lunch on a bench looking over the city. Quite a special place to visit and a lovely old castle too",
          "This a must do if visiting Nuremberg. Whilst not huge there are several buildings to visit. The deep well sets the scene illustrating why the location was picked for a castle. The views from the tower and walls are extensive across the city and the exhibition in the main part of",

          "If you want to visit a castle in Germany this is one that should be on the top of your list. It's large and has a nice historical exhibition that you walk through as you view the castle. It has a tower you can climb up and a well you can look down what more can you ask?",
          "Literally the high point of the city, I recommend taking a guided walking tour of this castle to understand it's historic significance to the city as well as getting the details of each panoramic city view. The walk is moderate in that there are several ups and downs (but no",
          "This is a must in a visit to Nuremberg. It has a lot of historical value and you get ashtoning views of the city. Although it was largely destroyed by war it was reconstructed so perfectely that retains its medieval charming. Do not miss climbing the stairs to the top of the",
          "We did not pay to go inside to the exhibitions, but you can walk around most of the castle anyway. It is a lovely complex, well worth the walk up the hill. Lots of fantastic architecture to admire.",
          "It was snowing the day we came to the castle. The tour(6E) is in German only but there is an English audio guide available. The castle is at the highest point in the city and has an amazing view of the roof tops.",
          "For \u20ac6 per person and children under 16 are free the Castle is a place to visit. With its location being the highest point in Nuremberg the views are amazing. Lots of things to see and tells the history of the town. The tour will take you about 2 hours to complete.",
          "We liked this castle due to the views it gave over Nuremberg. The castle is free to enter and then we paid an additional 3.50 euro each to climb to the top of the viewing tower. A nice place to visit when in Nuremberg.",
          "My BF and I walked to the castle from the local train station and the walk was pretty easy, there is a steep hill to tackle, but not terrible. the castle itself was amazing! It is definitely a must see. for 2 people I think we paid around 14 euros. Make sure to see the well!",
          "Nice and well maintained, we only had the chance and time to enjoy night and daily view. We didn't visit the inside. The area around it is nice too.",
          "Visited the place just before our flight was about to leave just so we can have a quick look at the castle. It offers a nice museum, a tower to have a lookout and a deep well. The guy at the reception was really nice and helpful and really really funny. The museum was ok but a",
          "A fun place to visit with views of the old town. A definet must-see on any visit, especially for those who love history",
          "Admission using the nuremberg tourist card, includes the tower tickets. Nice collection of relics and superb view of the city from the hill top. Stairs and road leading to the castle is quite steep though, prepare for a good workout!",
          "This medieval castle overlooks the entire city. This is a must see. While much of Nuremberg was destroyed by the allied bombings, the castle did receive damage but now has been restored. It's an easy downhill walk from the castle into old town Nuremberg.",
          "We enjoyed our walk through the surroundings of the castle. The castle is more like a burgh, where people live, have their businesses, a great place to visit during each season.",
          "This castle from the outside is impressive and has lived from many periods of history. It is worth a visit but I found it hard to be really excitied by the displays - perhaps I should have paid extra for a handset tour? This place has a lot of stories to tell but I found it",
          "Consists of the well tour - don\u2019t miss, the views from the tower, interesting to compare with the photos next to each window of the post-war ruins,and two exhibitions. The Holy Roman Empire exhibition could do with more English translation so we didn\u2019t stay long there. The rest",
          "A large castle area with an excellent video in the foyer area explaining how the castle and its features have changed over the ages. Good display of armoury and many other artefacts on the two floors that can be visited. Excellent views of the city, especially if you have the",

          "Definitely worth a visit during your stay in Nuremberg. It is free to enter the grounds and the view over the town is wonderful once you get to the top.",
          "Walking around the Kaiserburg provides one with a glimpse of royalty life from the mid to latter part of the Middle Ages. Taking time to read some of the information about the castle and that time period allows for an appreciation of the Kaiserburg. This castle still stands",
          "Beautiful Castle. In the museum you can have an overview of the history of the castle and the city. Notice that the visit to the water well starts every half an hour so organize to avoid waiting too much outside. Beautiful view of all the city from above.",
          "We visited the, Kaiserburg Nurnberg, The Imperial Castle during our Christmas Market trip. We used our Nuremberg Pass as entry to the castle. The cost of the pass was 25\u20ac which included all forms of transport and entry to all museums & attractions for 2 days, within the entire",

          "I love castles and history , so places like this is a must visit for me . This is not as big or grand as other palace but it's still beautiful and very interesting place to visit . It was a freezing day but still worth a visit .",
          "Visited the whole place of this castle. Great and interesting . Nice for photography. Beautiful town view.",
          "This place is the best place for a view of the city. It is a pretty good walk up from the center of town but the views are amazing. Definitely worth the visit. You must climb the tower though to get the best views. There are great before and after pictures in the tower of",
          "With the friends from Iran I did a brief visit to the platform of the Kaiserburg. There was snow, a nice christmas tree and an incredible view over the snow capped city including Christkindlesmarkt. We all enjoyed it.",
          "The castle is a short uphill walk from the city centre. Tickets are available from the ticket office on the ground floor of the palace building. The staff speak English. It\u2019s not obvious where the tour starts but just follow other visitors across the court yard to a door into",
          "We visited as the snow was falling so made our visit even more picturesque, especially from the tower. The tower is worth a visit and whilst there were a lot of steps up it\u2019s a great view of the rest of the city.",
          "Its 1 of those got to see places. Lots of history and great view points over the town. It\u2019ll take 1 to 2 hours to see it all and would recommend the audio tour for the museum. You have to ask for that though as its not offered or included in the cost. Must see place",
          "As a break from the xmas markets we walked up the hill to the castle which has been extensively restored. Get the audio guide as it takes you through the history and give more information that that presented with each display. View from the top of the tower is exceptional.",
          "We learnt so much about the Holy Roman Empire and the way the emperors were elected and why as well as how they visited. You can't miss the deep well - that was amazing!",
          "Visited this first on my first day there, fantastic place and well worth a look round, Not at all expensive 7 euros to see the areas you can see. It is at the highest point in Nuremburg so you need to be fairly fit if you arrive there through the town.",
          "This small castle is located inside the old town on a small hill and is at walking distance from the church and Christmas market at the main centre of the town. The slope to get up the castle and a little climb inside is all worth it as it offers lovely views of Nuremberg. Best",
          "We loved coming to the castle, it was well displayed and very pleasant to walk around. We learned the history of the area and its\u2019 rulers with some fantastic displays. Would love to come again in the spring!",
          "We were in and out in a n hour. As historical buffs it left us disappointed as not an awful lot of narrative for the actual exhibits on display. Just one main part to be honest. The grounds too are poor",

          "Another example of the wonderful work and effort by forefathers building into the sandstone rock high up in the old town. Worth the walk. You can buy a ticket to explore inside, or admire from the outside. Goid view of the city from the castle.",
          "VERy steep climb, and as snowy it was a bit slippery. Glad we went, but no glitz and glamour here. Let\u2019s face it this Castle was an armoury and defence placement not a luxurious palace. But still a little disappointed. The guide in the well was fabulous - we don\u2019t speak a word",

          "I parked in the city at a meter and purchased 2 hours of time, then ran up to the castle and down to the river. The Castle was a little underwhelming, offering bits of great architecture, fantastic views and free wi-fi. It just wasn't what I was expecting from a \"Castle\" but",
          "Mainly rebuilt after Allied bombing the site has some interesting exhibits and designs but it was never occupied full time by the kings and has little useful history to boast. The castle sits on a high hill overlooking the city and for this alone then it is worth the climb",

          "We walked from the train station and explored the old town, ending up by the castle. It was reasonably priced (we bought the ticket that included the well and tower - 7 Euro) and personally I think the tower in particular is well worthwhile as you get great 360 views. It wasn't",
          "A bit of a climb to get to the entrance gates and better food wear than flip flops might be required....the Castle is impressive and offers great panoramic views over the rooftops of Nuremberg. It was pretty crowded but a wedding was taking place there during our visit, so maybe",
          "We walked around the caste and did not take the tour. We greatly enjoyed all of the castle grounds & got some good pictures.",
          "After living in Nuremberg for almost 10 years, in 2017 I finally went for it and visited the Kaiserburg. Well, I would have liked to say that it was worth the wait or just that it was worth it. But it wasn't really. Except for the history revolving around WW II, the German",
          "We wanted to walk along the route of the old city wall. We found the lovely gardens planted up to make a great display, a delightful place to sit and view the city. You can go down the steps and back into the city to make a circular walk. There are maps on notice boards to help",
          "Went there directly after arriving to Nuremberg, it's a must do if it's your 1st time in Nuremberg,nothing impressive in the inside there you will get your ticket from the ticket center then you will have access to the museum, the tower (not a good view of the city) and the deep",
          "It was very hard to imagine how it was Before 1945... everything is so \"modern\". No good for weelchair; Just one toilette (under the tower); No bar; Just deutch descriptions, take audioguide (included in the price). 7.50 euros palas + museum (nothing special). After that, go",
          "An imposing set of buildings, worth visiting for three principal reasons: firstly, it tells the story of the Holy Roman Empire very effectively; secondly, the views of Nuremberg and around are the best you'll get in the city, and thirdly, the gardens and grounds are a good spot",
          "God place to visit. The tower was well worth the climb. Yes lots of steps! The Well was very interesting. So deep and the tour guide made it fun!",
          "As other reviewers have noted, to enter the castle you must go up a very steep, cobblestone walkway, which in 80+ degree temps was a bit of a challenge! But once inside the castle the views were wonderful! We did not pay for a tour/museum, but just walked the grounds. That alone",
          "You have to go up a very steep hill to visit that castle. But it is worth it. It is said that it has never been conquered by hostile armies.",
          "Situated on top of the hill, it is a place you cannot miss. It offers a great view of the whole old town, especially if you go up on the tour. In the museum you can see, among others, some old times weapons - could be especially interesting for boys and men. You should also not",
          "Climb the hill from the market square and you reach the castle. It's got great views over the city once up there. It's well worth the walk and the castle although small is worth wandering round. A bonus being the free toilet, always a help in European cities.",
          "Very interesting but quite a hike up the hill to the castle on a 30C hot day ! On the way back dow we did spot an Italian style ice cream parlour though.",
          "Upon entering the office to buy entrance tickets we were unfortunate to come upon a surly woman who had no interest in explaining anything and never offered us an audio tour in English (although I believe it was included in our entrance fee, but we only learned about it after",
          "An interesting castle with a very old keep tower where you can see the original entry part way up where the nobles could retreat into and pull up the ladder.",
          "The views from the castle are worth the steep climb. It is especially a great vantage point to see Nuremberg from above to get one's bearings especially of the old city. The reconstruction of Nuremberg after the war is phenomenal.",
          "I really liked walking the grounds of Nuremberg Castle. It has amazing views over Nuremberg and the Sinwell Tower is fantastic. The information that is there was interesting, although I did feel it lacked depth about the castle and it's history. There was some armoury stuff",
          "Worth a walk up for great views of the city. The re-built castle after the war is impressive but not the largest I have seen. We didn't pay for entry so cannot comment on anything else.",
          "The castle is located at the end of town and requires a rather steep climb (not too difficult - but, you may get winded if you do not take it slowly). The view over the city from over the castle wall is quite nice! Apart from the view, not much to actually see. After all, it",
          "Although this castle visit is nothing as extensive as those at Edinburgh castle, any of the Loire Valley chateaux, Neuschwannstein or Heidelberg Castle, it is still worth a visit if you are in Nuremberg. It doesn't take long, and is not hard to get to on foot. The castle wall",
          "Accessible by walking, reachable easily, best view to watch sunset , such a beautiful architectural castle showing the bavarian influence. So calm to relax and enjoy your afternoons",
          "we visited the castle two weeks ago when it rained in Biblical proportions. It was a great indoor activity. The history of the castle is quite amazing and important. It hi-lights the Holy Roman Emperor and his influence on this area of Germany and Holy Roman Empire. The exhibits",
          "Very easy to find out and to visit. It's a very old castle in a very good state and very interesting visit. A must to do",
          "Although we happened to be here on a hot summer afternoon, it was totally worth the hike up to this castle.Entree fee was reasonable, We chose to do the tour on our own. surprisingly we found quite a lot of write up for every exhibit making it very easy for a self tour.we spent",
          "A little bit of a hill climb but well worth it with the views from the top over the city are great. The museum is very interesting and a tower climb is a must. The 'well' story is fascinating.",
          "If you don't speak German be sure to take the self guided audio tour. Extremely interesting and educational. Great exhibits and displays.",
          "The tour of the castle as such is not as interesting as the views of the castle walls. The entire historic center opens and offers an incredible view of the Nuremberg Roofs. A walk from the center to the castle and back is a pleasant diversion of visiting this city.",
          "The 'Kaiserburg' is one of the top tourist attraction while in Nuernberg. From up there you have a nice view over the entire city. If you have time, visit the interior of the castle. It's very worthwhile!",
          "For the places one could visit, there aren't a lot. Lots of construction at the time I visited and therefore lots of restrictions. Very pleasant gardens to spend time in. Good view of the city and nice history about the castle. Didn't enter the exhibition as I was melting.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the castle, we spent a morning here going round the outside and then touring the inside. The inside was really interesting, lots of information and history to take in. The outside walls gave you a view over Nuremberg and a great photo",
          "The castle itself isn't that great but the views from the top are worth taking all efforts to climb up. First, it is located beautifully where you walk across a very steep street and that street itself looks so beautiful when viewed from the castle. Once you've reached the",
          "This castle is well worth the visit for the views alone. The climb is steep, but you are rewarded in the end. Park in the Hauptmarket parking structure.",
          "The steep road led to the top where you could see out over the city. It is beautiful, but Nuremberg was not my favorite place to visit in Germany.",
          "The view at the top is beautiful and you definitely get a work out climbing up the hills and steps. Also, the gardens are beautiful. Fun place to go to sit and relax, read a book, and enjoy. Definitely go in the day and at night! You can bring wine up with you and look at the",
          "A steep walk up to this impressive castle provides a great view over Nuremberg. The gardens are lovely and the buildings within the walls are amazing. Dates back to early 11th Century. Well worth the effort to get there and you will not be disappointed.",
          "This visit has three separate parts to it and collectively is good value for money. The ticket allows you entrance to the museum which is of historical interest and allows you to walk through the various rooms of the castle and see the numerous displays. The tour takes you up",
          "It's a must in the city guide checklist, the history and conservation in the place is really awesome.",
          "Amazing inside and out. The gardens are very beautiful, the inside of the castle is amazing (especially the chapel). The tour includes the tower which is unique in itself. It is a step walk up the hill but we'll worth it!",
          "If you are looking for multicultural and also millennial buildings you will find it on Nuremberg.. the downtown \"Altstadt\" is perfect for many afternoons, walking, visiting museums, ice creams whatever.. at the same time you will see how the history still alive.",
          "Lovely castle, good for pics and nice scenery. Can't get in most of it though. It's mainly an outside walk. Has the museum which is interesting. Does not take long to see everything but worth a visit.",
          "I am a fan of medieval history so I loved everything about this castle. Anyway, the place is so nice that my wife enjoyed it just as much as I did. The gardens sorrounding the castle are very beautiful and calm, we enjoyed them so much we went twice (before and after visiting",
          "We visited the castle Museum it was very interesting lovely views from the top. Long walk up but worth it. Wear sensible shoes ladies! All those cobbles are a bit difficult in wedges lol but a great bar called wanderer at the bottom where you can enjoy a cold pint",
          "Loved this castel, especially the grounds around the caste and the views of the city below! We spent about 4 hours at the caste so that we could see all of the highlights, the tower, water well, museum, chapel, and grounds. The only negative thing I can say is it is a steep",
          "The tour is very much worth taking. It takes you back in to the history. The views of the entire city from the top of the dome is breathtaking.",
          "They have a place for you to put your luggage so you aren't traveling in the castle with it and can relax. People under 18 were free. The castle was a 12 minute walk from the station. Full of awesome artifacts and suits of armour, ancient weapons, horse armour-all sorts of",
          "The castle itself is in excellent condition inside and there's plenty to see. They have separate sections written in English but be aware that not everything has an English translation so you may have to guess a little on what it's talking about. I'd definitely recommend paying",
          "Visited the Nurnberg castle couple of hours, there was a holiday and unfortunately the castle was closed can't reach the interior, the views from the platform is really awesome, The exterior of the castle is beautiful, with the blinked bridge of the castle and the town",
          "The castle is up on a steep hill. It looks imposing and impressive. The viewing platform gives you some impressive views of Nuremberg. Walking around the grounds and Courtyard was great. I didn't do the guided tour of the inside. I'm sure it too is impressive. Nice place",
          "I really enjoyed a visit to Nuremberg Castle. The tour is really interesting and you get a very good audio guide with your ticket. The Castle was badly damaged in the war butt hey have done a great job in restoring it to its former glory. Their attention to detail is meticulous",
          "The castle has a wonderful view of the city. From the tower one can see the entire city. There is a fee for entrance that allow you to visit the tower, the exhibition about the castle and a guided visit. I think that if you have few time, you should not pay for the visit. We",
          "Was an incredible place to visit. Did a walking tour of the city which helped explain and bring it all together which was great. The fortress gives a great view over the city.",
          "Super magical and nostalgic place with an amazing view over the city of nurnberg. The kids enjoyed it as well.",
          "The castle was severely damaged during WWII, but it has been meticulously reconstructed and restored. The combination ticket is a good price for everything that you get to see, and includes an audio tour in the palace and museum. You also get to climb to the top of Sinwell Tower",
          "I had been here twice previously and on both occasions the local guides were excellent. This time in a group of about 25 we had a woman who explained very little and just seemed to be in a hurry to get down to the town square and leave us. This was unfortunate because this",
          "The staff were not friendly which left bad memory from my Germany vacation When we went to see the only narrated part of the tour, the guide asked if anyone needed description in English, and we raised our hands From that point on, he never spoke English, and kept making jokes",
          "Nice castle on the top of the hill. Much of it can be seen free of charge and is very good. It has been restored after war damage but most castles have had their scrapes at some point in time.",
          "I would definitely recommend going up Nuremberg Castle during your stay in Nuremberg. The views are really good especially on a clear day you can see well into the distance. You can make out the rough outline of the old city walls, really impressive architecture in the castle",
          "Really a little gem. Great audio tour worth getting to give background. Lots of written stuff is not in English. Thoroughly enjoyed this as did my husband. Also climbed the tower for fantastic views. I wouldn't miss it. It has been well reconstructed after damage from WWII and",
          "Very Beuty full place to visit , amazing view over the city in day and night , a must see for all tourist",
          "The residence of the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire of German Origin. The German emperors were elected by the electors, that is to say, by the leaders of the German L\u00e4nder. The complex consists of three separate groups. It is worth visiting the fountain and tower that are",
          "Not as impressive as some of the places I have seen however it was interesting. The gardens were quite nice and there are some nice vantage points to the city, but overall, not really as good as what I had read from previous reviews. Maybe spoilt from the many wonderful things",
          "The highest point in town is a nice place to walk about. It's also the place to view the red rooftops of the city.",
          "Elaborate hilltop fortified palace with extensive walls, a moat (never filled with water but was used to hold game which was used for hunting), archery slots (high & low), & guard towers around the zig zag walls (this shape provided excellent monitoring of walls). The palace was",
          "The Castle is an interesting and creative structure in many ways. The approach from the rear hides the steep hillside which is the basis of the structure. Displays in the rooms are interesting and well labeled / described. Great views of the city from some rooms and the entry",
          "A \"working castle\" in that you realize how a medieval castle was built and its function. Almost a relatively small,fortified village with living quarters for the court,the soldiers and their horses and all the necessary artisans to keep them fed and dressed and shod.",
          "This castle towers over the older part of the city and requires a steepish climb to access it, but is well worth the effort if you can do it. The history of the city and the position of the castle in the making of that history are well told in a series of displays over a number",
          "Good history and interesting that this dates back so far in time. The culture and mix of the town between new and old is good",
          "The whole city is really terrific, one of the last great walled cities in Europe. The castle is impressive, although it is not furnished so not much to see inside. Still Nuremberg is well worth a stay on your itinerary",
          "If you are in or near Nurnberg you should spend some time at the Burg (Castle). Of extraordinary proportions, it is one of the most prominent of Germany's huge inventory of estates that were built over several centuries. Not quite as sophisticated as some of the castles you",
          "Combination ticket of 6 Euros gave access to a very comprehensive display in the museum.the tower and the Deep well.Really good value and very interesting.",
          "Great views of the city and cool museum inside! Defenitly worth a visit. And just down the hill you will find the Rathaus where the Nuernberg trials where held!",
          "We loved walking around the castle. Most of the signs are in English but not all. It is just he right length so you don't end up too bored nor overwhelmed. The tower is really fun with great views and the stairwell is really cool. A must do if you are in the city.",
          "The Nuremberg Castle is a group of medieval fortified buildings on a ridge dominating the center of the city. The imposing 11th century castle has beautiful Royal Palace, Gardens, fortified walls and courtyards which once represented the power and importance of the Holy Roman",
          "The highest part of Nuremberg so great for photos and you don't have to pay anything. We did the castle tour and it was not worth the money especially if not with audio guide as all labels are written in German. Going up the tower was great. Well tour was an anti climax !",
          "View at the top is amazing - and that's before you even go up the huge tower. Worth it for that alone. Inside the castle itself is OK, but it lost some of itself when it was rebuilt after WWII.",
          "Castle is very impressive and interesting to see where Nuremburg trials were held. Like the trams in the city. Nice and clean city, well maintained.",
          "A beautiful Renovated castle where it combines history with newly established shops and coffe shops within the surroudings of gates. The castle tower is the entrance for the beautiful old town where you can see the beautiful church and visit a variety of shops and resturants",
          "Visited the castle on a cold, rainy April day. There is a bit of information about the history of the castle, the usual medieval weapons and books/papers and a big tower outside (which we couldn't visit that day). Given the whole old fortress-city is quite nice in and of itself,",
          "Unique walk though the grounds, a guide helps as the buildings were built in many different years. Also free restrooms at the top",

          "Nurnberg Castle is one of the few locations where the roman imperor would leave room for. Its old, not as big as newer castles, but the history the surrounding and the feelings are just remarkable. The tower provides a high point to have a complete veiw of the town and the",

          "The castle is a worthwhile visit on a trip to Nuremberg. there is a lot of information about the History of the Holy Roman Empire and Nuremberg's strategic importance for trade. The tower is the highlight of the castle. it offers 360 degree views of the city and also provides",
          "We've reached this location after a walk in the town centre and as a recommendation of our friends. It was dark when we got up, and the view over the town was really beautiful. We haven't visited the inside, as it was already late.",

          "I love this castle so much...one of my favourite castles I have ever been to anywhere in Europe. It is such an important castle and the tour and museum inside is very well done and very informative and you are just left to wander around as you please, which I like. Most of it",
          "It was really nice to walk around outside. The views of Nuremberg were spectacular. The grumpy old men at the ticket office were off putting but the real disappointment was that almost nothing on display was more than a copy. ( the exception might be the armour and weapons). My",

          "Worth a visit as it's history goes back many many years ago. We went with Dorian who organises the Free Walking Tour around Nuremberg and his explanation about the story of this castle was great",

          "It's a beautiful place to visit if you enjoy history and castles. Nuremberg had a lot of hitlers history and lot of sight seeing",
          "The place itself is steeped in history. Great for us history buffs. It would have been lovely to have been offered the english audio guide, instead the quite rude counter staff took umbridge at our attempts to converse in (our not that bad) german. Disappointing service and a",
          "I drove all the way and parked in front of The Imperial Castle which was built on and of sandstone. The rock-cut cellars in the castle hill below have been used for centuries to brew and store beer. The view from the walls to me is more impressive than the castle it self There",
          "We were only in Nuremburg for a Day but managed to explore this castle. Very interesting all around, and the museum has a lot to look at. Little kids wouldn't be so interested, but our teens loved the ancient weaponry. Don't miss the chance to listen to the talk about the deep",
          "Other than the mini sausages, visit the castle and museums and you've covered most of Nuremberg. There's actually lots of hidden attractions - esp if you're in museums but I recommend starting with the castle to get an overview. Climb up the towers and then plot your day up",

          "This castle exhibit is very well done. Visitors can wander at their own pace through the castle spend time in the rooms that resonate for them. The chapel is lovely. The interactive computer stations provide an opportunity to learn more. You can even see the Golden Bull. Be sure",
          "This is a nice castle with great views of the old city. The best part for us was on the inside they have a bunch of old war relics from many centuries ago. They also have art and old carved wood furniture. In Nuremberg its a must do.",

          "The walk up to the castle from the Hautplatz is a pleasant experience in itself, and since there were not many tourists around, it made picture taking that little bit easier. The entrance to the grounds is free. There is a great view of the city from the castle walls. Make sure",

          "I would recommend hiring a tour guide for this stop as there is almost too much to take in. It is definitely a must see stop. It served as a fortress that protected the city for hundreds of years and was uniquely built with zig-zag wall to make it easier to defend. There is also",
          "The castle was quite interesting but we were disappointed because they do not offer English speaking tourist guides.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Up a steep hill so it definitely gives your calves a work out. You can go through the castle that also has a museum display inside. Then up the tower for a fantastic view over nurenberg. We weren't offered an audio guide but I would ask if one is",
          "This castle provided a great view of the city ! The castle it self was beautiful itself , we didnt pay for ajy tour so no money wasted, we just walked around and absorbed some of the nice features",

          "We climbed the hill over the castle two times, once in a night time, then on daytime too, and both times we had a beautiful view over the city. I liked it during the nigh time better though. We weren't able to visit the castle itself, as both times we arrived after closing time,",
          "Steep hike up............. but worth it! Absolutely beautiful views of the city! A must see when you are in town ...lots of photo ops",

          "Our tour only had time for an exterior visit. It was a good healthy ascent up to the fortress (exactly why it is an effective defense location). The crooked design of the entryway into the compound made it unconquerable, as the defenders had perfect perches to aim at the snail",
          "Great place and a must visit destination. When in Nuremberg you must visit this attraction. From here you have breathtaking views of the Altstad and the city of Nuremberg.",
          "When we visited Nuremberg several years ago for a day, we didn't have a chance to get inside the Imperial Castle. We decided this time that it would be our number one priority. The castle sits in a commanding position on the hill overlooking the town. It is possible to have a",
          "Great place to visit a lot of history here! Be ready to walk. Big hill to walk up but it is worth it. The views are amazing!",
          "Beautiful and pintoresque. I had been in tens of cities in Germany but never before in Nuremberg, I did not know what I was missing. Nuremberg is the hidden secret of Southern Germany",
          "We did not go inside the castle, I have been to so many castles that I couldn't fathom one more. The walk up there is short and steep. The view is lovely and there are lots of little houses that seem to be lived in right now. Everything is under construction it didn't say for",
          "A lovely walk up the hill for some wonderful pre-dinner views of the city. Love Nuremberg, would love to come back and visit again!",
          "Nice place to visit if you're in town. Great views over nuremberg too ... so worth the climb up the hill!",
          "The castle is easily one of the best parts of nuremberg - the views, the history, walks along the wall. Even better on New Year's Eve!",
          "It's impossible to understand Nuremberg and its historical importance without visiting its castle, a fundamental place in the history of the Holy Roman Empire.",
          "We visited the castle twice during our trip. Once during the night to see the Christmas tree and observe the lights from the city, this was excellent it provides a great look over the city. We then returned the next day to go inside the castle grounds which were beautifully",
          "The view is nice. Tbe castle not that great. It makes sense to visit it although just to have it on the list",
          "I am surprised the castle is free because it is so beautiful. Depending on the time of year you can see across the city. Steep hill leading up to it so might be useful to get a taxi. Overall a must-see!",
          "A brisk walk up a steep hill is rewarded with amazing views and then on into the castle through a huge wooden gate. It was badly damaged it the war but has been rebuild well. A must see",
          "It was totally worth the walk up the hill to see the medieval wall surrounding the city, and to tour the castle. The tour begins with a neat explanation of the well that served the castle, and ends with some displays of armor, swords, etc. that our kids loved. Throughout,",
          "Though much seems rebuilt after the war, the views of the city and the museums provide great insight into the city and its earlier history.",
          "Very pretty Castle. Steep climb up to main building and lots of steps to climb up to tower top but worth it for the view. Not a big castle but not expensive to enter either audio guides available at an \u20ac2 extra charge in various languages.",
          "This castle has a really nice feel about it and is surrounded by quaint little shops on cobbled streets for you to wander around. The veiws are amazing but we didn't go inside the castle so can't comment on that. I would say definatley worth a look!",
          "The castle grounds are pretty special and the Sinwell tower is worth the visit as the view is spectacular (you have to purchase a ticket from the main building before you can get through the barrier to the tower) but the tour/museum section wasn't really that great for me. Glad",
          "Good view over the city of Nurnberg, worth a visit. Especialy at Christmas time. Near the castle are great restaurants. Wort seeing also the hostel next to the castle. \ud83c\udf40",

          "You are able to tour a good portion of this castle and the museum portion is informative without becoming boring. There is a lot to see in this castle so recommend two to three hours for your visit. Great little bratwurst place on the walk back down from the castle is a great",
          "Great view of the town from above and a nice walk Up to the castle through the old town. I think it's a must visit while your in the area.",
          "We have been to a lot better castle, but if your there it's a nice thing to see, but if short on time it is not a must see attraction",
          "Family of 4 holiday in Nuremberg early dec 2016. Visited Nuremberg castle, it provides history of this town and of Germany. The buildings have been restored since WW2. Some great views from tower. Definitely worth a visit if in Nuremberg",
          "Very charming. This is not Disney World , this is the real thing with greeat food and very friendly people.",
          "enjoy the photo shoot of this place, but it was very cold at the time we were here and there were quite a few tourist eventhough it is cold.",
          "The castle is a good walk (steep) up from the centre of the old town. There is a museum that charges admission, which we did not go into, and extensive gardens and stone battlements and towers that can be explored for free. Nice views of the city.",
          "Learnt some history, worth the walk up the hill - amazing view! Kids liked the older buildings & learning how they protected themselves from enemies. Can be a tricky climb but the older part of the city is pretty amazing to see.",
          "Beautiful castle, so much history!! Really enjoyed the tour. Learned so much. Highly recommend with great views!",
          "This castle is an extensive complex. Paying to enjoy the museum and deep well (lit up with candles and an entertaining, informative talk on the water supply) was well worth our time and entrance fee. If your physically up for it, climb the staircase in the Sinwell Tower for a",
          "If you don't plan to go inside the buildings, it is free to walk up and see the scenic view, visit the courtyard, marvel at how horses and carriages ever negotiated the steep cobbled road. We didn't go inside, since we were going to the Charles IV exhibit at the Germanisches",
          "I didn't know this place existed or the history behind it but came across it while walking around Nuremberg. It's an amazing place to explore with good views over the city. I can't describe it enough, you will have to see for yourself.",
          "Walked to the castle from the Christmas market. The castle was wonderful. Despite construction going on, we were able to move around the grounds without issue.",
          "The castle of Nuremburg is in the north of the old town. It has a lot of history to tell with the latest section when it was rebuilt after 2nd World War. It is a place to go and try to feel the history. Dating back to Middle Age Emporers and Kings have used the castle. This",
          "Be prepared for a steep uphill walk to get there and lots of stairs after you arrive. We did not get the audio guide, which was a mistake--the exhibits are only labeled in German. As advertised, the deep well presentation was really interesting.",
          "We took a walking tour on a very cold day. The castle is rather plain but the views of the city from the top of the hill where the castle stands were magnificent. We did not stay long because of the cold and the windy conditions. We would not make a special trip to see it but",
          "Is an impressive castle with lots of history. Thought it lacked character. It felt soulless - think the staff need to be more enthusiastic we were expecting more. There could be more of a gift shop and perhaps a nice cafe (as a steep walk!!).",
          "I probably had too high expectations. The castle has been completely destroyed and then rebuilt and from what I could see the works have not properly been realized. Ok the location is worth a walk but the red painting with wich most of the walls have been painted is a punch in",
          "If you are visiting N\u00fcrnberg (Nuremberg), walk up the hill in the town center with the old castle. The view from the top is nice (and no entrance fee required). We did not visit the museum this time, which is inside in the courtyard and allows you to visit the medieval rooms in",
          "Not the \"fairytale castle\" type, more functional. The castle is on top of a hill overlooking the old Town and marktplatz. I would estimate 500 meters to walk there from the marktplatz. Currently undergoing some renovation, still worth a trip.",
          "While I wouldn't make a special trip to this castle, if you are already staying in Nurnberg, it's a neat 2-hour excursion. We took our 2 teens and 2 younger children. They had a good time. There isn't so much to see and do but they really liked the weapons rooms. And let's",
          "It's situated on a very high hill and so you can see it from very far. Just climb there and enjoy the view.",
          "This castle was originally built around 1050 but the current building is from about 1200. There was bombing damage in 1944-5, but the sandstone building has been very nicely restored to it's original look.",
          "The staff here are very friendly, the guy at the ticket counter speaks great English and was very funny. It was a reasonable price for the ticket, we got the ticket which allows entry to everything and we thought it was worth it, 7Euros. The best part for us, was the deep well!",
          "The Kaiserburg contains several castles and the Pentagonal tower which is the oldest structure in N'berg. We loved watching the candles being lowered into the deep well (over 300 feet) and listening to the story behind its construction. The tour of the imperial castle is worth",
          "Went to Nuremberg for the Christmas market and took the time to visit the castle. We didn't have time to see everything but what we saw was very interesting. Great views of the city and surrounding areas. A must see.",
          "Was hear last weekend and we visited this beautiful castle. It was a great experience, and we all loved it.",
          "Very interesting but a bit confusing special exhibition captions in English and German but rest of exhibits only captioned in German.Very colourful though and views from top of Sinwell tour are fantastic make sure you buy a ticket that includes it. Very steep climb and down.",
          "This is not an impressive nor magnificent castle in Europe but historically important. They however have a big collection of medieval military items. Please come if you happen to be a fan.",
          "One of the first castles to be built on the top of a hill, the Emperors/King's Castle commands an unobstructed view of the city of Nurnberg. Largely destroyed during WWII, the majority of the original castle, towers, and buildings have been restored. It is well worth the climb",
          "A bit of an uphill trek from the city center by foot. Highly recommend taking public transport if you're infirm. This impressive castle was once the seat of the Holy Roman Empire. You can tour some of the halls and follow the castle's story, as well as see some costumes,",
          "I lived in Nuremberg in the early 70's for a year. At that time the castle had been rebuilt (after WW2 bombing) and guides were there, but it was empty of furnishings and there was no museum. I was happily delighted to discover this lovely and informative museum. Nuremberg was",
          "Placed on the top of a hill the castle offers you very nice views of the town,especially if you climb in the tower(for this,you have to buy a ticket that also grants you access to the deep well and the museum).Not as big as other castles that I've seen but it's a nice,pretty",
          "We visited Kaiserburg during our stop over in Nuremberg for the Christmas Market. Great view of the city!",
          "There is quite a bit of renovation. One it is complete I am sure it will be great. You must pay entrance fee for both museum and tower which we did not know before we got to the towner and did not wish to go back to the line for tickets. However, even at the base of the tower",
          "The castle itself is lovely though it is under renovation, so the view is a bit ruined by this. Otherwise you can have a nice sight to Nuremburg.",
          "This castle is amasing, the history of this city apears on every step you take. If only the guided tour can be done also in english, more people will enjoy it.",
          "I went there, but I could not enjoy so much. One of the reason was that I could not understand Germany. However, if I could understand the language, I would not be interested in this castle.",
          "Every castle has a different story to tell as does this one, and is worthy of your time and the views are great.",
          "Very beautiful castle in a very good condition. Part of the well known city centre with large unharmed medieval parts. And do not forget to visit the impressive city walls as well: follow the walls counterclockwise from the castle to the Kettensteg and from there back into the",
          "It's definitely worth to visit the Kaiserburg and have a look from the top of Nuremberg. You can choose to visit it just from the outside or to go inside (there is a chapel and a museum about the history of the castle and weapons). I suggest you to go inside the Tower and to do",
          "What a great place. Run by such friendly helpful people. We visited on a cold November day not arriving til 3.15 with a 4pm close time. Ok we had a fast visit of the museum but the castle and tower are easily worth the entrance. The Well display is not to be missed. We",
          "Visiting Nuremberg you will likely visit the \"Altstadt\". Top of \"Altstadt\" and top of town is Kaiserburg - a bit exhausting walking up hill but worth every foot step taken.",
          "The best place to end a nice walk around town that can be even more surprising if you go up to the hill using the city wall that hides some wonderful tranquil places and finishes in the castle's garden just behind the castle itself. After climbing up towards the castle gate",
          "We took our visit early before our train left for the day...I will say that with the construction it was harder to find the entrance. There is a visitors center where you purchase your tickets, you can get tickets for the tower or the entire site...we chose to just visit the",
          "I have been here twice. It's a nice castle from the outside but honestly a waste of money to go in. It just doesn't have the feel of a castle on the inside because there is hardly anything in there. They modernized the look inside and by doing so the Castle lost its mystique.",
          "the place was rebuilt as the original structure due to the damage during the war. have to climb steep hill to arrive there and the is also quite an amount of steps to get on top of the castle, but the view is fantastic from up there.",
          "At the time of our visit unfortunately it was under construction. However there is agreat view to the city and also it's grat that you can walk around the castle down in the ditch. Specially romantic in the evenings as it's nicely flodlit.",
          "like much of Germany's historic castles, the Kaiserburg castle has much to see. There's a short 10 minute computer generated film documenting the history of the site, of the castle, and of the rulers over the centuries. It's worth viewing before you venture around the grounds of",
          "It is covered by the Bavarian Castle Pass without audio guides, which provided good information about the exhibits. There were also English descriptions for most exhibits, thankfully. In one of the rooms, some exhibits have touchscreens (english or german) which you can use to",
          "We used Nurnberg as a base in Germany on a three country trip and enjoyed its smaller feel, spread of history (it was an important medieval town, grew into a center for Nazi influence and has the Documentation Center -- a former Nazi center that is now a somber museum about the",
          "I think it cost \u20ac6 each and took us a few hrs to look around. My tip would be to tell the guide at the well your English before he starts the talk about the history of the well. Great views from up the tower. Friendly helpful staff. And looks fab at night when lit up.",
          "Cobblestone walkways lead to an impressive structure that overlooks the entire city of nurnberg! Wherever you are the city below awaits while touring the inner grounds puts you in the place of the people who have lived and worked there over the years! Renovations are ongoing to",
          "Thought Nuremberg got knocked flat in ww2 but no it's really nice particularly this Amazing castle with its complex and interesting history I would get a tour for this as there's a lot to know",
          "Very interest and scenic walk around the wall surrounding the castle, so much to see and discover. Is a very pleasant 11-12km walk (estimated 25k steps of slow walk) to complete one round of the whole wall. Walk outside the wall and inside the wall, there are pedestrian path",
          "Very interesting and well worth the visit. Lots of history and wonderful views over the city. Audio guides and lots to see and do.",
          "Good views of the city from the walls. Outside the castle was the home of the 'Praying Hands' painter, Albrecht Durer, also famous for his hare paintings.",
          "You are able to walk the castle grounds of the Nuremberg Castle and to enjoy the great views of Nuremberg. The castle grounds in my opinion is not worth a visit, but the view of Nuremberg makes it worthwhile.",
          "Lovely for an afternoon stroll. Unfortunately i didnt get to see what i wanted to see for time constraints. Will be back",
          "This is a nice castle with great views over the city. The views seem to be the best part, and the entrance is free. Museums are not terribly interesting and you may just skip them and come at a time when the place is not over-run by the tourists. That is, unless you are really",
          "Unlike most places they close at 4 PM on Saturday and will begin to shoo you out before that. It's a good hike up from the main square so be aware of the time before you think about going.",
          "With a roller coaster history, this castle is worth a wander/visit. Guides are available, good visuals and capsule history for visitors in museum store.",
          "I think everyone needs to go and experience for themselves. At this point in our trip I had castle fatigue, I think! There were some very interesting aspects of it - but there was SO much, that I felt it very overwhelming. I was not up to the climb up the tower to see the",
          "Long one of my favorite cities to visit, a tour of the Castle on the Hill is the highlight of the day. Steeped in history and ancient lore, the medieval quarter (Altstadt) of Nurnberg is a gem and whether it was a moonlight walk on the battlements that ring the old city, or a",

          "When you go to Nuremberg, Germany, one has to visit the Nuremberg Castle. It is an uphill walk so one has to have the stamina to make the trip up the castle. Upon arrival at the castle grounds, one would be rewarded by the city view.... Worth the effort....",
          "It is quite a climb up to the castle from the Altstadt. The inside is not that interesting so perhaps I only recommend visiting if you like castles",
          "I by chance was in Nuremberg for the 500th anniversary of the Bavarian law for beer. They had a festival in the moat of the castle with live bands and many of the local breweries that abide by the law. They have several festivals like this during the summer. Very worthwhile but",
          "Although not a stand-alone castle these days (the city and Altstadt bank right up to it), it nevertheless still retains the flavour of the castle with its towers and the whole complex of walls and moats. There are displays that recount the castle's history. The view out to the",
          "I absolutely love castles and with a vivid imagination can envision myself as the castle lord. This is an old impressive castle but don\u00b4t expect Neuschwanstein. However, like Ludwig's castle there is a steep, albeit much shorter, walk to the entrance. Once there, you will"

          "Great experience overall. Lacking a bit of interaction with the visitors. Would have liked to have a tour guide in person then just the ear pieces. Good place to visit if you are interested in german history.",
          "Very nice place to know the history of germany and germans..",
          "Very informative and a good retrospective of the German dark history. Some elements of which sadly seem to be reviving around the world. I am missing a bit of a guiding line apart from the linear historical event descriptions. Would it be to risky given the subject?",
          "Amazing place. Best part history I get in my life. So many historic unknown fackts. Highly recommended. Everyone have to see it",
          "Excellent museum mostly about Nuremberg's part in the third reich.  Set aside at least a couple of hours to see all the displays.",
          "Heaps of information to read about and hear, not a lot of displays though. Definitely visit if you're in Nuremberg.",
          "Really interesting, a must see for anyone who wants to learn more about the war",
          "Spent couple of hours there and it totally worth it. What ever the reality was, but this place tells a story worth hearing. \nIf you are a student, your ticket will only cost 1,5 euro.",
          "The place were all began.should you be in Nurnberg go and visit this breathtaking due to the Nazis' crimes museum.you will understand many,many things about the Germans' culture in the early 20's.and of course you will have the chance to learn about the foundation and the rise of the Reigh.",
          "This is a must see for anyone visiting Nuremberg.  Exceptionally well done and very sobering, particularly given today's political world.",
          "It's an immense place and Alamazing to see! One can sense the deep dichotomy and dissonance of the place. Its so impressive yet one knows it's purposely under utilised and maintained because of its history. \nWith a new vision it could become something very special.\nIt felt eerie since there were so few people there.",
          "Mind blowing, powerful, gripping. Spent 5 hours here",
          "Very informative. A lot of information is given and this can be a bit overwhelming. We got there before dark and wished we could have seen the parade ground before it got dark. Erry feeling in the dark. \nTake your time. The commentary in english just reads the boards which are in german.",
          "This was supposed to be a small stop for after the old city, get a bit more info on more recent events. What was calculated for 1h turned in to 3.5h and it was worth it. A audio guide takes the journey with you from the beginning of the \u2026",
          "Hugely impressive depth of detail here. Opportunities to develop further using the audio guides. Nuremberg has much to say about the Nazi Party Grounds, and the setting here is phenomenal. A decent, if small range of detailed books. Cafe is fine, too.",
          "Historically significant but very boringly laid out plaques with too much small font text to read for a tourist. Audio guides are simply an extension of the plaques verbatim. \nEntry fee is a reasonable \u20ac6.\nFeel like it could have been skipped.",
          "Informative museum in a style that fits the dark story it brings.",
          "Very interesting. Learn a lot about the history of Hitlers rise to power, the significance of Nuremberg, and the architecture. Can make it a quick visit or a long visit. Really up to you as it is an audio guided tour that is self paced. The audio device works very well.",
          "Nice to see this huge construction. You have parking near and info point, if you re around check it 5 min",
          "A complete waste of time. Avoid at all costs and instead enjoy the many great things the city of Nuremberg has to offer.",
          "Really impressive building. Just wished there was a more efficient appropriation by the democratic government. Maybe something to spite the NAZI ideals- something like putting LGBT flags where there stood the swastika. The building is very impressive.",
          "The bus tour was the best part and getting to know the history behind the building.",
          "Words cannot describe, Germans make it a point never to forget what occurred.  Highly recommend the audio tour.  Extremely sobering and important.  \n\nIf you have time, I recommend walking over to Zeppelin Field where many rallies were held \u2026",
          "Very informative place with information that you may not have know about Hitler's time period here in Germany. But there are different packages that allow you into buildings that others will not. So if you want to see the inside of some buildings research which package you walk. Also there will be walking. Not just a little.",
          "Historical things, places and people is always great to question",
          "Extremely emotional. And a must to see!",
          "Great museum, lot of audio-guide content , you will learn a lot about Nurnberg during the 30's and 40's. You can also see some historical buildings.",
          "One of the museums worth visiting. Full of information and videos. It's quite sad, and can be hard for some people, but the truth is often hard to know. Everyone who comes to visit me goes to this museum. Get the headset, and expect to spend a few hours in there.",
          "I was expecting to be able to get some better views inside the building going to an upper roof. The expo was not really well organized and all texts where just in one language so you are forced to hear the show recording in a place really crowded.",
          "Detailed narration of events leading to the third Reich by way of a pictography exhibition with text and commentry through audio guide. Visitors enjoy the detailed information and can be seen engrossed",
          "Museum is Fine for all. Non barrier. With snack bar.on Cash desk.. Receptionist has translator for foreigners. Strong sad experience to remember history. Good to know.",
          "Fantastic review of a short period of German history.  It was very informative on this period in history.  The prices are very reasonable.  GET the audio guide!  The grounds are fascinating  as are the buildings.  This museum is \u2026",
          "This place is meant for people who are so much involved in history and trying to dive deep into what happened and how Hilter built his country. It is really good but overwhelms u with lots and lots of information which becomes difficult to \u2026",
          "Not sure if it's because of Rock im Park going on at the same time (I assume it is) but the assembly area was used as a car park which detracted from the experience. Was only \u20ac1.50 though with a festival wristband. Pretty good otherwise, audio tour included in the price",
          "It takes almost 3-4 hrs to actually go through the history in detail. The audio guide is helpful and is available in multiple languages. There are many short videos that help to visualize the Nazi rule days. The place is well maintained. A \u2026",
          "Great information, shame they turn the lights off 15 mins before closing time and the receptionists are very rude.",
          "Very somber experience filled with a ton of artifacts and displays that document most of the rise and fall of the Nazis. If you like to learn about history, it's well worth a visit.",
          "A must stop... Overload of information but a necessary visit. Very nicely done, flow and historical collection of the Nazi Party rise and fall and it's affect on everything!",
          "An amazing experience.  Thank you.",
          "It felt like it went on forever!! The museum was good, offering translation audio devices, but it meant you had to wait for the slow speaker to talk.\n\nThe grounds themselves were derelict, overrun, and had big orange storage units in the middle, as well as parked cars?!?!\n\nVery weird.",
          "Super atmosphere place",
          "Building shows epoch of Nazi Germany. Many historical and interesting documents are available. You can find many information out by interactive dates.",
          "As the site comes into view, a wave of somberness and sobriety wash over you. The simultaneous awe of the structure and knowledge of what it stands for play back and forth in your mind. The Kongre\u00dfhalle in its majesty, though unfinished and in ruin, plays as a powerful symbol of the stark evil of the administration it represented.",
          "We had a Tour and because of That we did Not See that much. Maybe better without a tour",
          "If you love a bit of history,this is the place,no sugar coated facts,pure history",
          "Audio-guide are included in the ticket price (\u20ac6 for adults). It might take around 2 to 3 hours to finish to go through it all. Must see for those interested in history.",
          "Detailed timeline layout on Hitlers rise to power and fascistication of Germany",
          "Great fairground with huge and well lit halls. High quality amenities and friendly staff, very good documentation of where to find what. Food and beverage are average, but what do one expect from a fair ground?",
          "For me, as a Polish, this was a bit scary and deeply touching experience to see the history of Hitler's Germany on the show like this. I believe for Germans this was not an easy exhibition to prepare, especially to include all the grousome \u2026",
          "Scary. Must see. Well done. The Germans don't try to hide it, it happened. Let's not let it happen again.",
          "Very moving and very surprising to me how much I liked it. Well, \"liked\" may be a poor choice of words, but it is absolutely worth the visit. Probably takes about 3 hours to do it justice. The headphone tour is worth it, but basically just reads (in English) what the poster or display says in German.",
          "A really good and important experience in N\u00fcrnberg. They have offerings in many languages other than German. As a new resident of the area, I plan on going back a few more times and definitely any time we have visitors.",
          "Don't miss if you are in Norinberg.",
          "Very informative. Must visit.",
          "Lots of information. Could spend an entire day there. Audio Guide was very helpful",
          "Take your time here, as it does a wonderful job explaining the German mentality leading up to and during WW2.   Great audio guides, and most is in English.",
          "Historically important, huge structure, worth the visit!",
          "Very interesting.  You need time to visit so came, when possible, in the morning.",
          "If curious about history, it's a nice place",
          "Amazing, ominous, and makes you think. It also makes you want more people to visit as it reminds us what can happen if we are not both vigilant and truly empathetic to other human beings.",
          "An amazing building. The tour is about an hour but we\u2019ll worth it",
          "Mediocre exhibition. Only tells a tiny part of the story with seemingly arbitrary jumps in time.",
          "Very informative and important work that is done here to document history for future generations. But unfortunately for English-speakers only German descriptions. So you will be totally dependant on your audioguide.\nReduced entrance fee \u2026",
          "Very interesting and well done museum.",
          "Really informative and interesting experience. Would highly recommend a visit here, particularly with the audio tour. The walk around the grounds is equally as interesting but not as informative",
          "An amazing place showing the importance of N\u00fcrnberg in the Nazi history, informative and impressive arrangement the facts and pictures. You should go there or else you\u2019ll miss an important aspect of N\u00fcrnberg history.",
          "Deffinantly worth a visit but make sure to allocate at least 1/2 day or you may be skipping through.",
          "Remember me of the good days",
          "The best place to know part of Germany History",
          "Very important historical site.",
          "Very informative and well maintained. The entrance fee is about \u20ac6 and you get an audio guide. This place talks in detail about world war and has many videos of and pictures of it. Worth a visit.",
          "Place is must visit for history lovers. It gives lot of information. They also provide audio guide. Personally I got overloaded with the information.",
          "Great way to go back in time and find out all the details, especially considering the fact that we learned at school only the most important parts. If you are found of history and you like to listen to every chapter and watch every movie, it might take you up to 4 hours. And 6 \u20ac for a ticket which includes the audio guide is a bargain.",
          "Museum displaying important part of German history. In principle well organized but information get repetitive over time. Exhibition consist almost exclusively of pictures and short movies.",
          "I am from the United States and feel like there was no difference learning German history at this documentation center vs my past experiences in US public schools",
          "Much to learn and see very fascinating and a must see for kids to learn about world War II I am a teenager and I love it",
          "Came when visiting my brother- very interesting",
          "If you really love history and are fluent in German-> Go there,\nIf not.. think twice or even three times about going\n\nIt is interesting, but I've seen better museums that display stuff better and made it more interesting, like in D.C, \u2026",
          "A very detailed account of the rise and years under Hitler. Easy to get to on tram from city centre. You need to allocate several hours to do the site justice. Well done to citizens of the city for maintaining such an important exhibition",
          "Really abandoned building, there are wall graffitis everywhere.",
          "Very nice place. A lot information. Can be a little bit too long some times. A nice place to see for very cheap price(6\u20ac)",
          "Excellent museum documenting how Hitler was able to rise to power. Absolutely fascinating! You will want to allow a minimum of 2 hours to be able to get through all the information. At the end seeing the parade grounds is a must!",
          "Very detailed chronical description of the rize and fall of the NS. Very interesting and a lot to read. The quotes of survivors made it extra interesting.",
          "It was interesting to visit these monumental national socialist party rally grounds. You can also take a pink flamingo paddleboat and enjoy the view of the Congress centre from the lake.",
          "This is a must do, when you are in N\u00fcrnberg, if not for your self then you kids or grandchildren. So much information that I had no idea about.\nYou will get a voice guide when you pay entrance. Also in Englisch. Easy to use public transport to reach this place.",
          "Very informative. Many things not taught in school of the horrors and why this happened.",
          "Real historic site",
          "Very, very informative and interesting. Audio guides in English provide a good explanation. It's very information heavy and should not be considered as a casual trip.",
          "ok",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Very informative, especially if you get the audio guide. If recommend doing it before visiting the really grounds.",
          "A necessary place, needed to remember us of all the horrors of our past ...",
          "It is a bit sad place but it give a chance to remember our faults.",
          "Very well curated and thought out museum. It is full of text and images. Audio tours are offered in many languages which enhance the experience. The museum offers an interesting insight into the events it covers and documents everything extremely well. A good educational experience.",
          "Really good museum. Super easy to get to via tram. The information on the audio guide was super in-depth. Definitely recommended to do when visiting Nuremburg",
          "Incredibly well done museum with self guided audio tour. Really takes you back in time and gives great insight to the rise and fall of Hitler's Nazi Germany.",
          "5 Stars for the integrity and honesty of this place. Lest we forget",
          "Along with the Zeppelinfelds, people need to go here. The German people have rightly preserved all of these artificial as a strong reminder of power gone wrong. A must see for everyone.",
          "Very interesting museum. Allow 1.5-3 hours to see everything. 6euro entrance fee. Take the audio guide if you cannot read German",
          "Very informative, a must visit for the history of the 3rd Reich.",
          "I would highly recommend if you want to learn about the history of the war and would like to understand how the Hitler came to power and his pure madness of conquering the world with extremities. Its a lesson to learn.",
          "I learnt a lot but the place left me feeling very sad and somber about the history and what happened to so many people. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the audio guide was a great help for English speaking. It\u2019s an easy tram \u2026",
          "Loved the architecture and the concept behind it. You truly feel like you're on a journey as you're following through the whole audio tour.",
          "Not much to see just reading off of like posters.. ok not great.",
          "There is English audio guide but wish there are written English guide as it takes too much time listening to the audio",
          "It's a very detailed account of Germany's road to WWII and what followed. Great information that comes in multiple languages with a lot of history and information for those interested in WWII.",
          "If you are interested in history,  you need to visit that place. Is not very well maintained but is good to be seen while is still there.",
          "This center leads us to the historical events which are relevant in the world history...",
          "This is a stark reminder of how terrible one group of people can be to another. What is sad is that the same atrocities still occur today. This is a movie exhibit on several levels.",
          "Great museum.",
          "Beautiful country and location. Local population is extremely kind and inviting. City streets and country sides are 100% free of trash and pollution. Germans are extremely environmentally aware and make strong efforts to always recycle as \u2026",
          "Serves as a great reminder to what uncontrolled power can do. Interesting to note how such places are not actually called \u201cmuseums\u201d by the Germans (same is true for museums in K\u00f6ln and Bonn).",
          "Full immersion in the parabola of nazism. The panels are only in German though, and I was expecting to visit the whole monument from the open place inside, where people used to gather for the party rallies. Still, it's really informative.",
          "Really interesting and detailed history. Would recommend taking an audio tour and leaving time to explore the grounds as there are information boards outside also.",
          "Well worth a visit. Entrance is 6\u20ac per person and then you get a audio tour which is available in several different languages.",
          "Excellent museum and very well laid out.\n\nVery powerful imagery and text throughout.\n\nHandheld tour guides are free and are useful as the text in the muesum is in German.",
          "The memory of what happened is kept alive and well, so we may never forget",
          "Weird delivery. Didn't love it.\n\nIt was essentially a bunch of posters laid out between small rooms with pictures and descriptions in German. Each guest is given with an audio guide (that has a bunch of languages - around 6 or 8 options) \u2026",
          "Very informative,  very upsetting.  It gives you a good grasp on how well organized the naziregime was. This needs to be learned from!",
          "A must visit for people who want to know more about history, it's really nicely maintained and portraid one of my fav museum, it's a flash back in history. Beautifully pictured and very interesting depictions with original pictures dated back than.",

          "Fascinating visit back to a tragic era.",

          "A must see in Nuremburg. A little away from the city center but if you are interested in the history of the War and the portion of the cities part you will not be disappointed. 6 Eus per entry or 5 for a group of 15 plus.",
          "Wery interesting exposition. Audioguids included in ticket price.",

          "This is truly an experience, although not a positive one.  There is a massive amount of information and it is shocking to see the full documentation.  I highly recommend visiting and spending the time to learn the full story.",
          "Top",
          "Romantic plaz",
          "Lots to learn here with the English audio guide. Takes around 2 hours to listen to it all and watch the videos. The actual rally site outside is basically a car park so was disappointing but it was a good experience on the whole",
          "Awesome place",
          "A very informative  center that recounts one  of the darkest  periods in history. Go north  of the documentation center for a 10 minutes walk to the  zepplin field where the reminder of the past  awaits.",
          "Very educational. However when there are group guides they are very loud and they mask the sounds comming from the headset we have",
          "A place to make ourselves to think regarding what happened in the past",
          "Liked it.. Gave me a new insight on Nazis and Hitler. If you enjoy learning more about that period (1920-1950) and then the evolution of the Nazis then you must not miss it if you're in Nuremberg",
          "As stated in it\u2019s name, there are only documents nothing more and special. There are plenty of parking place. Around the building there are lake, park and bicycle paths. One can walk along the marching path after the museum.",
          "Well preserved piece of History and quite informative.",
          "Very interesting place. Good audio guide that takes you through the rise of the Nazi party, the war and finally the war trials. Spent several hours going round. The rooms were rather warm and lacking in fresh air.",
          "It is a place that everyone needs to see and understand.  The best way to prevent repeating history is to understand how and why it happened",
          "Okay place. Need to improve the interactive system",
          "One of the better museums to learn the history of the Nazi rise to power...and the fall. A little lengthy but well detailed. If you want to cover it all and capture everything that is available to see and hear then allow five hours for your visit, but with three hours avoiding repetition it would be enough.",
          "Extremely good museum. Takes you step by step through the history in great detail provided by audioguide in English and other languages. The museum is engaging and well laid out. The content is moving and interesting. Allow plenty of time for the museum so you are not rushed. The surrounding parkland is also interesting to walk around.",
          "Museum is really awesome and informative",
          "A really good museum experience.",
          "Informative museum with a lot of WWII facts. Get an audio guide and follow along",

          "The best",

          "Really interesting museum but most of the exhibits consisted of story boards only. Whilst these were interesting they got a bit repetitive. Make sure you go for a walk around the grounds afterwards.",
          "You have to give it proper time, if you want to listen to the audio guide till the end. 21 rooms, and 4 hours.",
          "Very well done and sensitive museum.. need at least a day to see and digest this information",
          "Filthy toilets, and far foo hot",
          "Really good museum. There's not just texts but also movies.",
          "Historically it's one of the most mererabel places in history. Well documented and good layouts. Without any proudness of this dark era in German history.",
          "Very well done museum telling the story of the rise and fall of Nazi Germany. A must visit in my opinion if you find yourself in Nuremberg.",
          "Impressive place, you can spend a whole day there if you are interested.",
          "Very good",
          "If you want a realistic look on WWII and the whole regime, this is where you learn",
          "Very well documented and explained.  The current generation will learn and always guard the future.",
          "From the outside looks great and it seemed to have lots of parking. Unfortunately we got here just after it closed for the night so we didn't get to make it inside.",
          "It is OK to visit.",
          "A must visit in Nurnberg!",

          "Give yourself a few hours to get through this at least.",
          "Very informative museum.",
          "This place has an amazing story to tell. It\u2019s outside of the city center but it\u2019s super accessible via bus 36 or tram 8 if you are coming from the city center. It\u2019s a must visit when in Nuremberg because it tells a very important story about a specific time of the city.",
          "Cool",
          "Beautiful and historical place in the center of Nuremberg",
          "Also known as the \"Nazi Rally Grounds\", you can feel the spirits of history as you walk through this exhibition.  Many exhibits describing Hitler's influence on the 3rd Reich.",
          "A well presented and unbiased history of the key figures, atrocities and origins of the Nazi regime, situated in the unfinished and crumbling building that was to be their \"great hall\". The visit relies heavily on informative audio guides, but information saturation was reached after about 2hrs of a 3hr visit.",
          "Powerful and moving. I could have spent hours there but needed to move through faster with younger child. There was a bat or multiple bats that were zipping through the back section that gave myself and others a fright.",
          "Great museum in Nuremberg. Must wisit to understand German modern history and the scale of NS influence.",
          "Worthwhile a visit ! Very interesting, good display of information",

          "A good afternoon. Easy to get to. Fascinating insight in to Nuremberg, the rally's and the German psyche.",
          "You need to spend 3 to 4 hours or more here, depending on interest.  Audio devices are free as well as the rest rooms!",
          "Very weird, graphic info, worth seeing the size of it all",
          "I thought this was great museum. Very interesting information, with a wonderful layout. The architecture and design really made it special, a unique way of adding on a modern museum while still preserving the historical authenticity of the \u2026",
          "Beautifully well organised place to know about the history of Hitler in N\u00fcrnberg. Very cheap for students. Would highly recommend this place.",
          "Very well done museum about a very heavy subject.",
          "Interesting but far too long and big as a museum. Don\u2019t try and read every info graphic and listen to every audio guide - you will get bored very quickly into the museum and will be there for actual hours.\n\nAlso, if you have studied world \u2026",
          "Very interesting but not a lot of new information if you know a bit about it already! Very well presented and the audio tour is brilliant",
          "Spectacular place but you may get bored with so long guides",
          "One of the best musuems I have been to. Super cheap for students (including the audio guide). Easily the place I enjoyed the most in Nuremberg and I'm not even that much into Musuems.",
          "Interesting place to visit lots of good information.  Tours are in English.   Good place to visit",
          "Enjoyed my visit here. Recommended!",
          "Great museum! Learned lots. Takes you from the formation of the party through up to the trials. Everything is in German so get the English audio book on the way in, free with entry. \n\nWe took our time and it took 3 hours listening to \u2026",
          "The museum is very modern looking and gives a lot of history surrounding the third Reich, with main focus on the building itself. Enjoy student price if you have a student card. Free parking can be found at the open field next to it. Worth \u2026",
          "How should I explain this place? Terrifying",
          "Not sure if I saw this its been a while but Nurmberg is a fascinating place",
          "Interesting place. You can rent audioguias in your own language because the info is in German and a few in English. I recommend to rent because is the only way to know all about this place",
          "You can see colesium and zeppelin field without having to take the audio tour.",
          "Great place to visit",
          "Very informative, but not super kid friendly.  People seemed very put out if our kids made the slightest noise, so we had to cut our visit short. Not surprising for Bavaria. We enjoyed our visit despite having to leave before we got through everything.",
          "It's a very interesting museum with audioguide in different languages that explaines everything in detail and has good visualisation. Definitely worth a visit. And it is not expensive, costs 5 euros and has student reduced price",
          "Good history info",
          "Great place",
          "A must visit when in nuremberg,very detailed exhibition about life of A. Hitler",
          "Objective and impressively. Rings a bell on the current political situation of Europe.",
          "Audio commentaries are available in many languages; all very sensitively done (not an easy task given the subject matter). It is a truly astonishing building and it would, perhaps, have added to the experience if there was access to more of it, but that is by no means meant as a criticism.",
          "Great documentary worth seeing once in a lifetime.",
          "This is the largest structures I have seen based on the Roman Coliseum. It\u2019s unfortunate the reason it was built was for Nazi Germany.",
          "Really interesting, is a must if you go to Nurenmberg in my opinion",
          "Fantastic museum about nazi Germany. Make sure you ask about the design of the building and the significance of the architecture. They have handheld tour guides in every language imaginable and at least one tour guide who speak fluent English.",
          "Amazing museum - full of must see history",
          "Good place too go learn about 2nd world war",
          "Part of history you can't afford to miss...",
          "Well worth it with the audioguide. Wished we'd had 3 hours here instead of 1.5 hours. Significantly improved since I last visited 6 years ago.",
          "powerful and intriguing exhibit-I felt like I'd relearned the Weimar Republic and the NSDAP through a different perspective",
          "Very good design. The exhibitions are thought through and give you a great history lesson about what Nazism meant. \n\nIt starts from the beginning with Hitler's ascend to power together with the sociopolitical context. Then it moves through \u2026",
          "A must see place to visit if you are in Nuremburg. For under 20 euro admission with English audio tour I easily spent 3 or so hours looking over each of the exhibits that detail the rise and fall of the Nazi Party and chronicles world war 2 \u2026",
          "Excellent place to learn history, especially the rise and fall of the Nazi",
          "Too much panels with text, i expected more videos and a simpler way in explaining the informations ,for me it was a little bit boring.",
          "Great place to get to know about WW II history, but I think about three hours is minimum to go round and listen to everything. Definitely worth a visit, it'll give you something to think about!",
          "Great museum with the strange atmosphere. I am not able to describe what I felt. You have to visit. If you are from Czech republic you can buy detailed paper guide.",
          "Eye opening understanding of the plans the Nazi's had for building Nuremberg into the center of their system.",
          "Helpfull staff and a wide language selection on the audio guides",
          "This place should be free of charge, it is a great opportunity for a history lesson and food for thought.",
          "Very mooving well worth popping on no 36 bus and taking in a bit of history",
          "Interesting...made the hair on my back stand-up, pleased I visited.",
          "Interesting but below my expectations.",
          "A museum worth the visit. It walks you through  the history of the Nazis from their rise to power untill their fall. It was really enlighting. In the front desk you are given an audio guide which helps since there is nothing is English.",
          "Very interesting, for real. Don't take a picture of yourself on the podium, it looks weird and everyone will think you might be a Nazi.",
          "Visited place since there was a festival going on and it was the last day. Amazing place to visit if you are a history buff. Can get to know a lot about Germany and it\u2019s history during the Second World War. There are many incomplete \u2026",
          "One of the best museums I\u2019ve ever visited. Reserve plenty of time when visiting.",
          "Boring for those who do not have much interest in history. Even if you have interest, the intense level of history and the boring method of listening to audio will make you tired soon",
          "very interesting historic location, but don't expect them to have the parties they used to have",
          "Very big and a lot of informations",

          "Ve heff ze veys off making you listen",
          "Very informative but after a while it started getting a bit boring. Definitly a great experience for those very interested in the hitler and nazzi storie. But for us who where there and visitied it was too much talk and not a whole lot to see",
          "I visited last year, was ok, a little boring and depressing. The video installations seem a little outdated. I didn't listen to the audio tour that is provided. You could probably learn more from reading books but has some interesting artifacts. Shame the building is partly destroyed, must have looked magnificent.",
          "A lot of information presented in an easy, walk around fashion, audio presentation follows along the route.  Traffic flow can bog down as some rooms are small and have many displays.  I recommend not taking small children, not because of the the content, but the time required and crowds.",
          "I think it's a best place where you can learn about Hitler and Germany during his rule. They have Audio devices which explain about each incident from scratch. These devices are available in different languages. People who have keen \u2026",
          "Absolutely fascinating and so well maintained!",
          "Great piece of history and important to educate future generations",
          "A must see if you are interested in Germany history during the second world war.",

          "Very moving.",
          "The museum was very educational. As a person that studied history I still learned things here. I also really enjoyed the fact that they had a section on the trials for the far East. \n\nWe got to the museum early and was concerned that we \u2026",
          "Its huge lot of interesting things to see but if you choose not to go inside a walk around that lake is beautiful",
          "Very sobering to see this. Unfortunately you can see this happening in other countries we have visited.",
          "It was a great graphical documentary from a section of contemporary history of Germany which you cannot simply find or see through internet. It has really good audio guide in different languages and with really good price, 6 euro normal and 1.5 for students.",
          "Really interesting place to visit. Dripping with history and really makes you appreciate what you're grandparents went through and endured.",
          "Overall was really interesting place to visit, the huge scale of it is astounding and the museum is very informative.",
          "So sad and impresive.",
          "They have audio tours in English, there is a lot of information as well. My 6 year old made it about 3/4 of the way before he was done. He enjoyed the audio tour. The area around is worth exploring. It's amazing how larege the structures \u2026",
          "Historic place where Hitler held his speeches.",
          "Good place to know history... the best to know some information. Incredible feeling staying there... Awful idea of building, but good to learn to the future.",
          "Very interesting with an excellent audio tour.",
          "Personally I liked more compared to the palace of justice. The proposed path is complete and well done. Interesting details about the Nazi town planning project in Nuremberg. Luckily never completed.",
          "A lot to see and learn about, loved it",
          "Definitely worth to visit, but takes a lot of time if you want to see the whole picture",
          "An important place of remembering!",
          "Nice museum , but everything consists of  pictures and videos that you go through with a private little speaker/guide that explains the story behind it (included in the ticket price of 6\u20ac)\nInteresting initially but you get bored after a while .\nWorth visiting though\nWhole museum will take around 90 minutes to go through.",
          "Better read a book that go there. Nothing to see at all...",

          "Great place to learn history and to visit in Nuremberg.",
          "Historical and very informative.",
          "The museum itself is very well-done and the English audioguide is superb. Very informative and impactful.\nDefinitely recommend to visit.",
          "Haunting story and display of a dark time in Germany's (and Nuremberg's) history.  Allow 2-3 hours to fully immerse into the story of the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party in it's strongest base of operations.",
          "A sobering overview of Nazi Germany and Hitler. May this never happen again.",
          "Everyone should visit it.\nIt's a museum with an audio guide in multiple languages.",

          "This museum provides an interesting look at the rise of Hitler and the events that led to WW2. The exhibits are in a number of languages, and audio guides can be checked out free of charge to listen to in your native language. The structure \u2026",
          "Very interesting informations on the third reich and its history. The building itself looks interesting as well.",
          "An amazingly informative museum really hitting out with facts and details of before and during the war. Entry fee was low cost and was given the option of a verbal handheld  tour.",
          "Very interesting place to visit, to see what causes the second world war. They have audio guides for non German speakers and they are easy to operate.",
          "The tour is self guided using a device you type exhibit numbers in to hear audio in your native language.  It is a chilling reminder of our history.",
          "Wish they gave a more extensive outside tour or had more information posted in the rally ground about the history. It looked abandoned for the most part, used for storage or loading docks for current companies... didn't feel like a historical monument. But it was still an amazing feeling to be there.",
          "Very comprehensive WWII history.",
          "Lots of information and well laid out.  Will take 2-3 hours to see and read it all.",
          "The building is full of History and it has impact. However, the exhibition area didn't have a single written translation in English (we had audio but the picture's subtitles were in German only). The videos were the best explanatory part.",
          "Good knowledge, best if you read about it first before heading over.",
          "If you have any thought of world war 2 and the history this is a must visit just make sure you have a couple of hours if not days to view and take all the photos and site on the property to get the real value of this third riche center \u2026",
          "The price with the student card is 2 euros",
          "Not Worth. Entry ticket is so costly.",
          "Emotional place to visit, worth your while if you are into historical facts.",
          "If you are interested in WWII history, this is a place for you!",
          "A lot information available thanks to the audiogide. If you find this part of history as interesting as I do you will need half a day to heard everything so take your time.",
          "Amazing how the German people cope with their historical legacy. Worth the trip to Neurenberg.",
          "Very nice place",
          "Necessary to visit it and see it. Nice overview about not funny history of Germany and city N\u00fcrnberg.",
          "One of the most wonderful places in Bavaria. Best part would be in winter... lake would be frozen, which allows any one to Ice skate or sledge.... great place to walk around and spend quality time with family,",
          "A must see sightseeing site in N\u00fcrnberg!",
          "This is a very interesting museum and worth the visit. I learned so much about how influential Hitler was to the young people. His speeches and rally had lots of energy.  The audio tour is filled of rich and detailed history starting with \u2026",
          "A very historic building",

          "Lots of info about the horrors of the nazi-regime. I would have liked some more detailed information about the actual buildings, and the (absence of) plans for it's conservation. I understand that an admiration of the architecture is difficult, in light of the tragedies commited, but still...",
          "Very Amazing place i'll be there once more ...and more",
          "Tip..if you are visiting DO NOT GOOSE STEP ACROSS THE MAIN SQUARE. As i found out these people really don't have a sense of humour..other than that it gets 5 Heil Hitlers out of 5",
          "Fantastic. Gripping. Thought provoking. Thorough presentation of the rise of nazism. How and why it could happen. Most challenging where the personal interviews with German civilians of that era and how they experienced the events. ",
          "This is a Must-Visit location if you\u2019re passionate about the German History. The entire museum chronologically explains the country\u2019s development, major changes in the economy and Industry pre and post wars and the influence of Adolf Hitler over them.",

          "Great historical place to visit",

          "Berg imprtant",
          "very informative place...",

          "Well organised, helpful audio guide, value for money. Must visit if in Nuremburg!",
          "Just doing a physical recon before family shows up next year. Took photos and got their opening hours. Next step will be to take a tour. Might be fun to do a tour with my German parents-in-law. In the 80s they used to tell me stories about when they were kids during World War II. Didn't know Soldier's Field was a DODDS reference.",
          "very interesting museum but if you don't speak german the visit gets to extensive",
          "Comprehensive and moving documentation regarding the rise and fall of nazism. It is my sincere wish that everyone, especially migrants from places and cultures known for endemic antisemitism, should pay a visit to this place and learn that antisemitism and fascism in all its forms should never be welcome in Europe.",
          "I was unable to see inside but to be at a historic location.",
          "Impressive! If you want to see all exhibitions, you have to spend all day!",
          "A somber place that shows how one man's idiosyncrasies cost a lot of harm to the psyche of an entire generation.\nStill well preserved on purpose, not to glorify the deeds but to make the present generation aware of them, so we never again have to endure the horrors that are revealed here.\nA must visit.",
          "Good place for the historians.... Few hours needed to complete the visit...",
          "Very well done. There is lots of information and I don't think it's as good if you skip the audio tour. If you are a completionist and don't like to miss anything, prepare to spend about 3 hours here.\n\nIt's like watching a documentary on \u2026",

          "Must to see in N\u00fcrnberg. The hall is huge and it is a part of the history. There is some posters, but it could be more interesting with more pictures. I think the most.side of this hall is a kind of storage or logistic center. This side is \u2026",
          "Good but isolated place.",

          "A Must See museum - gut wrenching but we must not forget the lessons from History.",

This museum is well worth a visit and is relevant for everyone. Audioguides are included in entry fee and are available in many languages.",
          "Boring audio visual museum. Not many objects to look at. Could use the building and grounds to better effect. \nThe audio device they provide is quite heavy to be holding up to your ear for over an hour. \n\nMuseum in Nuremberg center is much better. ",

          "History came alive.",

          "This museum has a very extensive collection of artifacts. One of the sections deals with the history of Germany and the Germans. You could spend several days to see all the exhibits in detail so it is best to make plans. A museum with a church inside has to be worth a look.",
          "I was expecting a bit more. The plan of the museum is very confusing. Some lovely works, of course, but the vibe here was strange. Work of Veit Sto\u00df was the reason to visit here. Great Middle Ages religious sculptures. It just was not presented in a cohesive manner.",
          "This museum is definitely a must-see when visiting Nuremberg, as it houses one of the most significant German art collections, ranging from medieval painting, sculpture and arts & crafts, to fairly contemporary ones. It also offers a great insight into the daily lives of people",
          "We were pleased to note it was free when we arrived at 5Pm but it also closes at 6Pm and there is nowhere near enough time to see everything. It contains something from everyone from art to religion to war but if you do want to see everything, give yourself some hours as it's",

          "We spent an entire day at the museum. Their collection of medieval artifacts was extensive. Even had artifacts from 500 BC. It is easy to spend hours there. We ate brunch, as it was the only thing they were serving on Sunday. The food was good, reasonable price and beautiful",

          "This museum is well worth a visit. It has fascinating collections of art, clothes, musical instruments. Staff are very friendly.",
          "It would probably take a full day or more to see all the collections: pick your favorites... weapons and armours or religious paintings and sculptures from the middle ages or musical instruments or 20th century paintings or.... Unfortunately the recorded audio tour is available",
          "We spent several, very interesting, hours visiting only a rather small part of this very rich museum. One will need several visits in order to enjoy all the exhibition rooms.",
          "One reads this is one of the best museums in the world and it is easy to see why. The structures which house it are fascinating in and of themselves. Many inventions come from Nuremberg, for example the pocketwatch and the globe, and the originals are in the museum. There is",
          "The German National Museum is a must when visiting Nuremberg, Germany. It is laid out exceptionally well and photographs are permitted. This museum rivals the Victoria and Albert in London.",
          "It would take days to see all the treasures in this museum. We were overwhelmed by its size and the variety of its content. Contains both art treasures (D\u00fcrer, Rembrandt, Cranach, etc.) and historic objects. Wonderfully organized. Excellent cafe. Not to be missed!",
          "This is an excellent museum. If you've gone to some historic sites in Europe and wonder where some of the interesting things that were in these buildings went, you can find some of them here. I spent 5 hours at this Museum recently and really enjoyed seeing all of the items in",
          "This museum is huge and overwhelming, but amazing. The displays for the most part are beautifully done and clearly presented. There is so much to see, though. Rooms of carved wooden crosses, cases of religious folk art, regional folk costumes, musical instruments, fragments",
          "It's just a place full of history and has some great pieces. I highly recommend going there and to bring something to write down.",
          "Today made visit #2 to this amazing museum. I'm able to visit often because I live 30 minutes South of the city. This museum is set in a great location right in the heart of Nuremberg and is in a phenomenal old building that has been mixed with new conatruction, so it is a great",
          "This museum is a collection of interconnected buildings. It started in one in the late 1800s and it's just grown since then. The armory is my favorite room. Its collection of swords and other weapons is lovely, plus the last time I went they had a life-sized model jouster set up",
          "This museum has the Way of Human Rights outdoor sculpture along the walkway leading to the main entrance of the museum. There is no admission charge from 6:00 P.M. to 9:00 P.M. on Wednesday nights and I used this three hour time frame to get an overview of the diverse and",
          "I spent two afternoons here and barely scratched the surface. Be sure to pick up an audio guide, as it explains works in more depth. The physical guides to each room's theme helps you acquaint yourself to the works and decide if you're interested or not. You can find them in",
          "The building is impressive but I did not find the collections inside excited. I really enjoyed the temporary exhibition of pocet watches which ends April 12",
          "Do take time to visit this excellent museum which presents a survey or German art and craft. I especially enjoyed the wood carvings. Look for the large angel that peers down from above as you enter the cloister section.",
          "This museum is huge and offers a great variety of exhibits. I would have never expected anything like that in a city like nuremberg. If this museum would be located in berlin, evryone would know it. Go there and experience german history, culture and art in a way you have never",
          "Be sure you have enough time reserved for the visit, it is THE museum to see in Nuremberg if you are a historian or history enthusiast. You'll get, inevitably lost, but it makes the discovery experience even more interesting. Thematic exhibitions/units spice things up! It's a",
          "This is a modern building with very nice museography, the pieces are nicely displayed and cover several centuries of German history. Wednesdays is a day when it closes late so you can take advantage of it.",
          "This had all different items including stone tools from ancient man (and a small horse cave drawing too), guild artifacts, ancient scientific instruments, a full pharmacy set-up, musical instruments, weapons, clothing, tapestries, paintings and sculptures etc. I only saw about",
          "great collections, diverse. Try to wear light close, is very warm in the most spaces inside . It worth to visit, maybe two days spent here would make the visit more enjoyable.",
          "This is a huge museum, so just go to the areas you want to go about as it's too big to see at one time. There's a lot here. We went to the ancient rooms and some of the boards are in english but not all of them. There were also some translation issues and the boards did not read",
          "This museum is huge. You can spend half a day in it and still can't say you covered it all. However, this is mainly a history museum and if you are not a fan of those, this museum would not change your mind. That being said, the organization of this museum seemed to be a mess.",
          "Well this is the place to come! From artwork to costumes, musical instruments to actual life size historical rooms, there is something to cater for all. The museum is a bargain for a family as it was only 10 euros. This is the English website",
          "I am not a fun of museums but this is something different. This museum shows all the history of Germany and a lot more... Be prepared, you will need all the morning hours to see everything. Also, we went there on Wednesday at 6-9 pm it is free.",
          "If you want to learn more about the rich history of Germany, please visit this wonderfull museum. On the top floor there is a compleet furnished old farmerhouse.",
          "After the castle and the old town, we have found this museum to be a must visit attraction. It is large and diverse. Chose what you want to see, otherwise you we be overwhelmed and there all day. The museum is Germany's most important. There is an archialogical collection,",
          "This very large museum, devoted to German history and culture contains a number of different collections spanning prehistoric times till present day. It's not the kind of museum you visit in one day. I would advise checking out their web site and deciding what's of most interest",
          "The museum is situated right in the center of the city. It has all kinds of exhibitions, from technics, to musical instruments . So you better check before, which exhibitions are your selection",
          "Many great exhibits so a very good place to learn German history and culture. Everyone will find something interesting. Had to check my tote because someone thought it too large. Not enthusiastic about that.",
          "There really is something for everyone here; this museum has at least a little bit of everything. Artifacts from the Middle Ages, Renaissance paintings, a reconstructed chapel and an alpine house, old furniture, an impressive collection of old scientific instruments, and more.",
          "Friendly and helpful reception. Very assorted collection, with diferent thematic sections. You should go there with at least 2 or 3 hours to spend, cause it's very big. For architects or architecture enthusiasts the building itself is worth the visit! The museum's cafe is great",
          "We got to visit the Zepplin Field where Hitler had started to build a coloseum for his Nazi Party rallies were held. We took a bus inside the place, and it was very uncomfortable for me to be there. Our bus look like an ant inside. The building was never finished. This is",
          "This is the place to go to see Durer's artwork. There is much more. I liked the globe that did not show North or South America because these continents had not been discovered, the entire chapels on the ground floor, the carved altars, and the regional religious statues. I",
          "Lots of exhibits and collections depicting German art and culture shedding light on the history of Nuremberg. It is said to be Germany's largest museum of cultural history so best to get the audio guide and / or map out what you want to see and how to get to that exhibit.",
          "A sensational range of artefacts and works of art, all displayed in a well-designed and elegant way. We were short of time, so had to cram it all into half a day. You need at least twice that to do it justice.",
          "The first point to make about this museum in downtown Nuremburg is that it represents the most ungainly mixture of various buildings and collections of different kinds of art and historical objects that I've ever seen--and I've been to a LOT of museums. The second point is that",
          "We only had one day to visit this vast museum featuring all things German from prehistoric to present. Thus we could only see a small fraction of what they had on offer but what we did see, we spent the entire day and the time really flew. Among the highlights are paintings by",
          "Great range of exhibition material. Could have spent all day there. Friendly staff, nice cafe...go and be amazed",
          "If it has a history or relates to Germany, it's in here. Three very full floors full of Religious, Art and daily living artifacts. We took a break in the middle to watch the glockenspeil at the Frauenkirche.",
          "No matter what you're interested in--science, design, fashion, art--chances are you can explore it here for as long as time allows. And you'll probably leave wishing you could have stayed longer. At this extraordinary place, you can see Germany's impact, for good and ill, on",
          "I was here during the Xmas week, and this spacious museum was a wonderful place to spend a quiet afternoon. Plenty of medieval items, paintings, ceramics, many with English descriptions. Spent more time than I expected to.",
          "I've been to this museum before some 4 years ago and it keeps getting better as my visit this time proved. You could spend a couple of days here which most of us can't spare, so give it at least half a day. It's the best museum in Germany about Germany from pre-history to the",
          "This is not to miss: from art history, to primitive tools through revolutionary war instruments, to a collection of musical instruments dating back to medieval times, this museum was a hit with us!",
          "The collection is very large - we were there for three hours and still had to skip a lot of stuff. Also, because it is housed in various buildings from different ages the flow from one exhibition hall to the other is somewhat disrupted, often you have to double back. The map",
          "The museum is superb, very bright and spacious, it feels so uncluttered considering how much there is to see, allow plenty time, it's like a maze. Had to have a break in the basement coffee shop.",

          "A very LARGE museum! Contains some very valuable and interesting pieces going back through the various ages. Talking of ages you will need it to see everything. We spent 2 hours in the place and we only really touched the sides of it. Looks like it's a very useful resource for",
          "This is a wonderful display of German history and art. At 8 euros a person it is well worth the money. We spent most of one day just visiting the first floor. The second and third floor will have to wait for another visit.",
          "This museum had a wide range of artifacts dating back to prehistory and an excellent armoury display.Don't expect the British Museum or the Louvre here but it is very well laid out. Again, as with so many things in Nuremburg, most of the displays are accompanied by German only",
          "We were very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this museum. We had a few hours to kill after visiting the Christmas market, and since it was near the train station (and free on Wednesday nights), it fit the bill. And it might have been the best museum we saw in all of",
          "An excellent museum with something to appeal to all tastes. Very large - you need a long time to get round particularly (if you are like us) you find it very confusing. The map they provide is far from clear on how to get from one section to another and the signs are not",
          "A very big museum on the theme of German culture and history (and pre-history). Great artifacts well presented with English text as well as German. Do push open the doors that seem closed as there are hidden treasures in the enormous complex of older passageways and buildings.",
          "This museum, which had extremely helpful staff, was very confusing to figure out. It is very large and I could've spent at least a day or a day and a half looking all around it. The museum has quite an extensive history into the beauty and pride of all that is Germany.",
          "We liked the museum and the variety of exhibits. The only drawback for us was the layout was a bit confusing. Loved the porcelain and antique musical instrument exhibit.",
          "This museum is definitely worth a visit but allow lots of time to see all its treasures! We made two visits and still did not see it all.",
          "This a very large museum, close to the main rail station, which is an amalgam of a number of buildings and consists of a number of sections dealing with German culture and art through the centuries. Despite the map and signs we had great difficulty in finding what we looking for",
          "This is a really magnificent museum where the exhibits are beautifully displayed. We plan to revisit Nuremberg early next year just to do the museum justice. I could spend days in it!",
          "It is worth visiting this museum as it very much focuses on German art and culture. Therefore it is not one of those museums which holds international collections so you could be in any European capital. There is much to see and could be worth more than one visit if you want to",
          "For museum buffs, this is a must. However, the collections are so vast that it is hopeless trying to see them all, even over a couple of days. The prehistory section was one of the best we have seen. Loved the medieval art as well as collections of old scientific instruments.",
          "Ther German National Museum has a wide selection across multiple centuries - from Stone Age to 19th century - in a large building that is unique to walk in all by itself. Some displays have English translations, but not all. More disappointing, many displays show only an item",
          "It's difficult to see all for a short time. And you can take pictures here. I hope you enjoy paintings and more.",
          "This is an all day experience if you really want to see and experience it all. It is very much like the Smithsonian. Just when you think you have seen it all, you walk into another gallery and see more. Originally I wanted to see some of Albrecht Durer's works. Three hours",
          "Yes, it's an absolutely magnificent collection, but the problem lies in trying to navigate your way round it. I asked for a plan at the information desk, but for some reason they only gave me leaflets on the temporary exhibitions so I don't know if there is even a visitors' plan",
          "To take in the whole museum is an ambitious undertaking. As others said it is layed out across several buildings all connected, but not easy to find the section you might be looking for. Highlights were the Prehistoric section, the musical instruments section. It is worth",
          "This is a museum to watch and understand the German history and culture; there are also English guided tours.",
          "Although this is primarily a historical museum, and an outstandingly good one, it is also home to many great works of art, from the Middle Ages into the 17th century. The collection of German painting and sculpture -- Riemenschneider, Cranach, Duerer, Atldorfer, Bruyn, etc. --",
          "Had a day off from business trip and took a trip to the museum. On the main strip of Downtown Nuremberg the maps on the street and the unique building make it easy to find if you walk into town. During my visit they had a Albert Durer exhibit which was one of a kind. Albert",
          "It was my first museum visit in Germany and I had enjoyed it a lot, the best experience for me in Nuremberg. Nice and interesting medieval collection, don't miss out the armory and weapons section and as others pointed out, you can easily lose your way in the museum and find",
          "A big museum with lots of exhibits. Some are a little dated, but others are obviously recently renewed. The (temporary) exhibit on Crafts and Guilds was excellent as was the (permanent) exhibit about medieval cities.",
          "We left exhausted and knew we could never do this museum justice in a single visit. We spent five hours listening to the excellent English language audio guide and wandering through the fabulous museum with exhibits from pre and ancient history that were simply amazing -- to",
          "No mistake found while wanderig through the museum rooms. Magnificient; with a lot valuable historical findings. Perfectly organized (also English translations provided). I recommend!!",
          "This is a museum that takes your breath away by its sheer scale and scope. German/Germanic art and artefacts coming from over 2000 years are here, magnificently laid out, but overwhelming in number. We spent 2 hours, and barely cherry-picked the collection. You need to have a",
          "This museum was so much more than I expected. My friends and I spend about 3 hours in there and we did NOT see everything. Please budget several hours if you are really interested in art. You won't be sorry",
          "I've never been in a museum where, when I ask where something is, no one can tell me how to get to it, but will lead me through corridors, rooms, up and down staircases, etc. to reach it. Perhaps if you have half a day to wander around aimlessly, this is a good museum. I was",
          "I was only in Nuremberg for 1 afternoon and 1 night, so I went into the museum an hour and a half before closing thinking that this would be enough time. Boy, was I wrong. There is so much to see there that I could have easily burned at least 4 more hours in there. They have",
          "My husband and I made the mistake of only giving ourselves 1.5 hours to visit this museum. We had no idea how massive it was! It has something for everyone - prehistoric artifacts, religious relics, art, clothing, recreations of rural life in Germany, musical instruments,",
          "We went here for a special exhibit about Albrecht Duerer, but there is always plenty to see and do. The tour guides are excellent and are available, for a fee, in many languages. There are also audio guides, so you can enjoy the museum on your own. Exhibits range form the",
          "This museum is totally worth a stop if you love renaissance art and culture, as well as per-historic and medieval artifacts! While all the main exhibitions were in both German and English and beautifully displayed with historical significance. The side wing with music, fashion",
          "there are english language museumtours as well and the advantage is these tours are with less people. so if you speak german but would prefer more information with less people (and for 2 hours) I strongly recommend a tour guided by an american lady",
          "The German National Museum in Nurnberg has an extensive collection of art and artifacts spanning many centuries, almost all specifically linked to the German experience. There are paintings including a superb German Impressionist depiction of military drummers. There is armor",
          "We spent about 3 hours in this museum but you could really allot a full day if you enjoy these types of displays. As others have said, they have a HUGE collection that has artifacts from the stone age to the present day. They do have English audioguides but there aren't",
          "Again we were blown away by the sheer volume of information and exhibitions, but the lack of an English Audio guide made the visit drawn out and a bit of a drag. We left after viewing the first 2 wings out of the 4 wings available as it simply got too tiresome and long winded to",
          "I went to this museum for my partner. It's \u20ac6 each. You get a guide in English and they later made a tannic announcement about a guided tour in English. All coats andbags much be left in the lockers for a \u20ac1 fee. The museum is huge, and I found it difficult to find my way",
          "I heard that most of the displays do not have English descriptions, this is not true. In fact, they are very accommodating to the English speaker and many, if not most displays had English language descriptions. We enjoyed just about the entire museum, understanding the maps and",
          "We visited this museum in both 2006 and 2012, and a day should be spent at leisure at this museum, which has everything from stone age prehistory to modern day art--and everything in between. There is something for everyone here--armor and weapons, traditional country home",
          "The museum has been designed to give visitors and nationals alike an insight to the past. Well worth a visit.",
          "The museum itself is pretty nice, and it may well be, as it claims, the largest museum of cultural history within the German-speaking region, but you might find it a bit disappointing if what you love are paintings. We had the misfortune of arriving to Nuremberg a few days only",
          "Spent a lovely afternoon here last summer, when there was NOT a special exhibit going on. This makes for a very different experience: no lines at all, quiet almost deserted halls, a peaceful experience. Some areas are closed off until you ask a guard to unlock the elevator &",
          "The queues are often very long here and although easy to find the lack of sign posts could deter some people. The website for the museum is very good and should be checked before a visit so one can see what is going on.",
          "We attended the special exhibition of Albrecht Durer which was amazing especially as we got there early and avoided the queues. Went back in the afternoon to see the main galleries but were pretty tired by then.",
          "If your grasp of German is ok, go by all means to one of the free introductory tours at 10:30 or 15 hrs (see homepage). The tours are meant to give an overview over the collection, after them you may dive in deeper. This museums needs lots of time to cover, don't go there if you",

It was great to see these in person, although as always with these high profile, popular shows, hard to get close enough or spend any time with the detailed and small sketches. Although it was obviously pertinent to the theme of his early work, a",
          "There is a huge variety of items and artifacts to view here. There is a family ticket that will save money on entry. They have lockers near the entrance to put up bags for 1 Euro, and the money is returned when you retrieve your items. The oldest globe in the world is located",
          "Would definitely recommend going here - excellent collection. We especially enjoyed the furniture gallery. Quite large - we probably spent about 3 hours here. We pretty much had the place to ourselves.",
          "The time frame coverers in the museum is quiet large, so take some time if you want to explore all. The exhibits are presented well, I recommend to spend a crew short visits at this great hotel ...",
          "Like all of the German National Museums, this one has an outstanding collection. This one specilizes in art, musical instruments, clothing and some weaponry and armor. Of particular interest are the musical instrument and clothing halls, which hold examples that I've only seen",
          "If you are in Nurnberg go and see the Durer exhibit. It is amazing. The rest of the museum is icing on the cake.",
          "My husband and I absolutely loved this museum. He could spend hours just looking at all of the guns and militaria on display. The part that I loved the most was the scientific instruments and castle locks as well as the compasses/clocks/astronomy section. The layout of the",
          "The Albrecht Durer show is a once in a lifetime museum exhibition and shows work from Durer's early life, documenting and elaborating upon his artistic development, inspiration, journeyman experiences, and artistic exploration.",
          "The museum was sprawling and if I weren't as tired, I would've explored the entire museum. They had a wonderful exhibit of Albrecht D\u00fcrer's work which was just stunning. Definitely a must-see for anyone there. The Way of Human Rights outside the museum is also breathtaking.",
          "Passing through Nuremberg I had a few hours to spare and decided to pop into the Museum. An amazing place, a huge collection covering culture, art, archaelogy, history and memorabilia. There are more sections than you could possibly see on a single visit, so study the (free)",
          "This is a huge museum where you can spend a whole day if you like. The collections involves paintings, armour, design, furniture, textile, sculpture and a period from long b.c to present day. The building can be disorientating and I must confess that the map didn't help much.",
          "Enormous collection of early German art -- a few by Durer, the native son. The museum itself it a beautiful building. At the side of the museum is a courtyard dedicated to human rights.",
          "I am astonished at the 2 terrible reviews of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum! Anyone who cannot find something fascinating in that huge museum would likely not find anything of interest in ANY museum. That or the search was flawed. We drive an hour each way and visit several",
          "You have collections for all tastes, from musical instruments to medieval weapons and of course, paintings and art pieces from the medieval times. This museum is so huge that it would take half day to see everything with time. However if you just want to have an idea of the",
          "A lot of history well displayed. Liked the music section as well as the Durer collection",
          "The museum is located inside the Old City walls, it has an amazing unexpected collection of Cranachs, Duerers and Rembrandts, on the first floor there is a historic exhibiotion. Definitely recommended for art lovers and families.",
          "Absolutely massive, high quality collection. Featuring Durer's works, of course!",

          "Beautiful architecture! Don't miss the sacrament house sculpted by Adam Kraft. The incredible art survived the Reformation because families had donated these priceless items to preserve the memory of their loved ones.",
          "I went in the middle of the day mid-week and it wasn\u2019t crowded. The church is beautiful with lots to see. In particular, there was a manger scene surrounded by candles in sand that I really loved. What a special place!",
          "Like so many of the European Churches, it has it's own personality and character. Each beautiful in their own way.",
          "In the old town you also can see the \u201cSt. Lorenz\u201d or \u201cSt. Lawrence\u201d who is a church of the former free imperial city of Nuremberg. The church is dedicated to \u201cSaint Lawrence\u201d. But anyhow it is one of the most prominent churches of the Evangelical Lutherian Church in Bavaria.",
          "I am still amazed when I visit these churches. How did they build these places? You most definitely should take a peak. I had my 12 year old niece with me, and she was absolutely mesmerized.",
          "Nice place to see the architecture with quite a few small restaurants and coffee joints surrounding it.",

          "This was the first of the many churches that we visited in Nuremberg. Beautiful stained glass throughout. Small gift shop as you enter. I was so peaceful just to walk around and enjoy the wonderful architecture. It's almost amazing how much damage occurred during WWII and yet",
          "I was absolutely blown away by wall statues of saints, the 3-panel paintings at numerous alters, and other hanging and statuary art. I think there is a statue of Jesus near the central altar, pointing or making some very unique hand gesture. I took one look at that life-size",
          "The St Lorenz church is probably one of the largest churches in the old city of Nuremberg. It is quite a magnificent structure and has a large square outside. When I visited there was a small demonstration going on and there were also different charities engaging people to",
          "I don't know was it a coincidence or this a \"feature\", but during our visit there was life marvelous organ playing which makes the whole air of visit much enjoyable. In addition you can buy there reproductions of some of the stained glass pictures in a form of a sticky film, so",
          "Never a cathedral, St Lorenz is a parish church build by Nuremburg's citizens for its citizens. It became a Lutheran/Protestant church in 1525. As an aside, we heard from different guides how overnight different town population were 'converted' to either Catholicism or",
          "This is a beautiful church in heart of old town. Easily accessible by U-bahn. The entry is free, but there is a suggested donation counter as well. That's totally up to you, no one will push for it. The church is beautiful from inside, and has a pretty tall ceiling. Beautifully",
          "This is a beautiful old church with a magnificent and ornate exterior. It contains carved stone details, stained glass windows and elaborate doorways.",
          "Most famous for the Engels Gruss by Veit Sto\u00df that is suspended in the choir, the St Lorenz has a number of other works from the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance. It is also a splendidly-proportioned church that is not overrun by tourists and therefore has a peaceful",
          "Amazing and absolutely impressive building, with many interesting small or big details in and out of the church!",
          "This is a beautiful, historic, medieval church, conveniently located in the old town. Although badly damaged during WWII, St. Lorenz (St. Lawrence) has been beautifully restored. Completed in 1477, it\u2019s well known for its three organs and a long list of prominent organists.",
          "A totally stunning St. Lorenz beautiful inside and out. Take a stroll there is so much to see it\u2019s all amazing to see and read. A couple of great spots to light a candle \ud83d\udd6f You can stroll though on your own or take a private or group tour. Allow an hour to see everything.",
          "Stunning old church in the old town. Imposing from the outside with great architecture all around. Very lavish inside. Disappointing having to pay to go in",
          "The church is really old and interesting to visit is really easy to find since is in the center of the city, I think this is a must-see from the town. The only downside for some people can be the fact that to enter the church you have to pay a small fee (2 euros for adults, 5",
          "700 year old church with amazing art work. A two euro charge to enter but well worth it to see the stained glass windows alone",
          "This church is super impressive! The instant look of the front is overwhelming and looks incredible in the sun but also when it gets dark it turns really gothic looking which is very cool! Very old, many pieces of art to look at and a great town centre built around it. well",
          "Lorenz Kirche is a super old church with lots of art pieces that one can expect to find in a museum! I certainly didn't expect all the points of interest - the altars, the choirs, the paintings - yes, this church is an example of plurality! I was awestruck the first time I saw",
          "Whilst in Nuremberg we visited St Lorenz church - a beautiful Catholic Church Excellent architecture with some beautiful stained glass windows including a massive rose window",
          "This dates from 1477 and certainly worth a 30 minute stop to take in Regensburg's best church. It is quite large and impressive and has some beautiful details, especially along the side altars. Pretty stained glass windows.",
          "Catholic Church and we were fortunate to visit whilst an organ recital was happening. All very loud and dramatic . The church is very centrally located and worth a visit.",
          "The facade with sunshine in the late afternoon looks like a magic. The most beautiful church in the town.",
          "We had the great luck of being in N\u00fcrnberg on a very hot Friday and stepped inside this Church for a visit. Again we were lucky. The organ was playing. The atmosphere was great.",
          "A small donation allows you to see some masterpieces in a beautiful setting. The church has been beautifully restored. This peaceful church is a nice break from crowds!",
          "We visited St Lorenz St Sebald and the Frauenkirche and they are each truly lovely. Two Lutheran one Catholic. Not to be missed in Lorenzkirch are the pictures of the war damage and it\u2019s restoration , the beautiful and multiple statues of Mary (but you\u2019re in a Lutheran Church)",
          "Located on the pedestrian street that runs through the middle of the old town. Quite a bit of original art in here, that was saved by having it stored underground during the war. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "As a Christian I was never stopped from entering a place of worship.. except for today. It was a Sunday morning, following the beautiful bells of St Lorenz Church I made my way to the door. All of a sudden a lady stayed in the way speaking German and not letting me in! She",
          "We were treated to a \"concert\" here, since a children's choir just happened to be rehearsing for a concert. The church is beautiful, and houses many artworks, including the wood carving \"Angelic Salutation\" by Veit Stoss. The tabernacle is from the 15th century. During the week,",
          "There was a nice street market outside too. We really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend a visit to this church",
          "The St. Lorez Church or Lorenzkirche is a beautiful and very old church in Nuremberg. It is very easy to find. If you are coming out of the Nuremberg Main Train Station, just exit the main exit, cross the street and enter the walled Handwerkerhof. There is a small alley that",
          "I was extremely lucky, I got inside to visit and have a look at the gothic architecture, then, why not, also to say a little prayer. Out of the blue an organ started to play, the organist was exercising and polishing the next sundays music. Charming and moving, both for the",
          "The St Lorenz church is a huge gothic structure that is hard to miss. The outside is fascinating but do not miss going inside. If you are a history, art or architecture geek you will be thankful that you did: vaulted ceilings, stained glass windows and several very interesting",
          "There are about half a dozen churches within steps from one another, all are unique and worth a stop in.",
          "The 750 year old church is worth the tour. Even though the structure was nearly completely destroyed by allied bombers in WWII, it shows very well. The stain glass windows along with most of the relics were removed prior to the church being destroyed.",
          "Beautiful old gothic building from the 14th century. Huge sanctuary with lots of stained glass, statues, and much history. Very ornate and beautiful to view.",
          "Stop and take a moment to visite inside the church. Its very nice. Located in the middle of the action.",
          "I spent about 45 minutes walking through st. Lorenz church. The building is magnificent, the paintings are ornate and the atmosphere is calming. There is a meditation chapel where you can light candles and enjoy a quiet grateful few moments for your experience. Definitely",
          "Church is located in the main thoroughfare (Hauptmarkt) but we couldn\u2019t access the inside since it was closed",
          "It was amazing hot the church was rebuilt after the Allied bombing. The oldest art piece goes back to the 13th century and the stained glass are originals that survived the war.",
          "Wonderfully stade Kirche in Nuremberg. Could visit it many many times and still not take it all in. Engineering and beauty, history and presence.",
          "Ever see something and just go HOW? Massive and beautiful definitely a site that takes your breath away. Its a quick stop but memorable right in middle of the streets in Nuremburg.",
          "It's a nice place in Nuremberg, which is the centre of the city. The church is the symbol of history .",

          "There's an optional donation on entry, but if you give 2 euros you get a little map of the church, with some historical details given. The church itself is absolutely beautiful, and worth spending a bit of time wandering through.",
          "St Lorenz, a beautiful old 13th century gothic church in the centre of Altstadt Nuremberg. The detail in the exterior of the church is wonderful to look at & the interior is well worth the small donation you pay to enter. The church has a pipe organ which is one of the largest",

          "The church is freezing inside (even colder than outside) but the architecture is definitely worth the cold. Definitely worth the 2 euro entrance \"donation\".",
          "This place is beautiful inside and out. It's somewhat of a typical 10th century European church, but we'll worth your time.",
          "The Lorenzkirche is one of the most beautiful Gothic Churches in Europe. See inside the \"Englischer Gru\u00df\" , a masterpiece of the middle age art.",
          "We did not visit the interior of the church bit definitely a central monument in the old city of Nuremberg. Clean from outside and you can find some kiosks or entertainment people nearby.",
          "Wonderful architecture from the creator of this church which separates the city from other places in Germany. Very pleasant place where you can feel peace and positive vibrations. 2\u20ac is requested as entry fee but no one demands it. Worth to visit this place",
          "Loved the sand to leave messages with candies - attracted teenagers into church to be creative. Recommend for a welcome",

          "Awesome architecture and church. Has been in existence from 1400s became Lutheran in 1525. Small entrance fee to help pay for the upkeep - 5 euros for a family, 2 Euros per adult. Person there to answer questions and a small gift shop. Must see in the area.",
          "Another beautiful church in Nuremberg. On my way back to the train station I stopped by to have a look. I\u2019m so amazed at the workmanship of these German churches. It\u2019s amazing they were build hundreds and hundreds of years ago. I find a sense of tranquility while sitting in the",
          "Well worth the visit. Take some time to walk around inside. It is one of a few amazing churches in Nuremberg.",
          "We popped in the church whilst visiting the Christmas markets. Good location and very nice inside with some ornate side altars. The door is to the right of the front as you look at the building.",
          "One of the most beautiful churches i have ever seen. Located in the center of the old town in Nuremberg. Not to be missed of course. Didn't go inside though but will do it next time.",

          "As you visit the Old Town of Nurnberg sooner or later you end up in front of St. Lorenz (St. Laurence) church. So here are some of the facts: - built in the late 1400 - it is a Lutheran church - and it stands today as an impressive landmark in Nurnberg. - it was severely",
          "When you walk into this church it takes your breath away, the building is stunning and you can see how amazing it was how it was re built after the war",
          "The church as a monument is impressive, and we happened to be there, while an interesting historic presentation was given by a lady. This church is a must while in N\u00fcrnberg!",
          "A very imposing church in the centre of Nuremberg. Very much worth taking time to admire from the outside and inside. Also believe it was quite damaged by air raids during the war but restored very well.",
          "A visit to Nuremberg should include time touring the exterior of this church and the surrounding area. The city's history as the center of the Nazi government is also both interesting and compelling with the stark buildings built by the Nazi regime, many of which were not",
          "This is quite the site. Like many others throughout the region, but still impressive nonetheless. When we were here there was a trailer set up out front with politicians talking over loud microphones. This made for terrible photos since it was impossible to photograph the",
          "As the name indicated, the church is dedicated to Saint Lawrence. It was built in 1250, and has been an Evangelical Lutheran church since 1525. The church was severely damaged during World War II but restored afterwards. The facade is dominated by the two towers. Inside the",

          "This church is like the majesty of the Old City Plaza. It is exquisite and must see. The architectural features and carved stone details are amazing. We were shocked to learn the church had suffered damage in WWII bombings, but residents and benefactors, used the original stones",
          "Very nice church located in center of Nurnberg. Very nice architecture from outside as well from inside.",
          "St Lorenz is one of three very interesting churches, lots of ancient artwork to see inside and a very impressive building in itself.",
          "An awesome experience, even if you've been in a dozen European churches already; stunningly beautiful; be ready for the fact that cathedrals as old as this don't have restroom facilities.",
          "This church just stands out as such a beautiful piece of architecture. You should really study the huge facade on the front since there\u2019s all kinds of stories embedded in it. Suspended over the Altar is a beautiful wood carving of \u201cThe Annunciation\u201d which depicts when Mary was",

          "Really impressive church , huge in size and height, with old displays like the hanging Annunciation carving.",
          "amazing music in a wonderful spot! well worth checking the music program as you may just be as lucky as we were to see a Bach's mass sung in the way and timing it was written for",

          "Has history dating back to 13 th Century, but was largely destroyed by the Allied bombing in 1945, so significantly reconstructed. \u20ac2 entry. Check out the Rose Window.",
          "As we appriached St Lorenz Square we noted a banner on the church featuring the 500th Anniversary of the Protestant Reformation and Martin Luther. We then noted people gathering on the church steps. Soon a lovely bell concert began. These are the things that make our trip",
          "This is worth a look as it is a nice building, but I didn't think it was that spectacular and no more impressive or memorable than any other cathedral.",
          "So much of the modern history of Nuremburg is associated with WW II. Visiting this church gives another perspective on the city and better appreciate its history.",
          "For me, the most impressive is the inside structure of the numerous overlapping arches, stained glass and alter. There are more beautiful and ornate churches in the world but this is small and feels warm and welcoming, at least for me. Easily located within the castle walls.",
          "Despite war damage, the church is full of medieval monuments and carved wooden altarpieces, glass etc. Adam Kraft's sacrament tower is stunning. The exterior of the church is also rich in details.",
          "Built upon the foundations of a previous church in the 13th Century, St. Lorenz is the second of two great Romanesque churches in Nuremburg. (St. Sebald is the other.) Located south of the river and situated along the great bustling pedestrian street, it is famous for the",
          "Stopped here as part of a city tour and the guide briefed us on the main features inside. This is a protestant church but inside must be what it was like pre-reformation. The carvings are beautiful but the stain glass work puts York Minster in the shade. You can pay a",

          "The outside intricacies of St. Lorenz drew is in, and we\u2019re so glad we wandered through. It\u2019s 2\u20ac pp, which goes toward the continued restoration of the Church, and is every bit worth it. They have printed guides in every language that explain the significance of the beautiful",
          "St.Lorenz church was almost fully destroyed during the world war second but now you can see it as it was first. The place is calm and easily archived from old town. You can see the church from castle also.",
          "From other reviews you can obviously you can visit inside but I have to say we had no idea as the doors were closed the entire time we were there and noticed no one going in. What we did notice was a constant flow of old men sitting down on the front step so we speculated there",

          "We visited this Church on our first day and then we were around this magnificent piece of architecture multiple times next few days. I would say it is one of most beautiful church that i have seen and that goes without mentioning that it is equally impressive from inside. Great",
          "We were here on July 16, the last day that the Engels Gruss, the splendid 500-year old work by Veit Sto\u00df, was down for cleaning, an event that occurs every seven years and brings unusually large crowds into the church. We made a special day trip from Munich to see it. The",
          "The most beautiful church I've ever seen. They let you take pics inside and some of the stain glass inside shows the date on them I remember one form 1435 I think the date says. A lot of beautiful and very old paintings and carvings inside from hundreds of years ago. A must see",
          "Very nice cathedral with photos and samples of the destruction it had. Little store on the way out. People has to access through the right side door. Easy to find parking lot nearby",

          "This church was very easy to get to from our hotel. It is in the center of Nuremberg and we were able to go inside. As you come in you immediately get a feeling of how old this church really is. I walked all the way around and took several pictures inside. It was not that bright",
          "On a recent visit to Nuremberg, this was my second in as many years, we visited several historic sites, including St. Lorenzkirche (St. Lawrence Church), a medieval church of the former free Imperial City of Nuremberg. A portion of the church was completed sometime around 1400.",

          "Has to be on your list if visiting this beautiful city....the stained glass windows are amazing, such an impressive church..",

          "It is impossible to walk by this imposing structure and not be curious about what lies within. A small donation of a Euro or less is all that is asked for the pleasure of viewing the interior of the church. The structural elements alone are enough to fascinate you and then add",

          "This wad one of the few attractions open on our ine full day here so we were able to spend some time fully exploring this church. It is not as pretty as other churches in Europe or even in Germany but was beautiful anyway. Worth a look.",
          "This beautiful church has the largest organ installation of any Protestant church in Germany (165 stops and 12,156 pipes). We were lucky to stop by when an organ concert was in progress.",
          "From the outside its very beautiful, unfortunately we did not have time to venture inside but at night lit up it looks fabulous too",
          "Fedelissima ricostruzione dell'antica cattedrale gotica, ancora oggi si coglie la bellezza dell'originale. Il pavimento in legno \u00e9 particolare. Perfect reconstruction of ancient gothic cathedral. Still nowadays ypu can feel the beauty of the original architecture. Wooden floor",
          "Enjoyed visiting St Lorenz, but we love visiting churches whenever we travel. This is located in the heart of Old Town. Awesome structure but you can see that it has been rebuilt after the war, It seems that some updates are still occurring. The organ is amazing. The pews",

          "The building is beautiful with many elaborate artistic and architectural details. Pretty interesting to stand inside a 750 years old building in such great condition. Of course, there had to be a lot of reconstruction after WWII.",

          "Beautiful church. It was under some construction as are many churches in Europe. It is hard to imagine this church had been so severely destroyed during WWII and now is hard to tell where the destruction had been. If you are in Nuremberg, you should stop on to view this",
          "It is an impressive gothic church right in the middle of old Nuremburg. It is extremely ornate inside and some old photos show the damage of the bombing in WW11. Well worth some time out to see it.",

          "In a city that suffered so much destruction during WW II, it is not surprising that the church was bombed. However, look for the pictures in the back of the church to see the extent of the destruction. Then, you will be very impressed with the work that went into bringing it",

          "While most visitors are likely to be drawn to the Frauenkirke, because of its exterior beauty and location on the Hauptmarkt square, St. Lorenz's interior was much more impressive, in my opinion. It had an older, more gothic feel to it, with more statues, and art.",
          "Amazingly beautiful Gothic church built in the later part of the 1200's and early 1300's. The Annunciation, a large structure above the altar, is both striking and worth a stop to visit. So many churches in Nuremberg, St. Lorenz is quite impressive.",

          "Really beautiful church, and the bells played everyday. Better moment to take pictures is in the end of day",

          "After/during a long day exploring the wealth of historic and fascinating places that Nuremberg has to offer, we can often forget to take a few minutes to appreciate the silent gems that the city has to offer. Sitting quietly but boldly in the middle of the 'Altstadt' is St",

          "Not sure what else to say, this is a beautiful place. You see one large church/cathedral you see them all. It's still remarkable and beautiful.",
          "The church is worth a visit for its architecture and stained glass alone. It is easy to get to the area because it is a stop on the U-Bahn. Church is open most days and can be visited. the exception would be when a service is in progress.",
          "St. Lorenz [Lawrence] is one of the most impressive churches in the city of Nuremburg which was heavily bombed on January 2, 1945. It is located in a main shopping precinct however the modern buildings nearby are most tasteful in design and construction and are subservient to",
          "One of two very similar looking churches in the middle of town. I actually prefer this one as it is more original and 'old' and has more traditional features. There are photos showing the damage done in WW2 and that this church seems to have survived in an area of heavy damage,",
          "Nuremberg has many lovely churches but this is probably the nicest and because of its location you would struggle not to see it. Definitely worth taking a closer look if you are in the area.",
          "We found this church by accident and it is yet another church (Lutheran) in Europe, We were there for some time as it is a large church. Worth a visit if you have the time.",

          "This church - seemingly caught in the midst of the Reformation movement - Lutheran, but 'Catholic' in style - is a reminder of the histories behind the Protestant movement, and the Catholic origins of Western denominations. Very intricate and beautiful carvings highlight along",

          "We were at Christkindlmarkt and saw people going in and out of this church and decided to just peek in. I'm so glad we did. It's a beautiful old church and we really enjoyed seeing it decorated for the holidays. I especially loved the beautiful manger scene in the back of the",
          "This Church is a great masterpiece, it's worth visiting by all gothic style lovers and people who would like to see something new ;) Even though there are plenty of catholic churches around Europe, this one has a couple of curious pieces inside, so just go and see them with your",
          "Even if St. Lorenz Church isn't on your Nuremberg itinerary, it's well worth the few minutes is takes to locate, just up the hill from the main square. The interior is very impressive, but if you're lucky enough to be around an organ recital or concert, don't miss that",
          "It's super easy to wander inside this church, located right in the center of town. The history is rich in Nuremburg & it of course includes their churches, of which there are a few! The metal worked annunciation took 2 years to make & hangs over the choir area, the 7 stained",
          "Good view of a Gothic Middle age cathedral. Missed the organ, sure must be awesome to hear. I always leave a small donation at least. be aware of non-tourist times during services.",
          "This church originally built in the 1200's is still used for services today. It has a modern public address system but otherwise, it has remained the same. The church received damage during WW 2, but the restoration of this church and much of Nuremburg leaves one believing",
          "We had a local lady sit with us at a beer hall and tell us that this church was one of the best ones to go to. It has original art that wasn't destroyed in WW2. I've lived in Germany for a bit now and seen about a million churches (all gorgeous), but this was nice in that it",
          "The church is enormous. It is located in the historic part of town. The inside is very big. One admires the effort people several centuries ago put into the construction of the church.",
          "I am pretty sure there is an image of Santa Claus in one of the stain glass windows, but it was dark when we visited so it was hard to tell! Anyway, it's a great big traditional German Cathedral and worth a visit just to look up and soak in the middle age engineering that went",
          "very interesting example of Gothic style, well worth entering for a short visit as you stroll along one of the streets in the old city center to this platz",
          "We have been in many Gothic churches during our travels, but this one has such soaring elegant architecture we were left breathless. Light pours in from the many windows so, in spite of it`s size, St. Lorenz seems almost weightless. Suspended from the ceiling as one approaches",
          "We happened in on a practice session of the St. Lorenz church choir and orchestra while visiting Nuremberg. They were doing a Verdi concert that evening. IT WAS MAGNIFICENT listening to those voices and that orchestra reverberate in the church. Used Rick Steve's commentary as we",
          "I loved the wall that held the candles that you light. It was a modern piece of art in a very old church but fit. Interesting to see the pictures of what was left after the WW!! bombings.",
          "OK, so it's not the biggest Gothic church in Germany*, but it is beautiful. It's worth a visit just for the wood carvings within and the stone work (wee bit gruesome)on the facade. If I haven't mixed up my notes, one of the paintings to the left as you face the altar was done by",
          "We used Rick Steve's Germany book to get insight into the side altars and carvings. They were some of the most simplistic, yet representative and beautiful we have seen.",
          "Important, historic interesting, different but ultimately not as vast as many of the great churches of its day. Made an interesting distraction.",
          "The church was very large with so much detail inside and out. The stained glass windows, staircase and pillars were very beautiful.",
          "A truly beautiful church with wonderful stained glass and a fabulous nave with a group sculpture of the Annunciation and an impressive crucifix.",
          "one of the most impressive sculptures to me. The quiteness of this church is not easy to be gained due to the heaps of visitors, but it`s worthwile waiting.",
          "we ducked in here as i always love visiting these magnificent houses of God from the days of grandeur. though bombed out in WW2, the building has been and is still in the process of rebuilding. lovely stained glass--some new, some restored. when one views the \"before & after\"",
          "It was a lovely church to see and visit - typical German architecture and a peaceful place to be. I always like to visit the churches in the towns I visit",
          "Another stunning church in the heart of Nuremberg and a great place to contemplate the trials and tribulations of life! Highly recommended to all who wish enlightenment!",
          "Medieval church rebuilt after damage caused in WW II. Very interesting is a Star of David on a floor in front of the churches\u2019 altar, because church is on a place of burned synagogue.",
          "A big crowd all over the place but it gives a feeling of 'alive' cheerful city. The church is absolutely beautiful. I tried to take a good picture but as you can see in my photo... there are people everywhere. Anyway, this is a place worth spending time to experience the life of",
          "Beautiful church, well rebuilt after the war. A model of reconciliation. Wish that the original hadn't been destroyed.",
          "The plaza and shopping district around the church is wonderful, especially after dark when things are lit up. Walk from St. Lorenz north to the castle on the hill and pass all the big churches. Quite wonderful! Nuremberg is still relatively unspoiled by vast tourist throngs.",
          "This in the centre of town and well worth a visit. It has been restored very sensitively since WW2 damage. Many beautiful art works and a real spiritual feel in the church.",
          "It is a wonderful church in the center of a wonderful city. It has a huge organ with frequent concerts, only the best!",
          "The sheer scale of this building and the intricate details of the architecture makes this a must see. When you wander through the arched entrance you step into another time - it is truly spectacular.",
          "This church has a very active organ recital program. There are midday concerts at 12:15 on Thursdays that last for 30 minutes for the working crowd. Attendance at these can run upwards of 300 people! Admission is free with a suggested donation box. In addition there are",
          "Our hosts had a wedding of their nephew here when we visited. Massive church as you can imagine. Along the same lines as other European and English churches and right in the middle of the city.",
          "Excellent cathedral. They have pictures of what it looked like after World War II, which was very interesting.",
          "A wonderful and impressive Gothic church, full of medieval treasures, and not a sign of any kitsch anywhere. You can spend hours in here if you are interested in ecclesiastical art and stained glass.",
          "Love German churches. Many were ruined in WWII but got rebuilt. They are all amazing. This church like many others is worth a visit.",
          "What a wonderful church to visit. No charge to enter but a donation is greatly appreciated. Suggest you add this to your \"Things to do and see\".",
          "This late-medieval church, originally Catholic but Lutheran since 1525, is well worth visiting. The suggested contribution of 1 euro for the maintenance of the church is more than reasonable. Among the church's treasures one stands out: a wonderful Annunciation by Veit Stoss"

        "wiki": "Nuremberg ( NEWR-\u0259m-burg; German: N\u00fcrnberg [\u02c8n\u028f\u0281nb\u025b\u0281k] (listen); Bavarian: Niamberg; East Franconian: N\u00e4rrnberch or N\u00e4mberch, locally N\u00e4rmberch) is the second-largest city of the German federal state of Bavaria after its capital Munich, and its 511,628 (2016) inhabitants make it the 14th largest city in Germany. On the Pegnitz River (from its confluence with the Rednitz in F\u00fcrth onwards: Regnitz, a tributary of the River Main) and the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal, it lies in the Bavarian administrative region of Middle Franconia, and is the largest city and the unofficial capital of Franconia. Nuremberg forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring cities of F\u00fcrth, Erlangen and Schwabach with a total population of 798,867 (2018), while the larger Nuremberg Metropolitan Region has approximately 3.6 million inhabitants. The city lies about 170 kilometres (110 mi) north of Munich. It is the largest city in the East Franconian dialect area (colloquially: \"Franconian\"; German: Fr\u00e4nkisch), Nuremberg was one of the host cities of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nThere are many institutions of higher education in the city, including the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg). With 39,780 students in 2017, it is Bavaria's third-largest and Germany's 11th-largest university, with campuses in Erlangen and Nuremberg and a university hospital in Erlangen (Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen). Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg Georg Simon Ohm and Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg are also located within the city. Nuremberg Airport (Flughafen N\u00fcrnberg \u201cAlbrecht D\u00fcrer\u201c) is the second-busiest airport in Bavaria after Munich Airport, and the tenth-busiest airport in Germany.\nStaatstheater N\u00fcrnberg is one of the five Bavarian state theatres, showing operas, operettas, musicals, and ballets (main venue: Nuremberg Opera House), plays (main venue: Schauspielhaus N\u00fcrnberg), as well as concerts (main venue: Meistersingerhalle). Its orchestra, Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg, is Bavaria's second-largest opera orchestra after the Bavarian State Opera's Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich. Nuremberg is the birthplace of Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Johann Pachelbel.\nNuremberg was the site of major Nazi rallies, and it provided the site for the Nuremberg trials, which held to account many major Nazi officials.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe first documentary mention of the city, in 1050, mentions Nuremberg as the location of an Imperial castle between the East Franks and the Bavarian March of the Nordgau. From 1050 to 1571 the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade-routes. King Conrad III (reigning as King of Germany from 1138 to 1152) established the Burgraviate of Nuremberg, with the first burgraves coming from the Austrian House of Raab. With the extinction of their male line around 1190, the last Raabs count's son-in-law, Frederick I from the House of Hohenzollern, inherited the burgraviate in 1192.\nFrom the late 12th century to the Interregnum (1254\u201373), however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Hohenstaufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor (German: Reichsschulthei\u00df) from 1173/74. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city.\n \nNuremberg is often referred to as the \"unofficial capital\" of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly because the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg played an important role in the administration of the empire. The increasing demands of the Imperial court and the increasing importance of the city attracted increased trade and commerce in Nuremberg. In 1219 Emperor Frederick II granted the Gro\u00dfen Freiheitsbrief ('Great Letter of Freedom'), including town rights, Imperial immediacy (Reichsfreiheit), the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy - almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves. Nuremberg soon became, with Augsburg, one of the two great trade-centers on the route from Italy to Northern Europe.\nIn 1298 the Jews of the town were falsely accused of having desecrated the host, and 698 of them were killed in one of the many Rintfleisch massacres. Behind the massacre of 1298 was also the desire to combine the northern and southern parts of the city, which were divided by the Pegnitz. The Jews of the German lands suffered many massacres during the plague pandemic of the mid-14th century.\nIn 1349 Nuremberg's Jews suffered a pogrom. They were burned at the stake or expelled, and a marketplace was built over the former Jewish quarter. The plague returned to the city in 1405, 1435, 1437, 1482, 1494, 1520 and 1534.\n\nThe largest growth of Nuremberg occurred in the 14th century. Charles IV's Golden Bull of 1356, naming Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet, made Nuremberg one of the three most important cities of the Empire. Charles was the patron of the Frauenkirche, built between 1352 and 1362 (the architect was likely Peter Parler), where the Imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg. The royal and Imperial connection grew stronger in 1423 when the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg granted the Imperial regalia to be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 1796, when the advance of French troops required their removal to Regensburg and thence to Vienna.In 1349 the members of the guilds unsuccessfully rebelled against the patricians in a Handwerkeraufstand ('Craftsmen's Uprising'), supported by merchants and some by councillors, leading to a ban on any self-organisation of the artisans in the city, abolishing the guilds that were customary elsewhere in Europe; the unions were then dissolved, and the oligarchs remained in power while Nuremberg was a free city (until the early-19th century). Charles IV conferred upon the city the right to conclude alliances independently, thereby placing it upon a politically equal footing with the princes of the Empire. Frequent fights took place with the burgraves - without, however, inflicting lasting damage upon the city. After fire destroyed the castle in 1420 during a feud between Frederick IV (from 1417 Margrave of Brandenburg) and the duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, the city purchased the ruins and the forest belonging to the castle (1427), resulting in the city's total sovereignty within its borders.\nThrough these and other acquisitions the city accumulated considerable territory. The Hussite Wars (1419-1434), a recurrence of the Black Death in 1437, and the First Margrave War (1449-1450) led to a severe fall in population in the mid-15th century. Siding with Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria-Munich, in the Landshut War of Succession of 1503-1505 led the city to gain substantial territory, resulting in lands of 25 sq mi (64.7 km2), making it one of the largest Imperial cities.During the Middle Ages, Nuremberg fostered a rich, varied, and influential literary culture.\n\n\n=== Early modern age ===\n\nThe cultural flowering of Nuremberg, in the 15th and 16th centuries, made it the centre of the German Renaissance. In 1525, Nuremberg accepted the Protestant Reformation, and in 1532, the Nuremberg Religious Peace was signed there, preventing war between Protestants and Catholics for 15 years. During the 1552 revolution against Charles V, Nuremberg tried to purchase its neutrality, but the city was attacked without a declaration of war and was forced into a disadvantageous peace. At the Peace of Augsburg, the possessions of the Protestants were confirmed by the Emperor, their religious privileges extended and their independence from the Bishop of Bamberg affirmed, while the 1520s' secularisation of the monasteries was also approved. Families like the Tucher, Imhoff or Haller run trading businesses across Europe, similar to the Fugger and Welser families from Augsburg, although on a slightly smaller scale. \n\nThe state of affairs in the early 16th century, increased trade routes elsewhere and the ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade. During the Thirty Years' War, frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and League soldiers, the financial costs of the war and the cessation of trade caused irreparable damage to the city and a near-halving of the population. In 1632, the city, occupied by the forces of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, was besieged by the army of Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein. The city declined after the war and recovered its importance only in the 19th century, when it grew as an industrial centre. Even after the Thirty Years' War, however, there was a late flowering of architecture and culture \u2013 secular Baroque architecture is exemplified in the layout of the civic gardens built outside the city walls, and in the Protestant city's rebuilding of St. Egidien church, destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century, considered a significant contribution to the baroque church architecture of Middle Franconia.After the Thirty Years' War, Nuremberg attempted to remain detached from external affairs, but contributions were demanded for the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War and restrictions of imports and exports deprived the city of many markets for its manufactures. The Bavarian elector, Charles Theodore, appropriated part of the land obtained by the city during the Landshut War of Succession, to which Bavaria had maintained its claim; Prussia also claimed part of the territory. Realising its weakness, the city asked to be incorporated into Prussia but Frederick William II refused, fearing to offend Austria, Russia and France. At the Imperial diet in 1803, the independence of Nuremberg was affirmed, but on the signing of the Confederation of the Rhine on 12 July 1806, it was agreed to hand the city over to Bavaria from 8 September, with Bavaria guaranteeing the amortisation of the city's 12.5 million guilder public debt.\n\n\n=== After the Napoleonic Wars ===\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the city's trade and commerce revived; the skill of its inhabitants together with its favourable situation soon made the city prosperous, particularly after its public debt had been acknowledged as a part of the Bavarian national debt. Having been incorporated into a Catholic country, the city was compelled to refrain from further discrimination against Catholics, who had been excluded from the rights of citizenship. Catholic services had been celebrated in the city by the priests of the Teutonic Order, often under great difficulties. After their possessions had been confiscated by the Bavarian government in 1806, they were given the Frauenkirche on the Market in 1809; in 1810 the first Catholic parish was established, which in 1818 numbered 1,010 souls.In 1817, the city was incorporated into the district of Rezatkreis (named for the river Franconian Rezat), which was renamed to Middle Franconia (German: Mittelfranken) on 1 January 1838. The first German railway, the Bavarian Ludwigsbahn, from Nuremberg to nearby F\u00fcrth, was opened in 1835. The establishment of railways and the incorporation of Bavaria into Zollverein (the 19th-century German Customs Union), commerce and industry opened the way to greater prosperity. In 1852, there were 53,638 inhabitants: 46,441 Protestants and 6,616 Catholics. It subsequently grew to become the more important industrial city of Southern Germany, one of the most prosperous towns of southern Germany, but after the Austro-Prussian War it was given to the Prussia as part of their telegraph stations they had to give up. In 1905, its population, including several incorporated suburbs, was 291,351: 86,943 Catholics, 196,913 Protestants, 3,738 Jews and 3,766 members of other creeds.\n\n\n=== Nazi era ===\n\nNuremberg held great significance during the Nazi Germany era. Because of the city's relevance to the Holy Roman Empire and its position in the centre of Germany, the Nazi Party chose the city to be the site of huge Nazi Party conventions \u2014 the Nuremberg rallies. The rallies were held in 1927, 1929 and annually from  1933 through 1938. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 the Nuremberg rallies became huge Nazi propaganda events, a centre of Nazi ideals. The 1934 rally was filmed by Leni Riefenstahl, and made into a propaganda film called Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will).\nAt the 1935 rally, Hitler specifically ordered the Reichstag to convene at Nuremberg to pass the Nuremberg Laws which revoked German citizenship for all Jews and other non-Aryans. A number of premises were constructed solely for these assemblies, some of which were not finished. Today many examples of Nazi architecture can still be seen in the city. The city was also the home of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher, the publisher of Der St\u00fcrmer.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Nuremberg was the headquarters of Wehrkreis (military district) XIII, and an important site for military production, including aircraft, submarines and tank engines. A subcamp of Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp was located here, and extensively used slave labour. The city was severely damaged in Allied strategic bombing from 1943 to 1945. On 29 March 1944, the RAF endured its heaviest losses in the bombing campaign of Germany. Out of more than 700 planes participating, 106 were shot down or crash-landed on the way home to their bases, and more than 700 men were missing, as many as 545 of them dead. More than 160 became prisoners of war.On 2 January 1945, the medieval city centre was systematically bombed by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Army Air Forces and about ninety percent of it was destroyed in only one hour, with 1,800 residents killed and roughly 100,000 displaced. In February 1945, additional attacks followed. In total, about 6,000 Nuremberg residents are estimated to have been killed in air raids.\nNuremberg was a heavily fortified city that was captured in a fierce battle lasting from 17 to 21 April 1945 by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, 42nd Infantry Division and 45th Infantry Division, which fought house-to-house and street-by-street against determined German resistance, causing further urban devastation to the already bombed and shelled buildings. Despite this intense degree of destruction, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent restored to its pre-war appearance, including the reconstruction of some of its medieval buildings. Much of this reconstructive work and conservation was done by the organisation 'Old Town Friends Nuremberg'. However, over half of the historic look of the center, and especially the northeastern half of the old Imperial Free City was not restored.\n\n\n=== Nuremberg trials ===\n\nBetween 1945 and 1946, German officials involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity were brought before an international tribunal in the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union had wanted these trials to take place in Berlin. However, Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trials for specific reasons:\n\nThe city had been the location of the Nazi Party's Nuremberg rallies and the laws stripping Jews of their citizenship were passed there. There was symbolic value in making it the place of Nazi demise.\nThe Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few that had remained largely intact despite extensive Allied bombing of Germany). The already large courtroom was reasonably easily expanded by the removal of the wall at the end opposite the bench, thereby incorporating the adjoining room. A large prison was also part of the complex.\nAs a compromise, it was agreed that Berlin would become the permanent seat of the International Military Tribunal and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg. Due to the Cold War, subsequent trials never took place.Following the trials, in October 1946, several prominent German Nazi politicians and military leaders were executed in Nuremberg.\nThe same courtroom in Nuremberg was the venue of the Nuremberg Military Tribunals, organized by the United States as occupying power in the area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSeveral old villages now belong to the city, for example Grossgr\u00fcndlach, Kraftshof, Thon, and Neunhof in the north-west; Ziegelstein in the northeast, Altenfurt and Fischbach in the south-east; and Katzwang, Kornburg in the south. Langwasser is a modern suburb.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNuremberg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) with a certain humid continental influence (Dfb), categorized in the latter by the 0 \u00b0C isotherm. The city's climate is influenced by its inland position and higher altitude. Winters are changeable, with either mild or cold weather: the average temperature is around \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) to 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F), while summers are generally warm, mostly around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the afternoon. Precipitation is evenly spread throughout the year, although February and April tend to be a bit drier whereas July tends to have more rainfall.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNuremberg has been a destination for immigrants. 39.5% of the residents had an immigrant background in 2010 (counted with MigraPro).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nNuremberg for many people is still associated with its traditional gingerbread (Lebkuchen) products, sausages, and handmade toys. Pocket watches \u2014 Nuremberg eggs \u2014 were made here in the 16th century by Peter Henlein. Only one of the districts in the 1797-1801 sample was early industrial; the economic structure of the region around Nuremberg was dominated by metal and glass manufacturing, reflected by a share of nearly 50% handicrafts and workers. In the 19th century Nuremberg became the \"industrial heart\" of Bavaria with companies such as Siemens and MAN establishing a strong base in the city.  Nuremberg is still an important industrial centre with a strong standing in the markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Items manufactured in the area include electrical equipment, mechanical and optical products, motor vehicles, writing and drawing paraphernalia, stationery products and printed materials.\nThe city is also strong in the fields of automation, energy and medical technology. Siemens is still the largest industrial employer in the Nuremberg region but a good third of German market research agencies are also located in the city. The Nuremberg International Toy Fair is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nNuremberg is Bavaria\u2019s second largest city after Munich, and a popular tourist destination for foreigners and Germans alike. It was a leading city 500 years ago, but 90% of the town was destroyed in 1945 during the war. After World War II, many medieval-style areas of the town were rebuilt.\n\n\n===== Attractions =====\nBeyond its main attractions of the Imperial Castle, St. Lorenz Church, and Nazi Trial grounds, there are 54 different museums for arts and culture, history, science and technology, family and children, and more niche categories, where visitors can see the world's oldest globe (built in 1492), a 500-year-old Madonna, and Renaissance-era German art. There are several types of tours offered in the city, including historic tours, those that are Nazi-focused, underground and night tours, walking tours, sightseeing buses, self guided tours, and an old town tour on a mini train. Nuremberg also offers several parks and green areas, as well as indoor activities such as bowling, rock wall climbing, escape rooms, cart racing, and mini golf, theaters and cinemas, pools and thermal spas. There are also six nearby amusement parks. The city's tourism board sells the Nurnberg Card which allows for free use of public transportation and free entry to all museums and attractions in Nuremberg for a two-day period.\n\n\n===== Culinary Tourism =====\nNuremberg is also a destination for food lovers. Culinary tourists can taste the city's famous lebkuchen, gingerbread, local beer, and N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrstchen, or Nuremberg sausages. There are hundreds of restaurants for all tastes, including traditional franconian restaurants and beer gardens. Also offers 17 vegan and vegetarian restaurants, seven fully organic restaurants. Nuremberg also boasts a two Michelin Star rated restaurant, Essigbr\u00e4tlein.\n\n\n===== Pedestrian zones =====\nLike many European cities, Nuremberg offers a pedestrian-only zone covering a large portion of the old town, which is a main destination for shopping and specialty retail, including year-round Christmas stores where tourists and locals alike can purchase Christmas ornaments, gifts, decorations, and additions to their toy Christmas villages. The Craftsmen's Courtyard, or Handwerkerhof, is another tourist shopping destination in the style of a medieval village. It houses several local family-run businesses which sell handcrafted items from glass, wood, leather, pottery, and precious metals. The Handwerkerhof is also home to traditional German restaurants and beer gardens.The Pedestrian zones of Nuremberg host festivals and markets throughout the year, most well known being Christkindlesmarkt, Germany's largest Christmas market and the gingerbread capital of the world. Visitors to the Christmas market can peruse the hundreds of stalls and purchase local wood crafts, nutcrackers, smokers, and prune people, while sampling Christmas sweets and traditional gluhwein.\n\n\n===== Hospitality =====\nIn 2017, Nuremberg saw a total of 3.3 million overnight stays, a record for the town, and is expected to have surpassed that in 2018, with more growth in tourism anticipated in the coming years. There are over 175 registered places of accommodation in Nuremberg, ranging from hostels to luxury hotels, bed and breakfasts, to multi-hundred room properties. As of 19 April 2019, Nuremberg had 306 AirBnB listings.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nNuremberg was an early centre of humanism, science, printing, and mechanical invention. The city contributed much to the science of astronomy. In 1471 Johannes Mueller of K\u00f6nigsberg (Bavaria), later called Regiomontanus, built an astronomical observatory in Nuremberg and published many important astronomical charts.\nIn 1515, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, a native of Nuremberg, created woodcuts of the first maps of the stars of the northern and southern hemispheres, producing the first printed star charts, which had been ordered by Johannes Stabius. Around 1515 D\u00fcrer also published the \"Stabiussche Weltkarte\", the first perspective drawing of the terrestrial globe.Printers and publishers have a long history in Nuremberg. Many of these publishers worked with well-known artists of the day to produce books that could also be considered works of art. In 1470 Anton Koberger opened Europe's first print shop in Nuremberg. In 1493, he published the Nuremberg Chronicles, also known as the World Chronicles (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated history of the world from the creation to the present day.

          "Dolphinarium like this in Nuremberg should be banned. 7 dolphins in aquarium so small that they can't swim straight. How can people enjoy this? The same problem with big cats. Zoo is beautiful but these two things killed the experience for me.",
          "Some parts of the zoo were closed thus they should have reduced the ticket price, otherwise it was fun out there.",
          "Nice Zoo, embedded in a vast Garden like Park. Plenty of animals and attractions...",

          "Amazing place. But be careful with your camera while going into the butterfly zone because it will fog the lens for at least 5 - 7 min. Don't try to change the lens inside the butterfly zone it will fog up the sensor too.",
          "Had such a lovely day! A must-visit attraction!",
          "Great place to take the family.  The zoo is wheelchair accessible.  There are many animals to see.  You can easily spend the whole day here.  The zoo also has shows for the some of the animals.  If you have children there are several areas \u2026",
          "I visited the Zoo on Sunday, it was crowded. Ticket price is quite high for a zoo but it worth money. This is a nice place for animals with very natural environment. \nA very special and interesting dolphin show making me so excited. I'm sure that children love it.",
          "Very beautiful place, I recommend.",
          "Such a Great experience for the whole family to enjoy. The kiddos really had a blast, surprised they lasted pretty long with all that walking. Parking is not the greatest, so finding a good spot is always a bummer. But overall it's still worth it going there.",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful quiet place in Nuremberg with many animals. What I liked most is that most of the animals are kept well with lots of free air to breathe. I am giving it a star less because animals like panda are suffering there in summer with heat and they look unhealthy and unhappy.",
          "Zoo is good and big with eating facilities inside.. we liked the bretzel shop just outside the zoo.\nYou can rent a cart for your easy carrying of bada and kids.. we bought one too.. but felt it could be overhead as we had one small \u2026",
          "The zoo was a very interesting activity. A few hundred species are kept there. It is an area of extreme natural beauty and it takes about 4 hours to see everything. The adult ticket is 16 Euros, for teenagers it's 12 Euros and for children 7.70 Euros.",

          "This is a really nice zoo, with some special species, like dolphins and manatees. The zoo is really green, just like a forest. Ideal for families. If you want to visit it, prepare for a long walk, at least 12 km, because the zoo is huge. :)",

          "Very good sorted, designed for animals and the people also. Animals seems in a very condition except they are in captivity. One can see animals easily and closely.  Watch the feeding times. One can easliy arrange whole shows during a day trip. One can find food, drink and etc. for kids in the zoo with a reasonable prices.",
          "I feel so bad for the lions and tigers that they have to live their lives in that small cages! They looked very unhappy and were screaming around. Think about that. You better let them back to their natural habitat.",

          "Zoo is absolutely awesome. Dolphins show is mesmerizing. Area is pretty huge, so you will nedd couple of hours to explore. Toilets everywhere, free parking is nice. But negative for me is that every legends in whole zoo are only in german language. Two language (german, english) would be better for visitors from rest of Europe.",
          "You can watch all animals comfortably walking with your children. It is hard to parking a vehicle on sunny day. Day ticket is expensive but annual ticket is cheap.",
          "The zoo is well maintained and clean. The animals are no doubt being taken care of and are healthy. The directions and signs are sufficient enough to help people along with the map provided with the purchase of ticket. The only reason I \u2026",

          "Amazing place. Lots of history and just fun displays. Very cool to check out! Not a must see, but it's awesome if you have an hour or 2 to kill! You won't regret it, that's for sure!",
          "I didn't have much nostalgia for the toys here since they were all European, mostly German in origin. However the old tin toys, especially all the different forms of transportation (Zeppelins, gondolas, streetcars, etc) and the model train set-up were enough to keep my interest.",

          "There are several floors to explore, make sure to get the audio tour as it adds a lot to the tour. We went on a weekday and it wasn't crowed at all, very nice little museum, brought back a lot of memories.",
          "It was so interesting how toys developed and as times changed what was important to the kids. A good and learning experience for parents and children.",
          "A delightful surprise. You would be missing out on a lot of history and information if you do not get the audioguide(1 euro) the history of Nuremberg's toy making and the really old toys were a highlight. As well as the doll houses which were to teach young girls how to keep",
          "Wonderful museum. Has several floors which are all worthwhile checking out. And it's not just for children. It really takes you thru the decades of toys. There is also a caf\u00e9 and playing area outside, along with a working train set...",

          "This is one of the museums I loved and I am not a museum person! Absolutely amazing how toys can talk about the history and development of the humanity and how the reflect the lifestile of each era. You would not believe how elaborate, detailed and smart some of the older toys",
          "For a toy museum, you'd think there would be a lot of interactive displays, but unfortunately they're missing. It was interesting to the history of toys and how they have developed over the years mind but it did become a little bit repetitive and rather boring. The rooms seem",

          "Interesting Museum and collection but can get a bit boring, we looked around the whole thing to kill an afternoon and it only took an hour or so. If you like old toys it would be good, but for us, mostly boring!",
          "A nice place to see the collection of different toys. Though we were expecting bigger amount of modern toys - well, I mean, from 15-20 years ago. If you have a fear of dolls, be careful - a significant part of the collection is dedicated to dolls :D We liked, though. Good",

          "The relevant part of this museum for my wife and I was when toys became manufactured from the 40's. That display of 40,50,60,70,80,90s era toys was like a story of our lives. The museum is easy to cover in a few hours and is a great bad weather day or any day activity. the",
          "The Spielzeugmuseum is a magical little museum: four floors of a wide range of toys from the last 200 years or so. The museum is very well organized: categorically and visually. The overall experience was very positive, and it is so much fun stepping back into your childhood",

          "Coming from Eastern Europe, seeing toys that we got in the '90s being displayed as '70s or '80s toy was in itself an emotional journey, reminding me of sacrifices our parents had to live through in Ceausescu's era and early Iliescu's. But seing expositions such as \"nazi toys\" or",
          "We came here as a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children aged 11 and 8). The cost of the ticket was reasonable and also enabled us to enter certain other museums in the same day for a slightly higher price. The collection is spread over several floors and there are either stairs",
          "A museum with difference and quite interesting for grown - ups too! Much larger than we expected and an enormous selection of toys through the ages. There is also small cafe which was very pleasant and a children's outside play area. On the top floor is also a children's hands-",

          "This museum has some amazing old toys in beautiful condition. Some interactivity for young children in the museum and on the top floor there is a supervised toy/play area with a vast array of toys and games for children to play with. You can also do craft for a fee.",
          "It's just okay, there's not enough social context given around the toys so it can become just loads of toys in one place but if the context was there to them all it would be much better because when it is it's fascinating.",

          "Was interesting to see how toys stay the same over time. The dollhouses were quite impressive because of the amount of work that must have gone into them. A temporary exhibit on wwii with children's toys was fascinating, if sad.",

          "For 10 Euros, it was fun to see the toys of old. Most interesting to me were the toys of the Hitler era and post destruction Germany. I wish there was more from this era shown. The toy shop at the end was small and disappointing if you had hoped to purchase anything.",

          "What a blast from the past! Everyone who had a first-world childhood must surely be able to relate to at least one of the displays here, whether they HAD one of the toys or WANTED it. Plenty to see and, when you get as far as the playroom upstairs, plenty to do as well.",
          "A fun experience even if you're not a kid. Very interesting walk through a history of toys. Extensive, at times odd toys. I just wish the gift shop had more options to buy. The miniature houses and the detail were exquisite. I wish I had a real kitchen like some of the miniature",
          "It is a fantastic museum. You should see the train station. There are tousands of trains. Every hour it is running. Must be seen. Nuremberg is famous with its toy trains. Because of that this miseum should not be miss.",

          "Got to the museum less than an hour to closing so we got a discount on admission. We didn't have time to linger, but saw most everything in the 4-story structure. It has everything from childhood friends like Barbie and He-Man to rare old treasures. Full rooms for toy soldiers",
          "The collection is great a the staff friendly, I even found some toys I used to play with at the end of the exibition. It should be a bit more interactive. They have a playeoom for children on the last floor, and a very cool playground outside for those who come with their",

          "Toy Museum is a misnomer. The \"miniature\" houses built and furnished for the children of the wealthy have to be seen to be believed. The detail exceeds your imagination, down to every copper pot and pewter plate in the kitchens. A must see!",
          "We ducked into the Spielzeugmuseum when it started raining. The price was reasonable. Audio tours are available, but the self-guided tour was still interesting. Be sure to pay attention to the optical illusions in the stairwells.",
          "After seeing so many wonderful buildings, it was nice to take a quick trip back in time with toys. The layout is a little confusing, but it is enjoyable to turn a corner and find another little display. Although we didn't have children with us, I'm sure the top floor",
          "It was nice to see how toys improved from the stone-age to the XXI. century. This 4 or 5 floor museum is a good choice not only for children, but for adults too. And you can't imagine how big it is, so don't be suprised if you go in and will come out after just 2 hours ;)",
          "Nice place for the kids to spend some indoor time. Very organised with different floors exhibiting different types of toys. Some interactive exhibits to engage the kids. The top floor was a great idea with games for the kids to enjoy.",

          "As far as I'm concerned this is a \"Must See\". There are 3 floors of wonderfully designed toys dating back to the 11th century...maybe further. Don't be deceived by the first floor. The amazing things are on the 2nd floor. Dolls houses like you could never imagine. The 3rd",
          "Nice overall museum. Small child enjoyed it, especially the play area. Most write ups are in German only. Only disappointment was model train wasn't running. Can get thru in under an hour if in a rush.",
          "As a huge history fan I enjoyed this museum. I must say that my kids did not seem to be interested by this site when we were there. However, I saw other kids around that seemed to enjoy this museum.",
          "Had 3 generations going to the museum. We all had a great time. There are very old toys there to see. Lots of dolls, doll houses, cars, tea sets, trains, tin figures ect. The museum goes over several floors with lots to see. They have one big train set build of the Omaha train",
          "Very big collection of toys truelly recomended for children and adults, playing area inside and out side of the museum, the audioguide is good. The museum shop is a bit dissapointing not a lot to offer.",
          "Layout a little confusing but takes you back to your childhood. The ticket desk is combined with the souvenirs and can get busy.",
          "We saw quite a collection of toys from around the world. We had no idea that we'd see toys from our own childhood. It was fun and a great way to spend an hour or so. The train set is amazing with all the buildings and details. There was an area set up where children could play",
          "After a long day at a trade fair, we decided to stop in at this attraction, but only about 1/2 before closing time. The lady at the ticket window was very kind and allowed us in at a discount (we did not request the discount, it was offered.) The attraction is very nice -",
          "This place is just fun, Walking around the museum was more than interesting. There were toys there that just bring one back to their own childhood. Certainly worth spending and hour or two.",
          "Lots of antique dolls. Cool train set up upstairs. Top floor has fun games for the kids to play. Explanations all in German.",
          "Well worth a visit to see this place and imagine how it was in the 1930's. A must for history lovers but I could image it to be of little interest to someone if not.",
          "A very nice collection of mainly german produced toys from the 17th century untill the moderm times. The highlight of the exhibition is the giant railway model on the 3rd floor, which, unfortunately, operates once a month",
          "I used the address provided and it brought me directly to a parking garage! How lucky. The museum offered a 5 museum family pass for \u20ac13 so we bought that and also visited the industrial museum. It started off a little slow for my five year old. However, on each floor there",
          "We went to this museum thinking just for kids, boy we were wrong! It was so much fun saw things from when I was a child, saw so many fun things, the train set up was very nice upstairs, it had elevators so easy to get around, just a nice way to spend an hour or two.",
          "The toy Museum of Nuremberg is an interesting place for young children and especially their parents. It has 4 floors devided to different topics (mechanical toys, girl's kitchens etc..) with description in German and English. on the last floor the children have the possibility",
          "Nuremberg Toy Museum is just in the corner of the main market square in the old town. It is a delightful place for children to play, also a nice place for adult to appreciate the beautiful crafted toys through the history and culture. So many toys are displaced in three floors.",
          "I really enjoyed seeing all of the toys. I particularly liked the ancient toys - the modern ones held less interest for me. Oh, the dollhouses were fascinating as they were usable by the girls who owned them as a means to teach them about keeping house. The miniatures in them",
          "This is a cute little museum. There are a few hands on things to play with throughout but some really neat old dollhouses, dolls, trains, etc. But really my kids LOVED the top floor--tons of hands on games, crafts, toys to play with. Definitely recommend if you need some",
          "It is a must see if you go to Nuremberg. The ticket is not costly at all. They even have a games room where kids get to play a bit after an hour of walking.",
          "After we finally found the Nuremberg Toy Museum, it was well worth the ticket price to see. We also got the audio guides which really helped. Nuremberg has a history of making toys and the museum has thousands of toys on display. We recommend going to see the museum.",
          "You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this museum of toys. Great collection of old through newer types of toys, wonderful installations and presentation.",
          "The Nuremberg Toy Museum was a nice respite from the market crowds. Nostalgic and charming displays of antique toys. Children and adults alike may find it interesting. Mechanical/tin toys, train sets and doll houses are the most interesting exhibits.",
          "What a wonderful city,it has lots of museum's including the toy one .It is very interesting but does become boring as you move through the building. The early toys are great with the details but not much interaction is allowed. The later toys are okay but nothing special. Is",
          "We had a fantastic morning, kids (3&4yo) loved playing on the top floor. We did too. It is a great place for the kids to have some time for themselves amid our sightseeing, so we are planning to go back again! There is a small play area for the kids on each level, which gave us",
          "I was disappointed by this museum. Being a toy museum, I expected it to be more entertaining and with some hands on experiences. Instead, it just displays toys from various centuries with almost no interaction with the visitor. A better name for it would be \"History of Toys",
          "Visiting Nuremberg? Heard they had a Toy Museum? Someone gave you a map, circled the location, and to took off after all it's only a short walk. Beware, it's easy to get lost as the streets twist and turn - but the adventure is definitely worth it! You've arrived, enter and",
          "If you have a kid, then you MUST visit this museum. But even if you have not, you will find interesting things there! At the upper floor there is a kid's room for the small one' s who want to play. Absolutely worth the visit! It would be better if they had a cafe-restaurant at",
          "After a long day at the Christkindl Markt, my husband and I found this unexpected gem just around the corner and a bit off the beaten path. It was the perfect place to spend an hour, perusing the many display cases filled with childhood toys and trinkets. The 8-euro ticket is",
          "Well worth a visit, there are a number of floors containing lots of memories of our childhood! There was so much to see for all ages. The top floor has a play area which had plenty to do. There is a toilet on the top floor which is on the opposite end of the playroom. It was 5",
          "The first floor of this museum was rather blah. It wasn't until we went to the upper floors that we really got into the feel of this museum because the toys were more interactive and relevant to us.",
          "If you like to play, you have to visit the Toy Museum in Nuremeberg, They have a wonderfull collection of dolls, with several heads. Also a great collection of Lehmann Toy Factory. It is worth a visit for more then 4 hours if you like to see everything.",
          "Wonderful collection of toys, trains, dolls, and games. This is a fun place for adults as well as children. Make sure you get the audio. If you are on a river boat trip make sure you mention this to get a discount.",
          "Small museum but there was a lot in it. Hand made toys from a long time ago. reminded me of Gipeto's workshop.",
          "Signage was a bit misleading but we did find it. It was an interesting place, with a wonderful doll collection and a superb train collection. The other parts of the collection were very good, too.",
          "My 5 year old loved it. My wife and I also had fun visiting it. There were a whole lot of modern and old toys to enjoy.",
          "This is a large collection of toys going back about three hundred years, but almost all are presented statically, inside a glass showcase. There is very little interactivity or even opportunity to touch the toys (or perhaps replicas), except in their \"Playroom\", which has stuff",
          "It has a good collection of mostly old toys. The top floor has an old fashioned games that both kids and adults can play. Impressive doll houses and other high quality antique toys. Enjoyable for both children and adults.",
          "It is extraordinary, exciting, also to grownups. One floor dedicated to Lehmann, higly exciting manufacturer of toys up to our times. There are a lot of dolls houses of all sizes, and on the top floor a large working railway station.",
          "I spent a good 1 1/2 hours here, it was a delightful museum, very well maintained and with helpful staff. There are lots of trips down memory lane made with the many, many toys on display. It would not matter what age you are, you would enjoy a visit to this museum. If you are",
          "If you are traveling with young teenagers or for the kid in all of us this is your place. We did not realize that Nuremburg was known for toy shops and factories dating back to the 14th century. With all the museums one visits it is nice to explore something out of the norm. It",
          "As antiques collectors, we couldn\u00b4t miss this very well presented museum. The collection is huge. The distribution of the show is explicit. We got many posters and souvenirs from the well organised shop museum.",
          "We had the great good luck to visit this place on the last Saturday of the month and were thus able to see a demonstration of an incredible model train exhibit. Even if you can't see it working, there is a movie about it (in German) and it's awesomely cool to look at: \"Omaha,",
          "There is a lot to see, and you can spend hours in here if you have the time. There are audio guides in English and German (and I'm not sure what other languages) that are very informative. You can listen to everything or pick and chose depending on your time. There is even a",
          "Takes you back to your childhood! Lots of interactive play areas for kids, small but friendly cafe..",
          "A great little museum in Nuremberg. You don't need more then an hour here and the gift shop is awesome with some really neat toys available for purchase, hand made in Nuremberg.",
          "An excellent museum, well laid out and very interesting and informative. Do not miss this gem if in Nuremberg. Be sure to take advantage of the English headsets available for 1 euro each.",
          "5 euros, interesting and worth a look. Looking for lots of unique toys it was great a little out of disrepair though, many cabinets and lights not working. They have a terrific train set but it only runs for certain hours and we weren't there at the right time.",
          "Tells the story of the toy industry in Nuremberg, Germany and some is more generic. For an additional $1E you can get a language friendly audio tour. Not to be missed because of it's unique story approach for the children and a little cultural propaganda regarding changes in the",
          "My daughter and I enjoyed the exhibits with the dolls and doll houses. There were some amazing doll houses. Just beautiful.",
          "I thought this would be for only children but the history and all the things to see inside are too fantastic to speak about. You must go early and take your time to see it all and truly understand the history of the toy business here in Germany where it all started. Do not",
          "Though hard to find this little gem is worth the effort. It has a functioning elevator and so is \"disabled friendly\". Gift shop is only modest but staff very helpful. The story of toys through the ages is told with simple details. Though primarily focussed on the German toy",
          "We are a family of 13, 9, and 7 years old children and it was very fun. It was a nice change for the children from \"boring\" historical sites. It had a wide variety of interesting toys and dolls. The children especially enjoyed the toy cars. There were also many old and cool",
          "Found the visit to this museum very interesting. Good displays showing progression of toy making. Play area for the kids on the last floor. Not sure if you would take young children to this museum as you have 2 floors of toy displays to get through.",
          "We are a family of 4 two kids 6 - 12 year olds. It was 12 Euro for entrance. The exhibits were interesting and I was pleased they let me take photos. There is access to very nice restrooms. All very important when out sightseeing. The miniature train was very detailed and",
          "The museum shows a good collection of toys through time. There was a toys corner for kiddy. Me and my partner went in there and played a miniature magnetic ice hockey game. It was so much fun there even for adults.",
          "There are many larger and more historically significant attractions in Nuremburg but this one is a pleasant little gem. Explore a varied range of toys on display on all three floors. It was a real pleasure.",
          "Very interesting displays of old and newer toys in this museum. Fun to see them and remind yourself of toys from before the internet.",
          "we had initially planned to head to the DB Museum and had placed this secondary. unfortunately, at the Palace of Justice, we were inaccurately informed by the staff there that the DB Museum was included in the day ticket (just top up 2.50 EUR and you could visit several of the",
          "Very interesting museum about toys from 1400-s to modern toys, from small to big. If you have spare 1 euro take guide with you there are lots of interesting stories. Last floor is a big playground for kids, so take them with you and they will be happy too.",
          "A well set out museum of mostly German manufactured toys from early 1800's up to modern day Lego. Set out on three floors with a model railway. The railway is only working occasionally but there is a movie film about the person who made it. The audio guide is worth using.",
          "It was kind of cool to see the toys over the years. Mostly European of course but there were several the same from North America. There is a Kid's Playroom at the top level however there were no kids, just adults playing like they were children again. If you need to kill an",
          "I enjoyed this rather small museum not too far from the old part of town. I used the audio guide, which I highly recommend. I listened to quite a few guides during my stay in Germany, and this was the most entertaining. The speakers presented the history of the toys on display",
          "We went here on a whim. We purchased a day pass for all the city museums and this was near the Albrecht Durer house so we thought we would kill an hour there before lunch! It was a great way to pass an hours worth of time. The dollhouse collection is crazy and the",
          "This afternoon my LO had a wonderful place to play himself and with other kids. The museum has three floors and a playroom full of toys, table games and wooden bricks which was my LO's favorite and we spent all afternoon there.",
          "this museum covers toys thru the ages\u2026and there are lots of toys of every kind on every floor. we paid one euro extra for the english audio guide which was a good decision as it takes you thru the highlights in each section. otherwise, it would have been hard to decide what to",
          "Even if you think, like I did, this would be dull, think again. Incredible selection of toys and games going back centuries. Brought back some memories of childhood toys and showed the history of some toys today. Some very ingenious toys from yesteryear. Includes historic",
          "This Museum is tucked away off the central square and is contained in the upper floors of a house above a Caf\u00e9. It contains a large collection of toys to evoke memories of childhood for both boys and Girls, from early wooden toys, through to electric slot car racing, small",
          "Nuernberg (Nuremberg) is worldwide known as the city of toy makers (Leipzig as well) , toy exhibitions (after WW2) and of anything related with Christmas tree toys and ornaments. The old city is a jewel of beauty on the other hand, with exhiting things to see and places to",
          "This was the most disappointing thing we did in our 6 days in Nuremberg. Sadly, you can't give a no star review.The one star reviews have it right. 4 small rooms of inept, tired displays that don't come near warranting the 4 euro charge. We felt obliged to spend time examining",
          "I was ambivalent about visiting this museum. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The collection of different types of toys is amazing. I was very interested to learn the history of local toy makers.",
          "Three floors of historical and modern toys. Lots of trains , dolls, games and dolls houses. Outdoor cafe with a running train and a play-garden for children and parents.",
          "A day of \"remembering\" for us older folks! Although there is room for kids with kids activities, the museum itself is mostly focused on and appealing to adults. Sadly, no photographs are allowed, unlike many other places that at least allow photos without flash.",
          "Fabulous collection and well displayed. Only negative, we weren't allowed to play! Our visit lasted an hour and a half, and at 5 \u20ac each was great value. Highly recommended if you are still a child at heart",
          "Many people don't realize Nuremberg is famous for toys. If you are interested in the history of German toys than this is a must see. I was particularly interested in the doll and doll house collection. Really unique and one of a kind exhibits for the doll enthusiast. Also, a",

          "Interesting museum with many types of toys. We especially enjoyed the metal toys and wind-ups. Some of the old wood toys were advanced with the things they could do. The audio guide gave us facts behind sone of the toys. Surprisingly, there was a room devoted to a hand-made",
          "For something a little different this museum is great for all ages. German toys are unique especially the timber made toys. Enjoy this experience as we did.",
          "There were 3 floors of toys. One was for trains and was exciting and complete with toys made in Germany and the USA and other countries. The second floor had dolls, which was really overwhelming and not much of an interest to me but would be very good for people who love",
          "When I first saw Toy Museum as a recommended place, I thought it was mainly for kids. However, the museum got me completely spellbound. The was it is organised - you can rent a small audio player for just one Euro from the reception - and listen to context specific comments -",
          "This is a little gem. Its only over 3 floors but there are a lot of toys, history and information in this space. As well as a fantastic area on the top floor for children to play. There are all manner of toys, puppets, books etc for kids to play as they please. There is a also a",

          "Any toy you might imagine is there; doll's houses I could only dream of in my childhood; trains that moove if you push a button; lots of old and very old toys. You can see any mechanical toy move on a touch-screen in every room.",

          "I was expecting a large model railways section in this museum knowing that Nurnberg was hometown for various famous model train brands; I was however disappointed that there was only one panaroma and it was only operated once (and only for 2 hours) a month.",
          "i have a child soul and the toy museum was the best thing i saw. the puppet houses were absolutely amazing, and the train big station was very interesting. I had an audio-guide so i listened the stories and that makes the visit more pleasant.",
          "If you are looking for the child in you go to the Toy museum and you will not understand how the time passes by. Since Nuremberg is the toy manufacturing capital of Germany it has a wonderful collection of dollhouses, trains etc.",
          "The visit to the toy museum was really amazing. As art and culture evolved over time, so did toys and it was very apparent in the way the exhibitions were put together. Here you also have a German attraction with a reasonable audio guide in English. Definately my highlight of",
          "Nuremberg is famed for its toy making. The toy museum has lots to show and offer. Ideal to take children as there is a play area too. It is interesting for young and old, with train sets, bears and dolls houses on display. This museum can be perused slowly, or can be a quick",
          "This museum was what you'd expect I suppose. 4 floors of different kinds of toys. I personally found it boring after the first 10 minutes. Maybe some more interaction would have been good.",

          "This is a small museum dedicated to European toys from the last two centuries. We enjoyed looking at how different they are from the ones that children have now. If you were a kid of the 70's or 80's, you would probably fell nostalgic about some of the toys in display. Also,",
          "Fantastic display of toys from past to present. So many toys in their original boxes. Amazing displays with great audio guide. Don't miss the outdoor train, maze and garden. A very enjoyable couple of hours.",

          "A facinating place for adults and children alike. The Germans have always had a good reputation for making toys. Take a trip down memory lane and visit this museum",

          "Together with 3 other adults, visited this museum and were impressed with the quality of the displays. Reminded us so much of the toys we played with as children and showed a great selection of doll houses and metal toys. A good place to visit when you want a more relaxed",

          "Brilliant little museum, right in the heart of town. The most amazing sights for me were the old children's kitchens as they represent little time capsules. The museum is across 3 floors, though there is not too much to see ont he top floor, the other 2 make up for it. I",

          "My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this museum. The collection was wonderfully presented. The toys brought back so many memories of our own childhoods and those of our children. Many of the toys, most made of wood, were made locally and are beautifully constructed. The",
          "I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to spend the day at the Spielzug Museum in Nuremberg with 40 1st and 5th graders from the Ansbach American Elementary School and it was a fantastic experience. This place is a great way to spend a few hours re-living your childhood",
          "Really comprehensive collection of toys. Fascinating collection of toy steam engines, trains, but also the typical toya such as dolls houses. The dolls houses must have been serious investments at the time, with such detail. You can get a bus to the museum, or walk up the hill"

          "So much fun! Check the weather before you go. Most stuff is outside, and during warm months the kids can splash and play in the water area. In my opinion, teenagers won't have much fun there. This is mostly geared towards the younger crowd. \u2026",
          "Nice creative fun park,  many activities for the kids. But the staffs are not really friendly with the kids.",
          "Great park! Looking forward to go back next year!",
          "Great for kids that love Playmobil. Love the Biergarten.",
          "Sitting on a bench near Noah's Ark, I noticed a family playing with boats in the small basin. The children were occupied with a pirate ship, and the father thought he was unnoticed as he started playing with a huge container ship. He was \u2026",
          "A very nice place to be with the family. We have been there from 9 till 4 o\u2019clock, we took the breakfast Buffet from 8:30 to 10:00, after that the kids went playing. We spent almost the whole day indoors because it was raining. The kids were happy.",
          "Nice and still relatively cosy Family Park...",
          "The Covid-19 precautions are a joke, since they still admit 4.000 guests to enter.\nAside from that it was great as always",
          "It's designed for kids, not adults. Still having fun for about 1-2h. We didnt eat inside, because the food is overpriced and small portion. Recommended for parents, but not just for adults.",
          "It is our favorite place in holidays whether during winter or summer. They also have affordable eating options. The kids love it.",
          "A fun place for the kids. \nJust do not go in the holiday times if you don't like crowded places.\nIn winter there is just the Hob-Center (indoor) open. There is also a small trail for a walk in the winter time.",
          "A good place to make a stop for 2-3h, on a long road by car, with children. In winter, there are few people during the week, so even the smallest children can have fun.  Outdoor activities are closed, only in front of the building there is \u2026",
          "One of the best park I ve ever visited for young children up to 10 years old",
          "We love this park. A lot of interesting attractions for kids. Open hours are longer as others parks. With your Season Karts  you can go every day there\ud83d\ude03",
          "Amazing place kids will love it, it's perfect to spend a day and just enjoy usually during the summer it's a bit crowded but even though it's great.",
          "My kid loves this place. Has good outdoor activities for kids including boating. Indoor games are fun and has good facility for new Moms. Experienced it myself this time.",
          "Nice place for kids, a lot to do , reasonably priced but over crowded during school vacation",
          "Love it !! Fun for kids and for parents too",
          "An amazing place for kids. Loads to do and really well planned out. Lots of educational play and not commercialised like other toy companies. Only downside is that there were lots of older children in younger play areas. This meant that the little ones couldn't play and there were no staff around to help.",
          "We have been here several times and I would say it is excellent for the 3-7 year old age range. Our 4 year old had a great time as did his brother when he was the same age. We can see that the 8 year old bog brother wasn't so engaged as for 2 years ago. Still a very good concept.",
          "Enjoy a wonderful day with the kids. Have a great breakfast before (at the park) because you're going to use too much energy since the attractions need human interaction. Use the labels at the entrance to identify the kids, they get lost in a snap!",
          "I would not recommend this place to other Korean and foreign friends.\nI went to see Nuremberg's Christmas Market on 23.12.2019. And there is a playmobil too, so I visited here with my child. We played half a day here at the indoor \u2026",
          "Very nice Park, reasonable prices, a lot of playgrounds and climbing parks. Nice indoor area, where children can actually play with Playmobile products. The toilets could be better maintained. Unfortunately you find a lot of single-use plastics there. Hopefully this will Improve.",
          "Loved it ,well my boy did anyway and thats what counts. Food good too",
          "it was crowded but a lot of fun, i would recomend it",
          "Favorite park worth every cent",
          "A great place to take the children so many activities it makes you wish you were a child again. \nOne negative smokers had an area in the middle of a play area wire tables and benches whereas families had to sit on the ground to have their \u2026",
          "One of the best leisure parks. You have to go there with your children/family.\nThe entrance fee is very low and in the park the prices are also normal.\nBest to go there in the hot summer months.",
          "Great amusement park. No rides, more like a series of well thought out playgrounds with climbing frames, big slides etc. The lake with the pirate ship, rafts, water cannons etc. is brilliant. There is another lake with kid sized paddle \u2026",
          "Magical place for kids. Easy to spend the whole day in the park. Most of the stuff is outdoors, so good weather is a must.",
          "We really enjoy coming to this park. It is reasonably priced with plenty of fun activities for the kids.",
          "We had a great time. The playgrounds are as good as I've ever seen.  The children get a good workout here. The big playgrounds are full of detail that keep the children busy for a long while.\nEven through the place was busy , still had a \u2026",
          "The best Spielplatz in the entire region for kids under 10. Safe from every angle, and with endless possibilities (from pirates to police to far west to dinosaurs), it's definitely a PARENTS and kids delight. Food is available in every part \u2026",
          "Great fun, extremely well organised. Kids paradise. Requires 5/6hrs to complete the in&out door parts. Parkhaus(P1/2/3) costs 5\u20ac per day. Visit early to find roadside parking for free.",
          "Superb park. Fun for kids, nobody force you to by anything all the time. Cheap and well thought details. 100% recommended.",
          "Excellent park for the kids. Lots of activites for them. In summer they can enjoy lots of water play.\n\nHighly recommended\n\nVery reasonable in price too. About \u20ac12 each for the day.",
          "Lot of fun for kids. Very big entrance queues - we bought online tickets and were waiting in \"the fast lane\" - it was moving unbelievably slowly, as only one person was thoroughly checking everyone bags.",
          "An unexpected surprise! Lovely adventure park for kids (even toddlers enjoyed some activities). No age limit, parents can also have fun here. One thing that needs attention: the staff speak English poorly and is hard to communicate with \u2026",
          "My kids enjoyed lot here then Disneyland Paris. Cheap price for one day enjoyment for kids . Worth for money .",
          "Very good place",
          "Loved the PlayMobil experience. Awesome park with a lot of playing activities for kids. The lack of rides actually is welcoming as there are no queues and the atmosphere is really calm and enjoyable. Certainly a must go to if your kids are between 6-9 years old.",
          "Great for kids from 3 and up.  Lots of climbing structures and themed areas.  Even has an indoor climbing structure for when the weather is bad or it's too cold. I personally wish there were a couple more parent stairs to get from the \u2026",
          "Loads to do, spotless, very reasonable for amount of time spent here! Kid's absolutely loved it!  Staff very helpful and friendly too. Thanks, we will be back.",
          "I went with my 8 y.o. daughter. She LOVED it. I was worried she'd be too old but no - lots of things to do for her. She ran around very happy. I liked the prices and the cleanliness. A pleasent surprise! I'd rate it better than Legoland! (although the parks are very different).",
          "Great place for kids! Lots of games and toys to play around! Good food and beer! You can park your car all day for just 5 \u20ac.",
          "Very nice for Kids between 2 and 9 years old. The parking space was limited \u00e1nd they make you pay in advance for parking, Only cash. Without cash they send you away and you'll have to search somewhere else.",
          "My kid loved this place. Satisfied with the food prices. Recommend it for families with younger kids 2 till 7 y.o.",
          "Great fun for all Playmobil fans. Food was mediocre and to expensive.\nNext time we need to take our swimming costumes!",
          "A wonderful place for kids anytime of the year. The outdoor activities engage children of a wide age range and require physical activity. The indoor area is a fun place to play with the wide assortment of Playmobil toys, and play on the indoor climbing area.",
          "Fantastic for young kids!\n\nWe went with our 3.5 year old daughter and I must say that for kids of this age and up the place is fantastic.\n\nEach themed area is well designed and engages the kids imagination while based on a Playmobil theme. \u2026",
          "Really beautiful funpark! It was quite crowded when we where there, which was a bit of a downside. But nevertheless a great day with our daughter...",
          "Brilliant day out, second time there.  Kids loved all the water play.  So much to play with inside too with all the playmobil toys and soft play (perfect for wet or wintery days).\n\nNew pirate area is great and could have easily spent half a \u2026",
          "Clean, great value, lots of staff and lots of fun. Never had to wait in line for long even though it was peak season. Highly recommend for any family with kids 3-10 years that enjoy playing.",
          "Really good Park! Entrance cheap and you can easily spend there day or more. Good food also!",
          "There's everything there to have fun from 0 to 99 years!",
          "Very busy however my kids enjoyed the time over there anyway. Highly recommended.",
          "Brilliant, makes you want to be a child again.",
          "It's only good for very young children about 3 to 5 years old maximum, also the play water areas smelled heavily of chlorine even from 20 meters distance, apart from that one could spend a Pleasent few hours there",
          "Great place to walk around and enjoy if you have kids.  My daughter love Playmobil so makes for a good time for her.",
          "Fantastic themed playground. Not much rides or such but lots of places to discover and spend hours playing. 1 day is definetely not enough to cover all areas. Great quality, attention to details, pleasant enviroment. Would love to visit again.",
          "Great Park with lots of fun for young and old",
          "Large with many different themed areas to appeal to kids with different interests. From unicorns to pirates, western to medieval. There is water play for kids to get wet and enjoy.",
          "We visited Playmobil funpark five years ago when my daughters were 6 and 5.  I wasn't sure if they would have as much fun this time but they really loved it.  It's a giant playground with so much to do regardless of age.  I also like that \u2026",
          "The bratwurst and pasta is terrible and has absolutely no flavour at all. But the park was so much fun. My kids (2 and 4) loved it! We were there yesterday on an extremely hot day (almost 40 degrees), but it was absolutely bearable with \u2026",
          "Very entertaining amusement park and cheap entrance including a almost free park.",
          "We love this place!!!",
          "Very Disappointing.. this park is clean.. But I won't say this is theme park. They just placed playmobile dolls in most of the areas.. other than that this is just like other open parks which you can find it near your home in Germany. \u2026",
          "A very well-designed fun park with a great variety of facilities. Definitely  a must-go for families.",
          "This is simply the best attraction for small children that I've ever visited. So many imaginatively created, hands on play areas. My kids love sifting through the sand to find  treasure in the pirate and gold mine areas. Very little queuing \u2026",
          "A great place for the family!! My children loved the small water park especially on the hot days.",
          "Nice place, kids loved here.",

          "Great place for kids , our two and a half  years old daughter loved it especially the area with water so be sure to bring a bathing suit and extra clothes. She didn't want to leave \ud83e\udd29\nSadly we didn't have time to see everything, it took alot more time than what we expected.",
          "Spent almost a full day. Lovely place for kids. Sometimes adults get involved as well. Food is ok as well. Would recommend.",
          "We enjoyed alot with kids",
          "It is the ideal daily excursion for families with kids till 8-9 years old. \u0399 visited on a warm October Saturday but I think ideally one should visit during the warm period since there are a lot of activities with water. The place is \u2026",
          "Very nice Park. Recommended with kids.",
          "My kids love it! They had a lot of fun here. There are also children\u2019s programs and dancing. Sommer or winter is always a nice place to visit. Outdoor and indoor!",
          "Nice park for kids. Lots of fun and activities. Theme is only playmobil but could be anything. Mainly a giant playground area for a good price",
          "Amazing place for kids. Great indoor and outdoor playgorunds. A great way to spend the whole day there. A lots of restaurant with very very reasonable prices. The kids had a blast there. Parking on the spot. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95",

          "Nice place for yours kids.",

          "I loved it because there are activities instead of merry-go-rounds. The kids spent over an hour digging for gems or sieving gold nuggets...",
          "They removed stone mine, the best part of playmobil, to enlarge the shop, MINUS ONE STAR",
          "A great place for the little ones to have fun!",
          "Play for yourself... not Disney stile. Good to visit during the summer.",
          "A LOT of fun! So much to do--remember to being a change of clothes!",
          "Fun experience for both kids and parents. Here one doesn't really have to sit and wait for a kid to play but join on the fun and be a kid again. There's regular change of play stations and new, even cooler characters. My kids love the kid's disco too... Finding Parking can be a nightmare, oh well, welcome to Germany!",
          "AMAZING! Could spend the entire day in the enormous indoor play centre alone, nevermind all the incredible outdoor activities. It has an almost zen, zoo-like feeling, with rambling walkways and no over-commercial amusement park overkill. I \u2026",
          "Great playground. Would prefere more shades in hot summer day.",
          "Pretty fun for all ages but really geared towards the 10 and under age groups. If you want to use the afternoon ticket make sure to wait till three o'clock. There's lots of parking but most of it is \u20ac5. It is basically a bunch of \u2026",
          "Very nice place for kids and grownups.",
          "An amazing place to have fun!",
          "This is a great place for younger children up to maybe 9 years old.",
          "Its a nice amusement park.... lots of fun for the whole family. Its suitable for small kids... we went with a 1,5 years old boy. I think its the best at the summer because of the water playground but it must be nice at winter too (indoor playing facilities too).",
          "A great place to walk around for family and kids.",
          "Good place didn't have to wait very long for anything. There were a lot of people though.",

          "Great for kids till 10 years. I was two times and allways enjoid it",
          "Winter opening so limited to indoor centre. It was perfect for our children. We spent 5 hours playing with all the different themed toys and climbing on the indoor play area.",
          "Visited during winter so we only had access to the indoor area,  it was AMAZING!!! Can't wait to bring my little one during spring/summer time!",

          "Super! Great for the kids (ours was almost 4yrs old). Spent 2 whole days there including an overnight stay at their hotel. Clean, safe, and plenty to keep the kids (and adults) occupied. For a more detailed review, Google my blog - 'ABC Dad UK'",
          "A very nice day trip for young children. My 3 and 5 year old children loved it. However, it was uncomfortably crowded by lunchtime. The public transit connection between the park and nearby Nuremberg could have been better/more direct.",
          "It had pirates, police and magic unicorns. The park is well suited for young children, I would say up to art most 12. On hot days bring your swimsuit so you can cool down. The park has many hidden crooks and crannies where you may find some \u2026",
          "Fun place to be with little to 12yr old kids...there no big rides there like in legoland or bayern park. It feels like a hige playground but its fun. The pirate ship, the castle, noahs ark, paddle boats, inside playarea, goldmine, fairyland \u2026",
          "Visited with my 3year old son.  Couldn't get him out of there ideal for a sunny day as the water attractions are great.  The gift shop was reasonably priced and took me for 50 euros but was part of my negotiations with my son to get him out of the park. Would highly recommend.",
          "Loved this park. Definitely worth the visit. Kids are entertained and active the entire day. Impressive all the things they can do with the various playgrounds and different spaces. It was crowded but you really aren't jammed in like some parks.",
          "I believe there are enough reviews for this place but to put it in short- we were lucky to have come on a hot summer day, since there are lots of water theme venues. What are they good for on a rainy cold day?!? Anyway we had lots of fun. \u2026",
          "Always an amazing time. Even though it was very busy, there was still plenty to do. Looking forward to our next trip",

          "Fun for the children when not too crowded",
          "A perfect place for the young ones (2 to 10). Older kids might get bored, but plenty of things to do for the entire family. Weekends tend to be crowded so consider going during the week if possible. I took our four kids (ages 5, 5, 4, & 2) and they had a blast for two days. They keep talking about going back.",
          "A place to spend whole day with kids. Lots of activities for different ages",

          "Great program for the whole family, especially for children.",
          "Just plain fun for the kids.  Low prices.",
          "Difficult one. You will have a good time if you adjust your expectations. Effectively it is a large playground with different themes. People brought food and picknick blankets with them. Kids were playing in bathing suits around the water \u2026",
          "Great experience if you like Playmobil. It has also a great shop. It's weir the fact that there are just few buses to get there, at least in July. If you haven't got a car the schedule to go there it's not easy.",
          "Great place for families with (smaller) kids.\n\nThis fun park is located in the original home of Playmobil and really caters for families. It has ample car parking space and good, easy food options. It certainly is not overpriced, has an \u2026",

          "Our kids love it and so do we. For kids aged 3-11 it is perfect. If you can, I recommend that you book the Playmobil hotel. It is very hard to beat price to quality ratio with another accomodation.",

          "Very fun for kids under 10, can play a whole day without a Q",
          "Amazing place for children and parents to spend at least two days, having fun on a lot of attractions. Bring swimsuits for kids, or a second set of dry clothes. There are some driers, but we didn't use them this time. Firendly staff, a lot of things to do, inside and outside. Our kids loved it so much and they can't wait to come back.",
          "This place is amazing with so much to do for everyone",

          "Awesome! A really great place for kids to run around and play with all things life size playmobile. There are a ton of things to to - easily enough to occupy a four year old for two days, possibly more. The food is really good and not expensive either.",

The museum had great English audio guide that lead you through this amazing artist, who lived in the same time as Leonardo DaVinci, but created artwork that are even mysterious in our time.",
          "Don't expect to see much of Durer's work in this museum, as most of it was sold and left the city already during artist's life. But it does convey the atmosphere of the time well. Do take the time to walk the streets around the museum, the mix of old and new is simply enchanting.",
          "A great place to stop and see one of the only houses of 16th century Artisan in all of northern Europe!  Prices are very inexpensive and they have an audio guide that comes with the price of admission.  Be sure to have your students bring \u2026",
          "It was my first meeting with Durer but I was glad to hear such a comprehensive story about him and the house. I still feel something is missing - maybe more paintings, or it's just knowing all the stuff inside come from somewhere else.",
          "My only question is how this place continues to exist given the people who work there. I\u2019ve been there multiple times with my students and every time both the front desk lady and the manager (?) were extremely rude. During my last \u2026",

          "Very nice museum, it helps you to find out who D\u00fcrer was.",
          "A lovely historic landmark just below the castle. It's like walking back in time to see the life and works of this amazing artist. The audio tour is very informative and only took about an hour and a half. Highly recommended for history and art nerds!",
          "There is a lady acting as D\u00fcrer's wife and she explains everything, it was great and the kinds liked it !!!",
          "So much fascinating history. The audio tour really brought it to life. Our only regret was we couldn't have stayed longer.",
          "A very small museum. Skip this if you are thinking of seeing the artist\u201ds original artworks, because there are none here. Go to the Alte Pinakohtek instead for Durer\u2019s masterpieces such as the Four Apostles..",
          "When you visit Albrecht D\u00fcrer, you should be aware that there are virtually no original works by the master exhibited here - they are all in the Pinakothek in Munich. The house in Nuremberg, where D\u00fcrer actually lived for a while, gives a good impression of how things were in D\u00fcrer's day.",
          "It was a big disappointment. We read that there are no original paintings but we thought we would visit original rooms with original or almost original furniture. Nothing  of this: one and i say one room with copies and two and i repeat two \u2026",
          "One of the interesting museums to visit in Nuremburg is the Albrecht D\u00fcrer's House on Albrecht-D\u00fcrer-Stra\u00dfe in the St. Sebald district. This is a good place to learn about Nuremburg's most famous artist and to walk through a well-preserved \u2026",
          "Beautifully restored artist's house, with crazy interactive panels. But unfortunately, not one work of this great artist is hanged in this place. But at least, there are detailed audio tour through the house, and through artist's life.",

          "Warm and cosy coffee house!",
          "Very much Durer house. Good painting. Nice one Durer!",
          "It doesn't take very long to visit. Very near other sites worth viewing, including the plaza and pubs outside.  Every bit as nice as Rembrandt's house in Amsterdam, only not as big.",
          "That was very a pleasant surprise in the city! The museum is a bit of a time travel, and I loved to find out more about the life and art of D\u00fcrer. The house is very charming and gives you an idea of how it was to live there in the past.",
          "Lovely museum worth visiting",
          "Very interesting to see the house of a such great artist",
          "A lovely little museum with many original paintings as well as skilled copies. On the top floor you'll be even be able to see an artist create etching on copper plates.",
          "A small but pleasant museum giving some details of the famous artist. As others have pointed out the aren't actually any of his works present and the house is actually mere speculation as there are no records of how it was during D\u00fcrer's time. It is an OK museum but not Nuremberg's best.",
          "Every art student should stop in this tiny museum to see the art and how the artist lived.",
          "The original house that the artist bought and lived in. Admission with day pass after the toy museum. Three floors with reproductions of the artist's works and the imagined decor of his time. Lockers are avaliable for a returned deposit of 1 Euro.",
          "Fascinating history of the artist and his home. I wish there were more period furnishings, but then it would be more crowded and probably cost more. They provide recorded headsets, but you can see the whole house in half an hour if you skip a few recordings.",
          "Albrecht Durer Haus is a magical place where I felt the presence of his genius. Highly recommended!",
          "My favourite place in Nuremberg. After visiting the museum, you can have a drink",

          "A very nicely put together museum, considering it has no original paintings of Durer. That said, it does a good job of explaining his life and history!!",
          "Greatest part of the trip! What a charming house!",
          "Very detailed audio guide, but the house was modified so much through the centuries that almost nothing remains belonging to D\u00fcrer's time.",
          "A popular and interesting place in Nuremberg",
          "A fine look at former residence of legendary German artist",
          "Excellent Museum !!! This was a gem of a place to walk into! If you visit Nuremberg-- come here, make it a priority. You'll learn so much about this man and get to see some great works of art! The audio tour was in English and the staff was friendly!",
          "I had just read the lost symbol by Dan Brown and was very pleasantly surprised when I entered this small house and saw Albrecht Durer's signature on the wall. It was just by coincidence that I entered and didn't regret it! The house is very well kept and the audioguide is part of the entrance fee",
          "Very interesting place to visit. Must have for art lovers",
          "A must see attraction in Nuremberg,  to learn about one of it's most famous sons.",
          "Nice place for such a fine craftsman.\nJust in front of Nuremberg castle",
          "Pretty interesting museum. Takes 1h to visit",

          "Interesting and well presented but at least I wanted to see one original work made by D\u00fcrer. Apparently all originals are scattered all over in the \u201cfamous\u201d museums. Pity!!",
          "Pretty boring. The house is far more interesting than any of the art. The house is very small.",
          "Reconstructed house of a great artist. You learn more about life in the 16 century than about D\u00fcrer himself. A good audio guide is included in the ticket price.",
          "Quite a cool museum. Definitely a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. Came through with a few friends during 'Die Blaue Nacht' and it was very enjoyable. I'd definitely like to come back again and spend more time here.",
          "Worth visiting when in the city of Nuremberg to enter the life of one of Nuremberg's (and the world's) greatest artists.",
          "Lovely place",
          "Impressive, great job at preserving this home. The kitchen was my favorite.",
          "I'm not a very big fan of art. I only planned to take pictures of Albrecht-D\u00fcrer-Haus from outside as well as its beautiful surroundings at first but when I found out that the entrance ticket for student is only 1.50 (and free audio guide!) \u2026",
          "I've been looking forward to returning to this place for many years, and it didn't disappoint. The history of the house and its inhabitants was very well presented, and I learned much more about Duerer than I had known before.",
          "Interesting, but could be so much better.",
          "It's a beautiful house on the top of the hills in Nuremberg. The museum inside is not so big and takes around 30-60 min to visit. I recommend to purchase the day ticket to see the other public museums in Nuremberg for 2.5\u20ac each.",
          "A well kept small Museum paying homage to Nuremberg's most famous citizen, Albrecht Duerer. Highly recommended.",
          "Nice to visit, but too much to see. All the original works are elsewhere",
          "Extremely rude staff. Sometimes in Germany you don't notice unfriendly staff because German customers might have a compensating effect (read: they are rude as well or worser). That being said, there is nothing to see here, so... the right people on the right place.",
          "A well put together museum that has a good mix of information about the house and the man. The audio guide in English is great and very cleverly put together. It is not a particularly large house and you don't need to spend any longer here than the audio guide takes.",
          "Awesome place.",
          "Worth a visit, is this a N must see? Probably, especially for the history buffs in the crowd, for the others, find a rendezvous spot and refresh yourself with a  Frankish beer - Frankish please.",
          "Amazing \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
          "History. Without D\u00fcber, no Selfies !",
          "It was very pleasent visiting it with my children",
          "Interesting place, with lot of history and wonderful painting.. The lady on the reception though wasn't so kind",
          "A beautiful home-museum dedicated to the German master, you can enjoy the lifestyle of the D\u00fcrer family. The visit includes an audio guide that tells the story of the house. A small negative note was the rudeness of the cashier who among other things spoke only German.",
          "Hey make sure you check the door; it's open on Mondays!!!!! At least up until now-September. If you like art history this place is definitely worth it. If not, just look from the outside. Normal price: 5\u20ac",
          "very impresive",
          "Interesting but not unmissable",
          "Interesting.",
          "The house did not suffer during the war!\nBut the exposition and especially audio guide are very strange. I think it's stupid to tell the visitors some details of everyday life of Durer from his wife's point of view (whom the Master even did \u2026",
          "Was very nice. No originals but it is still a nice place to visit. Take the audio guide it had good fun facts!",

          "Very little to see but expensive..",

          "Although small house, very interesting facts",
          "The Durer house is very nicely renovated and the whole exposition is well organized.  However, more information about the paintings could be provided on how, when and why with some connections to Durer's whereabouts, life milestones and the era in general. Nevertheless, a must-visit in Nuremberg!",

          "Worth a visit.",

          "I could well live there, it is still comfy and warm. Good experience.",

          "Very educational",
          "Didn't know who Albrecht Durer was until coming here. He's the one who drew the praying hands which has become a tattoo favourite! The only thing is, very limited original works of his is actually inside the house...",
          "5 euro to get in and 3 euro for the locker to lock your backpack. With free self guided tours of the house come with an audio in english. The house have his origianals and copies of his art work, but you also get to re live his foot step.",
          "You can see the different thi gs Albrecht d\u00fcrer did on several floors. Very nice to have had such a famous artist living in my hometown! :)",
          "Nice house-museum with changing exhibitions. The spring/summer 2016 exhibition of Durer prints from the Diehl collection is outstanding.",
          "They could be better!!!And with more painting of durer-Haus!!!!",

On the Pegnitz River (from its confluence with the Rednitz in F\u00fcrth onwards: Regnitz, a tributary of the River Main) and the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal, it lies in the Bavarian administrative region of Middle Franconia, and is the largest city and the unofficial capital of Franconia. Nuremberg forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring cities of F\u00fcrth, Erlangen and Schwabach with a total population of 798,867 (2018), while the larger Nuremberg Metropolitan Region has approximately 3.6 million inhabitants. The city lies about 170 kilometres (110 mi) north of Munich. It is the largest city in the East Franconian dialect area (colloquially: \"Franconian\"; German: Fr\u00e4nkisch), Nuremberg was one of the host cities of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nThere are many institutions of higher education in the city, including the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg). With 39,780 students in 2017, it is Bavaria's third-largest and Germany's 11th-largest university, with campuses in Erlangen and Nuremberg and a university hospital in Erlangen (Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen). Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg Georg Simon Ohm and Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg are also located within the city. Nuremberg Airport (Flughafen N\u00fcrnberg \u201cAlbrecht D\u00fcrer\u201c) is the second-busiest airport in Bavaria after Munich Airport, and the tenth-busiest airport in Germany.\nStaatstheater N\u00fcrnberg is one of the five Bavarian state theatres, showing operas, operettas, musicals, and ballets (main venue: Nuremberg Opera House), plays (main venue: Schauspielhaus N\u00fcrnberg), as well as concerts (main venue: Meistersingerhalle). Its orchestra, Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg, is Bavaria's second-largest opera orchestra after the Bavarian State Opera's Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich. Nuremberg is the birthplace of Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Johann Pachelbel.\nNuremberg was the site of major Nazi rallies, and it provided the site for the Nuremberg trials, which held to account many major Nazi officials.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe first documentary mention of the city, in 1050, mentions Nuremberg as the location of an Imperial castle between the East Franks and the Bavarian March of the Nordgau. From 1050 to 1571 the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade-routes. King Conrad III (reigning as King of Germany from 1138 to 1152) established the Burgraviate of Nuremberg, with the first burgraves coming from the Austrian House of Raab. With the extinction of their male line around 1190, the last Raabs count's son-in-law, Frederick I from the House of Hohenzollern, inherited the burgraviate in 1192.\nFrom the late 12th century to the Interregnum (1254\u201373), however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Hohenstaufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor (German: Reichsschulthei\u00df) from 1173/74. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city.\n \nNuremberg is often referred to as the \"unofficial capital\" of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly because the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg played an important role in the administration of the empire. The increasing demands of the Imperial court and the increasing importance of the city attracted increased trade and commerce in Nuremberg. In 1219 Emperor Frederick II granted the Gro\u00dfen Freiheitsbrief ('Great Letter of Freedom'), including town rights, Imperial immediacy (Reichsfreiheit), the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy - almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves. Nuremberg soon became, with Augsburg, one of the two great trade-centers on the route from Italy to Northern Europe.\nIn 1298 the Jews of the town were falsely accused of having desecrated the host, and 698 of them were killed in one of the many Rintfleisch massacres. Behind the massacre of 1298 was also the desire to combine the northern and southern parts of the city, which were divided by the Pegnitz. The Jews of the German lands suffered many massacres during the plague pandemic of the mid-14th century.\nIn 1349 Nuremberg's Jews suffered a pogrom. They were burned at the stake or expelled, and a marketplace was built over the former Jewish quarter. The plague returned to the city in 1405, 1435, 1437, 1482, 1494, 1520 and 1534.\n\nThe largest growth of Nuremberg occurred in the 14th century. Charles IV's Golden Bull of 1356, naming Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet, made Nuremberg one of the three most important cities of the Empire. Charles was the patron of the Frauenkirche, built between 1352 and 1362 (the architect was likely Peter Parler), where the Imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg. The royal and Imperial connection grew stronger in 1423 when the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg granted the Imperial regalia to be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 1796, when the advance of French troops required their removal to Regensburg and thence to Vienna.In 1349 the members of the guilds unsuccessfully rebelled against the patricians in a Handwerkeraufstand ('Craftsmen's Uprising'), supported by merchants and some by councillors, leading to a ban on any self-organisation of the artisans in the city, abolishing the guilds that were customary elsewhere in Europe; the unions were then dissolved, and the oligarchs remained in power while Nuremberg was a free city (until the early-19th century). Charles IV conferred upon the city the right to conclude alliances independently, thereby placing it upon a politically equal footing with the princes of the Empire. Frequent fights took place with the burgraves - without, however, inflicting lasting damage upon the city. After fire destroyed the castle in 1420 during a feud between Frederick IV (from 1417 Margrave of Brandenburg) and the duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, the city purchased the ruins and the forest belonging to the castle (1427), resulting in the city's total sovereignty within its borders.\nThrough these and other acquisitions the city accumulated considerable territory. The Hussite Wars (1419-1434), a recurrence of the Black Death in 1437, and the First Margrave War (1449-1450) led to a severe fall in population in the mid-15th century. Siding with Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria-Munich, in the Landshut War of Succession of 1503-1505 led the city to gain substantial territory, resulting in lands of 25 sq mi (64.7 km2), making it one of the largest Imperial cities.During the Middle Ages, Nuremberg fostered a rich, varied, and influential literary culture.\n\n\n=== Early modern age ===\n\nThe cultural flowering of Nuremberg, in the 15th and 16th centuries, made it the centre of the German Renaissance. In 1525, Nuremberg accepted the Protestant Reformation, and in 1532, the Nuremberg Religious Peace was signed there, preventing war between Protestants and Catholics for 15 years. During the 1552 revolution against Charles V, Nuremberg tried to purchase its neutrality, but the city was attacked without a declaration of war and was forced into a disadvantageous peace. At the Peace of Augsburg, the possessions of the Protestants were confirmed by the Emperor, their religious privileges extended and their independence from the Bishop of Bamberg affirmed, while the 1520s' secularisation of the monasteries was also approved. Families like the Tucher, Imhoff or Haller run trading businesses across Europe, similar to the Fugger and Welser families from Augsburg, although on a slightly smaller scale. \n\nThe state of affairs in the early 16th century, increased trade routes elsewhere and the ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade. During the Thirty Years' War, frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and League soldiers, the financial costs of the war and the cessation of trade caused irreparable damage to the city and a near-halving of the population. In 1632, the city, occupied by the forces of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, was besieged by the army of Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein. The city declined after the war and recovered its importance only in the 19th century, when it grew as an industrial centre. Even after the Thirty Years' War, however, there was a late flowering of architecture and culture \u2013 secular Baroque architecture is exemplified in the layout of the civic gardens built outside the city walls, and in the Protestant city's rebuilding of St. Egidien church, destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century, considered a significant contribution to the baroque church architecture of Middle Franconia.After the Thirty Years' War, Nuremberg attempted to remain detached from external affairs, but contributions were demanded for the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War and restrictions of imports and exports deprived the city of many markets for its manufactures. The Bavarian elector, Charles Theodore, appropriated part of the land obtained by the city during the Landshut War of Succession, to which Bavaria had maintained its claim; Prussia also claimed part of the territory. Realising its weakness, the city asked to be incorporated into Prussia but Frederick William II refused, fearing to offend Austria, Russia and France. At the Imperial diet in 1803, the independence of Nuremberg was affirmed, but on the signing of the Confederation of the Rhine on 12 July 1806, it was agreed to hand the city over to Bavaria from 8 September, with Bavaria guaranteeing the amortisation of the city's 12.5 million guilder public debt.\n\n\n=== After the Napoleonic Wars ===\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the city's trade and commerce revived; the skill of its inhabitants together with its favourable situation soon made the city prosperous, particularly after its public debt had been acknowledged as a part of the Bavarian national debt. Having been incorporated into a Catholic country, the city was compelled to refrain from further discrimination against Catholics, who had been excluded from the rights of citizenship. Catholic services had been celebrated in the city by the priests of the Teutonic Order, often under great difficulties. After their possessions had been confiscated by the Bavarian government in 1806, they were given the Frauenkirche on the Market in 1809; in 1810 the first Catholic parish was established, which in 1818 numbered 1,010 souls.In 1817, the city was incorporated into the district of Rezatkreis (named for the river Franconian Rezat), which was renamed to Middle Franconia (German: Mittelfranken) on 1 January 1838. The first German railway, the Bavarian Ludwigsbahn, from Nuremberg to nearby F\u00fcrth, was opened in 1835. The establishment of railways and the incorporation of Bavaria into Zollverein (the 19th-century German Customs Union), commerce and industry opened the way to greater prosperity. In 1852, there were 53,638 inhabitants: 46,441 Protestants and 6,616 Catholics. It subsequently grew to become the more important industrial city of Southern Germany, one of the most prosperous towns of southern Germany, but after the Austro-Prussian War it was given to the Prussia as part of their telegraph stations they had to give up. In 1905, its population, including several incorporated suburbs, was 291,351: 86,943 Catholics, 196,913 Protestants, 3,738 Jews and 3,766 members of other creeds.\n\n\n=== Nazi era ===\n\nNuremberg held great significance during the Nazi Germany era. Because of the city's relevance to the Holy Roman Empire and its position in the centre of Germany, the Nazi Party chose the city to be the site of huge Nazi Party conventions \u2014 the Nuremberg rallies. The rallies were held in 1927, 1929 and annually from  1933 through 1938. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 the Nuremberg rallies became huge Nazi propaganda events, a centre of Nazi ideals. The 1934 rally was filmed by Leni Riefenstahl, and made into a propaganda film called Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will).\nAt the 1935 rally, Hitler specifically ordered the Reichstag to convene at Nuremberg to pass the Nuremberg Laws which revoked German citizenship for all Jews and other non-Aryans. A number of premises were constructed solely for these assemblies, some of which were not finished. Today many examples of Nazi architecture can still be seen in the city. The city was also the home of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher, the publisher of Der St\u00fcrmer.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Nuremberg was the headquarters of Wehrkreis (military district) XIII, and an important site for military production, including aircraft, submarines and tank engines. A subcamp of Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp was located here, and extensively used slave labour. The city was severely damaged in Allied strategic bombing from 1943 to 1945. On 29 March 1944, the RAF endured its heaviest losses in the bombing campaign of Germany. Out of more than 700 planes participating, 106 were shot down or crash-landed on the way home to their bases, and more than 700 men were missing, as many as 545 of them dead. More than 160 became prisoners of war.On 2 January 1945, the medieval city centre was systematically bombed by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Army Air Forces and about ninety percent of it was destroyed in only one hour, with 1,800 residents killed and roughly 100,000 displaced. In February 1945, additional attacks followed. In total, about 6,000 Nuremberg residents are estimated to have been killed in air raids.\nNuremberg was a heavily fortified city that was captured in a fierce battle lasting from 17 to 21 April 1945 by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, 42nd Infantry Division and 45th Infantry Division, which fought house-to-house and street-by-street against determined German resistance, causing further urban devastation to the already bombed and shelled buildings. Despite this intense degree of destruction, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent restored to its pre-war appearance, including the reconstruction of some of its medieval buildings. Much of this reconstructive work and conservation was done by the organisation 'Old Town Friends Nuremberg'. However, over half of the historic look of the center, and especially the northeastern half of the old Imperial Free City was not restored.\n\n\n=== Nuremberg trials ===\n\nBetween 1945 and 1946, German officials involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity were brought before an international tribunal in the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union had wanted these trials to take place in Berlin. However, Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trials for specific reasons:\n\nThe city had been the location of the Nazi Party's Nuremberg rallies and the laws stripping Jews of their citizenship were passed there. There was symbolic value in making it the place of Nazi demise.\nThe Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few that had remained largely intact despite extensive Allied bombing of Germany). The already large courtroom was reasonably easily expanded by the removal of the wall at the end opposite the bench, thereby incorporating the adjoining room. A large prison was also part of the complex.\nAs a compromise, it was agreed that Berlin would become the permanent seat of the International Military Tribunal and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg. Due to the Cold War, subsequent trials never took place.Following the trials, in October 1946, several prominent German Nazi politicians and military leaders were executed in Nuremberg.\nThe same courtroom in Nuremberg was the venue of the Nuremberg Military Tribunals, organized by the United States as occupying power in the area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSeveral old villages now belong to the city, for example Grossgr\u00fcndlach, Kraftshof, Thon, and Neunhof in the north-west; Ziegelstein in the northeast, Altenfurt and Fischbach in the south-east; and Katzwang, Kornburg in the south. Langwasser is a modern suburb.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNuremberg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) with a certain humid continental influence (Dfb), categorized in the latter by the 0 \u00b0C isotherm. The city's climate is influenced by its inland position and higher altitude. Winters are changeable, with either mild or cold weather: the average temperature is around \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) to 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F), while summers are generally warm, mostly around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the afternoon. Precipitation is evenly spread throughout the year, although February and April tend to be a bit drier whereas July tends to have more rainfall.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNuremberg has been a destination for immigrants. 39.5% of the residents had an immigrant background in 2010 (counted with MigraPro).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nNuremberg for many people is still associated with its traditional gingerbread (Lebkuchen) products, sausages, and handmade toys. Pocket watches \u2014 Nuremberg eggs \u2014 were made here in the 16th century by Peter Henlein. Only one of the districts in the 1797-1801 sample was early industrial; the economic structure of the region around Nuremberg was dominated by metal and glass manufacturing, reflected by a share of nearly 50% handicrafts and workers. In the 19th century Nuremberg became the \"industrial heart\" of Bavaria with companies such as Siemens and MAN establishing a strong base in the city.  Nuremberg is still an important industrial centre with a strong standing in the markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Items manufactured in the area include electrical equipment, mechanical and optical products, motor vehicles, writing and drawing paraphernalia, stationery products and printed materials.\nThe city is also strong in the fields of automation, energy and medical technology. Siemens is still the largest industrial employer in the Nuremberg region but a good third of German market research agencies are also located in the city. The Nuremberg International Toy Fair is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nNuremberg is Bavaria\u2019s second largest city after Munich, and a popular tourist destination for foreigners and Germans alike. It was a leading city 500 years ago, but 90% of the town was destroyed in 1945 during the war. After World War II, many medieval-style areas of the town were rebuilt.\n\n\n===== Attractions =====\nBeyond its main attractions of the Imperial Castle, St. Lorenz Church, and Nazi Trial grounds, there are 54 different museums for arts and culture, history, science and technology, family and children, and more niche categories, where visitors can see the world's oldest globe (built in 1492), a 500-year-old Madonna, and Renaissance-era German art. There are several types of tours offered in the city, including historic tours, those that are Nazi-focused, underground and night tours, walking tours, sightseeing buses, self guided tours, and an old town tour on a mini train. Nuremberg also offers several parks and green areas, as well as indoor activities such as bowling, rock wall climbing, escape rooms, cart racing, and mini golf, theaters and cinemas, pools and thermal spas. There are also six nearby amusement parks. The city's tourism board sells the Nurnberg Card which allows for free use of public transportation and free entry to all museums and attractions in Nuremberg for a two-day period.\n\n\n===== Culinary Tourism =====\nNuremberg is also a destination for food lovers. Culinary tourists can taste the city's famous lebkuchen, gingerbread, local beer, and N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrstchen, or Nuremberg sausages. There are hundreds of restaurants for all tastes, including traditional franconian restaurants and beer gardens. Also offers 17 vegan and vegetarian restaurants, seven fully organic restaurants. Nuremberg also boasts a two Michelin Star rated restaurant, Essigbr\u00e4tlein.\n\n\n===== Pedestrian zones =====\nLike many European cities, Nuremberg offers a pedestrian-only zone covering a large portion of the old town, which is a main destination for shopping and specialty retail, including year-round Christmas stores where tourists and locals alike can purchase Christmas ornaments, gifts, decorations, and additions to their toy Christmas villages. The Craftsmen's Courtyard, or Handwerkerhof, is another tourist shopping destination in the style of a medieval village. It houses several local family-run businesses which sell handcrafted items from glass, wood, leather, pottery, and precious metals. The Handwerkerhof is also home to traditional German restaurants and beer gardens.The Pedestrian zones of Nuremberg host festivals and markets throughout the year, most well known being Christkindlesmarkt, Germany's largest Christmas market and the gingerbread capital of the world. Visitors to the Christmas market can peruse the hundreds of stalls and purchase local wood crafts, nutcrackers, smokers, and prune people, while sampling Christmas sweets and traditional gluhwein.\n\n\n===== Hospitality =====\nIn 2017, Nuremberg saw a total of 3.3 million overnight stays, a record for the town, and is expected to have surpassed that in 2018, with more growth in tourism anticipated in the coming years. There are over 175 registered places of accommodation in Nuremberg, ranging from hostels to luxury hotels, bed and breakfasts, to multi-hundred room properties. As of 19 April 2019, Nuremberg had 306 AirBnB listings.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nNuremberg was an early centre of humanism, science, printing, and mechanical invention. The city contributed much to the science of astronomy. In 1471 Johannes Mueller of K\u00f6nigsberg (Bavaria), later called Regiomontanus, built an astronomical observatory in Nuremberg and published many important astronomical charts.\nIn 1515, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, a native of Nuremberg, created woodcuts of the first maps of the stars of the northern and southern hemispheres, producing the first printed star charts, which had been ordered by Johannes Stabius. Around 1515 D\u00fcrer also published the \"Stabiussche Weltkarte\", the first perspective drawing of the terrestrial globe.Printers and publishers have a long history in Nuremberg. Many of these publishers worked with well-known artists of the day to produce books that could also be considered works of art. In 1470 Anton Koberger opened Europe's first print shop in Nuremberg. In 1493, he published the Nuremberg Chronicles, also known as the World Chronicles (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated history of the world from the creation to the present day. It was written in the local Franconian dialect by Hartmann Schedel and had illustrations by Michael Wohlgemuth, Wilhelm Pleydenwurff, and Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Others furthered geographical knowledge and travel by map making. Notable among these was navigator and geographer Martin Behaim, who made the first world globe.\nSculptors such as Veit Stoss, Adam Kraft and Peter Vischer are also associated with Nuremberg.\nComposed of prosperous artisans, the guilds of the Meistersingers flourished here. Richard Wagner made their most famous member, Hans Sachs, the hero of his opera Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel was born here and was organist of St. Sebaldus Church.\nThe academy of fine arts situated in Nuremberg is the oldest art academy in central Europe and looks back to a tradition of 350 years of artistic education.\nNuremberg is also famous for its Christkindlesmarkt (Christmas market), which draws well over a million shoppers each year.  The market is famous for its handmade ornaments and delicacies.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n \nGermanisches Nationalmuseum\nHouse of Albrecht D\u00fcrer\nKunsthalle N\u00fcrnberg\nKunstverein N\u00fcrnberg\nNeues Museum N\u00fcrnberg (Modern Art Museum)\nNuremberg Toy Museum\nNuremberg Transport Museum\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nThe Nuremberg State Theatre, founded in 1906, is dedicated to all types of opera, ballet and stage theatre.

The State Philharmonic Nuremberg (Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg) is the orchestra of the State Theatre. Its name was changed in 2011 from its previous name: The Nuremberg Philharmonic (N\u00fcrnberger Philharmoniker). It is the second-largest opera orchestra in Bavaria. Besides opera performances, it also presents its own subscription concert series in the Meistersingerhalle. Christof Perick was the principal conductor of the orchestra between 2006\u20132011. Marcus Bosch heads the orchestra since September 2011  .\nThe Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra (N\u00fcrnberger Symphoniker) performs around 100 concerts a year to a combined annual audience of more than 180,000.

In the centre of the city, on the bank of the river Pegnitz, stands the Hospital of the Holy Spirit. Founded in 1332, this is one of the largest hospitals of the Middle Ages. Lepers were kept here at some distance from the other patients. It now houses elderly persons and a restaurant.\nThe Hauptmarkt, dominated by the front of the unique Gothic Frauenkirche (Our Lady's Church), provides a picturesque setting for the famous Christmas market. A main attraction on the square is the Gothic Sch\u00f6ner Brunnen (Beautiful Fountain) which was erected around 1385 but subsequently replaced with a replica (the original fountain is kept in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum). The unchanged Renaissance bridge Fleischbr\u00fccke crosses the Pegnitz nearby.\nThe Gothic Lorenzkirche (St. Laurence church) dominates the southern part of the walled city and is one of the most important buildings in Nuremberg. The main body was built around 1270\u20131350.\nThe even earlier and equally impressive Sebalduskirche is St. Lorenz's counterpart in the northern part of the old city.\nThe church of the former Katharinenkloster is preserved as a ruin, the charterhouse (Kartause) is integrated into the building of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum and the choir of the former Franziskanerkirche is part of a modern building.\nOther churches located inside the city walls are: St. Laurence's, Saint Clare's, Saint Martha's, Saint James the Greater's, Saint Giles's, and Saint Elisabeth's.\nThe Germanisches Nationalmuseum is Germany's largest museum of cultural history, among its exhibits are works of famous painters such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Rembrandt, and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner.\nThe Neues Museum N\u00fcrnberg is a museum for modern and contemporary art.\nThe Walburga Chapel and the Romanesque Doppelkapelle (Chapel with two floors) are part of Nuremberg Castle.\nThe Johannisfriedhof is a medieval cemetery, containing many old graves (Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Willibald Pirckheimer, and others).

They won their first regional title in the Southern German championship in 1916 closely followed by their first national title in 1920. Besides the eleven regional championships they won they were the German championship for a total of seven times. With this they held the record for the most German championship titles until 1986 when the current record holder FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen surpassed them.  The current chairmen are Nils Rossow and Robert Palikuca. They play in Max-Morlock-Stadion which was refurbished for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and accommodates 50,000 spectators. \n\nGerman Champion: 1920, 1921, 1924, 1925, 1927, 1936, 1948, 1961, 1968\nGerman Cup: 1935, 1939, 1962, 2007TuS Bar Kochba is a league that was founded in 1913 as a social-sport club for the Jewish community in N\u00fcrnberg.

Since then, teams from Nuremberg have attempted to return to Germany's elite league. The recently founded N\u00fcrnberg Falcons BC have already established themselves as one of the main teams in Germany's second division ProA and aim to take on the heritage of the SELLBYTEL Baskets N\u00fcrnberg.

        "wiki": "The Nuremberg trials (German: N\u00fcrnberger Prozesse) were a series of military tribunals held after World War II by the Allied forces under international law and the laws of war. The trials were most notable for the prosecution of prominent members of the political, military, judicial, and economic leadership of Nazi Germany, who planned, carried out, or otherwise participated in the Holocaust and other war crimes. The trials were held in Nuremberg, Germany, and their decisions marked a turning point between classical and contemporary international law.\nThe first and best known of the trials was that of the major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT).  It was described as \"the greatest trial in history\" by Sir Norman Birkett, one of the British judges present throughout. Held between 20 November 1945 and 1 October 1946, the Tribunal was given the task of trying 24 of the most important political and military leaders of the Third Reich. Primarily treated here is the first trial, conducted by the International Military Tribunal. Further trials of lesser war criminals were conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 at the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunal (NMT), which included the Doctors' trial and the Judges' Trial.\nThe categorization of the crimes and the constitution of the court represented a juridical advance that would be followed afterward by the United Nations for the development of an international jurisprudence in matters of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and wars of aggression, and led to the creation of the International Criminal Court. For the first time in international law, the Nuremberg indictments also mention genocide (count three, war crimes: \"the extermination of racial and national groups, against the civilian populations of certain occupied territories in order to destroy particular races and classes of people and national, racial, or religious groups, particularly Jews, Poles, and Gypsies and others.\")\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nA precedent for trying those accused of war crimes had been set at the end of World War I in the Leipzig War Crimes Trials held in May to July 1921 before the Reichsgericht (German Supreme Court) in Leipzig, although these had been on a very limited scale and largely regarded as ineffectual. At the beginning of 1940, the Polish government-in-exile asked the British and French governments to condemn the German invasion of their country. The British initially declined to do so; however, in April 1940, a joint declaration was issued by the British, French and Polish. Relatively bland because of Anglo-French reservations, it proclaimed the trio's \"desire to make a formal and public protest to the conscience of the world against the action of the German government whom they must hold responsible for these crimes which cannot remain unpunished.\"Three-and-a-half years later, the stated intention to punish the Germans was much more trenchant. On 1 November 1943, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States published their \"Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe\", which gave a \"full warning\" that, when the Nazis were defeated, the Allies would \"pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth ... in order that justice may be done. ... The above declaration is without prejudice to the case of the major war criminals whose offences have no particular geographical location and who will be punished by a joint decision of the Government of the Allies.\" This intention by the Allies to dispense justice was reiterated at the Yalta Conference and at Potsdam in 1945.British War Cabinet documents, released on 2 January 2006, showed that as early as December 1944 the Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, had then advocated a policy of summary execution in some circumstances, with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles, being dissuaded from this only by talks with US and Soviet leaders later in the war.\n\nIn late 1943, during the Tripartite Dinner Meeting at the Tehran Conference, the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, proposed executing 50,000\u2013100,000 German staff officers. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt joked that perhaps 49,000 would do. Churchill, believing them to be serious, denounced the idea of \"the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country\" and that he would rather be \"taken out in the courtyard and shot\" himself than partake in any such action. However, he also stated that war criminals must pay for their crimes and that, in accordance with the Moscow Document which he himself had written, they should be tried at the places where the crimes were committed. Churchill was vigorously opposed to executions \"for political purposes.\" According to the minutes of a meeting between Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta, on 4 February 1945, at the Livadia Palace, President Roosevelt \"said that he had been very much struck by the extent of German destruction in Crimea and therefore he was more bloodthirsty in regard to the Germans than he had been a year ago, and he hoped that Marshal Stalin would again propose a toast to the execution of 50,000 officers of the German Army.\"Henry Morgenthau Jr., US Secretary of the Treasury, suggested a plan for the total denazification of Germany; this was known as the Morgenthau Plan. The plan advocated the forced de-industrialisation of Germany and the summary execution of so-called \"arch-criminals\", i.e. the major war criminals. Roosevelt initially supported this plan, and managed to convince Churchill to support it in a less drastic form. Later, details were leaked generating widespread condemnation by the nation's newspapers. Roosevelt, aware of strong public disapproval, abandoned the plan, but did not adopt an alternative position on the matter. The demise of the Morgenthau Plan created the need for an alternative method of dealing with the Nazi leadership. The plan for the \"Trial of European War Criminals\" was drafted by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and the War Department. Following Roosevelt's death in April 1945, the new president, Harry S. Truman, gave strong approval for a judicial process. After a series of negotiations between Britain, the US, Soviet Union, and France, details of the trial were worked out. The trials were to commence on 20 November 1945, in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Creation of the courts ==\nOn 20 April 1942, representatives from the nine countries occupied by Germany met in London to draft the \"Inter-Allied Resolution on German War Crimes\". At the meetings in Tehran (1943), Yalta (1945), and Potsdam (1945), the three major wartime powers, the United Kingdom, United States, and the Soviet Union, agreed on the format of punishment for those responsible for war crimes during World War II. France was also awarded a place on the tribunal. The legal basis for the trial was established by the London Charter, which was agreed upon by the four so-called Great Powers on 8 August 1945,  and which restricted the trial to \"punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis countries.\"\nSome 200 German war crimes defendants were tried at Nuremberg, and 1,600 others were tried under the traditional channels of military justice. The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany. Political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council which, having sovereign power over Germany, could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939.\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nLeipzig and Luxembourg were briefly considered as the location for the trial. The Soviet Union had wanted the trials to take place in Berlin, as the capital city of the 'fascist conspirators', but Nuremberg was chosen as the site for two reasons, with the first one having been the decisive factor:\nThe Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few buildings that had remained largely intact through extensive Allied bombing of Germany), and a large prison was also part of the complex.\nNuremberg was considered the ceremonial birthplace of the Nazi Party. It had hosted the Party's annual propaganda rallies and the Reichstag session that passed the Nuremberg Laws. Thus it was considered a fitting place to mark the Party's symbolic demise.As a compromise with the Soviets, it was agreed that while the location of the trial would be Nuremberg, Berlin would be the official home of the Tribunal authorities. It was also agreed that France would become the permanent seat of the IMT and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg.Most of the accused had previously been detained at Camp Ashcan, a processing station and interrogation center in Luxembourg, and were moved to Nuremberg for the trial.\n\n\n=== Participants ===\nEach of the four countries provided one judge and an alternative, as well as a prosecutor.\n\n\n==== Judges ====\nMajor General Iona Nikitchenko (Soviet main)\nLieutenant Colonel Alexander Volchkov (Soviet alternate)\nLord Justice Colonel Sir Geoffrey Lawrence (British main), President of the Tribunal\nSir Norman Birkett (British alternate)\nFrancis Biddle (American main)\nJohn J. Parker (American alternate)\nEdward Francis Carter (American alternate)\nProfessor Henri Donnedieu de Vabres (French main)\nRobert Falco (French alternate)\n\n\n==== Chief prosecutors ====\nAttorney General Sir Hartley Shawcross (United Kingdom)\nAssociate Justice Robert H. Jackson (United States)\nLieutenant-General Roman Andreyevich Rudenko (Soviet Union)\nFran\u00e7ois de Menthon, later replaced by Auguste Champetier de Ribes (France)Assisting Jackson were the lawyers Telford Taylor, William S. Kaplan and Thomas J. Dodd, and Richard Sonnenfeldt, a US Army interpreter. Assisting Shawcross were Major Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe and Sir John Wheeler-Bennett. Mervyn Griffith-Jones, who was later to become famous as the chief prosecutor in the Lady Chatterley's Lover obscenity trial, was also on Shawcross's team. Shawcross also recruited a young barrister, Anthony Marreco, who was the son of a friend of his, to help the British team with the heavy workload.\n\n\n==== Defence counsel ====\nThe vast majority of the defense attorneys were German lawyers. These included Georg Fr\u00f6schmann, Heinz Fritz (Hans Fritzsche), Otto Kranzb\u00fchler (Karl D\u00f6nitz), Otto Pannenbecker (Wilhelm Frick), Alfred Thoma (Alfred Rosenberg), Kurt Kauffmann (Ernst Kaltenbrunner), Hans Laternser (general staff and high command), Franz Exner (Alfred Jodl), Alfred Seidl (Hans Frank), Otto Stahmer (Hermann G\u00f6ring), Walter Ballas (Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach), Hans Fl\u00e4chsner (Albert Speer), G\u00fcnther von Rohrscheidt (Rudolf Hess), Egon Kubuschok (Franz von Papen), Robert Servatius (Fritz Sauckel), Fritz Sauter (Joachim von Ribbentrop), Walther Funk (Baldur von Schirach), Hanns Marx (Julius Streicher), Otto Nelte (Wilhelm Keitel), and Herbert Kraus/Rudolph Dix (both working for Hjalmar Schacht). The main counsel were supported by a total of 70 assistants, clerks and lawyers. The defense witnesses included several men who took part in war crimes themselves during World War II, such as Rudolf H\u00f6ss. The men testifying for the defense hoped to receive more lenient sentences. All of the men testifying on behalf of the defense were found guilty on several counts.\n\n\n== The trial ==\nThe International Military Tribunal was opened on 19 November 1945 in the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg. The first session was presided over by the Soviet judge, Nikitchenko. The prosecution entered indictments against 24 major war criminals and seven organizations \u2013 the leadership of the Nazi party, the Reich Cabinet, the Schutzstaffel (SS), Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the Gestapo, the Sturmabteilung (SA) and the \"General Staff and High Command\", comprising several categories of senior military officers. These organizations were to be declared \"criminal\" if found guilty.\nThe indictments were for:\n\nParticipation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of a crime against peace\nPlanning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace\nParticipating in War crimes\nCrimes against humanityThe 24 accused were, with respect to each charge, either indicted but not convicted (I), indicted and found guilty (G), or not charged (\u2014), as listed below by defendant, charge, and eventual outcome:\n\n\n== Intelligence tests and psychiatric assessments ==\nThe Rorschach test was administered to the defendants, along with the Thematic Apperception Test and a German adaptation of the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Test. All were scored as having above average intelligence, several considerably so.\n\nThroughout the trials, specifically between January and July 1946, the defendants and a number of witnesses were interviewed by American psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn.

Twelve of the accused were sentenced to death, seven received prison sentences (ranging from 10 years to life sentence), three were acquitted, and two were not charged.\n\n\n== Executions ==\n\nThe death sentences were carried out on 16 October 1946 by hanging using the standard drop method instead of long drop. The U.S. Army denied claims that the drop length was too short, which may cause the condemned to die slowly from strangulation instead of quickly from a broken neck, but evidence remains that some of the condemned men choked in agony for 14 to 28 minutes. The executioner was John C. Woods. The executions took place in the gymnasium of the court building (demolished in 1983).Although the rumor has long persisted that the bodies were taken to Dachau and burned there, they were actually incinerated in a crematorium in Munich, and the ashes scattered over the river Isar. The French judges suggested that the military condemned (G\u00f6ring, Keitel and Jodl) be shot by a firing squad, as is standard for military courts-martial, but this was opposed by Biddle and the Soviet judges, who argued that the military officers had violated their military ethos and were not worthy of the more dignified death by shooting. The prisoners sentenced to incarceration were transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947.\nOf the 12 defendants sentenced to death by hanging, two were not hanged: Martin Bormann was convicted in absentia (he had, unknown to the Allies, died while trying to escape from Berlin in May 1945), and Hermann G\u00f6ring committed suicide the night before the execution. The remaining 10 defendants sentenced to death were hanged.\n\n\n== Nuremberg principles ==\nThe definition of what constitutes a war crime is described by the Nuremberg principles, a set of guidelines document which was created as a result of the trial. The medical experiments conducted by German doctors and prosecuted in the so-called Doctors' Trial led to the creation of the Nuremberg Code to control future trials involving human subjects, a set of research ethics principles for human experimentation.\nOf the indicted organizations the following were found not to be criminal:\n\nReichsregierung\n\"The General Staff and High Command\" was found not to comprise a group or organization as defined by Article 9 of the London Charter 14 Members of the High Command were tried as Criminals at the high command trial case 12 of the Subsequent Nuremberg ProceedingsSturmabteilung\n\n\n== Subsidiary and related trials ==\nThe American authorities conducted subsequent Nuremberg Trials in their occupied zone.\nOther trials conducted after the first Nuremberg trial include the following:\n\nAuschwitz trial\nBelsen trial\nBelzec trial before the 1st Munich District Court in the mid-1960s, of eight SS men of the Belzec extermination camp\nChe\u0142mno trials of the Che\u0142mno extermination camp personnel, held in Poland and in Germany. The cases were decided almost twenty years apart\nDachau trials\nFrankfurt Auschwitz trials\nMajdanek trials, the longest Nazi war crimes trial in history, spanning over 30 years\nMauthausen-Gusen camp trials\nHamburg Ravensbr\u00fcck trials\nSobib\u00f3r trial held in Hagen, Germany, in 1965 against the SS men of the Sobibor extermination camp\nTreblinka trials in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n\n\n== American role in the trial ==\n\nWhile Sir Geoffrey Lawrence of Britain was the judge who was chosen to serve as the president of the court, arguably, the most prominent of the judges at the trial was his American counterpart, Francis Biddle. Prior to the trial, Biddle had been Attorney General of the United States but had been asked to resign by Truman earlier in 1945.Some accounts argue that Truman had appointed Biddle as the main American judge for the trial as an apology for asking for his resignation. Ironically, Biddle was known during his time as Attorney General for opposing the idea of prosecuting Nazi leaders for crimes committed before the beginning of the war, even sending out a memorandum on 5 January 1945 on the subject. The note also expressed Biddle's opinion that instead of proceeding with the original plan for prosecuting entire organizations, there should simply be more trials that would prosecute specific offenders.Biddle soon changed his mind, as he approved a modified version of the plan on 21 January 1945, likely due to time constraints, since the trial would be one of the main issues which was to be discussed at Yalta. At trial, the Nuremberg tribunal ruled that any member of an organization convicted of war crimes, such as the SS or Gestapo, who had joined after 1939 would be considered a war criminal. Biddle managed to convince the other judges to make an exemption for any member who was drafted or had no knowledge of the crimes being committed by these organizations.Justice Robert H. Jackson played an important role in not only the trial itself, but also in the creation of the International Military Tribunal, as he led the American delegation to London that, in the summer of 1945, argued in favour of prosecuting the Nazi leadership as a criminal conspiracy. According to Airey Neave, Jackson was also the one behind the prosecution's decision to include membership in any of the six criminal organizations in the indictments at the trial, though the IMT rejected this on the grounds that it was wholly without precedent in either international law or the domestic laws of any of the Allies. Jackson also attempted to have Alfried Krupp be tried in place of his father, Gustav, and even suggested that Alfried volunteer to be tried in his father's place. Both proposals were rejected by the IMT, particularly by Lawrence and Biddle, and some sources indicate that this resulted in Jackson being viewed unfavourably by the latter.Thomas Dodd was a prosecutor for the United States. There was an immense amount of evidence backing the prosecutors' case, especially since meticulous records of the Nazis' actions had been kept. There were records taken in by the prosecutors that had signatures from specific Nazis signing for everything from stationery supplies to Zyklon B gas, which was used to kill the inmates of the deathcamps. Thomas Dodd showed a series of pictures to the courtroom after reading through the documents of crimes committed by the defendants. The showing consisted of pictures displaying the atrocities performed by the defendants. The pictures had been gathered when the inmates were liberated from the concentration camps.Henry F. Gerecke, a Lutheran pastor, and Sixtus O'Connor, a Roman Catholic priest, were sent to minister to the Nazi defendants. Photographs of the trial were taken by a team of about a dozen US Army still photographers, under the direction of chief photographer Ray D'Addario.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nThe Tribunal is celebrated for establishing that \"crimes against international law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced.\" The creation of the IMT was followed by trials of lesser Nazi officials and the trials of Nazi doctors, who performed experiments on people in prison camps. It served as the model for the International Military Tribunal for the Far East which tried Japanese officials for crimes against peace and crimes against humanity. It also served as the model for the Eichmann trial and for present-day courts at The Hague, for trying crimes committed during the Balkan wars of the early 1990s, and at Arusha, for trying the people responsible for the genocide in Rwanda.\nThe Nuremberg trials had a great influence on the development of international criminal law. The Conclusions of the Nuremberg trials served as models for:\n\nThe Genocide Convention, 1948.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948.\nThe Nuremberg Principles, 1950.\nThe Convention on the Abolition of the Statute of Limitations on War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, 1968.\nThe Geneva Convention on the Laws and Customs of War, 1949; its supplementary protocols, 1977.The International Law Commission, acting on the request of the United Nations General Assembly, produced in 1950 the report Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the N\u00fcrnberg Tribunal and in the Judgement of the Tribunal (Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1950, vol. II). See Nuremberg Principles.\nThe influence of the tribunal can also be seen in the proposals for a permanent international criminal court, and the drafting of international criminal codes, later prepared by the International Law Commission.\nTourists can visit courtroom 600 on days when no trial is on. A permanent exhibition has been dedicated to the trials.\n\n\n=== Establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court ===\nThe Nuremberg trials initiated a movement for the prompt establishment of a permanent international criminal court, eventually leading over fifty years later to the adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. This movement was brought about because during the trials, there were conflicting court methods between the German court system and the U.S. court system. The crime of conspiracy was unheard of in the civil law systems of the Continent. Therefore, the German defense found it unfair to charge the defendants with conspiracy to commit crimes, while the judges from common-law countries were used to doing so.\n It [IMT] was the first successful international criminal court, and has since played a pivotal role in the development of international criminal law and international institutions.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nCritics of the Nuremberg trials argued that the charges against the defendants were only defined as \"crimes\" after they were committed and that therefore the trial was invalid, and thus seen as a form of \"victor's justice\".As Michael Biddiss observed in a 1995 edition of History Today, \"the Nuremberg Trial continues to haunt us. ... It is a question also of the weaknesses and strengths of the proceedings themselves.\"\nQuincy Wright, writing eighteen months after the conclusion of the IMT, explained the opposition to the Tribunal thus:The assumptions underlying the Charter of the United Nations, the Statute of the International Court of Justice, and the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal are far removed from the positivistic assumptions which greatly influenced the thought of international jurists in the nineteenth century. Consequently, the activities of those institutions have frequently been vigorously criticized by positivistic jurists ... [who] have asked: How can principles enunciated by the Nuremberg Tribunal, to take it as an example, be of legal value until most of the states have agreed to a tribunal with jurisdiction to enforce those principles? How could the Nuremberg Tribunal have obtained jurisdiction to find Germany guilty of aggression, when Germany had not consented to the Tribunal? How could the law, first explicitly accepted in the Nuremberg Charter of 1945, have bound the defendants in the trial when they committed the acts for which they were indicted years earlier?Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Harlan Fiske Stone called the Nuremberg trials a fraud. \"(Chief U.S. prosecutor) Jackson is away conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg, ... I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas\", Stone wrote.Jackson, in a letter discussing the weaknesses of the trial, in October 1945 told U.S. President Harry S. Truman that the Allies themselves \"have done or are doing some of the very things we are prosecuting the Germans for. The French are so violating the Geneva Convention in the treatment of prisoners of war that our command is taking back prisoners sent to them. We are prosecuting plunder and our Allies are practising it. We say aggressive war is a crime and one of our allies asserts sovereignty over the Baltic States based on no title except conquest.\"Associate Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas charged that the Allies were guilty of \"substituting power for principle\" at Nuremberg. \"I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled,\" he wrote. \"Law was created ex post facto to suit the passion and clamor of the time.\"U.S. Deputy Chief Counsel Abraham Pomerantz resigned in protest at the low caliber of the judges assigned to try the industrial war criminals, such as those at I.G. Farben.Robert A. Taft, a US Senate Majority Leader from Ohio and son of William Howard Taft, criticized the Nuremberg Trials for trying Nazi war criminals under ex post facto laws, which resulted in his failure to secure the Republican nomination for President in 1948.A number of Germans who agreed with the idea of punishment for war crimes admitted trepidation concerning the trials. A contemporary German jurist said:\n\nThat the defendants at Nuremberg were held responsible, condemned and punished, will seem to most of us initially as a kind of historical justice. However, no one who takes the question of guilt seriously, above all no responsibly thoughtful jurist, will be content with this sensibility nor should they be allowed to be. Justice is not served when the guilty parties are punished in any old way, even if this seems appropriate with regard to their measure of guilt. Justice is only served when the guilty are punished in a way that carefully and conscientiously considers their criminal errors according to the provisions of valid law under the jurisdiction of a legally appointed judge.\nThe validity of the court has been questioned on a number of grounds:\n\n\n=== Legitimacy ===\n\nOne criticism that was made of the IMT was that some treaties were not binding on the Axis powers because they were not signatories. This was addressed in the judgment relating to war crimes and crimes against humanity, which contains an expansion of customary law: \"the [Hague] Convention expressly stated that it was an attempt 'to revise the general laws and customs of war,' which it thus recognised to be then existing, but by 1939 these rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war which are referred to in Article 6 (b) of the [London] Charter.\"\n\n\n== Introduction of extempore simultaneous interpretation ==\n\nThe Nuremberg Trials employed four official languages: English, French, German and Russian. In order to address the complex linguistic issues that clouded over the proceedings, interpretation and translation departments had to be established. However, it was feared that consecutive interpretation would slow down the proceedings significantly. What is therefore unique in both the Nuremberg tribunals and history of the interpretation profession was the introduction of an entirely new technique, extempore simultaneous interpretation. This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter to listen to a speaker in a source (or passive) language and orally translate that speech into another language in real time, that is, simultaneously, through headsets and microphones. Interpreters were split into four sections, one for each official language, with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth (their mother tongue). For instance, the English booth consisted of three interpreters, one working from German into English, one working from French, and one from Russian, etc. Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with consecutive court interpreters. Some of the languages heard over the course of the proceedings included Yiddish, Hungarian, Czech, Ukrainian, and Polish.\nThe equipment used to establish this system was provided by IBM, and included an elaborate setup of cables which were hooked up to headsets and single earphones directly from the four interpreting booths (often referred to as \"the aquarium\"). Four channels existed for each working language, as well as a root channel for the proceedings without interpretation. Switching of channels was controlled by a setup at each table in which the listener merely had to turn a dial in order to switch between languages. People tripping over the floor-laid cables often led to the headsets getting disconnected, with several hours at a time sometimes being taken in order to repair the problem and continue on with the trials.\nInterpreters were recruited and examined by the respective countries in which the official languages were spoken: the United States, United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, as well as in special cases Belgium and the Netherlands. Many were former translators, army personnel, and linguists, some were experienced consecutive interpreters, others were ordinary individuals and even recent secondary school-graduates who led international lives in multilingual environments. It was, and still is believed, that the qualities that made the best interpreters were not just a perfect understanding of two or more languages, but more importantly a broad sense of culture, encyclopedic knowledge, inquisitiveness, as well as a naturally calm disposition.\n\nWith the simultaneous technique being extremely new, interpreters practically trained themselves, but many could not handle the pressure or the psychological strain. Many often had to be replaced, many returned to the translation department, and many left. Serious doubts were given as to whether interpretation provided a fair trial for the defendants, particularly because of fears of mistranslation and errors made on transcripts. The translation department had to also deal with the overwhelming problem of being understaffed and overburdened with an influx of documents that could not be kept up with. More often than not, interpreters were stuck in a session without having proper documents in front of them and were relied upon to do sight translation or double translation of texts, causing further problems and extensive criticism. Other problems that arose included complaints from lawyers and other legal professionals with regard to questioning and cross-examination. Legal professionals were most often appalled at the slower speed at which they had to conduct their task because of the extended time required for interpreters to render an interpretation properly. Additionally, a number of interpreters protested the idea of using vulgar language, especially if it referred to Jews or the conditions of the Nazi concentration camps. Bilingual/trilingual members who attended the trials picked up quickly on this aspect of character and were equally quick to file complaints.\nYet, despite the extensive trial and error, without the interpretation system the trials would not have been possible and in turn revolutionized the way multilingual issues were addressed in tribunals and conferences. A number of the interpreters following the trials were immediately recruited into the newly formed United Nations, while others returned to their ordinary lives, pursued other careers, or worked freelance. Outside the boundaries of the trials, many interpreters continued their positions on weekends interpreting for dinners, private meetings between judges, and excursions between delegates. Others worked as investigators or editors, or aided the translation department when they could, often using it as an opportunity to sharpen their skills and to correct poor interpretations on transcripts before they were available for public record.\nFor further reference, a book titled The Origins of Simultaneous Interpretation: The Nuremberg Trial, written by interpreter Francesca Gaiba, was published by the University of Ottawa Press in 1998.\nToday, all major international organizations, as well as any conference or government that uses more than one official language, uses extempore simultaneous interpretation. Notable bodies include the Parliament of Kosovo with three official languages, the Parliament of Canada with two official languages, the Parliament of South Africa with eleven official languages, the European Union with twenty-four official languages, and the United Nations with six official working languages.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNuremberg Trials bibliography\nCommand responsibility\nDora Trial\nEichmann in Jerusalem\nEinsatzgruppen Trial\nInternational Military Tribunal for the Far East\nJudgment at Nuremberg (1961 film)\nNuremberg (2000 film)\nList of Axis personnel indicted for war crimes\nNuremberg Diary, an account of observations and discussions with the defendants by an American psychiatrist\nResearch Materials: Max Planck Society Archive\nSuperior orders\nTokyo War Crimes Tribunal\nTransitional justice\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n==== Avalon Project ====\nThese citations refer to documents at \"The International Military Tribunal for Germany\".

On the Pegnitz River (from its confluence with the Rednitz in F\u00fcrth onwards: Regnitz, a tributary of the River Main) and the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal, it lies in the Bavarian administrative region of Middle Franconia, and is the largest city and the unofficial capital of Franconia. Nuremberg forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring cities of F\u00fcrth, Erlangen and Schwabach with a total population of 798,867 (2018), while the larger Nuremberg Metropolitan Region has approximately 3.6 million inhabitants. The city lies about 170 kilometres (110 mi) north of Munich. It is the largest city in the East Franconian dialect area (colloquially: \"Franconian\"; German: Fr\u00e4nkisch), Nuremberg was one of the host cities of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nThere are many institutions of higher education in the city, including the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg). With 39,780 students in 2017, it is Bavaria's third-largest and Germany's 11th-largest university, with campuses in Erlangen and Nuremberg and a university hospital in Erlangen (Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen). Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg Georg Simon Ohm and Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg are also located within the city. Nuremberg Airport (Flughafen N\u00fcrnberg \u201cAlbrecht D\u00fcrer\u201c) is the second-busiest airport in Bavaria after Munich Airport, and the tenth-busiest airport in Germany.\nStaatstheater N\u00fcrnberg is one of the five Bavarian state theatres, showing operas, operettas, musicals, and ballets (main venue: Nuremberg Opera House), plays (main venue: Schauspielhaus N\u00fcrnberg), as well as concerts (main venue: Meistersingerhalle). Its orchestra, Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg, is Bavaria's second-largest opera orchestra after the Bavarian State Opera's Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich. Nuremberg is the birthplace of Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Johann Pachelbel.\nNuremberg was the site of major Nazi rallies, and it provided the site for the Nuremberg trials, which held to account many major Nazi officials.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe first documentary mention of the city, in 1050, mentions Nuremberg as the location of an Imperial castle between the East Franks and the Bavarian March of the Nordgau. From 1050 to 1571 the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade-routes. King Conrad III (reigning as King of Germany from 1138 to 1152) established the Burgraviate of Nuremberg, with the first burgraves coming from the Austrian House of Raab. With the extinction of their male line around 1190, the last Raabs count's son-in-law, Frederick I from the House of Hohenzollern, inherited the burgraviate in 1192.\nFrom the late 12th century to the Interregnum (1254\u201373), however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Hohenstaufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor (German: Reichsschulthei\u00df) from 1173/74. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city.\n \nNuremberg is often referred to as the \"unofficial capital\" of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly because the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg played an important role in the administration of the empire. The increasing demands of the Imperial court and the increasing importance of the city attracted increased trade and commerce in Nuremberg. In 1219 Emperor Frederick II granted the Gro\u00dfen Freiheitsbrief ('Great Letter of Freedom'), including town rights, Imperial immediacy (Reichsfreiheit), the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy - almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves. Nuremberg soon became, with Augsburg, one of the two great trade-centers on the route from Italy to Northern Europe.\nIn 1298 the Jews of the town were falsely accused of having desecrated the host, and 698 of them were killed in one of the many Rintfleisch massacres. Behind the massacre of 1298 was also the desire to combine the northern and southern parts of the city, which were divided by the Pegnitz. The Jews of the German lands suffered many massacres during the plague pandemic of the mid-14th century.\nIn 1349 Nuremberg's Jews suffered a pogrom. They were burned at the stake or expelled, and a marketplace was built over the former Jewish quarter. The plague returned to the city in 1405, 1435, 1437, 1482, 1494, 1520 and 1534.\n\nThe largest growth of Nuremberg occurred in the 14th century. Charles IV's Golden Bull of 1356, naming Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet, made Nuremberg one of the three most important cities of the Empire. Charles was the patron of the Frauenkirche, built between 1352 and 1362 (the architect was likely Peter Parler), where the Imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg. The royal and Imperial connection grew stronger in 1423 when the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg granted the Imperial regalia to be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 1796, when the advance of French troops required their removal to Regensburg and thence to Vienna.In 1349 the members of the guilds unsuccessfully rebelled against the patricians in a Handwerkeraufstand ('Craftsmen's Uprising'), supported by merchants and some by councillors, leading to a ban on any self-organisation of the artisans in the city, abolishing the guilds that were customary elsewhere in Europe; the unions were then dissolved, and the oligarchs remained in power while Nuremberg was a free city (until the early-19th century). Charles IV conferred upon the city the right to conclude alliances independently, thereby placing it upon a politically equal footing with the princes of the Empire. Frequent fights took place with the burgraves - without, however, inflicting lasting damage upon the city. After fire destroyed the castle in 1420 during a feud between Frederick IV (from 1417 Margrave of Brandenburg) and the duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, the city purchased the ruins and the forest belonging to the castle (1427), resulting in the city's total sovereignty within its borders.\nThrough these and other acquisitions the city accumulated considerable territory. The Hussite Wars (1419-1434), a recurrence of the Black Death in 1437, and the First Margrave War (1449-1450) led to a severe fall in population in the mid-15th century. Siding with Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria-Munich, in the Landshut War of Succession of 1503-1505 led the city to gain substantial territory, resulting in lands of 25 sq mi (64.7 km2), making it one of the largest Imperial cities.During the Middle Ages, Nuremberg fostered a rich, varied, and influential literary culture.\n\n\n=== Early modern age ===\n\nThe cultural flowering of Nuremberg, in the 15th and 16th centuries, made it the centre of the German Renaissance. In 1525, Nuremberg accepted the Protestant Reformation, and in 1532, the Nuremberg Religious Peace was signed there, preventing war between Protestants and Catholics for 15 years. During the 1552 revolution against Charles V, Nuremberg tried to purchase its neutrality, but the city was attacked without a declaration of war and was forced into a disadvantageous peace. At the Peace of Augsburg, the possessions of the Protestants were confirmed by the Emperor, their religious privileges extended and their independence from the Bishop of Bamberg affirmed, while the 1520s' secularisation of the monasteries was also approved. Families like the Tucher, Imhoff or Haller run trading businesses across Europe, similar to the Fugger and Welser families from Augsburg, although on a slightly smaller scale. \n\nThe state of affairs in the early 16th century, increased trade routes elsewhere and the ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade. During the Thirty Years' War, frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and League soldiers, the financial costs of the war and the cessation of trade caused irreparable damage to the city and a near-halving of the population. In 1632, the city, occupied by the forces of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, was besieged by the army of Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein. The city declined after the war and recovered its importance only in the 19th century, when it grew as an industrial centre. Even after the Thirty Years' War, however, there was a late flowering of architecture and culture \u2013 secular Baroque architecture is exemplified in the layout of the civic gardens built outside the city walls, and in the Protestant city's rebuilding of St. Egidien church, destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century, considered a significant contribution to the baroque church architecture of Middle Franconia.After the Thirty Years' War, Nuremberg attempted to remain detached from external affairs, but contributions were demanded for the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War and restrictions of imports and exports deprived the city of many markets for its manufactures. The Bavarian elector, Charles Theodore, appropriated part of the land obtained by the city during the Landshut War of Succession, to which Bavaria had maintained its claim; Prussia also claimed part of the territory. Realising its weakness, the city asked to be incorporated into Prussia but Frederick William II refused, fearing to offend Austria, Russia and France. At the Imperial diet in 1803, the independence of Nuremberg was affirmed, but on the signing of the Confederation of the Rhine on 12 July 1806, it was agreed to hand the city over to Bavaria from 8 September, with Bavaria guaranteeing the amortisation of the city's 12.5 million guilder public debt.\n\n\n=== After the Napoleonic Wars ===\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the city's trade and commerce revived; the skill of its inhabitants together with its favourable situation soon made the city prosperous, particularly after its public debt had been acknowledged as a part of the Bavarian national debt. Having been incorporated into a Catholic country, the city was compelled to refrain from further discrimination against Catholics, who had been excluded from the rights of citizenship. Catholic services had been celebrated in the city by the priests of the Teutonic Order, often under great difficulties. After their possessions had been confiscated by the Bavarian government in 1806, they were given the Frauenkirche on the Market in 1809; in 1810 the first Catholic parish was established, which in 1818 numbered 1,010 souls.In 1817, the city was incorporated into the district of Rezatkreis (named for the river Franconian Rezat), which was renamed to Middle Franconia (German: Mittelfranken) on 1 January 1838. The first German railway, the Bavarian Ludwigsbahn, from Nuremberg to nearby F\u00fcrth, was opened in 1835. The establishment of railways and the incorporation of Bavaria into Zollverein (the 19th-century German Customs Union), commerce and industry opened the way to greater prosperity. In 1852, there were 53,638 inhabitants: 46,441 Protestants and 6,616 Catholics. It subsequently grew to become the more important industrial city of Southern Germany, one of the most prosperous towns of southern Germany, but after the Austro-Prussian War it was given to the Prussia as part of their telegraph stations they had to give up. In 1905, its population, including several incorporated suburbs, was 291,351: 86,943 Catholics, 196,913 Protestants, 3,738 Jews and 3,766 members of other creeds.\n\n\n=== Nazi era ===\n\nNuremberg held great significance during the Nazi Germany era. Because of the city's relevance to the Holy Roman Empire and its position in the centre of Germany, the Nazi Party chose the city to be the site of huge Nazi Party conventions \u2014 the Nuremberg rallies. The rallies were held in 1927, 1929 and annually from  1933 through 1938. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 the Nuremberg rallies became huge Nazi propaganda events, a centre of Nazi ideals. The 1934 rally was filmed by Leni Riefenstahl, and made into a propaganda film called Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will).\nAt the 1935 rally, Hitler specifically ordered the Reichstag to convene at Nuremberg to pass the Nuremberg Laws which revoked German citizenship for all Jews and other non-Aryans. A number of premises were constructed solely for these assemblies, some of which were not finished. Today many examples of Nazi architecture can still be seen in the city. The city was also the home of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher, the publisher of Der St\u00fcrmer.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Nuremberg was the headquarters of Wehrkreis (military district) XIII, and an important site for military production, including aircraft, submarines and tank engines. A subcamp of Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp was located here, and extensively used slave labour. The city was severely damaged in Allied strategic bombing from 1943 to 1945. On 29 March 1944, the RAF endured its heaviest losses in the bombing campaign of Germany. Out of more than 700 planes participating, 106 were shot down or crash-landed on the way home to their bases, and more than 700 men were missing, as many as 545 of them dead. More than 160 became prisoners of war.On 2 January 1945, the medieval city centre was systematically bombed by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Army Air Forces and about ninety percent of it was destroyed in only one hour, with 1,800 residents killed and roughly 100,000 displaced. In February 1945, additional attacks followed. In total, about 6,000 Nuremberg residents are estimated to have been killed in air raids.\nNuremberg was a heavily fortified city that was captured in a fierce battle lasting from 17 to 21 April 1945 by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, 42nd Infantry Division and 45th Infantry Division, which fought house-to-house and street-by-street against determined German resistance, causing further urban devastation to the already bombed and shelled buildings. Despite this intense degree of destruction, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent restored to its pre-war appearance, including the reconstruction of some of its medieval buildings. Much of this reconstructive work and conservation was done by the organisation 'Old Town Friends Nuremberg'. However, over half of the historic look of the center, and especially the northeastern half of the old Imperial Free City was not restored.\n\n\n=== Nuremberg trials ===\n\nBetween 1945 and 1946, German officials involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity were brought before an international tribunal in the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union had wanted these trials to take place in Berlin. However, Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trials for specific reasons:\n\nThe city had been the location of the Nazi Party's Nuremberg rallies and the laws stripping Jews of their citizenship were passed there. There was symbolic value in making it the place of Nazi demise.\nThe Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few that had remained largely intact despite extensive Allied bombing of Germany). The already large courtroom was reasonably easily expanded by the removal of the wall at the end opposite the bench, thereby incorporating the adjoining room. A large prison was also part of the complex.\nAs a compromise, it was agreed that Berlin would become the permanent seat of the International Military Tribunal and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg. Due to the Cold War, subsequent trials never took place.Following the trials, in October 1946, several prominent German Nazi politicians and military leaders were executed in Nuremberg.\nThe same courtroom in Nuremberg was the venue of the Nuremberg Military Tribunals, organized by the United States as occupying power in the area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSeveral old villages now belong to the city, for example Grossgr\u00fcndlach, Kraftshof, Thon, and Neunhof in the north-west; Ziegelstein in the northeast, Altenfurt and Fischbach in the south-east; and Katzwang, Kornburg in the south. Langwasser is a modern suburb.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNuremberg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) with a certain humid continental influence (Dfb), categorized in the latter by the 0 \u00b0C isotherm. The city's climate is influenced by its inland position and higher altitude. Winters are changeable, with either mild or cold weather: the average temperature is around \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) to 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F), while summers are generally warm, mostly around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the afternoon. Precipitation is evenly spread throughout the year, although February and April tend to be a bit drier whereas July tends to have more rainfall.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNuremberg has been a destination for immigrants. 39.5% of the residents had an immigrant background in 2010 (counted with MigraPro).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nNuremberg for many people is still associated with its traditional gingerbread (Lebkuchen) products, sausages, and handmade toys. Pocket watches \u2014 Nuremberg eggs \u2014 were made here in the 16th century by Peter Henlein. Only one of the districts in the 1797-1801 sample was early industrial; the economic structure of the region around Nuremberg was dominated by metal and glass manufacturing, reflected by a share of nearly 50% handicrafts and workers. In the 19th century Nuremberg became the \"industrial heart\" of Bavaria with companies such as Siemens and MAN establishing a strong base in the city.  Nuremberg is still an important industrial centre with a strong standing in the markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Items manufactured in the area include electrical equipment, mechanical and optical products, motor vehicles, writing and drawing paraphernalia, stationery products and printed materials.\nThe city is also strong in the fields of automation, energy and medical technology. Siemens is still the largest industrial employer in the Nuremberg region but a good third of German market research agencies are also located in the city. The Nuremberg International Toy Fair is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nNuremberg is Bavaria\u2019s second largest city after Munich, and a popular tourist destination for foreigners and Germans alike. It was a leading city 500 years ago, but 90% of the town was destroyed in 1945 during the war. After World War II, many medieval-style areas of the town were rebuilt.\n\n\n===== Attractions =====\nBeyond its main attractions of the Imperial Castle, St. Lorenz Church, and Nazi Trial grounds, there are 54 different museums for arts and culture, history, science and technology, family and children, and more niche categories, where visitors can see the world's oldest globe (built in 1492), a 500-year-old Madonna, and Renaissance-era German art. There are several types of tours offered in the city, including historic tours, those that are Nazi-focused, underground and night tours, walking tours, sightseeing buses, self guided tours, and an old town tour on a mini train. Nuremberg also offers several parks and green areas, as well as indoor activities such as bowling, rock wall climbing, escape rooms, cart racing, and mini golf, theaters and cinemas, pools and thermal spas. There are also six nearby amusement parks. The city's tourism board sells the Nurnberg Card which allows for free use of public transportation and free entry to all museums and attractions in Nuremberg for a two-day period.\n\n\n===== Culinary Tourism =====\nNuremberg is also a destination for food lovers. Culinary tourists can taste the city's famous lebkuchen, gingerbread, local beer, and N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrstchen, or Nuremberg sausages. There are hundreds of restaurants for all tastes, including traditional franconian restaurants and beer gardens. Also offers 17 vegan and vegetarian restaurants, seven fully organic restaurants. Nuremberg also boasts a two Michelin Star rated restaurant, Essigbr\u00e4tlein.\n\n\n===== Pedestrian zones =====\nLike many European cities, Nuremberg offers a pedestrian-only zone covering a large portion of the old town, which is a main destination for shopping and specialty retail, including year-round Christmas stores where tourists and locals alike can purchase Christmas ornaments, gifts, decorations, and additions to their toy Christmas villages. The Craftsmen's Courtyard, or Handwerkerhof, is another tourist shopping destination in the style of a medieval village. It houses several local family-run businesses which sell handcrafted items from glass, wood, leather, pottery, and precious metals. The Handwerkerhof is also home to traditional German restaurants and beer gardens.The Pedestrian zones of Nuremberg host festivals and markets throughout the year, most well known being Christkindlesmarkt, Germany's largest Christmas market and the gingerbread capital of the world. Visitors to the Christmas market can peruse the hundreds of stalls and purchase local wood crafts, nutcrackers, smokers, and prune people, while sampling Christmas sweets and traditional gluhwein.\n\n\n===== Hospitality =====\nIn 2017, Nuremberg saw a total of 3.3 million overnight stays, a record for the town, and is expected to have surpassed that in 2018, with more growth in tourism anticipated in the coming years. There are over 175 registered places of accommodation in Nuremberg, ranging from hostels to luxury hotels, bed and breakfasts, to multi-hundred room properties. As of 19 April 2019, Nuremberg had 306 AirBnB listings.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nNuremberg was an early centre of humanism, science, printing, and mechanical invention. The city contributed much to the science of astronomy. In 1471 Johannes Mueller of K\u00f6nigsberg (Bavaria), later called Regiomontanus, built an astronomical observatory in Nuremberg and published many important astronomical charts.\nIn 1515, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, a native of Nuremberg, created woodcuts of the first maps of the stars of the northern and southern hemispheres, producing the first printed star charts, which had been ordered by Johannes Stabius. Around 1515 D\u00fcrer also published the \"Stabiussche Weltkarte\", the first perspective drawing of the terrestrial globe.Printers and publishers have a long history in Nuremberg. Many of these publishers worked with well-known artists of the day to produce books that could also be considered works of art. In 1470 Anton Koberger opened Europe's first print shop in Nuremberg. In 1493, he published the Nuremberg Chronicles, also known as the World Chronicles (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated history of the world from the creation to the present day. It was written in the local Franconian dialect by Hartmann Schedel and had illustrations by Michael Wohlgemuth, Wilhelm Pleydenwurff, and Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Others furthered geographical knowledge and travel by map making. Notable among these was navigator and geographer Martin Behaim, who made the first world globe.\nSculptors such as Veit Stoss, Adam Kraft and Peter Vischer are also associated with Nuremberg.\nComposed of prosperous artisans, the guilds of the Meistersingers flourished here. Richard Wagner made their most famous member, Hans Sachs, the hero of his opera Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel was born here and was organist of St. Sebaldus Church.\nThe academy of fine arts situated in Nuremberg is the oldest art academy in central Europe and looks back to a tradition of 350 years of artistic education.\nNuremberg is also famous for its Christkindlesmarkt (Christmas market), which draws well over a million shoppers each year.  The market is famous for its handmade ornaments and delicacies.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n \nGermanisches Nationalmuseum\nHouse of Albrecht D\u00fcrer\nKunsthalle N\u00fcrnberg\nKunstverein N\u00fcrnberg\nNeues Museum N\u00fcrnberg (Modern Art Museum)\nNuremberg Toy Museum\nNuremberg Transport Museum\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nThe Nuremberg State Theatre, founded in 1906, is dedicated to all types of opera, ballet and stage theatre. During the season 2009/2010, the theatre presented 651 performances for an audience of 240,000 persons. The State Philharmonic Nuremberg (Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg) is the orchestra of the State Theatre. Its name was changed in 2011 from its previous name: The Nuremberg Philharmonic (N\u00fcrnberger Philharmoniker). It is the second-largest opera orchestra in Bavaria. Besides opera performances, it also presents its own subscription concert series in the Meistersingerhalle. Christof Perick was the principal conductor of the orchestra between 2006\u20132011. Marcus Bosch heads the orchestra since September 2011  .\nThe Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra (N\u00fcrnberger Symphoniker) performs around 100 concerts a year to a combined annual audience of more than 180,000. The regular subscription concert series are mostly performed in the Meistersingerhalle but other venues are used as well, including the new concert hall of the Kongresshalle and the Serenadenhof. Alexander Shelley has been the principal conductor of the orchestra since 2009.\nThe Nuremberg International Chamber Music Festival (Internationales Kammermusikfestival N\u00fcrnberg) takes place in early September each year, and in 2011 celebrated its tenth anniversary. Concerts take place around the city; opening and closing events are held in the medieval Burg. The Bardentreffen, an annual folk festival in Nuremberg, has been deemed the largest world music festival in Germany and takes place since 1976. 2014 the Bardentreffen starred 368 artists from 31 nations.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nNuremberg is known for N\u00fcrnberger Bratwurst, which is shorter and thinner than other bratwurst sausages.\nAnother Nuremberg speciality is N\u00fcrnberger Lebkuchen, a kind of gingerbread eaten mainly around Christmas time.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nNuremberg offers 51 public and 6 private elementary schools in nearly all of its districts. Secondary education is offered at 23 Mittelschulen, 12 Realschulen, and 17 Gymnasien (state, city, church, and privately owned). There are also several other providers of secondary education such as Berufsschule, Berufsfachschule, Wirtschaftsschule etc.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\nNuremberg hosts the joint university Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, two Fachhochschulen (Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg and Evangelische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg), an art school (Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste N\u00fcrnberg), and a music conservatoire (Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg). There are also private schools such as the Akademie Deutsche POP N\u00fcrnberg offering higher education.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nNuremberg Castle: the three castles that tower over the city including central burgraves' castle, with Free Reich's buildings to the east, the Imperial castle to the west.\nHeilig-Geist-Spital. In the centre of the city, on the bank of the river Pegnitz, stands the Hospital of the Holy Spirit. Founded in 1332, this is one of the largest hospitals of the Middle Ages. Lepers were kept here at some distance from the other patients. It now houses elderly persons and a restaurant.\nThe Hauptmarkt, dominated by the front of the unique Gothic Frauenkirche (Our Lady's Church), provides a picturesque setting for the famous Christmas market. A main attraction on the square is the Gothic Sch\u00f6ner Brunnen (Beautiful Fountain) which was erected around 1385 but subsequently replaced with a replica (the original fountain is kept in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum). The unchanged Renaissance bridge Fleischbr\u00fccke crosses the Pegnitz nearby.\nThe Gothic Lorenzkirche (St. Laurence church) dominates the southern part of the walled city and is one of the most important buildings in Nuremberg. The main body was built around 1270\u20131350.\nThe even earlier and equally impressive Sebalduskirche is St. Lorenz's counterpart in the northern part of the old city.\nThe church of the former Katharinenkloster is preserved as a ruin, the charterhouse (Kartause) is integrated into the building of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum and the choir of the former Franziskanerkirche is part of a modern building.\nOther churches located inside the city walls are: St. Laurence's, Saint Clare's, Saint Martha's, Saint James the Greater's, Saint Giles's, and Saint Elisabeth's.\nThe Germanisches Nationalmuseum is Germany's largest museum of cultural history, among its exhibits are works of famous painters such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Rembrandt, and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner.\nThe Neues Museum N\u00fcrnberg is a museum for modern and contemporary art.\nThe Walburga Chapel and the Romanesque Doppelkapelle (Chapel with two floors) are part of Nuremberg Castle.\nThe Johannisfriedhof is a medieval cemetery, containing many old graves (Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Willibald Pirckheimer, and others).

The Nuremberg\u2013Ingolstadt\u2013Munich high-speed line with 300 km/h (186 mph) operation opened 28 May 2006, and was fully integrated into the rail schedule on 10 December 2006. Travel times to Munich have been reduced to as little as one hour. The Nuremberg\u2013Erfurt high-speed railway opened in December 2017.\n\n\n=== City and regional transport ===\n\nThe Nuremberg tramway network was opened in 1881.  As of 2008, it extended a total length of 36 km (22 mi), had six lines, and carried 39.152 million passengers annually.  The first segment of the Nuremberg U-Bahn metro system was opened in 1972. Nuremberg's trams, buses and metro system are operated by the VAG N\u00fcrnberg (Verkehrsaktiengesellschaft N\u00fcrnberg or Nuremberg Transport Corporation), itself a member of the VGN (Verkehrsverbund Grossraum N\u00fcrnberg or Greater Nuremberg Transport Network).\nThere is also a Nuremberg S-Bahn suburban metro railway and a regional train network, both centred on N\u00fcrnberg Hauptbahnhof.\nSince 2008, Nuremberg has had the first U-Bahn in Germany (U2/U21 and U3) that works without a driver. It also was the first subway system worldwide in which both driver-operated trains and computer-controlled trains shared tracks.\n\n\n=== Motorways ===\nNuremberg is located at the junction of several important Autobahn routes. The A3 (Netherlands\u2013Frankfurt\u2013W\u00fcrzburg\u2013Vienna) passes in a south-easterly direction along the north-east of the city. The A9 (Berlin\u2013Munich) passes in a north\u2013south direction on the east of the city. The A6 (France\u2013Saarbr\u00fccken\u2013Prague) passes in an east\u2013west direction to the south of the city. Finally, the A73 begins in the south-east of Nuremberg and travels north-west through the city before continuing towards F\u00fcrth and Bamberg.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nNuremberg Airport has flights to major German cities and many European destinations. The largest operators are currently Eurowings and TUI fly Deutschland, while the low-cost Ryanair and Wizz Air companies connect the city to various European centres. A significant amount of the airport's traffic flies to and from mainly touristic destinations during the peak winter season. The airport (Flughafen) is the terminus of subway line 2; it is the only airport in Germany served by a subway.\n\n\n=== Canals ===\nNuremberg is an important port on the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n1. FC N\u00fcrnberg, known locally as Der Club (English: \"The Club\"), was founded in 1900 and currently plays in the Bundesliga. The official colours of the association are red and white, but the traditional colours are red and black. They won their first regional title in the Southern German championship in 1916 closely followed by their first national title in 1920. Besides the eleven regional championships they won they were the German championship for a total of seven times. With this they held the record for the most German championship titles until 1986 when the current record holder FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen surpassed them.  The current chairmen are Nils Rossow and Robert Palikuca. They play in Max-Morlock-Stadion which was refurbished for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and accommodates 50,000 spectators. \n\nGerman Champion: 1920, 1921, 1924, 1925, 1927, 1936, 1948, 1961, 1968\nGerman Cup: 1935, 1939, 1962, 2007TuS Bar Kochba is a league that was founded in 1913 as a social-sport club for the Jewish community in N\u00fcrnberg. Established as the \"Jewish Gymnastics and Sports Club Nuremberg\", the league was dissolved by the Nazi party in 1939. It was reformed in 1966. The club plays in the senior A-league of the Bavarian Football Association.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nThe SELLBYTEL Baskets N\u00fcrnberg played in the Basketball Bundesliga from 2005 to 2007.

          "The truth is that the service is not entirely good, the site is giant and it is difficult to attend well. We only had a couple of beers made by them, and they were not bad at all, light beers both blonde and black, \u2026",
          "The little cute coffee on the corner is very magical. We had delicious mulled wine.\n\n",
          "Small quaint neighborhood at the beginning of the Old Town. We pass by curiosity but do not give particular emotions. A few shops, a few restaurants, nothing exceptional.\n\n",

        "wiki": "The Nuremberg trials (German: N\u00fcrnberger Prozesse) were a series of military tribunals held after World War II by the Allied forces under international law and the laws of war. The trials were most notable for the prosecution of prominent members of the political, military, judicial, and economic leadership of Nazi Germany, who planned, carried out, or otherwise participated in the Holocaust and other war crimes. The trials were held in Nuremberg, Germany, and their decisions marked a turning point between classical and contemporary international law.\nThe first and best known of the trials was that of the major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT).  It was described as \"the greatest trial in history\" by Sir Norman Birkett, one of the British judges present throughout. Held between 20 November 1945 and 1 October 1946, the Tribunal was given the task of trying 24 of the most important political and military leaders of the Third Reich. Primarily treated here is the first trial, conducted by the International Military Tribunal. Further trials of lesser war criminals were conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 at the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunal (NMT), which included the Doctors' trial and the Judges' Trial.\nThe categorization of the crimes and the constitution of the court represented a juridical advance that would be followed afterward by the United Nations for the development of an international jurisprudence in matters of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and wars of aggression, and led to the creation of the International Criminal Court. For the first time in international law, the Nuremberg indictments also mention genocide (count three, war crimes: \"the extermination of racial and national groups, against the civilian populations of certain occupied territories in order to destroy particular races and classes of people and national, racial, or religious groups, particularly Jews, Poles, and Gypsies and others.\")\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nA precedent for trying those accused of war crimes had been set at the end of World War I in the Leipzig War Crimes Trials held in May to July 1921 before the Reichsgericht (German Supreme Court) in Leipzig, although these had been on a very limited scale and largely regarded as ineffectual. At the beginning of 1940, the Polish government-in-exile asked the British and French governments to condemn the German invasion of their country. The British initially declined to do so; however, in April 1940, a joint declaration was issued by the British, French and Polish. Relatively bland because of Anglo-French reservations, it proclaimed the trio's \"desire to make a formal and public protest to the conscience of the world against the action of the German government whom they must hold responsible for these crimes which cannot remain unpunished.\"Three-and-a-half years later, the stated intention to punish the Germans was much more trenchant. On 1 November 1943, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States published their \"Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe\", which gave a \"full warning\" that, when the Nazis were defeated, the Allies would \"pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth ... in order that justice may be done. ... The above declaration is without prejudice to the case of the major war criminals whose offences have no particular geographical location and who will be punished by a joint decision of the Government of the Allies.\" This intention by the Allies to dispense justice was reiterated at the Yalta Conference and at Potsdam in 1945.British War Cabinet documents, released on 2 January 2006, showed that as early as December 1944 the Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, had then advocated a policy of summary execution in some circumstances, with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles, being dissuaded from this only by talks with US and Soviet leaders later in the war.\n\nIn late 1943, during the Tripartite Dinner Meeting at the Tehran Conference, the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, proposed executing 50,000\u2013100,000 German staff officers. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt joked that perhaps 49,000 would do. Churchill, believing them to be serious, denounced the idea of \"the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country\" and that he would rather be \"taken out in the courtyard and shot\" himself than partake in any such action. However, he also stated that war criminals must pay for their crimes and that, in accordance with the Moscow Document which he himself had written, they should be tried at the places where the crimes were committed. Churchill was vigorously opposed to executions \"for political purposes.\" According to the minutes of a meeting between Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta, on 4 February 1945, at the Livadia Palace, President Roosevelt \"said that he had been very much struck by the extent of German destruction in Crimea and therefore he was more bloodthirsty in regard to the Germans than he had been a year ago, and he hoped that Marshal Stalin would again propose a toast to the execution of 50,000 officers of the German Army.\"Henry Morgenthau Jr., US Secretary of the Treasury, suggested a plan for the total denazification of Germany; this was known as the Morgenthau Plan. The plan advocated the forced de-industrialisation of Germany and the summary execution of so-called \"arch-criminals\", i.e. the major war criminals. Roosevelt initially supported this plan, and managed to convince Churchill to support it in a less drastic form. Later, details were leaked generating widespread condemnation by the nation's newspapers. Roosevelt, aware of strong public disapproval, abandoned the plan, but did not adopt an alternative position on the matter. The demise of the Morgenthau Plan created the need for an alternative method of dealing with the Nazi leadership. The plan for the \"Trial of European War Criminals\" was drafted by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and the War Department. Following Roosevelt's death in April 1945, the new president, Harry S. Truman, gave strong approval for a judicial process. After a series of negotiations between Britain, the US, Soviet Union, and France, details of the trial were worked out. The trials were to commence on 20 November 1945, in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Creation of the courts ==\nOn 20 April 1942, representatives from the nine countries occupied by Germany met in London to draft the \"Inter-Allied Resolution on German War Crimes\". At the meetings in Tehran (1943), Yalta (1945), and Potsdam (1945), the three major wartime powers, the United Kingdom, United States, and the Soviet Union, agreed on the format of punishment for those responsible for war crimes during World War II. France was also awarded a place on the tribunal. The legal basis for the trial was established by the London Charter, which was agreed upon by the four so-called Great Powers on 8 August 1945,  and which restricted the trial to \"punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis countries.\"\nSome 200 German war crimes defendants were tried at Nuremberg, and 1,600 others were tried under the traditional channels of military justice. The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany. Political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council which, having sovereign power over Germany, could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939.\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nLeipzig and Luxembourg were briefly considered as the location for the trial. The Soviet Union had wanted the trials to take place in Berlin, as the capital city of the 'fascist conspirators', but Nuremberg was chosen as the site for two reasons, with the first one having been the decisive factor:\nThe Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few buildings that had remained largely intact through extensive Allied bombing of Germany), and a large prison was also part of the complex.\nNuremberg was considered the ceremonial birthplace of the Nazi Party. It had hosted the Party's annual propaganda rallies and the Reichstag session that passed the Nuremberg Laws. Thus it was considered a fitting place to mark the Party's symbolic demise.As a compromise with the Soviets, it was agreed that while the location of the trial would be Nuremberg, Berlin would be the official home of the Tribunal authorities. It was also agreed that France would become the permanent seat of the IMT and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg.Most of the accused had previously been detained at Camp Ashcan, a processing station and interrogation center in Luxembourg, and were moved to Nuremberg for the trial.\n\n\n=== Participants ===\nEach of the four countries provided one judge and an alternative, as well as a prosecutor.\n\n\n==== Judges ====\nMajor General Iona Nikitchenko (Soviet main)\nLieutenant Colonel Alexander Volchkov (Soviet alternate)\nLord Justice Colonel Sir Geoffrey Lawrence (British main), President of the Tribunal\nSir Norman Birkett (British alternate)\nFrancis Biddle (American main)\nJohn J. Parker (American alternate)\nEdward Francis Carter (American alternate)\nProfessor Henri Donnedieu de Vabres (French main)\nRobert Falco (French alternate)\n\n\n==== Chief prosecutors ====\nAttorney General Sir Hartley Shawcross (United Kingdom)\nAssociate Justice Robert H. Jackson (United States)\nLieutenant-General Roman Andreyevich Rudenko (Soviet Union)\nFran\u00e7ois de Menthon, later replaced by Auguste Champetier de Ribes (France)Assisting Jackson were the lawyers Telford Taylor, William S. Kaplan and Thomas J. Dodd, and Richard Sonnenfeldt, a US Army interpreter. Assisting Shawcross were Major Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe and Sir John Wheeler-Bennett. Mervyn Griffith-Jones, who was later to become famous as the chief prosecutor in the Lady Chatterley's Lover obscenity trial, was also on Shawcross's team. Shawcross also recruited a young barrister, Anthony Marreco, who was the son of a friend of his, to help the British team with the heavy workload.\n\n\n==== Defence counsel ====\nThe vast majority of the defense attorneys were German lawyers. These included Georg Fr\u00f6schmann, Heinz Fritz (Hans Fritzsche), Otto Kranzb\u00fchler (Karl D\u00f6nitz), Otto Pannenbecker (Wilhelm Frick), Alfred Thoma (Alfred Rosenberg), Kurt Kauffmann (Ernst Kaltenbrunner), Hans Laternser (general staff and high command), Franz Exner (Alfred Jodl), Alfred Seidl (Hans Frank), Otto Stahmer (Hermann G\u00f6ring), Walter Ballas (Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach), Hans Fl\u00e4chsner (Albert Speer), G\u00fcnther von Rohrscheidt (Rudolf Hess), Egon Kubuschok (Franz von Papen), Robert Servatius (Fritz Sauckel), Fritz Sauter (Joachim von Ribbentrop), Walther Funk (Baldur von Schirach), Hanns Marx (Julius Streicher), Otto Nelte (Wilhelm Keitel), and Herbert Kraus/Rudolph Dix (both working for Hjalmar Schacht). The main counsel were supported by a total of 70 assistants, clerks and lawyers. The defense witnesses included several men who took part in war crimes themselves during World War II, such as Rudolf H\u00f6ss. The men testifying for the defense hoped to receive more lenient sentences. All of the men testifying on behalf of the defense were found guilty on several counts.\n\n\n== The trial ==\nThe International Military Tribunal was opened on 19 November 1945 in the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg. The first session was presided over by the Soviet judge, Nikitchenko. The prosecution entered indictments against 24 major war criminals and seven organizations \u2013 the leadership of the Nazi party, the Reich Cabinet, the Schutzstaffel (SS), Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the Gestapo, the Sturmabteilung (SA) and the \"General Staff and High Command\", comprising several categories of senior military officers. These organizations were to be declared \"criminal\" if found guilty.\nThe indictments were for:\n\nParticipation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of a crime against peace\nPlanning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace\nParticipating in War crimes\nCrimes against humanityThe 24 accused were, with respect to each charge, either indicted but not convicted (I), indicted and found guilty (G), or not charged (\u2014), as listed below by defendant, charge, and eventual outcome:\n\n\n== Intelligence tests and psychiatric assessments ==\nThe Rorschach test was administered to the defendants, along with the Thematic Apperception Test and a German adaptation of the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Test. All were scored as having above average intelligence, several considerably so.\n\nThroughout the trials, specifically between January and July 1946, the defendants and a number of witnesses were interviewed by American psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn. His notes detailing the demeanor and comments of the defendants survive; they were edited into book form and published in 2004. Jean Delay was the psychiatric expert for the French delegation in the trial of Rudolf Hess.\n\n\n== Overview of the trial ==\n\n20 November 1945: The trials begin.\n21 November 1945: Robert H.

Twelve of the accused were sentenced to death, seven received prison sentences (ranging from 10 years to life sentence), three were acquitted, and two were not charged.\n\n\n== Executions ==\n\nThe death sentences were carried out on 16 October 1946 by hanging using the standard drop method instead of long drop. The U.S. Army denied claims that the drop length was too short, which may cause the condemned to die slowly from strangulation instead of quickly from a broken neck, but evidence remains that some of the condemned men choked in agony for 14 to 28 minutes. The executioner was John C. Woods. The executions took place in the gymnasium of the court building (demolished in 1983).Although the rumor has long persisted that the bodies were taken to Dachau and burned there, they were actually incinerated in a crematorium in Munich, and the ashes scattered over the river Isar. The French judges suggested that the military condemned (G\u00f6ring, Keitel and Jodl) be shot by a firing squad, as is standard for military courts-martial, but this was opposed by Biddle and the Soviet judges, who argued that the military officers had violated their military ethos and were not worthy of the more dignified death by shooting. The prisoners sentenced to incarceration were transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947.\nOf the 12 defendants sentenced to death by hanging, two were not hanged: Martin Bormann was convicted in absentia (he had, unknown to the Allies, died while trying to escape from Berlin in May 1945), and Hermann G\u00f6ring committed suicide the night before the execution. The remaining 10 defendants sentenced to death were hanged.\n\n\n== Nuremberg principles ==\nThe definition of what constitutes a war crime is described by the Nuremberg principles, a set of guidelines document which was created as a result of the trial. The medical experiments conducted by German doctors and prosecuted in the so-called Doctors' Trial led to the creation of the Nuremberg Code to control future trials involving human subjects, a set of research ethics principles for human experimentation.\nOf the indicted organizations the following were found not to be criminal:\n\nReichsregierung\n\"The General Staff and High Command\" was found not to comprise a group or organization as defined by Article 9 of the London Charter 14 Members of the High Command were tried as Criminals at the high command trial case 12 of the Subsequent Nuremberg ProceedingsSturmabteilung\n\n\n== Subsidiary and related trials ==\nThe American authorities conducted subsequent Nuremberg Trials in their occupied zone.\nOther trials conducted after the first Nuremberg trial include the following:\n\nAuschwitz trial\nBelsen trial\nBelzec trial before the 1st Munich District Court in the mid-1960s, of eight SS men of the Belzec extermination camp\nChe\u0142mno trials of the Che\u0142mno extermination camp personnel, held in Poland and in Germany. The cases were decided almost twenty years apart\nDachau trials\nFrankfurt Auschwitz trials\nMajdanek trials, the longest Nazi war crimes trial in history, spanning over 30 years\nMauthausen-Gusen camp trials\nHamburg Ravensbr\u00fcck trials\nSobib\u00f3r trial held in Hagen, Germany, in 1965 against the SS men of the Sobibor extermination camp\nTreblinka trials in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n\n\n== American role in the trial ==\n\nWhile Sir Geoffrey Lawrence of Britain was the judge who was chosen to serve as the president of the court, arguably, the most prominent of the judges at the trial was his American counterpart, Francis Biddle. Prior to the trial, Biddle had been Attorney General of the United States but had been asked to resign by Truman earlier in 1945.Some accounts argue that Truman had appointed Biddle as the main American judge for the trial as an apology for asking for his resignation. Ironically, Biddle was known during his time as Attorney General for opposing the idea of prosecuting Nazi leaders for crimes committed before the beginning of the war, even sending out a memorandum on 5 January 1945 on the subject. The note also expressed Biddle's opinion that instead of proceeding with the original plan for prosecuting entire organizations, there should simply be more trials that would prosecute specific offenders.Biddle soon changed his mind, as he approved a modified version of the plan on 21 January 1945, likely due to time constraints, since the trial would be one of the main issues which was to be discussed at Yalta. At trial, the Nuremberg tribunal ruled that any member of an organization convicted of war crimes, such as the SS or Gestapo, who had joined after 1939 would be considered a war criminal. Biddle managed to convince the other judges to make an exemption for any member who was drafted or had no knowledge of the crimes being committed by these organizations.Justice Robert H. Jackson played an important role in not only the trial itself, but also in the creation of the International Military Tribunal, as he led the American delegation to London that, in the summer of 1945, argued in favour of prosecuting the Nazi leadership as a criminal conspiracy. According to Airey Neave, Jackson was also the one behind the prosecution's decision to include membership in any of the six criminal organizations in the indictments at the trial, though the IMT rejected this on the grounds that it was wholly without precedent in either international law or the domestic laws of any of the Allies. Jackson also attempted to have Alfried Krupp be tried in place of his father, Gustav, and even suggested that Alfried volunteer to be tried in his father's place. Both proposals were rejected by the IMT, particularly by Lawrence and Biddle, and some sources indicate that this resulted in Jackson being viewed unfavourably by the latter.Thomas Dodd was a prosecutor for the United States. There was an immense amount of evidence backing the prosecutors' case, especially since meticulous records of the Nazis' actions had been kept. There were records taken in by the prosecutors that had signatures from specific Nazis signing for everything from stationery supplies to Zyklon B gas, which was used to kill the inmates of the deathcamps. Thomas Dodd showed a series of pictures to the courtroom after reading through the documents of crimes committed by the defendants. The showing consisted of pictures displaying the atrocities performed by the defendants. The pictures had been gathered when the inmates were liberated from the concentration camps.Henry F. Gerecke, a Lutheran pastor, and Sixtus O'Connor, a Roman Catholic priest, were sent to minister to the Nazi defendants. Photographs of the trial were taken by a team of about a dozen US Army still photographers, under the direction of chief photographer Ray D'Addario.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nThe Tribunal is celebrated for establishing that \"crimes against international law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced.\" The creation of the IMT was followed by trials of lesser Nazi officials and the trials of Nazi doctors, who performed experiments on people in prison camps. It served as the model for the International Military Tribunal for the Far East which tried Japanese officials for crimes against peace and crimes against humanity. It also served as the model for the Eichmann trial and for present-day courts at The Hague, for trying crimes committed during the Balkan wars of the early 1990s, and at Arusha, for trying the people responsible for the genocide in Rwanda.\nThe Nuremberg trials had a great influence on the development of international criminal law. The Conclusions of the Nuremberg trials served as models for:\n\nThe Genocide Convention, 1948.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948.\nThe Nuremberg Principles, 1950.\nThe Convention on the Abolition of the Statute of Limitations on War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, 1968.\nThe Geneva Convention on the Laws and Customs of War, 1949; its supplementary protocols, 1977.The International Law Commission, acting on the request of the United Nations General Assembly, produced in 1950 the report Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the N\u00fcrnberg Tribunal and in the Judgement of the Tribunal (Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1950, vol. II). See Nuremberg Principles.\nThe influence of the tribunal can also be seen in the proposals for a permanent international criminal court, and the drafting of international criminal codes, later prepared by the International Law Commission.\nTourists can visit courtroom 600 on days when no trial is on. A permanent exhibition has been dedicated to the trials.\n\n\n=== Establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court ===\nThe Nuremberg trials initiated a movement for the prompt establishment of a permanent international criminal court, eventually leading over fifty years later to the adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. This movement was brought about because during the trials, there were conflicting court methods between the German court system and the U.S. court system. The crime of conspiracy was unheard of in the civil law systems of the Continent. Therefore, the German defense found it unfair to charge the defendants with conspiracy to commit crimes, while the judges from common-law countries were used to doing so.\n It [IMT] was the first successful international criminal court, and has since played a pivotal role in the development of international criminal law and international institutions.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nCritics of the Nuremberg trials argued that the charges against the defendants were only defined as \"crimes\" after they were committed and that therefore the trial was invalid, and thus seen as a form of \"victor's justice\".As Michael Biddiss observed in a 1995 edition of History Today, \"the Nuremberg Trial continues to haunt us. ... It is a question also of the weaknesses and strengths of the proceedings themselves.\"\nQuincy Wright, writing eighteen months after the conclusion of the IMT, explained the opposition to the Tribunal thus:The assumptions underlying the Charter of the United Nations, the Statute of the International Court of Justice, and the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal are far removed from the positivistic assumptions which greatly influenced the thought of international jurists in the nineteenth century. Consequently, the activities of those institutions have frequently been vigorously criticized by positivistic jurists ... [who] have asked: How can principles enunciated by the Nuremberg Tribunal, to take it as an example, be of legal value until most of the states have agreed to a tribunal with jurisdiction to enforce those principles? How could the Nuremberg Tribunal have obtained jurisdiction to find Germany guilty of aggression, when Germany had not consented to the Tribunal? How could the law, first explicitly accepted in the Nuremberg Charter of 1945, have bound the defendants in the trial when they committed the acts for which they were indicted years earlier?Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Harlan Fiske Stone called the Nuremberg trials a fraud. \"(Chief U.S. prosecutor) Jackson is away conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg, ... I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas\", Stone wrote.Jackson, in a letter discussing the weaknesses of the trial, in October 1945 told U.S. President Harry S. Truman that the Allies themselves \"have done or are doing some of the very things we are prosecuting the Germans for. The French are so violating the Geneva Convention in the treatment of prisoners of war that our command is taking back prisoners sent to them. We are prosecuting plunder and our Allies are practising it. We say aggressive war is a crime and one of our allies asserts sovereignty over the Baltic States based on no title except conquest.\"Associate Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas charged that the Allies were guilty of \"substituting power for principle\" at Nuremberg. \"I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled,\" he wrote. \"Law was created ex post facto to suit the passion and clamor of the time.\"U.S. Deputy Chief Counsel Abraham Pomerantz resigned in protest at the low caliber of the judges assigned to try the industrial war criminals, such as those at I.G. Farben.Robert A. Taft, a US Senate Majority Leader from Ohio and son of William Howard Taft, criticized the Nuremberg Trials for trying Nazi war criminals under ex post facto laws, which resulted in his failure to secure the Republican nomination for President in 1948.A number of Germans who agreed with the idea of punishment for war crimes admitted trepidation concerning the trials. A contemporary German jurist said:\n\nThat the defendants at Nuremberg were held responsible, condemned and punished, will seem to most of us initially as a kind of historical justice. However, no one who takes the question of guilt seriously, above all no responsibly thoughtful jurist, will be content with this sensibility nor should they be allowed to be. Justice is not served when the guilty parties are punished in any old way, even if this seems appropriate with regard to their measure of guilt. Justice is only served when the guilty are punished in a way that carefully and conscientiously considers their criminal errors according to the provisions of valid law under the jurisdiction of a legally appointed judge.\nThe validity of the court has been questioned on a number of grounds:\n\n\n=== Legitimacy ===\n\nOne criticism that was made of the IMT was that some treaties were not binding on the Axis powers because they were not signatories. This was addressed in the judgment relating to war crimes and crimes against humanity, which contains an expansion of customary law: \"the [Hague] Convention expressly stated that it was an attempt 'to revise the general laws and customs of war,' which it thus recognised to be then existing, but by 1939 these rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war which are referred to in Article 6 (b) of the [London] Charter.\"\n\n\n== Introduction of extempore simultaneous interpretation ==\n\nThe Nuremberg Trials employed four official languages: English, French, German and Russian. In order to address the complex linguistic issues that clouded over the proceedings, interpretation and translation departments had to be established. However, it was feared that consecutive interpretation would slow down the proceedings significantly. What is therefore unique in both the Nuremberg tribunals and history of the interpretation profession was the introduction of an entirely new technique, extempore simultaneous interpretation. This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter to listen to a speaker in a source (or passive) language and orally translate that speech into another language in real time, that is, simultaneously, through headsets and microphones. Interpreters were split into four sections, one for each official language, with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth (their mother tongue). For instance, the English booth consisted of three interpreters, one working from German into English, one working from French, and one from Russian, etc. Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with consecutive court interpreters. Some of the languages heard over the course of the proceedings included Yiddish, Hungarian, Czech, Ukrainian, and Polish.\nThe equipment used to establish this system was provided by IBM, and included an elaborate setup of cables which were hooked up to headsets and single earphones directly from the four interpreting booths (often referred to as \"the aquarium\"). Four channels existed for each working language, as well as a root channel for the proceedings without interpretation. Switching of channels was controlled by a setup at each table in which the listener merely had to turn a dial in order to switch between languages. People tripping over the floor-laid cables often led to the headsets getting disconnected, with several hours at a time sometimes being taken in order to repair the problem and continue on with the trials.\nInterpreters were recruited and examined by the respective countries in which the official languages were spoken: the United States, United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, as well as in special cases Belgium and the Netherlands. Many were former translators, army personnel, and linguists, some were experienced consecutive interpreters, others were ordinary individuals and even recent secondary school-graduates who led international lives in multilingual environments. It was, and still is believed, that the qualities that made the best interpreters were not just a perfect understanding of two or more languages, but more importantly a broad sense of culture, encyclopedic knowledge, inquisitiveness, as well as a naturally calm disposition.\n\nWith the simultaneous technique being extremely new, interpreters practically trained themselves, but many could not handle the pressure or the psychological strain. Many often had to be replaced, many returned to the translation department, and many left. Serious doubts were given as to whether interpretation provided a fair trial for the defendants, particularly because of fears of mistranslation and errors made on transcripts. The translation department had to also deal with the overwhelming problem of being understaffed and overburdened with an influx of documents that could not be kept up with. More often than not, interpreters were stuck in a session without having proper documents in front of them and were relied upon to do sight translation or double translation of texts, causing further problems and extensive criticism. Other problems that arose included complaints from lawyers and other legal professionals with regard to questioning and cross-examination. Legal professionals were most often appalled at the slower speed at which they had to conduct their task because of the extended time required for interpreters to render an interpretation properly. Additionally, a number of interpreters protested the idea of using vulgar language, especially if it referred to Jews or the conditions of the Nazi concentration camps. Bilingual/trilingual members who attended the trials picked up quickly on this aspect of character and were equally quick to file complaints.\nYet, despite the extensive trial and error, without the interpretation system the trials would not have been possible and in turn revolutionized the way multilingual issues were addressed in tribunals and conferences. A number of the interpreters following the trials were immediately recruited into the newly formed United Nations, while others returned to their ordinary lives, pursued other careers, or worked freelance. Outside the boundaries of the trials, many interpreters continued their positions on weekends interpreting for dinners, private meetings between judges, and excursions between delegates. Others worked as investigators or editors, or aided the translation department when they could, often using it as an opportunity to sharpen their skills and to correct poor interpretations on transcripts before they were available for public record.\nFor further reference, a book titled The Origins of Simultaneous Interpretation: The Nuremberg Trial, written by interpreter Francesca Gaiba, was published by the University of Ottawa Press in 1998.\nToday, all major international organizations, as well as any conference or government that uses more than one official language, uses extempore simultaneous interpretation. Notable bodies include the Parliament of Kosovo with three official languages, the Parliament of Canada with two official languages, the Parliament of South Africa with eleven official languages, the European Union with twenty-four official languages, and the United Nations with six official working languages.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNuremberg Trials bibliography\nCommand responsibility\nDora Trial\nEichmann in Jerusalem\nEinsatzgruppen Trial\nInternational Military Tribunal for the Far East\nJudgment at Nuremberg (1961 film)\nNuremberg (2000 film)\nList of Axis personnel indicted for war crimes\nNuremberg Diary, an account of observations and discussions with the defendants by an American psychiatrist\nResearch Materials: Max Planck Society Archive\nSuperior orders\nTokyo War Crimes Tribunal\nTransitional justice\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n==== Avalon Project ====\nThese citations refer to documents at \"The International Military Tribunal for Germany\".

          "Interesting and excellent exhibition on the Nuremberg Trials. You can see and go in the Court Room when not in use. Check its opening hours before you visit. Exhibition was great and spent hours there.",
          "I used to love history in school but this is for serious history buff. If people coming here hoping for an attraction, it's not the place for it as you pretty much would be looking at an empty courthouse. However, even for me, it was a moving experience and a worthwhile visit.",
          "Visited with a friend who is a WW2 enthusiast. Very interesting and educational and is one of the top Nuremberg tourist attractions Bargain \u20ac5 entrance fee makes it well worth a visit. An eye opener for those like me who are not well educated in the history.",
          "Glad we did this site. It is always moving to actually visit sites that have a pivotal place in history. We spent close to 2 hours here on a Sunday morning. The audio guide was good but a little long winded. We watch the 2000 film Nuremberg with Alec Baldwin when we returned",
          "An experience, interesting and horrible. Very important to be aware what had happened. It really makes it all so real. The exhibition is interesting but if you really want to listen all the things from each section, you need to have time at least for two hours. I recommend.",
          "Really nice courthouse. Ticket was only 5.- eur. You should start your tour from the 3rd floor, on the 2nd floor is courtroom. You will get little machines and if you put codes into it- you can hear about history in audio version. Keep it next to your ear so you do not disturbe",
          "We came here as part of a WWII tour. Our tour guide took us through, so we did not have much chance to look at the exhibit ourselves. We did not get to see the infamous Courthouse room as a trial was going on. I was glad to have gone.",
          "The whole center of Neurenberg is impressive, but the Palace of Justice gets your attention for it's size and good condition of preservation.",
          "The Memorium Nuremberg Trials is located in the Palace of Justice. It is here that the Nuremberg trials took place. It provides information about the history, the course and the repercussions of the trials. Selected exhibits, such as parts of the original dock, and historical",
          "This is a great add-on for other parts of history, but totally centered on the World War II Nuremberg trials. You lose out on some of the other information that you can get from other areas in Germany. But comma the information presented is amazing and well worth the visit.",
          "Very interesting and thought provoking to be in this historic courtroom, although it's been reconfigured to the layout it had prior to the famous trials. There are interesting exhibits in adjacent rooms. The site is easily accessible from the U-Bahn.",
          "This is the site of the Nuremburg trials. It was an interesting choice really but seemed to be made on pragmatic grounds. There is nothing especially interesting other than being in the place where justice was meted out.",
          "The visit to the courtrooms where the trials took place really brings it home to you. The courthouse 600 was not available to be visited the day we went, but you can see it through the glass windows.",
          "Museum is made up of 2 parts. One is a self guided audio tour of the war and the subsequent trials followed by a visit to the actual courtroom here they were held. The guide is excellent and allows you to understand the exhibitis and there meaning. it is a few minutes walk from",
          "This Court opened at 1000 hrs on the Saturday we visited. Court room 600 in which the War Crime trials were held is still an operational Court and so if the court is sitting there is no entry so I would suggest an advanced enquiry or visit on a weekend. Visitors are free to walk",
          "There were no English translations only an audioguide, unless you have all day to sit there and listen to the explanation of a hundred panels I'm not sure if it it is worth the time. I should have just read a book at home. The interesting thing I did come away with is the",
          "A quick visit to Courtroom 600, where the War Crimes Trials took place post-WW2. It has been returned to the condition it was prior to those trials; apparently there was a feeling that they should be forgotten. Also incongruous - a crucifixion above the judge's chair in",
          "Very nice historic place , not only for room 600 where the trials occurred but it has great exhibition room full of information , the free audio guide was excellent . Not to be missed in nuremberg .",
          "The Palace of Justice is sobering and sad to realize all that the Nazi's did to those they were persecuting during their reign of terror. . They give you an electronic voice box in your language explaining each exhibit. (You need to see the documentation center as well to get",
          "We found the Palace of Justice difficult to find. However, very glad we did. Better information than a book is able to give included artefacts such as the chairs made for the defendants to sit on First rate. Upon leaving we were asked to complete a questionnaire during which",
          "You only visit room 600 and a tiny museum, you cannot visit the rest of the buidling. the museum is small and redudant, not much information and not very interesting.",
          "Excellent museum to understand how the Trials came to be held there, the preparations that were necessary, and how the trials were carried out. I learned many things the history books don't cover. We did get to visit Courtroom 600 and to sit in it is an experience not to be",
          "It all happened here - the post WWII trials. Sit in the courtroom and let the interactive display lead you back in time to how the room looked, who sat where, and how the proceedings unfolded.Then, take a walk through the informative displays of the crimes, the accused, and the",
          "If you are a history buff, seeing the palace of justice is a must. The Trial court room is maintained very well and displays are informative. The second floor has a small museum, also interesting. We had the combo ticket which included the dokuzentrum museum, Palace of justice",
          "It's worth a quick visit and it's interesting to see Room 600 if possible. The court room isn't always accessible as is an active venue so best to check ahead if this is your desire.",
          "Lest we forget. I believe everyone should be reminded of the horrors that existed so that society does not make the same mistakes and Nurnberg Palace of Justice does that. In my opinion, this is a must see.",
          "Excellent exhibition, though very informative and detailed. The tour is well structured and you do it at your own pace. It takes longer than they recommend - took us over three hours and I skipped a few information panels towards the end. However it is a very good tour for",
          "Go, take your kids, help them to understand a dark period in history and how it was handled. Standing in courtroom 600 was of personal significance because my mom was a translator for the trials. But, the place will speak to everyone. The exhibition upstairs is remarkable with",
          "We got to the palace at around 430 pm, to make sure the courtroom 600 hearings would adjourned for the day. Seeing the courtroom (which was open) was fascinating, to imagine the ww2 defendants sitting in the same courtroom years ago. My regret was not leaving enough time for",
          "This palace is one of the best in Germany. It was undergoing some renovations during our visit. Make sure you watch the video at the front by the ticket sales. Also, make sure you purchase the audio guide. Wonderful gardens and walking around the palace. You really feel",
          "Visit includes the complimentary audio guide. Very impressive to see courtroom 600 where the actual Nuremberg trials took place. Also, upstairs is an exhibit with more information as well as bathrooms. We had our younger kids with us but I easily could have spent hours there.",
          "We caught the U1 train line to Barenschanze, where we could visit the Nuremberg Palace of Justice, where the trials for the war criminals that participated in the Holocaust took place. It is still a working court and I have to say the museum section was not easily to spot, we",
          "After a morning spent out at the parade grounds it was very easy to get to the palace of justice which is out in a modern suburb today. Fantastic and thorough exhibition of the process, background and aftermath of the trials. Meticulously prepared legal dimensions to the various",
          "The history in this place is on show. You can visit the courtroom where the nuremberg trials happened, they have been remodeled slightly since then but the atmosphere still remains. The museum offers an audio guide as you go through and it allows you to fast forward and rewind",
          "A highlight of our visit to Nuremberg. Lots of historical background information,if anything it was too much of an overload but you can skip parts if you wish. Interesting to sit in the courtroom where they held the trials.",
          "This is where the Nazi leaders stood trail. The victors extracting vengence specifically the Americans. While ther men and women whom carried out some of the most haineous crimes in the history of mankind, it was basically a charade. The men and women whom stood trial were",
          "This place is extremely important. In this building took place the famous Nurnberg Nazi Trials after II WW. You can went to the room 600 and sit there - in the same place when around 70 years ago sit Nazi criminals. Upstairs you have the museum with very details and interesting",
          "A very large display with a wealth of information. Better than excepted, could do with English language signage. I was very lucky to be able to look in and sit in courtroom. Well worth a visit.",
          "This place holds a lot of history. It was the location for the Nuremburg trials when the Nazi party were held for trial. It was perhaps a little bit to much of a history lesson. However if you are a history buff and want to learn more about the trials, then this stop cannot be",
          "This place holds a lot of history, it is amazing to look at and it is close to the city centrum so if you go there it is worth passing by and taking a chance to learn something new.",
          "We visited the Palace of Justice after a visit to the documentation centre. Tip - for 7.5 Euros you can buy a ticket that covers a number of Nuremberg museums (we used it for the documentation centre and Palace of Justice). The exhibition is comprehensive covering the lead up to",
          "Prior to coming I watched the film \"Judgement at Nuremburg\" about one of the later trials, which also took place in that building. Overall it is a great visit (recommend going on a Saturday to ensure you can go inside the courtroom). You receive a small speakerbox that gives",
          "My family had the opportunity to visit Nuremberg and the Nuremberg Palace of Justice (Justizpalast). This is the courthouse where the Allies held its Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals. We were on a river cruise and this was an optional tour. We had a tour guide and",
          "The exhibits on the third floor are good and the audio describes the issue and pictures. Good display but one that didn't tell me much new. Could have the information in old documentaries. It was interesting to stNd in court room 600 and imagine that so mNy of the Natzies were",
          "I would consider it as a must-see for it's historical role. But be sure that the actual courtroom is not in use on the day of your visit: that was the hightlight. The rest of the exhibition is interesting, but it gives so much detailed information that one could lose the overall",
          "We spent 2 hours here and did not have enough time to see everything before closing...there is so much information about the Nuremberg trials, and it was arranged very nicely",
          "This is the actual court where nuremberg trial took place. If you have been to the nazi dociment museum then you will understand the importance of this trial. Good for history lovers however i wasnt much enthusiased.",
          "The room itself is not the issue it looks today like any other court room but our guide brought the whole trial to life. Interesting was the why the trial was held here and the fight among the allies as to who would run it and what were the crimes that where committed, as there",
          "To see the ramifications of the horrors of WWII this place is for all. Its a very well done exhibit of what happens when a dictator gets the power he doesn't deserve.",
          "It is awesome to be in the courtroom where the NAZI upper echelon were tried and convicted of genocide. The museum above the courtroom is really worth the trip. The details of who was tried, what they were charged with, and the theory of the prosecution was fully explained. The",
          "the place which is one of best known in modern history of the world. Place and Room number 600 where International Nuremberg Trial Court was happened.",
          "Thee are 2 elements to this visit. If yoy are lucky (as we were), you will get the chance to go into the actual courtroom where the trials took place, you can then find out in much more detail about the trials, how they came about and what happened by going around the",
          "So many amazing buildings and palaces throughout Europe and this was no exception. One could never spend enough time in any of them to get the best out of them all. Still, any time spent is a bonus, and the views and history that go along with any walking tour, is always an",
          "Very interesting place to visit. Big place. Room 600 were several Nazis were judged by criminal acts by four nations jury first time in history is exactly as it was in 1945 and is still in use. There is a very good description in several languages.",
          "As you are not guaranteed to be able to enter room 600 since it is an active courtroom I had rather low expectations of this side trip my daughter wanted to take. I was pleasantly surprised about the entire experience. We were able to enter the courtroom and with the audio",
          "We visited this venue as part of a package tour and it was history personified. To think it was the scene of some overdue justice way back in 1945 was simply mind blowing. To go in to court room 600 and sit there where it all happened all those years ago was surreal.The room is",
          "This is actually a museum set inside an actual working courthouse. The museum itself has been built in the roof of the Justizpalast, and it gives a very educational look into just what had to happen for the trials to take place. Things like the 4 Allied countries all working",
          "I think of this site as the place where World War II actually ended. Court room 600, where the main trial was held, is still in use but not daily. Therefore, much of the time, the public has access to this historic room. Adjacent is a small but informative museum. The court",
          "If you have any knowledge of courtroom 600 take a seat on the visitor benches and think about what you know, it's quite a personal experience to let your imagination loose in a place like this. You can almost hear Jackson and the rest of the lawyers probing and interrogating",
          "This informative exhibition is a must see. Get the \u20ac7.50 ticket and visit other museums that day. It's a decent walk from the old town so think about transport. Parking was difficult but we managed. Audio was included in the ticket which was fantastic and allowed us to learn",
          "We toured both the actual courtroom, courtroom 600, and the exhibit one floor above. As a lawyer it was inspiring to have stood in the courtroom where the war crime trials were held. The exhibit was fascinating and provided a wealth of interesting information about the trial and",
          "I suggest that you visit this court house with a history guide. We were fortunate enough to have Andreas Clemens from Geschichte fur Alle (History for All) to bring the display to life. The depth of understanding of what happened and passion to impart that to the group was",
          "A visit to the palace of justice is well worthwhile. It is the courtroom where the Nuremburg trials were held. It is currently used as a courtroom for the city of Nuremburg, so it is only accessible on the weekends. There are pictures there of where the participants sat and",
          "The Justizplatz is still in use today by The Bavarian state. The museum exhibition is directly adjacent and is clearly marked with a information sheet. The audio guide is quite good, but a little lengthy so give yourself some time to get through everything. There were some",

          "This courthouse is the Nuremberg court house of today, it is sited right next door the court house of the \"infamous war criminals court house\" and prison",
          "Another interesting historical summary of the trials and the Nazis on trial. Allow at least 2 hours to do the place justice. Your ticket here will get a discount at the Documentation Center.",
          "Interesting, interesting museum about a great historic event. Very well organized, clean, audioguide included. They should put multilingual panels, especially for photographies.",
          "I think that it worths a visit by tourists. There is all the information for Nuremberg trials and I think that i left totally informed about the trials' history.",
          "Try to plan your visit here in conjunction with the Dokumentationszentrum. Perfect for history buffs, Great location just outside of the ring road and easily accessible via U-Bahn.",
          "This place is moving, challenging and an absolute must-see for anyone who wants to try and understand what happened before, during and after World War II. The massive collection of pictures and videos is rather amazing, not least of which because the German forces kept such",
          "Worth visiting if you have access to Room 6 where famous Nuremberg Trials took place. The museum inside the Palace is also very interesting.",
          "Sitting in the same room that the Allied Forces convicted SS Officers gave me goosebumps. It is incredible to see the room as it was, and how it is now. Walking through the rest of the Gallery you can read the history of WWII, the progression of Aggression, and the end of the",
          "Historically significant, the courtyard site of the hangings, more than the courtrooms themselves. Pictures don't do 'justice' to those involved...",
          "Still find it hard to believe that 'remnants' of World War 2 still haunt us today. At least this place stands as a reminder that Justice will be served no matter how long it takes.",
          "This is a bit of a walk from the centre of Nuremberg but completely worth it and an absolute must visit whilst in the city. The information boards are mainly in German so the audio guide is a necessity but, as at the 'Dokumentationszentrum Reichsparteitagsgelaende', they are",
          "Situated some distance from the centre of Nuremberg but easily accesssible by the metro, the Palace of Justice is a thought provoking and interesting place to visit. We went on a Saturday and were able to go into Courtroom 600 ( where the trials took place). As the courtroom is",
          "Worth for sure a visit. Would recommend for every person who has to learn something about our history,",
          "Well worth a visit but be prepared to stay longer than you expected and be aware this is not a \"feel good\" attraction but everyone should visit!",
          "The courtroom 600 is on the second floor of the Palace building. It can be visited when no hearing is held there. Once in it one can't avoid having a mixed feeling of horror, owing to the abominable criminal offences committed by the Nazi indicted officers who were tried there,",
          "On the floor above Courtroom 600 is an incredible exhibit and documentation from the trial itself. They have the actual bench on which the defendants sat and explain the charges and punishment given to each of the defendants. Also a lot of information on the American",
          "The Palace of Justice is where the Nuremberg trials were held. You can actually see the court in which the trials took place and visit the museum which presents a wealth of knowledge in an interactive and very interesting format. Highly recommended!!",
          "Begin your visit by sitting in Courtroom 600 where the Nuremberg Trials took place (still an active court so not always possible). Then tour the museum which is very well done. Audio phones are included with the price of the visit; most helpful for the numerous video clips.",
          "We visited this Palace not on foot, nor did we go inside of it. Only toured around it via bus, with a highly knowledgeable German Tour Guide. He explained in depth, the history of the Palace of Justice, and it was an interesting site to take in.",
          "Must go if you are in Nuremburg, if you're lucky you can see the actual court for the trial if it's not in use",
          "I came here with my school for our Modern History trip. The tour was great, with lots of really interesting information. Our guide (an American woman I think) knew lots about the events of the Nuremberg Trials, the people involved, and the city itself. The displays were done",
          "Visited the Palace of Justice as part of a group tour. Our guide, Felix, was excellent. He provided just enough detail and held the group's interest throughout the tour. He was great with questions. This was an informative and educational experience. Would recommend if you",
          "I'm a lawyer and like seeing other court houses everyone has heard of Judgement At Nuremberg well this is where it all happened.",
          "Externally this historic building is magnificent. Internally the tour explains the whole Nuremberg Trials. It is well worth a visit, especially by historians.",
          "Museum shows in great detail the entire Nuremberg Trail process as well as the place in history these trials played in regards to modern human rights. ,",
          "My partner is doing a history degree and is going to specialise in Nazi Germany and WWII so she wanted to visit the museum of the Nuremberg trials. I am interested to a certain extent and found it engaged me to a point, more so than the documentation centre in Munich. The",
          "Skip it and stay in the old city. I realize this isn't the typical review but I just don't get it. War Crimes are defined by the victors. And the fact that their are laws of war and threatened sanctions is interesting but it sure hasn't kept conflict out of the Middle East,",
          "Very interesting and you will not be disappointed. It makes the hairs stand up on the back of your neck when you watch the footage of the trials.",
          "You can almost feel the weight of the air inside. A solemn and a real place of law. You just sit on the bench and stare at the world's symbol of justice.",
          "Excellent historical site and a must see if you're in Nurnberg. Seems smaller than you'd imagine, but such a significant site for world history. The museum upstairs from the actual courtroom was also exceptional. Learned more than I ever knew about these famous trials. Would",
          "The historical significance of this building cannot be over-emphasized. Initially when you enter, it's up to the first floor to see the courtroom 600. The audioguide explains how it was modified to accommodate the war crimes tribunal and how it reverted back to local use in the",
          "Unfortunately we only had an hour or so here. The exhibition is very well laid out with many thought-provoking pictures, guides and documents. Chilling and engrossing in equal measure I can thoroughly reccommend a visit.",
          "It was emotional to sit in the same room as where the Nuremberg trials were held. Trials are still held here so you have to be lucky to go when there is not a trial in session. They've changed the room some it is still awesome to sit there.",
          "If you've seen the movie 'Judgment at Nurenberg' well this is where it all happened. This is where all the horrors of Nazi were on view to the world and countless officers and others were tried and many executed, right here on the grounds. Unfortunately, you can only get into",
          "This is a very good museum to learn about the trials after War II ended. Many museums show what led up to the war and what happened during the war this tells about the trials in Nuremberg. A lot of reading or audio not many artifacts but it's done well. The room 600 is neat to",
          "This was one of the highlights of our trip. To be in the same room where some of the most evil men in history were tried for their crimes is an amazing and chilling experience. The signage in the Courtroom 600 and the adjacent exhibit were truly riveting. This alone is worth",
          "It's a lot of text and pictures but I learned a lot about the IMT. The court room where the trials occurred was in use during my visit but you can still look in from the exhibit area. This was my favorite site in Nuremberg.",
          "Many people come here to see the court hall no.600 to feel the atmosphere but please remember that the hall was heavily reconstructed by the US powers for the known trial and after that turned into its previous state by the Bavarian government. There are some similarities",
          "Even though the actual interior structure has changed a bit (a wall added to make the room a bit smaller and the area above the wood panels sheetrocked to enclose it a bit more), the impressiveness of the room remains. We were seated a few yards from where the infamous war",
          "Beautiful building but wish we could have stopped and gone for a tour, but it wasn't part of the driving tour.",
          "This is the place where the WW II Nazi war criminals have been prosecuted in 1945 and 1946. Room 600 still looks pretty much the same as it did 70 years ago. The documentation on the lower floor is so interesting that you need to bring lots of time which we didn't have as we",
          "Amazing to stand 20 feet from where the infamous Nazi's were tried. The court room is set up differently but with the guide's help you can visualize the movie set you are familiar with. That along with the guide's explanations of how the prisoners were housed and guarded makes",
          "The presentation of the information in the palace is superb. The trial is dissected and the different views of most of the stakeholders are presented in a condensed yet highly informative way. Take about an hour or two to go through all the information and interactive parts.",
          "My father & I toured the museum as we look at world war 2 history. It is well done & give you sense of the trial process. We also able to see the main court room.",
          "We visited Room 600 where the trials took place. It is a functioning court room and has been remodeled since the end of WWII but you can feel the history while sitting there. We had the advantage of a tour guide since we were on a Viking cruise.",
          "We spend a very absorbing three hours here going around the exhibition. There is so much to take in. We were lucky in that we could go in to court 600 and ponder on the historical significance of this place. This is a must go to in any visit to Nuremberg.",
          "The Palace of Justice is found at B\u00e4renschanzstra\u00dfe 72 \u2013 the entrance fee is 5 Euros. The Nuremberg Trials were held in this building (Courtroom 600) between 1945 and 1949. The courtroom is still a working court and we were lucky enough to visit on a day when it wasn't being",
          "A good place to see and learn about the Nuremberg trials that were held here. There is an audio guide that is worth getting and takes you through the courtrooms. These are active courts and sometimes they may not be acessable though.",
          "Chilling to stand in the same room where Nazi criminals were tried and sentenced......made the whole thing more real somehow.....",
          "Interesting from a historical standpoint, but since it is a functioning courthouse with few preserved artifacts save for a small museum upstairs, it's not a must visit, but a good filler between main attractions. Docents/guides are knowledgeable, unfortunately the whisper",
          "We had a private tour of the Nuremburg Nazi grounds and leaned a lot of history from Kevin...great experience and leaned a lot that we would not have otherwise. Also walked around Old Town...very worthwhile.",
          "Visit Courtroom 600 when there are no ongoing court cases. This is an active courtroom and is closed when in session. Courtroom 600 is where several Nazi leaders were tried and brought to justice after WW II. Much of the courtroom, including the door and passageway leading to",
          "A really historically interesting place, a must place to visit in Nuremberg, an audio guide explanation of the trials.",
          "This is the place where the infamous Nazi trials after the war took place (Courtroom 600). The building is still in use, so the court room is not always open for visiting, so make sure you inquire in advance. The entry is only 5 \u20ac and there is 2 things to see: The room where",
          "An important place to visit in Nuremberg. The information about the World War II Trials is a must see, there are lots of photographs and movies we spent a few hours here but you could spend lots more as there are many stories to listen to and movies. We were unable to go into",
          "Absolutely fabulous for an student of history. Over 3 hours the exhibits will enlighten and inform from the rise of the Nazi Party thru the Trials. Films of the accused and their actual testimony is offered as well as witnesses to their crimes. Spend time in the actual courtroom",
          "What an incredible place to visit. To sit in the actual courtroom where they held the Trials, to see the Judges bench, the dock that held the prisoners, the Prosecutor's table - it was just incredible. Then to tour through the museum, read all the information available, listen",
          "It's a very comprehensive audio guide which is included in the entrance fee. You could easily lose yourself for a good 3 hours in here as we did. It's a very interesting exhibition with some footage of the trials but it can become a little dry at times. Too many facts and",
          "This was somewhere I really wanted to visit, unfortunately I didn't do any more homework that checking it out on TA. I assumed it would be open usual hours but alas it is closed on Tuesdays. If only I had checked their website\u2026",

          "The articles of the UDHR written in German on stone pillars. Even German-speakers can't read them because they text curves in several lines around the pillar. Each article is replicated in a different foreign language, which seems to be significant but there's no explanation on",
          "It\u2019s an interesting way to show the UN human rights, with each pillar showing a right in a different language. It\u2019s quite easy to miss if your not looking for it though. It\u2019s an interesting way to start a visit to the germanisches museum next door",
          "very early morning visit, before there were many people. Thought it not is striking. The idea is quite novel to have a human right on ever pillar. I also liked that they placed the rights in German and in another language on ever pillar. Wish I could understand German. I still",
          "...way to describe the Human Rights in numerous languages but still very interesting. We thought that the wording on the main gate maybe a bit of a mistake, see what we mean?",

          "Accessed through an arch from the Kornmarkt and right beside the National Museum, this unassuming monument to Human Rights is worth a stroll through on this quiet Street. The engraved pillars set beside one side of the street have quotes inscribed in German. We passed it daily",
          "... but just a street with sculptures on it. Should have researched more about its history before coming so I could appreciate it.",
          "Yes, you can walk through it in a couple of minutes but it is more than that. The 30 pillars, each engraved with one article from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in German and another language.28 pillars are 8 metres in height and I will leave you to find out how tall",
          "Did not have much to see but note the history associated with the place did not go inside but enjoyed from outside.",
          "This is a subtle but moving reminder as to how this city has moved on from a difficult past. It's not the most impressive set of pillars but it is appropriate and thought provoking - make sure you see them.",
          "We did this walk while visiting the Germanic History Museum. It is a pleasant place adjacent to the museum. It is unlike anything we've seen before. A welcome respite from the rest of Old Nuremberg.",
          "It is easy to miss this monument as it is in a small side street. Each pillar has a line written on it in a different language from all countries affected by Human Rights. There is a lone oak tree in the middle of the line.",
          "An imposing structure in a quiet part of the town enumerating the fundamental rights as given in the UN Charter and more impressive since Nuremberg was the town where the fundamental rights of the citizens were trampled.",

          "My son was keen to visit here, and it's location not far from the main underground station makes it an easy stop on a city tour. Really interesting what it stands for, but without my sons explanation I wouldn't had known its significance. Worth a stop.",
          "The Way of Human Rights\" is just a series of columns with sections of the German Constitution in numerical order stated in dozens of languages. It sits outside the German Museum, which is itself quite interesting, incorporating what was left after WWII of an old abbey.",
          "One of those places one has to go to and start thinking. Don't take what you have for granted, because nothing in life is guaranteed. Go there. Sit there. And start thinking.",
          "Lining the way to the Germanic Museum is a long row of columns etched with declarations of peace and pronouncements of human rights. Look also at the solid archway.",
          "I didn't realize that this was an attraction apart from the museum. It was interesting, but not worth a visit just for itself.",
          "An outdoor sculpture built in the 90's. It was simple and meaningful I suppose but not overly interesting.",
          "This attraction is besides the German National Museum and it is a short walk with pillars on both sides representing one human right each, and in the end there is the wall of human rights.",
          "Beautiful place to honor victims of the holocaust and the World war II. The huge sizes of these columns are outstanding.",
          "You will come through this approaching the Germanisches Nationalmuseum. An interesting piece of architecture, adds something to the exterior of the museum, actually compenetrating the volume of the latter. The pillars symbolize the relevance of the chapters of the declaration.",
          "Basically a set of pillars with various key statements regarding human rights. Nice, if you're into symbolism.",
          "For what it represents, but can be easily overlooked or missed. However very near other tourist attractions.",
          "Next to the museum. an impressive avenue of pillars for a bit of reflection. Plenty of seating and a good caf\u00e9/restaurant in the museum.",
          "This installation is right at the main entrance to the known German museum so if you visit that place (and I highly recommend it) you won't miss the \"Way of Human Rights\". Nothing special, just a series of columns with the articles taken from the UN Declaration on Human Rights"

          "For all those people who loves and admires modern art. Very beautiful modern architecture of the building and interiors. Great collection of the modern art (paintings, graphics and installations).",
          "I enjoy the tour and I extremely felt the staff talking and was really passionate telling the story of every insights here.",
          "Very good museum with actual design and art, place  not to large it is kind of beginner friendly",
          "The museum has some interesting art and design pieces, although some pieces feel like they\u2019re only there to fill space and do not add anything to the exhibits. Worth a short visit",
          "A little small, but if you want to kill an afternoon, go ahead and slowly stroll around the artwork. Some stuff is permanently installed, some are temporary.",
          "Ticket price with student discount is 1\u20ac!!! And it is definetily worth it, the exhibitions change from time to time, but if you are interested in design and modern art you would most probably enjoy it.",
          "Great museum, huge place with lots of art. Quiet and relaxing place to be with lots to see and wander around.",
          "\u20ac1.00 per visit. Beautiful architecture, interior design, art works...",
          "Very fine and comprehensive contemporary museum. design collection is super interesting. I was with the tour and the staff is really passionate and gave a lot insights. One drawback of the museum, it accept only CASH!  Even the counter said: we are in stone age. That's why it's not five star.",
          "They do not accept Credit cards! I find that a bit old fashioned for a modern museum within the eu!",
          "Very interesting art work and wonderful asthetics. The building is a pleasant modern design while keeping the elegance of the artwork.",
          "If you\u2019re into modern art or even art in general, Neues is definitely a museum to visit. Located in the center of nurnberg just a couple minutes \nfrom the train station. Really cheap general entry and even discounts for students. You can \u2026",
          "Very interesting exhibitions. Especially recommend the posters exhibition once a year.",
          "Not the best modern museum. It is cool, but a lot of performances are only in German and we didn\u2019t understand anything. \nBut there is a very cool shop on the 1st floor. There are so many unusual stuff for presents.",
          "Must-go",
          "Fun selection of modern artwork. They have pamphlets in English too. As all modern art museums you wonder if it really is art but that's the great thing to see and experience different designs. The front desk staff was friendly and answered \u2026",
          "To make it very clear, the artwork in here is 5 star. The current exhibit of K.P. Brehmer's work is brilliant. Lost a star because of the \"security\" staff, who followed me around as if I walked in with a can of spray paint and a knife. \u2026",

          "Perfect museum for art lovers! We had less time to see the museum as it as about to get closed within 30 mins after we reached. If you want to watch properly everything, I suggest to spend atleast 1-2 hours in the museum. It's great for children too",
          "Really interesting modern art",
          "An interesting museum to check out. A majority of the art was sort of hidden around the corner so you need to be sure to look around to find it. Not sure how often they switch out their exhibits",
          "Security staff, please take note of the reviews and stop following people like criminals. I've been to plenty of art galleries across Europe - some with artwork that is worth far more than this one - where the staff are less intrusive. \u2026",

          "Loved it :)",
          "Free for design/ art students but even if I did have to pay it would have been really worth it, great exhibitions which were very thought provoking can highly recommend if you have an interest in modern art and design.",

          "Every work gives a lot of space and is well sorted. I liked the spiral staircase and the many lights.\n\n",

          "Had a guided tour in 2017 which was awesome, since they changed to a media guide you literally get a presentation of what is standing in Wikipedia. I recommend inform yourself before the tour and then take it, because the location is awesome and it is an important piece of N\u00fcrnbergs history (the tour is 4\u20ac which is ok)",

          "What should I say .... We were a small group of 6 people ... and were as it were durchgescheucht by an unmotivated young woman. Listen to the audio in the room, wait until they are all done. Shy in the next room again \u2026",

          "Great leadership. Unfortunately, few guides offered ..... Very worth seeing.\n\n",

          "I'm not a fan of museums, but the Lochgef\u00e4ngnisse are worth half an hour to look back at the historically interesting past. With media support (multilingual!) Here is an insight into the mediatic Nuremberg and the \u2026",

          "Visit quite curious and the audio guide (which is also visual) brings a plus.\n\n",
          "Interesting, worth the lead. Unfortunately only by audio guide, but worthwhile. With 4 \u20ac entrance also well acceptable.\n\n",
          "It's worth a visit, as you rarely have the opportunity to see such a thing. The tour takes about 30 minutes. The individual groups are very small, so plan a little more waiting time.\n\n",
          "With the new Audioguide no longer as lively and funny as in the past with leaders on Frankish accent\n\n",
          "Indescribable how one used to build. Impressive and see worth seeing. A must, if you are in Nuremberg. Not easy to find. At the main market in the town hall. Free guide\n\n",
          "Strange place. There was a dungeon and torture rooms. Take a separate tour is quite expensive. It is better to buy 1 ticket for 6 museums in Nuremberg (including your toys. Then it will be interesting and justified) \u2026",
          "Unfortunately, the guide does not speak and explain itself. It is much more authentic then.\nBut the audio systems are probably due to the internationality.\n\n",

          "Very informative and scary when I think so what our ancestors did with their prisoners until they were convicted.\nGuidance was very good I can only recommend who is visiting Nuremberg.\n\n",

          "Had a good time in the zoo. I wish there would be any signs in English. Since everything was only in German. I was also disappointed that there are no elephants in this zoo, probably the most watched animal after lions and tigers. Didn't like the place where the Polar Bear was",
          "It is a nice attraction for families with young children. There are different animals and playgrounds for the children to play and have fun.",
          "Nuremberg Zoo is a MUST while your visiting. The variety of animals are up there with the best. If you plan on eating there the bigger restaurant has a great atmosphere but is more expensive than the smaller one. We ate our main meal in the restaurant but then had a cake stop",
          "Wear comfortable shoes as some walking between each of the animal. There are plenty of seats along the way. Get there early as you will need 4 to 5 hours to see evey thing. Pack water and snacks as most food places are open on weekends only. I had lots of fun taking many",
          "Large zoo with many beautiful animals. It\u2019s a good place to the family and one of the better things to do in Nuremberg with young children. The dolphin Laguna was really interesting and not you see at many zoos. It\u2019s nice to see that the zoo really looked after and the animals",
          "The zoo is planned out like a garden park, and animals are spread out within the zoo so do expect to do some walking. Both of the playgrounds are really fun, especially the one next to the petting zoo. The children were able to feed the goats, and watch little piglets and",
          "Having three children I have visited many Zoo's but the Tiergarten Nurnberg is one of my favorites. The park and petting zoo are almost like a theme park within the Zoo. There are many wonderful places to eat and prices were affordable while quality remained good. The animals",
          "A zoo with shows and play areas. We spent an entire day with our boys 3 and 5 yrs old - and they loved it. There are many car-parks in walking distance. Arrive early to catch the shows and beat the crowds",
          "This zoo is set in a woodland on a hillside. The animals have large natural enclosures. We saw the lions and tigers being fed which was amazing. The children\u2019s zoo area is the farthest from the entrance. There is a train but this wasn\u2019t running when we visited. The children",
          "The Zoo is big and very nicely built in somehow like jungle, which is a bad idea on a cold day. There are many many beautiful animals, and several feeding shows, we enjoyed the dolphins one so much. There's a very nice restaurant, but a bit over priced. We didn't eat there",
          "We had a lovely visit here on Boxing Day with our 2 year old daughter. So many of the animals have inside enclosures and the whole zoo is in a huge woodland with gorgeous walks between the large exhibits. We couldn\u2019t believe how close we could get to some of the animals without",
          "Excellent with all the animals you would want to see, would recommend a Visit! I was surprised to know that they have aquatic animals as well.",
          "Having arrived in Nuremberg a couple of days early for the start of the Christmas market, we were at a bit of a loss at what to do so decided to visit the zoo. It was well signposted even though my sat nav took us along what can only be described as a footpath near to the actual",
          "We spent a lot longer here than we'd expected. The zoo is built on the side of a hill, and set in woodland. Highlights are gorillas, snow leopard, fishing cat and underwater viewing areas for penguins, seals and manatees. There are also some habitat areas. Nice restaurant at",
          "Great zoo. It was very quiet due to the time of year, made it feel like we had our own private zoo. Very well organised with good facilities. The dolphin show was fantastic. The animals are cared about and well looked after. Would definitely recommend.",

          "We arrived late in the day and had to rush before the zoo closed, but what we saw was absolutely worth the time. Good layout and easy to navigate. Mostly flat to help with walking. Get an earlier start and make a day of it.",

          "Easy to get to on the Tiergarten tram, drops you off right in front. Very pleasant, small zoo. Nice exhibits and habitats for the animals. Unique that they have a Dolphin arena and training demonstration specific times. Cafeteria style restaurant with a variety of selections",
          "I had seen many zoo's until now but this really impressed me. First of all is very big. second, the variety of animals. Don't miss the dolphin and seal show! Get a place half an hour before it's start because you don't find place at the time of start. Prepare your camera",
          "Great zoo with lots of interesting animals. Very pleasant atmosphere. Tram takes you right to the zoo.",
          "Do you wish you could go into jungle safaris to observe animals in their natural habitat? Well, visiting the Nuremberg Zoo can be a similar experience because this Zoo is situated in a forest and be prepared with the best shoes you have for this trip as you will have to walk for",
          "As other reviewers have said, be prepared to walk as this place is big. From one side to the other it is about 1.5 kilometres and has a lot of hills. Some of the hills can be quite steep so bear that in mind if you have small children. There are little trolleys you can use for",
          "We spent the whole day here and it was great. There is a great range of animals. While it is an older style zoo some of the enclosures should be bigger the newer looking enclosures were much bigger. The enclosure where you could go in and feed the goats was great fun and",

It costs \u20ac20 each for an adult and children were \u20ac10. The zoo is easily accessible from the tram or bus routes. We spent a good",
          "Be prepared to walk - thankfully lots of shade as it was extremely hot, but the facility is well maintained and has great access to food and drinks. The habitats appear to be well kept and we were surprised to see how close you can actually get to the animals compared to zoos",
          "It almost felt that you weren't in a zoo. There were minimal 'cages' or housed exhibits. The majority of the animals were in exposed fields, of a very large size in proportion to the number of animals in them.. We were really impressed by that and impressed by the healthiness",
          "Lots of walking, some hilly areas, lots of animals to see, so wear comfy shoes and pack a lunch. It is allowed to bring in if you would like, but they do have vendors as you enter the zoo.",
          "We saved the last day of a week long trip to N\u00fcrnberg to visit the zoo and what a way to round up the holiday. The zoo offers a huge range of animals to see and both the grounds and enclosures are beautifully kept. An extra bonus is how easily accessible the zoo is from the",
          "Nuremberg zoo is one of the places to visit if you have young kids. Kids love to see different animals and this zoo has plenty of them and has a good variety. For non Deutsch speakers they provide English menu which is super helpful. It has divided zoo in 5 areas like monkey,",
          "Our daughter (12) chose the zoo as her activity request. We have a great zoo at home, but the weather is usually too hot to enjoy it. This zoo has many natural habitats, shaded walking trails, a great variety of animals, an excellent playground for younger kids, and even sea",
          "We love visiting different zoo's This place was really good and value for money, there is plenty to see and do at the zoo. You have to get the metro link in as it's quite distance to walk. The journey is only around 15 minutes and very easy to navigate. If you have a morning",
          "Plan to walk...and plan to enjoy the stroll. This park-like zoo is hilly in places and sprawls, but every bit of the walk is pretty. The highlight: seeing a dolphin show from the underside. Viewing the acrobatics underwater from a massive viewing area was a perspective I've",
          "Had the day to kill before flying home in the evening so got the tram to the zoo for the day. Its very easy to get to by public transport, costs 3 Euro 20 I think for a ticket there from just outside Nurnberg Hauptbahnhof main train station in Nurnberg and only takes between",
          "Good ZOO with lots of interesting animals. I am not a friend of keeping dolphins in ZOOs but in Nurnberg even the dolphins look to be taken a relatively good care of. Highlight of the ZOO for me were their manatees though, it is an interesting encounter to see them so far from",
          "We took the number 5 tram from the station in Nuremberg to be dropped right outside for easy access. Reasonable cost at 27 euro for two for entry. Food and drink inside all reasonable priced, lots to do and see. I was especially pleased to see the Manitee (sea cows) which I",

          "This place was amazing ..you need a good few hours to get around it\u2019s massive .. from lions and tigers to dolphins and sea lions this place has them all and they all appear very well cared for with lots of space to move around .. the cafes were nice and clean and the curry wurst",
          "The Zoo cares for a wonderful and varied collection of wildlife. The layout encourages one to focus on each enclosure. The playground spaces provide a welcome diversion for children. Good for all ages. Please note that there are some up and downhills that. May feel a bit steep",
          "Nice place to spend the weekend with family and friends. Very big Zoo and a lot of cute animals to see.",
          "Took tram no.5 from the old city. It was too cold for some of the animals that were hiding away. There were a good variety of animals and it was quiet and spaced out. I think its good considering it serves a small region, but nevertheless it doesnt compare to Chester or London",
          "It was a great day at the zoo. Saw a lot of the animals and they had really big fish in the river. That was cool to see",
          "Really impressed by this zoo! Went there after getting a Nuremberg card, so it was free entrance and free public transport. Planned to spend half a day there but enjoyed it so much we spent 6 hours there! Some unique attractions like the seal/dolphin show which was fun to watch",
          "It was sooo nice! I love animals and zoos so much we spent a whole day here! The weather was really cold and it was a good thing that there were in house attractions as well so we could have a quick warm up. We arrived when the dolphin show was just about to start and since",
          "This zoo is a jewel of Nurenberg, rivals with zoo's of much bigger cities around the world. The set-up is perfect, there are many animal species, a big aquarium, dolphins, penguins, tigers, lions, a great monkeys court and another one for apes, excellent playgrounds (even a",
          "The zoo was only about 15 minutes from the center by tram, and admission was great value for the size of the zoo. The location is incredible, was amazing walking through the wood with the zoo built into it. The hills might be hard work for some people but I enjoyed the walk",
          "We visited to the Nuremberg Zoo. We used tram no 5 from Hauptbahnhof main to the Tiergarten stop. This was the last stop on the journey, where it would turn around ready for the return journey. We used our Nuremberg Passes, the cost of the pass was 25\u20ac which included all forms",
          "This zoo is lovely and large with a wide variety of animals including manatees, dolphins and polar bears which are unusual to see in a zoo in the UK. We visited on a very cold snowy day so the animals weren\u2019t very active but still visible. Be prepared to walk a lot in this zoo,",
          "Visited this zoo last week and had a wonderful 5 hours there. Be prepared to walk as it is set over many acres. The zoo was very quiet, but was nice as it meant I could take a lot of pictures and could easily see lots of the animals close up. There are a fantastic selection",
          "Easy to go to with tram or bus outside the main train station. It takes you from 3 to 4 hrs to visit. A nice sea lion and dolphin show. Lots of animals to see. Well worth a visit",
          "The zoo is nothing short of amazing! Easily accessed via the no5 team from town which stops directly outside the entrance. It is set outside the city in the woods which makes for a perfect, relaxed setting. At only \u20ac13.00 for adults it\u2019s an absolute bargain in comparison to",
          "It was more like we were walking through a park than a zoo. Some hilly walks, but you can hire a buggy for \u20ac4 if you have children that get tired. A good play area in the middle, too. Easy to get to on the No 5 tram (Tiergarten).",
          "We visited after season, so it may be part of it, but everything seemed a little bit shabby - toilets, pavilions.. But never mind, because they have some really cool animals: dolphins and manatees - and their pavilion is awesome.",
          "The park itself was scenic though a little hilly. The enclosures for the small animals seemed adequate. But the tigers were inside a small glass enclosure with one at a time allowed outside into a small area this I found very upsetting. The lions were outside, but yet again on a",
          "This zoo is such a lovely day out for all the family! The forest setting is so relaxing and amazing. It is a nice zoo where you will spend a whole day if you want to see all the animals. It also has a lovely playground for the kids to have a great play break in the middle of the",
          "There was a bit of a line when we first arrived and unless you get there early, you may have to park a little far. But definitely worth it. We have visited zoos over the world and I don't recall ever beeing this close to the animals. The exhibits are not as far as others and the",
          "We only really went because it was included on the Nuremberg card. The enclosures for the small animals were good- the Red Panda must have had no idea that he lives in captivity, but the abiding memory is of the lions, tiger, dolphins, that (as is true for most zoos) simply do",
          "What a lovely zoo! Animals are really close by. There are a lot of trees, So Good to visit even on a warm day. Take cash, you can't pay with card in the zoo. We would visit it again If it was close by. Really Nice dolphin show. We visited passing by, 4 hours is enough, But If",
          "It is great place to spend a day, outdoor with your kids .. you can see all kind of animals and birds from all over the world but the most wonderful is the dolphin show .. you need to check for the time the show start.",
          "When we arrived to the ZOO, we could see a lot of cars. Everywhere. We were worried that ZOO will be too crowdy. Fortunetaly it wasnt. The ZOO is really large. We could see a lot of animals. Not all you can remember, as someone wrote here. For instance there are not Elephants.",
          "The best zoo ever visited! The kids loved it. A lot of animals in a very well preserved environment. We enjoyed the dolphin and seal show during feeding time! The place is amazing.",
          "Excellent zoo, reasonably priced and easy to navigate. Best of all, the animals are really close and easy to see and all the habitats look natural.",
          "I really enjoyed the Nuremberg zoo! I loved all the animals there! My favourite animal there was the tiger. It was funny to see a tiger playing in the water. I thought it was trying to catch a fish. The tiger was actually playing with a log. I think it had a good habitat but was",
          "Every animal u can think of is represented here. We especially enjoyed the Dolphins. It took us about 3 hrs to make our round, the Zoo is huuuuuuge!",
          "This is an amazing zoo. We visited in February. We love how big the zoo was with plenty of room for the animals to move around and also plenty of room for guests to explore. There is a really wide range of animals in this zoo and you could easily spend a full day there like we",
          "Love this park and the living conditions of the animals. Could have stayed here all day as the kids just loved it.",
          "Many wonderful animals in really nice and natural park. You don't see solid cages, so you can focus on animals. Dolphins are great!! The only minus is, that all descriptions and explanations are in German only.",
          "What a lovely zoo. Very easy to get to by tram. We spent 3 hours here and could have stayed longer had it not been closing time. The animals looked really well cared for and the whole place was beautifully clean. Loved the Pygmy marmosets who were free to run above your head on",
          "With the temperature at 30+, hottest day of the year so far, we were looking for a cool place to spend the day and saw on Tripadvisor that the zoo is shady with plenty of trees. Indeed it is ! It's easy to get there from the city centre on the tram. We were very impressed with",
          "We came to the Nuremberg zoo, because we wanted to see the amazing animals - dolphings...and manatees too:o) The zoo is in very nice forrest area. You can spend here very nice day.",
          "I visited with my family, and we really enjoyed the day. They have many animals to see, and put in an effort for the animals to have good surroundings.",
          "Parking lots available around the main entrance at no cost. If the main ones are occupied, don't get desperate, follow the signs into adjacent forested area to the main lot. There is also a public bus available, stopping just outside the main access gate. Information can be",
          "Nice European zoo. It is a very nice walk and the zoo itself a lot larger than I thought it would be. Took quite some time to walk the whole thing and we actually got turned around once due to the size of the complex. Animals seemed relatively content and engaged. The dolphins",
          "Nuremberg Zoo is one of the biggest zoo in Europe. It is a beautiful green park and you can see many kinds of animals. Dolphin show is the best part of zoo. I recommend to everyone to visit zoo.",

          "As other reviewers said, Nuremberg Zoo is excellent for many reasons: very reasonably priced, large zoo with ~6 miles of well-maintained paved paths, many exhibits are spacious, Dolphin show is a highlight (sit in upper area for best viewing of show), water exhibits have lower",
          "What a fantastic Zoo. Beautiful location surrounded by trees. Lots of animals to see and a very clean, tidy and well kept zoo.",
          "Brought our Burley double stroller for 1&4yr olds. Great zoo! Open area lunch with waiter service was great... space is close to open play area for kids (so you can eat and watch them play). Offered play ground and open space for motorized cars which were a BLAST! Meal was",
          "That the zoo in Nuremberg is a beautiful place many other visitors will probably point out. They are perfectly right. It's a wonderful area for kids with wild animals, Delfin shows, but also nice play grounds, and many other attractions. But please be aware - after 11 am it's a",
          "Spent a Sunday afternoon here. Very easy to get to from Nuremburg centre, a direct tram running numerous times an hour. Entrance cost is reasonable, about 25 euros for two adults. The zoo itself is well kept, clean, the animals are in nice enclosures and look well kept. It is a",
          "The animals seem happy and playful here. The tigers played with each other in the water. The polar bear was swimming about his pool. The Meerkats ran. As a parent, it was incredibly nice that the food was reasonably priced.",
          "Wow, the zoo is set in gorgeous woodland and so natural without the high fences and caged feeling of usual zoos. We had a lovely walk around through the well laid out paths (some of which are quite steep). As it was winter many of the animals were kept inside but this wasn't a",
          "The Nuremberg Zoo was build into the Forest Area with little hills. The Cages are mostly crafted into the stones there. They have a great variety on animals. I love to go there just to take pictures. You can see the Animals mostly without fence but other ways to keep them in so",
          "Easy access from the main train station and nice to get out of the main city centre to see more of the area. We went in February on a friday so it was really quiet so was perfect as we almost feel like we had the zoo to ourselves. Large zoo, lots of walking to do and some",
          "One of the favorite places to go out in summer with kids and friends. Nuremberg is not a big city, but has interesting attractions all over.",
          "Visited the zoo on December 24 and practically had the zoo to ourselves. We went into the lion den and watched the lions eat - up close and personal! We thought it was a really good zoo.",
          "During our trip to Nuremberg we decided to spend the afternoon in the zoo. Due to the time of year and the chilly conditions there was very few other people in the zoo we felt like it was our private tour. The zoo is home to a wide variety of animals from dolphins to camels,",
          "We visited Nuremberg Zoo in December. The zoo itself it's an amazing place with many animals, but visiting it in the winter doesn't get you the chance to see it's beauty. It's true that the zoo it's not crowded (you will barely see a few people), but also you don't get the",
          "You'll be spoilt here! Lots of animals to see along with activities and pleasant walks. Probably a dry day activity. There is a lovely restaurant onsite.",
          "Visited with our 3 year old. This was a wonderful zoo with lots of animals being quite active (given it was nearly freezing!) and beautiful surroundings in a forest. Highly enjoyable. Easy parking. The Bavarian restaurant served good sausages for lunch, but I would skip dessert",
          "Probably the best zoo I've seen. The animals all seem to be very active compared to the zoos I've recently visited. I also got to see a tiger let out a big roar a few times which was unique. Not sure if it regularly does this. The zoo is in the woodland and has lots of sandstone",
          "I can guarantee the place for good study of animal kingdom. Because there are so variety species. And then they organised in the zone and easy to explore entire park.",
          "Perhaps the zoo does not want the animals to catch a cold, most of them are not at home. There is simply not much to see here in winter! While the walk is nice, it certainly does not worth EUR13.5 to visit.",
          "One of the most beautiful zoos I've ever seen and I say this not necessarily because of the number of animals but because of the way it is arranged.A walk in this zoo it's like a walk in nature as long as it's placed in some old woods.So,you walk the alleys beneath old trees and",
          "Well what can I say ... I was so happy after visiting this place. I have only been to a zoo in Sri Lanka and compared to that one this was like a different world not only for the people who are visiting but also for the animals. The space that they have allocated for each animal",
          "Visited here on a rainy September day. We loved it .. they have a petting zoo with pigmy goats, a very cute red panda family. We stayed at the dolphins feeding. We really liked the weird piggies, the animals had space, they seemed happy and we really had a good impression.",
          "Visited here on a cold November day. Hardly anyone else there. Great place to visit with good size enclosures for the animals. Lions and Tigers were fab, and were fairly active even in the cold. Polar Bear sat watching us and the sea lions gave us a display of their own",
          "It has been a great day with my familiy and friends, the Zoo offers a big variarity of food and also restrooms. a very good puplic transportation connection! Recommandable!",
          "The location of the zoo, design, kind of animals ... You should see this place. Also good for a small walk.",
          "We were here on a sunny day. The zoo is amazing, we saw the dolphins feeding and it was great. It's a great place for kids and adults as well. I liked better the ones from Wien and Prague, but this one is nice also. I strongly recommend it. The entrance is 13.5 Euros for adults.",
          "The zoo is great and easy to reach from the center by tram no. 5. There were some really rare species that we have never seen alive - like the manatees, the red panda and the Nepalese rhinoceros. 3 times a day there are performances at the dolphin lagoon and that's why many",
          "This delightful, comparatively small zoo, is easily accessible by tram, from the Nuremberg Central Station. Set in the pleasant \"Imperial Forest\", there are easy, moderate and steep walks that are clearly marked on the Guide map. Children's activities, a pleasant caf\u00e9 /",
          "zoo is located just outside Nuremberg city centre but the tram stops right outside. We had the 2 day Nuremberg card which was excellent value as it included the zoo and most of the museums. The zoo covers a large areas comfortable walking shoes are advisable. The animals are",
          "We've been coming here since before we had children. The zoo offers a great, mostly shaded though hilly walk (former quarry) with lots of animals. We especially enjoy the manatee house. If you go during the week, this is a great place to sit and watch the butterflies, listen to",
          "Dolphin show is included in admission and was the highlight of our visit. Be sure to have plenty of Euros, as credit cards are not accepted for zoo admission....",
          "We came here with my fiance, our 10 month old daughter, my sister in law & brother in law. Initially thought it was closed, we were in Nuremberg for the Christmas markets & at the height of winter! However, it was just very quiet but we were here for well over 3 hours. It is set",
          "This was a lovely zoo with a large variety of animals. Unlike zoos in America, this zoo seemed so open that I was afraid the tigers were going to hop the moat with no high fence there! Lots of walking up and down hills, so we had to separate and let the grandparents head in a",
          "This zoo is big with an awful lot to see. You will do lots of walking and see lots of animals. It starts at 13.50 euro for single adult going to 31.00 euros for two adults and 3 children. For families you can get a little trolley/wagon which you can pull along and initially put",
          "I (22 years old) visited with my sister (20 years old) and our parents. Should have been \u20ac14 each but we were charged a family ticket, about \u20ac22 less than we would have paid - even though we said 4 adults in English and German. We spent 9 hours here in total, and didn't get to",
          "What a nice surprise! 14 Euro gets you in and there is a beautiful selection of animals, all looking rather content and well looked after. Saw the polar bear superstars playing, the dolphin show and enjoyed every minute. BYO food as the cafes are a bit expensive, but highly",
          "Very big zoo and very nice to visit spicily for family you will spent at least 5 hours there 2 restaurant there and very nice train will take u to zoochildren",
          "Spend an extremely enjoyable 5 hours visiting this enormous zoo. Great animal enclosures but very spaced out, so lots of walking some slightly up hill but not a problem if you are used to walking. We covered 9km but managed to see everything. Tigers and polar bears were good as",
          "The zoo provides contact with the animals and with the environment. It is clear to the visitor that the animal has its own biome when going close to their space. The cages are big, which provide a good quality of life for the animal and also looks as much as possible like the",
          "I would add this to my list of good zoos- great lay out, animal selection and care given to the animals and their habitats. Add to that the vastly shaded trails and attention to the native flora on the paths you have a great zoo- up there with San Diego and Cincinnati zoos - my",
          "Let me summarize the pros and cons of this nice Zoo: Pro: - The Zoo is laid out like an extensive, beautiful, hilly park; you can wander for hours. - There are a large amount of free parking spaces; if you are early, you can literally park in front of the Zoo in the wide",
          "We like zoos that care for the captive animals they have and Nuremberg is at the top of our list!. Easily accessible by tram from the main station outside Hauptbahnhof which drops you off virtually at the zoo gates - perfect. Layout of the zoo is quite unusual in the sense that",
          "Nuremberg zoo isn't the biggest of zoos, but it has beautifully designed enclosures for the animals and makes for a great trip. The tropical house and the sea house where you could see seahorses and dolphins under water were especially cool. The tigers and lions however had",
          "I spent a rainy day in the zoo and had amazing fun! I was surprised with the size of the zoo and with the amount of space that the animals have on their enclosures! The tropical forest enclosure (manatee house) is really impressive! A must see for zoo lovers!",
          "The park was moved by Hitler to its present situationand is among the biggest in Europe. The dolphin enclosure is Europes best, the Manatee house really cool. But no elephants",
          "I must preface this review with two disclaimers. First, it was a school day for Germans, and second, it was raining and overcast. Why does that matter? Well, my family and I seemed to have the entire zoo to ourselves. We spent 3 hours there and saw maybe 10 other people in",
          "This is one of the most amazing zoos out there. The Dolphins were the highlight for my kids. I did have some issues though. If you have sensitivity to smoking this will be difficult for you. I don't want to be around it and I definitely don't want my kids around it. Apparently",
          "Nice variety of animals, even dolphins. Easy to explore, spent half a day on Sunday, plenty of people. Good food & drink, decent prices",
          "Spent 4 hours on Sunday, plenty of people, good variety of animals, couple of places to eat/drink, decent prices",
          "Very well organized. Animals seem to be well taken care of. There is a nice small train. Nice playground. There is even a place where you can get in to touch some animals. RECOMMEND",
          "With children? In couple? Single? Just go and enjoy this gorgeous zoo. It is my favourite by far from all zoos I've witnessed. Carved in the nature, there is not really cages sticking to you when you admire Nature's different species. Clean, enjoyable and not too expensive, it",
          "The Nuremberg zoo is nice place to visit, the animals have good and spacious surroundings. Can be recommended especially when travelling with children!",
          "Went on a Monday morning in April. Perfect weather. Had the place to ourselves. Brought our three year old and newborn. Toddler friendly everything. Viewing areas and walking paths are fantastic. Animals appear healthy and energetic. Amazing kids playground area and well thought",
          "We spent about 4 hours at the Nuremberg zoo on a Sunday. Watching the manatees munching on some lettuce was our highlight. The zoo looked clean and well kept. Drinks and food reasonably priced. Parts of the zoo are a little hilly, but as we like walking it was great.",
          "Excellent zoo, just outside city centre, with reasonable admission prices- 30 Euros for family ticket. Covers huge area and is in the forest, which is very pleasant to walk tthrough, though there are some small hills to walk up. Look out for info at the entrance for the animal",
          "I visited here because it was one of the places I could get free entry with my Nuremberg Card. It was easy to use public transport (tram and then bus) from the city centre to get here. It's a little out of town, but the setting is perfect. There are lots of picnic areas dotted",
          "Great place for everyone, does not matter if you are with children, or coming with your partner, or even alone! Big park, nice walk, lot to see and nice places for a picnik!",
          "Very nice, spread out zoo in a naturally wooded area of the city. Huge kids area with playground, petting area, feed the goats. Missing elephants though.",
          "We have seen our share of zoos in Germany, in fact there aren't many we didn't visit yet. The time of our trip to Nuremberg probably wasn't the best one could think of, but we stayed in the area for New Year, so we went in early January. Since it was a rather warm day, that made",
          "Yes, go. Well thought out, large, sprawling acres of fauna and flora. We arrived very early and enjoyed the peace and quiet as animals slowly woke up to a sunny day. The dolphin show is worthwhile a gander and do take your seats higher up - so you can see properly. Do not forget",
          "The N\u00fcremberg zoo is located in a nice beauty spot, to which one can betake himself by tram n. 5. Before reaching the final stop, which is in front of the zoo entrance, the tram penetrates through the forest and then one starts being enchanted by the marvelous landscape of which",
          "The tiegarten is really a nice place to be with your family and friends. Now they have a dolphins show every day and it is really nice. The entry was 13,5 \u20ac, not too bad.",
          "This zoo is a great size with alot of diversity. This was a nice day long activity but parking is a headache!",
          "It was a big hit with our family, especially the dolphin show. Lots of animals to see and a wonderful playground. We really enjoyed the break from the city!",
          "Huge diversity, with well attained animals. Make sure you visit the exotic greenhouse and gorillas stand.",
          "There were a large variety of animals of various species which made it an interesting visit. The zoo has a great endangered species breeding programme as both the Siberian tigers and snow leopards had very young cubs in the enclosures. Definitely worth a trip - especially in the",
          "An amazing days spend among animals and wildlife. Of course it would be nicer not to see them in cages, but they are taking good care of them. A must see is the new dolphin area with a show. It was very nice.",
          "Great place to enjoy the day, and spend time with the kids! I've visited on different occasions during my visits to N\u00fcrnberg. If you'd like to spend the day outside, this may be the place to visit.",
          "Great PlayGround for Kids!! + Fantastic animals :) + Delfin Show ... SUUPERB !!! Food in the Restaurant was very bad!! ----",
          "youmay not see the animals, they love the genourus hideways they find in their surroundings. Manyanimals from all continents in a wide, green park. Your children will love it.",
          "All in all it's a pretty set up... But there are some pretty steep hills to climb to reach certain animal enclosures. Some of these enclosures are pretty tiny in comparison to the animals living in them... They recently remodeled the dolphin tank, but it's still just a blue,",
          "This is a zoo with a very long tradition and a lot of room for the animals (which I believe is more important than have loads of animals in one place). As in most zoos there is room for improvement with restaurants. But by and large it is one of the best ways to spend a lazy",
          "The ZOO has a good choice of animals, it's not too big, but we spent there around 5 hours and we even didn't see all the animals. Especially the water areas with dolphin show and feeding of seals and sea lions were great. Some parts of the ZOO look a bit older, but they are",
          "The zoo is located in the middle of the woods that make for an excellent day in nature. The dolphin presentation and Manati house are wonderful. The pavilions in the northern part could use a bit of renovation to extend the areas where the animals can roam freely.",
          "Great family day out. The zoo is an easy tram ride from the central station, and is large enough to enjoy a full day out. The highlights for us were the polar bears. It is also very reasonable to eat and drink in the many cafes and restaurants.",
          "The zoo is good for family with kids. It is big zoo so expect to walk a lot. The dolphin show is just ok, not great, you can go to zoo by taking Tram 5 from the main station.",
          "Easy to get to, great entry price especially for what's on offer. This is a huge place with plenty of space for animals and beautiful playgrounds. We totally loved the dolphin show and had fun feeding the cheeky goats. The only negative point was the food at Gruene Oase.",
          "We come quite often to Nuremburg and whenever we have the time we like to come to the zoo. Not only does it have lots of interesting animals, but because it is spread over a large area you get lots of exercise walking around too. For us, the highlight is always the dolphin show,",
          "An excellent zoo with a lot to see. More than enough to tire out all but the most active children. The dolphins were captivating. Not sure they should really be there, however there is no denying that their routine is nothing short of dazzling. Restaurant is great too! Easy",
          "It has animals. You can see them. It does't hinder you in any way in going about seeing the animals. Portions of the paths were a little steep. Food is all over the zoo, and it's pretty much what you would expect in Germany. It cost me, my wife, and my daughter (3 yr old) 25",
          "It cost 13.50 to get in, which at first sounded like a lot, but it is totally worth it! The only downside is that it is so big! However, to make up for the walking, on every corner is a restaurant and shop. The animals were in enclosures instead of cages, much better than",
          "I went with my 3 month old baby and my husband and we had an amazing time. The zoo is way different from any zoo in the states side. I would recommend people to go here. They also give a free key chain with your picture.",
          "We walked for 6 hours in the park, around 75 kind of animals are included, there was three resturant for fast food. The resturant food and service was not good. the kids can interact with the animals, informative place but description only written in German.",
          "This is a zoo that is definately worth the price. A wide variety of animals and home to the dolphinarium.",
          "I have been to many zoos and never seen one so spacious and fun. The monkeys run over your heads and the cats feeding session was the coolest to watch. They allow you to bring in food so pack a huge picnic and spend the day with your family at an educational and relazing place!",
          "Dolphins and seecows were amazing. We visited the show with dolphins twice and both were not the same. In the zoo there are many nice children playgrounds.",
          "The Nuremberg Zoo is a very well kept, lovely park where the animals live in large areas which closely resemble their natural habitats. The Nuremberg Zoo is definitely one I can recommend. It is beautiful to walk around in, and the wide variety of animals appear to be very well",
          "Large zoo, with many species needing large areas to be kept well, be prepared for a long walk, but it is worth it. The woodland setting is great, with massive natural sandstone outcrops, and has a wonderful bonus of lots of native wildlife too, especially birds - in late may",
          "This Zoo is fantastic and of very high Quality. Incredibly, you get a decent Dolphin show included in your standard ticket. This is unheard off considering Dolphin shows alone can be quite expensive. The setup is great with beautiful landscaping and a wide range of species.",
          "Beautiful zoo with lots of baby animals this time of year. The created natural habitats for the animals.",
          "Very big and with lots of trees well kept and clean big children playing areas. You can only pay cash. Easy to reach from the city center by tram so no need to bring your car.",
          "One of germany\u00b4s oldest zoo\u00b4s, the dolphin show is very interesting. downside... nothing is in english .",
          "We took our Grand Daughter and enjoyed a relaxed 4 hrs in one of the best zoos in Bavaria. Nicely laid out and stroller friendly.",
          "We live in Munich still we travelled 100Kms to Nuremburg for specially this zoo as this is quiet BIG zoo in whole Baveria and you need a complete day to enjoy it to fullest.It has all range of animal. The seal show was amazing and play area with OLD McDonalds farm animals were",
          "I've been living in Germany for ages now and I visited several zoos as our lil boy was still small. As an overseas tourist, this place is actualy not a must visit, but once you live in Germany and have kids, and love to take them around across the country, this is one of the",
          "I went with family while they were visiting. This zoo is massive. We saw literally every exhibit thanks to my cousin's interest in animals. It took us five hours to get through it. There are some hills to climb, but there are picnic tables and benches set up for people who need",
          "The layout of the Zoo was terrible and the map didn't match up. Other than that, it was so much fun! Don't miss the goat feeding area, crepes stand, and if you have little ones the playground is awesome. Prepare to spend an entire day here, do a lot of walking, and see TONS of",
          "It was a spectacular when I see lions eating raw meats! A big zoo, worth visiting. There is a combination price if you use a tram.",
          "This zoo is nicely laid out, with a very complete variety of animals. There is a fee for entry. There is an indoor dolphin show, which is great for the kids. The dolphin show is a separate fee. There are a few dining facilities within the grounds, and bathroom facilities are",
          "We have visited lots of zoos in Czech Republic, Slovakia and Germany. Any time of the year. But this one seemed having very little to see compared to others. Many animals were taken away for winter time. On the good side the animals are kept in very nice and natural",
          "The Nuremberg Zoo is a fun-filled and educational experience for the kids, and it's leafy park-like layout gives it a relaxing atmosphere for parents to enjoy as well. The dolphin display is a treat, but get there well before the show starts, as good seating is in short",
          "An excellent little zoo with nice collection of various animals. Lions and seals are special attractions. Quiet little walkways through the zoo to explore. Tram service from the downtown directly takes you to the zoo.",
          "One of the greatest Zoos in Central Europe. Its Delfinarium, size, overall spirit and number of animal make one of our favorite destinations with our kids. If only the food service would be better. There is basically only one restaurant open during winter with pretty limited",
          "A wonderful zoo, some animals have lots of room, others not so much. The dolphins show was great, and there is a viewing room \"underground\" so you can see the dolphins and the sea-lions swim. Too bad that the only thing they offer for children is a big wooden cart that you have",
          "My wife and I had a great time at the zoo today. It's a beautiful zoo with nice trails through the forrest between some of the exhibits. There are benches abs picnic tables throughout the park to rest if needed. Our favorite exhibit was the dolphins. The seating area to watch",
          "I hardly ever come here. Only if I get forced from my school etc. I always feel sorry for some of the animals. A lot of the cages are quite good sized, but others seem way too small like the dolphins , the crocodiles , the sea cows.. Please change that and let the dolphins back",
          "This zoo is by far the largest zoo that I have been to. It may not have as many animals as some but the animals have large places to stay and places to stay inside once it gets cold. I love that. Prepare for a lot of walking.",
          "Zoos tend to be more of the same, so here's what set the Nuremberg Zoo apart: - an awesome playground! - some animals (really cool ones) that I'd never seen in a zoo before, or even heard of - a dolphin show - huge pretzels for sale at the entrance - more walking than I recall",
          "This is a must do when visiting Nuremburg. The zoo is situated in a nice quiet forest setting, with lots of trails. It is easy to reach via the tram.",
          "The Zoo itself is quite nice and large, but for unknown reason is highly unfriendly to international travelers. forget about going there without a stack of cash in your pocket, no credit cards are accepted (unless you have the special german EC card) and no ATM is within reach",
          "Definitely a must-visit. A beautiful, well-kept zoo located in a forest just outside N\u00fcrnberg. The animals seem well treated, and you get really close to them. The enclosures blend into the surrounding forest, at times leaving you to wonder if there is any separation between you",
          "In a large group we were able to have an escorted private tour of the zoo and then dinner was in the restaurant with a terrific dinner show that was funny and entertaining. Highly recommend this 100 year old zoo - 75 years in this location.",
          "This zoo is fantastic! It has lots of facilities and playgrounds for the kids. The animals are well treated and the whole zoo is without a doubt greatly organized. My wife and I along with some friends have spent an outstanding memorable Saturday afternoon there and helped us to",
          "the best ever zoo i have seen,main part is the dolphin show and seal show.amazing performance and well trained.well organised and takes one day to enjoy fully and roam around the zoo.its gud to visit in summer",
          "Spent a grey wet day in zoo, despite this the tropical ravine was impressive and the manati basin a nice surprise, also the dolphin training and sea lions show wort watching, plenty of things to do for all ages with nice extensive play ground and kids zoo with feeding",
          "very clean ,perfect organization !Is only 15 minutes with tram and the station is at the entrance of the zoo",
          "One of the best zoo i ever visited..it is spread in wide area jungle type. snacks collection also good. Dont miss the Dolphin show, awesome experirnce...",
          "Zoo is located in woods and creates feeling that you are in nature. We visited zoo in winter, so not all animals were displayed, but anyways worth visiting. They have petting zoo with pigs, cows, etc. 2-3 playgrounds for children and aquarium. Be careful when taking taxi to zoo,",
          "This is a big zoo. Take your time. One can watch the dolphin show or admire all the beautiful animals from all over the world. It is located on the edge of the town.",
          "We were astounded by the tropical house - manatee's, fish, frogs, birds, butterflies, iguana and monkeys all in one area you walk through. This is one of the best zoo's I have ever been to - we might even go back, despite it being a flight only destination for us. We also loved",
          "I felt sorry for some of the animals being enclosed in such small and unnatural spaces, especially the Dolphins. The layout itself is quite nice and there is a diverse range of animals, although there are a lot better Zoos around the world. The facilities are good.",
          "Built in an area of parkland, the visit to the zoo offerred an opportunity to take a pleasant walk whilstv vieing a range of animal species. If there is a correct approach to keeping animals in captivity, then Nuremburg is the way forward.",
          "I am very happy that I had opportunity to visit this zoo. I had wonderful time here. Everything was very nice, but I especially loved manatees! \u2665 Dophine show was so so so funny! :) The botanic part was the best, I took many pictures there. I recommend this friendly zoo to",
          "Took the tram from Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof to the zoo, fantastic to ride through the trees directly to the zoo entrance. Good price for entry and very clean. A fantastic variety of animals to look at, we especially enjoyed the dolphins. A nice selection of food available in the",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the zoo in Nuernberg in August. The animals are spread over a large area which allows you to walk and spend a whole day looking around. There are plenty of opportunities to sit and to have some food. Don't miss the dolphin show! It is in German,",

          "I went with my family of 5 and we had a great time. The animal's enclosures are anything but! There is every kind of animal you could think of and it's nicely landscaped with beautiful flowers. The facilities are clean and organized. People are friendly, but not all can speak",

          "The zoo is huge in my perspective but I grew up by a small humble zoo. The dolphin and aquarium exhibits are their pride and joy and they make it obvious by the seemingly lack of care to the rest of the zoo. Its nice altogether but they showcase that part the most. The kinder",

          "We had an excellent experience here! We took our 1 year old daughter and she loved seeing all of the different types of animals, as well as the many different habitats. The cost was approx. 27 euro for two adults, which was a bit steep. The food in the restaurant was fair priced",
          "....I have seen it much nicer and better ages ago. When I used to go their as a kid with my grand pa I loved all the different species. But it seems to me now a days the visible animals are getting less and less. They might have more butterflies and birds but when we have been",
          "For sure a great day ! Just go around this beautiful and vast zoo. Animals do not look so much in cages, and the vegetation around is beautiful",

          "It was hard to understand everything written... as it was in German, but the zoo was much bigger than I expected! Manz animals and even a dolphin show!! It was a great experience!!",

          "Pretty historic bridge worth the short walk. Many nice views from the bridge and surrounding area. Not crowded.",
          "Another special place to wander to when you walk around Nuremberg. Old wooden bridge over the river makes such a great a photograph to reminisce about when you get back home. Throughly enjoyed the area and seemed to gravitate here on more than one occasion as we explored the",
          "The Hangman's Bridge is a really nice bridge to stop and admire the views as you explore the Altstadt. Make sure you check this place out as you explore the city.",
          "Not much activity you can do here except relax and enjoying the walk and the view. Would recommend to have a nice cup of coffee in the nearby cafe.",
          "Popular style of bridge over the river in the city. Great architecture and feel of history. Solidly built and one of the best looking type of this style of covered bridge",
          "an amazing beautiful covered bridge. Visited when we were on our Viking Cruise. One of the guides was kind enough to take me right to the bridge.",
          "the history of this place is interesting, and the one executioner our tour guide spoke about was in his job for 40 years. Gruesome things were done to keep the law.",
          "The story goes that the Nuremberg town executioner lived in the tower opposite, far enough away from the other town folk that they could avoid him. He changed the rules for executing women although that's probably not quite enough for a gong next International Women's Day.",
          "This area was my favorite area in Old Town. Lots of pretty bridges which I suppose looked extra special with the light snow falling. Pics and more info at etbtravelphotography",
          "Every time I go there I show my friends or whoever I\u2019m with the cool things Nurenberg has to offer the best thing about it is you don\u2019t have to pay they\u2019re all over the place however never missed a bratwurst roll",
          "When we were on our Viking Cruise I was thrilled to get the opportunity to visit Hangman's Bridge. One of the tour guides took me to the bridge on her own. How nice!! Nice bridge in excellent condition.",
          "Part of our walking tour took us the the bridge. It was strange to see a wooden bridge across the river but the stay regarding the hangman was compelling. Nice place to visit as part of your trip to Nuremberg.",
          "Went here mid morning. A covered bridge with some great views of the river. There is a cafe just over the bridge on the left that does good breakfasts and coffee and tea.",
          "Hangman's Bridge is a picturesque covered bridge over the river. We did not go in to the museum as it was closed that day.",
          "A wonderful section of the city to stroll and take in the scene. It was not busy and seems to be missed by the tourist mob. Take time to get that interesting photo that nobody else has and stop at one of the local cafes and enjoy a cup of coffee and a tasty pastry.",
          "This was cute just to walk across and very nice to photograph as well. Tucked away by a few other bridges it adorable to come across.",
          "I had no idea what this gem was when I stumbled upon it. It's a wooden covered pedestrian bridge that fit in so well with the Altstadt. Discovering that it was \"Hangman's Bridge\" makes it even cooler and offers awesome pic opportunities.",
          "We had heard of this bridge, but didn\u2019t seek it out. However, we ate at a nearby restaurant one evening and happened to cross it. The Hangman\u2019s House at one end is now a Museum, but was obviously closed at night. There is little to see, but you need to know the history.",
          "This is just one more gem to be found in the Old Town: the Hangman's Way, a roofed sentry walk, which was once part of the 14th Century fortifications that secured the river exit. While it is itself interesting, this bridge also provides the visitor with many photogenic",
          "A picturesque setting where newly married couples have photo shoots has not always been such a romantic place. Just across this bridge on the island is the executioners cottage and this bridge is where those condemned in times gone by took their last steps to the gallows.",
          "Came here on a walking tour and was interesting to learn a little more about it. The last walk people took over this bridge before the executioners house the other side. Picturesque views over the river",
          "When we were there a freshly married couple walked around there and have had a photo session. A wooden bridge over a small river with sweet ducks. Lovely.",
          "A very nice area to walk around and lots to see along the river with nice bridges and buildings, then walk into town and stop for coffee and cake.",
          "This covered bridge used to connect the hangman's house with the gallows. Now it is a beautiful walkwat across the the river Pegnitz, connecting the two parts of the old town. It's a great place to take more unusual or atypical pictures.",
          "And awful history too. But very interesting Place and they have this nice logo in the wall of the Hangman's house.",
          "As far as I can tell, this is the only wooden bridge in downtown Nuremberg. It leads you over the river to the Hangman's House (Henker Haus) which is a museum (only open weekends in the winter). It reminds me of a lot of the wooden bridges you see in the US and is worth a few",

          "Wee bit tricky to find, but the walk is pretty on a nice day which makes up for it. Beautiful view, and great photo opportunity. Maybe we missed it, but some history on the bridge would have been nice.",
          "You can cross the river back and forth starting from the west part of the old city center all the way through the east, on these old but nice bridges, each with its own unique charm and story.",
          "A covered wooden bridge over the Pegnitz river, which I guess the Hangman used to access the tower! The bridge is nothing special to see but if the weather is good, take a walk along the river and cross all the bridges as you find them. Cost is zero if you ignore all the beers,",
          "Do not miss this part of the area when visiting this quaint part of Germany...walk along the river and over the bridge from the Starbucks and you will come to this bridge with such history...lovely area.",
          "There is a lot to do in Nuremberg, so if you are staying for a little while, a nice stroll around the town and down to the Hangman's bridge is absolutely charming. This old wooden bridge links two areas of the town and I cannot remember ever seeing a bridge like it. Evidently it"

          "St. Elizabeth is the largest Roman Catholic church of the city. It was dedicated to Saint Elizabeth of Hungary and was built in this location. The chapel was demolished in 1785 and replaced by a neo-classical building. St. Elizabeth's Church was badly damaged during World War",
          "The outside doesn't look that spectacular aside from the dome on the top. There is a door to go inside, which is not that obvious. Once inside the interior is in different coloured marble and is worth seeing.",
          "From the exterior I expected more of the same... but found a cozy and very pretty smaller church... too big to be a chapel, but it was an intimate church. Would have enjoyed attending a service there!",
          "St. Elisabeth Church is unique among the other two gothic churches (St. Lorenz and St. Sebald) in Nuremberg. While not as elaborately detailed as St. Lorenz or St. Sebald, St. Elisabeth provides a glimpse into the architecture of the 17 and early 1800's. It's present day altar",
          "Is this really a church? From the outside it looks like a government building or a Masonic Hall. Classical architecture which disguises the true building and its usage. The church is very small in snide and almost circular in shape, with the pews arranged in a circle facing",
          "If you look at this structure you may mistake it for something other than a church. It is definitely a different look for a church on the outside - nothing super special - but the interior makes up for it. The church is beautiful on the inside if you take the time to look at",
          "This church looks more like a government building than a place of worship and inside the area to sit is very compact and centralized. It has a modern feel though it is decorated with more medieval/renaissance art. The statues of the 12 apostles in the dome are very eye catching.",
          "Interesting church but not one of the most beautiful in Nuremberg.Anyway,somehow different from the other churches in town,with its round dome.Across the street is another beautiful church,Jakobskirche.",
          "An interesting church but not as beautiful as many in Nuremberg. Very imposing exterior with interesting domed ceiling.",
          "St. Elisabeth church is the only neoclassical one in Nuremberg. As St. Jacobs church it is located in Jakobsplatz. Both churches are very different from one another, since St. Jacobs church is of gothic style. Notwithstanding that, they both belonged once to the Teutonic Order.",
          "Bringing the altar to the middle of the round is just one of the touches that makes this church on of the more popular in Nuernberg. Incredible baroque architecture and a delightful dome."

        "wiki": "The Nuremberg Rally (officially Reichsparteitag , meaning Reich Party Convention) was the annual rally of the Nazi Party in Germany, held from 1923 to 1938.  They were large Nazi propaganda events, especially after Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933. These events were held at the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg from 1933 to 1938 and are usually referred to in English as the \"Nuremberg Rallies\". Many films were made to commemorate them, including Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will and The Victory of Faith.\n\n\n== History and purpose ==\nThe first Nazi Party rallies took place in 1923 in Munich and in 1926 in Weimar. From 1927 on, they took place exclusively in Nuremberg. The Party selected Nuremberg for pragmatic reasons: it was in the center of the German Reich and the local Luitpoldhain (converted parkland) was well suited as a venue. In addition, the Nazis could rely on the well-organized local branch of the party in Franconia, then led by Gauleiter Julius Streicher. The Nuremberg police were sympathetic to the event.\nLater, the location was justified by the Nazi Party by putting it into the tradition of the Imperial Diet (German Reichstag) of the Holy Roman Empire, considered the First Reich. After 1933, the rallies took place near the time of the Autumnal equinox, under the title of \"The German people's National Party days\" (Reichsparteitage des deutschen Volkes), which was intended to symbolize the solidarity between the German people and the Nazi Party. This point was further emphasized by the yearly growing number of participants, which finally reached over half a million from all sections of the party, the army, and the state.\n\n\n== Rallies ==\n\nEach rally was given a programmatic title, which related to recent national events:\n\n1923: The First Party Congress took place in Munich on January 27, 1923.\n1923: The \"German day rally\" was held in Nuremberg, September 1\u20132, 1923.\n1926: The 2nd Party Congress (\"Refounding Congress\") was held in Weimar, July 3\u20134, 1926.\n1927: The 3rd Party Congress (\"Day of Awakening\") was held in Nuremberg, August 19\u201321, 1927. The propaganda film Eine Symphonie des Kampfwillens was made at this rally.\n1929: The 4th Party Congress, known as the \"Day of Composure\", was held in Nuremberg, August 1\u20134, 1929. The propaganda film Der N\u00fcrnberger Parteitag der NSDAP was made at this rally.\n1933: The 5th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, August 30 \u2013 September 3, 1933. It was called the \"Rally of Victory\" (Reichsparteitag des Sieges). The term \"victory\" relates to the Nazi seizure of power and the victory over the Weimar Republic. The Leni Riefenstahl film Der Sieg des Glaubens was made at this rally. Hitler announced that from then on all Rallies would take place in Nuremberg.\n1934: The 6th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, September 5\u201310, 1934, which was attended by about 700,000 Nazi Party supporters. Initially it did not have a theme. Later it was labeled the \"Rally of Unity and Strength\" (Reichsparteitag der Einheit und St\u00e4rke), \"Rally of Power\" (Reichsparteitag der Macht), or \"Rally of Will\" (Reichsparteitag des Willens). The Leni Riefenstahl film Triumph des Willens was made at this rally. This rally was particularly notable due to Albert Speer's Cathedral of light: 152 searchlights that cast vertical beams into the sky around the Zeppelin Field to symbolise the walls of a building.\n1935: The 7th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, September 10\u201316, 1935. It was called the \"Rally of Freedom\" (Reichsparteitag der Freiheit). \"Freedom\" referred to the reintroduction of compulsory military service and thus the German \"liberation\" from the Treaty of Versailles. Leni Riefenstahl made the film Tag der Freiheit: Unsere Wehrmacht (Day of Freedom: Our Armed Forces) at this rally, and the Nazis introduced the Nuremberg Laws.\n1936: The 8th Party Congress was known as the \"Rally of Honour\" (Reichsparteitag der Ehre, September 8\u201314). The remilitarization of the demilitarized Rhineland in March 1936 constituted the restoration of German honour in the eyes of many Germans. The film Festliches N\u00fcrnberg incorporated footage shot at this rally, as well as the rally of 1937.\n1937: The 9th Party Congress was called the \"Rally of Labour\" (Reichsparteitag der Arbeit, September 6\u201313). It celebrated the reduction of unemployment in Germany since the Nazi rise to power.\n1938: The 10th Party Congress was named the \"Rally of Greater Germany\" (Reichsparteitag Gro\u00dfdeutschland, September 5\u201312). This was due to the annexation of Austria to Germany that had taken place earlier in the year.\n1939: The 11th Party Congress, scheduled for September 2\u201311, was given the name \"Rally of Peace\" (Reichsparteitag des Friedens). It was meant to reiterate the German desire for peace, both to the German population and to other countries. It was cancelled at short notice, as one day before the planned date, on September 1, Germany began its offensive against Poland (which ignited World War II) in Europe.\n\n\n== Propaganda films ==\nOfficial films for the rallies began in 1927, with the establishment of the NSDAP (Nazi Party) film office. The most famous films were made by Leni Riefenstahl for the rallies between 1933 and 1935. Relating to the theme of the rally, she called her first movie Victory of Faith (Der Sieg des Glaubens). This movie was taken out of circulation after the Night of the Long Knives, although a copy survived in Britain and has recently been made available on the Internet Archive for public viewing. The rally of 1934 became the setting for the award-winning Triumph of the Will (Triumph des Willens). Several generals in the Wehrmacht protested over the minimal army presence in the film: Hitler apparently proposed modifying the film to placate the generals, but Riefenstahl refused his suggestion. She did agree to return to the 1935 rally and make a film exclusively about the Wehrmacht, which became Tag der Freiheit: Unsere Wehrmacht.\nThe rallies for 1936 and 1937 were covered in Festliches N\u00fcrnberg, which was shorter than the others, only 21 minutes.\n\n\n== Books ==\nThere were two sets of official or semi-official books covering the rallies. The \"red books\" were officially published by the NSDAP and contained the proceedings of the \"congress\" as well as full texts of every speech given in chronological order.\nThe \"blue books\" were published initially by Julius Streicher, the Gauleiter of Nuremberg, later by Hanns Kerrl, not by the party press. These were larger scale books that included the text of speeches and proceedings, as well as larger photographs.\nIn addition to these, collections of Heinrich Hoffman's photographs were published to commemorate each Party congress, as well as pamphlets of Hitler's speeches. Both series of books are much sought after by collectors.Hoffman created 100-image series on the 1936, 1937, and 1938 rallies in stereoscopic 3D through his Raumbild-Verlag outfit.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAdolf Hitler March of German Youth\nNazi propaganda\nRuins of the Reich\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA summary of the Nuremberg books from the World Future Fund\nThe Schedules for the Parteitags of 1934\u20131938",

        "wiki": "Nuremberg ( NEWR-\u0259m-burg; German: N\u00fcrnberg [\u02c8n\u028f\u0281nb\u025b\u0281k] (listen); Bavarian: Niamberg; East Franconian: N\u00e4rrnberch or N\u00e4mberch, locally N\u00e4rmberch) is the second-largest city of the German federal state of Bavaria after its capital Munich, and its 511,628 (2016) inhabitants make it the 14th largest city in Germany. On the Pegnitz River (from its confluence with the Rednitz in F\u00fcrth onwards: Regnitz, a tributary of the River Main) and the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal, it lies in the Bavarian administrative region of Middle Franconia, and is the largest city and the unofficial capital of Franconia. Nuremberg forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring cities of F\u00fcrth, Erlangen and Schwabach with a total population of 798,867 (2018), while the larger Nuremberg Metropolitan Region has approximately 3.6 million inhabitants. The city lies about 170 kilometres (110 mi) north of Munich. It is the largest city in the East Franconian dialect area (colloquially: \"Franconian\"; German: Fr\u00e4nkisch), Nuremberg was one of the host cities of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nThere are many institutions of higher education in the city, including the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg). With 39,780 students in 2017, it is Bavaria's third-largest and Germany's 11th-largest university, with campuses in Erlangen and Nuremberg and a university hospital in Erlangen (Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen). Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg Georg Simon Ohm and Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg are also located within the city. Nuremberg Airport (Flughafen N\u00fcrnberg \u201cAlbrecht D\u00fcrer\u201c) is the second-busiest airport in Bavaria after Munich Airport, and the tenth-busiest airport in Germany.\nStaatstheater N\u00fcrnberg is one of the five Bavarian state theatres, showing operas, operettas, musicals, and ballets (main venue: Nuremberg Opera House), plays (main venue: Schauspielhaus N\u00fcrnberg), as well as concerts (main venue: Meistersingerhalle). Its orchestra, Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg, is Bavaria's second-largest opera orchestra after the Bavarian State Opera's Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich. Nuremberg is the birthplace of Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Johann Pachelbel.\nNuremberg was the site of major Nazi rallies, and it provided the site for the Nuremberg trials, which held to account many major Nazi officials.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe first documentary mention of the city, in 1050, mentions Nuremberg as the location of an Imperial castle between the East Franks and the Bavarian March of the Nordgau. From 1050 to 1571 the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade-routes. King Conrad III (reigning as King of Germany from 1138 to 1152) established the Burgraviate of Nuremberg, with the first burgraves coming from the Austrian House of Raab. With the extinction of their male line around 1190, the last Raabs count's son-in-law, Frederick I from the House of Hohenzollern, inherited the burgraviate in 1192.\nFrom the late 12th century to the Interregnum (1254\u201373), however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Hohenstaufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor (German: Reichsschulthei\u00df) from 1173/74. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city.\n \nNuremberg is often referred to as the \"unofficial capital\" of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly because the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg played an important role in the administration of the empire. The increasing demands of the Imperial court and the increasing importance of the city attracted increased trade and commerce in Nuremberg. In 1219 Emperor Frederick II granted the Gro\u00dfen Freiheitsbrief ('Great Letter of Freedom'), including town rights, Imperial immediacy (Reichsfreiheit), the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy - almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves. Nuremberg soon became, with Augsburg, one of the two great trade-centers on the route from Italy to Northern Europe.\nIn 1298 the Jews of the town were falsely accused of having desecrated the host, and 698 of them were killed in one of the many Rintfleisch massacres. Behind the massacre of 1298 was also the desire to combine the northern and southern parts of the city, which were divided by the Pegnitz. The Jews of the German lands suffered many massacres during the plague pandemic of the mid-14th century.\nIn 1349 Nuremberg's Jews suffered a pogrom. They were burned at the stake or expelled, and a marketplace was built over the former Jewish quarter. The plague returned to the city in 1405, 1435, 1437, 1482, 1494, 1520 and 1534.\n\nThe largest growth of Nuremberg occurred in the 14th century. Charles IV's Golden Bull of 1356, naming Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet, made Nuremberg one of the three most important cities of the Empire. Charles was the patron of the Frauenkirche, built between 1352 and 1362 (the architect was likely Peter Parler), where the Imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg. The royal and Imperial connection grew stronger in 1423 when the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg granted the Imperial regalia to be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 1796, when the advance of French troops required their removal to Regensburg and thence to Vienna.In 1349 the members of the guilds unsuccessfully rebelled against the patricians in a Handwerkeraufstand ('Craftsmen's Uprising'), supported by merchants and some by councillors, leading to a ban on any self-organisation of the artisans in the city, abolishing the guilds that were customary elsewhere in Europe; the unions were then dissolved, and the oligarchs remained in power while Nuremberg was a free city (until the early-19th century). Charles IV conferred upon the city the right to conclude alliances independently, thereby placing it upon a politically equal footing with the princes of the Empire. Frequent fights took place with the burgraves - without, however, inflicting lasting damage upon the city. After fire destroyed the castle in 1420 during a feud between Frederick IV (from 1417 Margrave of Brandenburg) and the duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, the city purchased the ruins and the forest belonging to the castle (1427), resulting in the city's total sovereignty within its borders.\nThrough these and other acquisitions the city accumulated considerable territory. The Hussite Wars (1419-1434), a recurrence of the Black Death in 1437, and the First Margrave War (1449-1450) led to a severe fall in population in the mid-15th century. Siding with Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria-Munich, in the Landshut War of Succession of 1503-1505 led the city to gain substantial territory, resulting in lands of 25 sq mi (64.7 km2), making it one of the largest Imperial cities.During the Middle Ages, Nuremberg fostered a rich, varied, and influential literary culture.\n\n\n=== Early modern age ===\n\nThe cultural flowering of Nuremberg, in the 15th and 16th centuries, made it the centre of the German Renaissance. In 1525, Nuremberg accepted the Protestant Reformation, and in 1532, the Nuremberg Religious Peace was signed there, preventing war between Protestants and Catholics for 15 years. During the 1552 revolution against Charles V, Nuremberg tried to purchase its neutrality, but the city was attacked without a declaration of war and was forced into a disadvantageous peace. At the Peace of Augsburg, the possessions of the Protestants were confirmed by the Emperor, their religious privileges extended and their independence from the Bishop of Bamberg affirmed, while the 1520s' secularisation of the monasteries was also approved. Families like the Tucher, Imhoff or Haller run trading businesses across Europe, similar to the Fugger and Welser families from Augsburg, although on a slightly smaller scale. \n\nThe state of affairs in the early 16th century, increased trade routes elsewhere and the ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade. During the Thirty Years' War, frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and League soldiers, the financial costs of the war and the cessation of trade caused irreparable damage to the city and a near-halving of the population. In 1632, the city, occupied by the forces of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, was besieged by the army of Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein. The city declined after the war and recovered its importance only in the 19th century, when it grew as an industrial centre. Even after the Thirty Years' War, however, there was a late flowering of architecture and culture \u2013 secular Baroque architecture is exemplified in the layout of the civic gardens built outside the city walls, and in the Protestant city's rebuilding of St. Egidien church, destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century, considered a significant contribution to the baroque church architecture of Middle Franconia.After the Thirty Years' War, Nuremberg attempted to remain detached from external affairs, but contributions were demanded for the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War and restrictions of imports and exports deprived the city of many markets for its manufactures. The Bavarian elector, Charles Theodore, appropriated part of the land obtained by the city during the Landshut War of Succession, to which Bavaria had maintained its claim; Prussia also claimed part of the territory. Realising its weakness, the city asked to be incorporated into Prussia but Frederick William II refused, fearing to offend Austria, Russia and France. At the Imperial diet in 1803, the independence of Nuremberg was affirmed, but on the signing of the Confederation of the Rhine on 12 July 1806, it was agreed to hand the city over to Bavaria from 8 September, with Bavaria guaranteeing the amortisation of the city's 12.5 million guilder public debt.\n\n\n=== After the Napoleonic Wars ===\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the city's trade and commerce revived; the skill of its inhabitants together with its favourable situation soon made the city prosperous, particularly after its public debt had been acknowledged as a part of the Bavarian national debt. Having been incorporated into a Catholic country, the city was compelled to refrain from further discrimination against Catholics, who had been excluded from the rights of citizenship. Catholic services had been celebrated in the city by the priests of the Teutonic Order, often under great difficulties. After their possessions had been confiscated by the Bavarian government in 1806, they were given the Frauenkirche on the Market in 1809; in 1810 the first Catholic parish was established, which in 1818 numbered 1,010 souls.In 1817, the city was incorporated into the district of Rezatkreis (named for the river Franconian Rezat), which was renamed to Middle Franconia (German: Mittelfranken) on 1 January 1838. The first German railway, the Bavarian Ludwigsbahn, from Nuremberg to nearby F\u00fcrth, was opened in 1835. The establishment of railways and the incorporation of Bavaria into Zollverein (the 19th-century German Customs Union), commerce and industry opened the way to greater prosperity. In 1852, there were 53,638 inhabitants: 46,441 Protestants and 6,616 Catholics. It subsequently grew to become the more important industrial city of Southern Germany, one of the most prosperous towns of southern Germany, but after the Austro-Prussian War it was given to the Prussia as part of their telegraph stations they had to give up. In 1905, its population, including several incorporated suburbs, was 291,351: 86,943 Catholics, 196,913 Protestants, 3,738 Jews and 3,766 members of other creeds.\n\n\n=== Nazi era ===\n\nNuremberg held great significance during the Nazi Germany era. Because of the city's relevance to the Holy Roman Empire and its position in the centre of Germany, the Nazi Party chose the city to be the site of huge Nazi Party conventions \u2014 the Nuremberg rallies. The rallies were held in 1927, 1929 and annually from  1933 through 1938. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 the Nuremberg rallies became huge Nazi propaganda events, a centre of Nazi ideals. The 1934 rally was filmed by Leni Riefenstahl, and made into a propaganda film called Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will).\nAt the 1935 rally, Hitler specifically ordered the Reichstag to convene at Nuremberg to pass the Nuremberg Laws which revoked German citizenship for all Jews and other non-Aryans. A number of premises were constructed solely for these assemblies, some of which were not finished. Today many examples of Nazi architecture can still be seen in the city. The city was also the home of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher, the publisher of Der St\u00fcrmer.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Nuremberg was the headquarters of Wehrkreis (military district) XIII, and an important site for military production, including aircraft, submarines and tank engines. A subcamp of Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp was located here, and extensively used slave labour. The city was severely damaged in Allied strategic bombing from 1943 to 1945. On 29 March 1944, the RAF endured its heaviest losses in the bombing campaign of Germany. Out of more than 700 planes participating, 106 were shot down or crash-landed on the way home to their bases, and more than 700 men were missing, as many as 545 of them dead. More than 160 became prisoners of war.On 2 January 1945, the medieval city centre was systematically bombed by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Army Air Forces and about ninety percent of it was destroyed in only one hour, with 1,800 residents killed and roughly 100,000 displaced. In February 1945, additional attacks followed. In total, about 6,000 Nuremberg residents are estimated to have been killed in air raids.\nNuremberg was a heavily fortified city that was captured in a fierce battle lasting from 17 to 21 April 1945 by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, 42nd Infantry Division and 45th Infantry Division, which fought house-to-house and street-by-street against determined German resistance, causing further urban devastation to the already bombed and shelled buildings. Despite this intense degree of destruction, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent restored to its pre-war appearance, including the reconstruction of some of its medieval buildings. Much of this reconstructive work and conservation was done by the organisation 'Old Town Friends Nuremberg'. However, over half of the historic look of the center, and especially the northeastern half of the old Imperial Free City was not restored.\n\n\n=== Nuremberg trials ===\n\nBetween 1945 and 1946, German officials involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity were brought before an international tribunal in the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union had wanted these trials to take place in Berlin. However, Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trials for specific reasons:\n\nThe city had been the location of the Nazi Party's Nuremberg rallies and the laws stripping Jews of their citizenship were passed there. There was symbolic value in making it the place of Nazi demise.\nThe Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few that had remained largely intact despite extensive Allied bombing of Germany). The already large courtroom was reasonably easily expanded by the removal of the wall at the end opposite the bench, thereby incorporating the adjoining room. A large prison was also part of the complex.\nAs a compromise, it was agreed that Berlin would become the permanent seat of the International Military Tribunal and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg. Due to the Cold War, subsequent trials never took place.Following the trials, in October 1946, several prominent German Nazi politicians and military leaders were executed in Nuremberg.\nThe same courtroom in Nuremberg was the venue of the Nuremberg Military Tribunals, organized by the United States as occupying power in the area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSeveral old villages now belong to the city, for example Grossgr\u00fcndlach, Kraftshof, Thon, and Neunhof in the north-west; Ziegelstein in the northeast, Altenfurt and Fischbach in the south-east; and Katzwang, Kornburg in the south. Langwasser is a modern suburb.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNuremberg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) with a certain humid continental influence (Dfb), categorized in the latter by the 0 \u00b0C isotherm. The city's climate is influenced by its inland position and higher altitude. Winters are changeable, with either mild or cold weather: the average temperature is around \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) to 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F), while summers are generally warm, mostly around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the afternoon. Precipitation is evenly spread throughout the year, although February and April tend to be a bit drier whereas July tends to have more rainfall.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNuremberg has been a destination for immigrants. 39.5% of the residents had an immigrant background in 2010 (counted with MigraPro).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nNuremberg for many people is still associated with its traditional gingerbread (Lebkuchen) products, sausages, and handmade toys. Pocket watches \u2014 Nuremberg eggs \u2014 were made here in the 16th century by Peter Henlein. Only one of the districts in the 1797-1801 sample was early industrial; the economic structure of the region around Nuremberg was dominated by metal and glass manufacturing, reflected by a share of nearly 50% handicrafts and workers. In the 19th century Nuremberg became the \"industrial heart\" of Bavaria with companies such as Siemens and MAN establishing a strong base in the city.  Nuremberg is still an important industrial centre with a strong standing in the markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Items manufactured in the area include electrical equipment, mechanical and optical products, motor vehicles, writing and drawing paraphernalia, stationery products and printed materials.\nThe city is also strong in the fields of automation, energy and medical technology. Siemens is still the largest industrial employer in the Nuremberg region but a good third of German market research agencies are also located in the city. The Nuremberg International Toy Fair is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nNuremberg is Bavaria\u2019s second largest city after Munich, and a popular tourist destination for foreigners and Germans alike. It was a leading city 500 years ago, but 90% of the town was destroyed in 1945 during the war. After World War II, many medieval-style areas of the town were rebuilt.\n\n\n===== Attractions =====\nBeyond its main attractions of the Imperial Castle, St. Lorenz Church, and Nazi Trial grounds, there are 54 different museums for arts and culture, history, science and technology, family and children, and more niche categories, where visitors can see the world's oldest globe (built in 1492), a 500-year-old Madonna, and Renaissance-era German art. There are several types of tours offered in the city, including historic tours, those that are Nazi-focused, underground and night tours, walking tours, sightseeing buses, self guided tours, and an old town tour on a mini train. Nuremberg also offers several parks and green areas, as well as indoor activities such as bowling, rock wall climbing, escape rooms, cart racing, and mini golf, theaters and cinemas, pools and thermal spas. There are also six nearby amusement parks. The city's tourism board sells the Nurnberg Card which allows for free use of public transportation and free entry to all museums and attractions in Nuremberg for a two-day period.\n\n\n===== Culinary Tourism =====\nNuremberg is also a destination for food lovers.

Around 1515 D\u00fcrer also published the \"Stabiussche Weltkarte\", the first perspective drawing of the terrestrial globe.Printers and publishers have a long history in Nuremberg. Many of these publishers worked with well-known artists of the day to produce books that could also be considered works of art. In 1470 Anton Koberger opened Europe's first print shop in Nuremberg. In 1493, he published the Nuremberg Chronicles, also known as the World Chronicles (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated history of the world from the creation to the present day. It was written in the local Franconian dialect by Hartmann Schedel and had illustrations by Michael Wohlgemuth, Wilhelm Pleydenwurff, and Albrecht D\u00fcrer.

          "We came here as the 3rd Christmas market of many. The lights and festive feeling in the area is beautiful. It's not the best market of all of them that we went to, but it's centrally located from the train station and worth a few hours. We had their famous sausage sandwich",
          "The Nuremberg Christmas market is the number 1 market to attend in Germany. 4 of us went last November and we were not disappointed. There were Gluwein stalls and a few Christmas craft / gift stalls open in the days leading up to the official opening of the market which was",

          "We get it - this is probably the most famous Christmas market in all of Germany, and people are going to come from all over the world in large numbers to visit it (us included). So it wasn't the crowds so much that left us disappointed, but rather the surprisingly limited",
          "This was an onshore excursion off the Danube River from our Viking River cruise. In addition to the variety of street vendors, Christmas shopping, there are many, many department stores within walking distance of this open square. My wife picked up s few pairs of branded German",

          "I loved the Christmas markets at Nuremberg. They were traditional, the food stalls were delicious and the atmosphere was lovely. Don't leave without trying Nuremberg sausage with sauerkraut (Drei Im Weggla), blueberry gluhwein, lebkuchen and a schokokuss! All were simply",
          "Glad we stayed two nights prior in Budapest to enjoy the sights and markets there. First Viking cruise and I can see why others rave about it. However it was labeled Romantic had I been with my significant other ( I was with gal pals) would have been looking for twosome tables",

          "This is a busy market from 11am onwards but it really picks up after 4pm. Worth calculating if crowds are an issue for you because it is hard to move even outside of peak hours. Everybody makes a big deal about the sausage which is nothing special. If you've had it once, you've",
          "I can't understand what kind of Christmas is this when the Christmas market is closed at 24 of December at 14:00. I heard so much about the Christams in Nuremberg but I am totally disappointed. Was way better in Heidelberg.",

          "This December was my third visit to Nuremberg, and my second visit to the Christmas Market. It\u2019s always a treat for me. The throngs of people make it that way. It\u2019s just a joy to saunter among the stalls....take in the sights and sounds and yes, those Bratwurst! While I enjoy",
          "Very charming market in the main square of the city where I was able to get some Christmas gifts for family members and try out some yummy German cuisine like appel strudel and this one pastry stuffed with cranberries! It's worth a walk through.",

          "I an a ' Bah Humbug'. I have to say this was fabulous. Very traditional, no kitch.Very safe and plenty of room to move around between stalls and the whole market. Lots of great food products and if you want a treasure for the Christmas tree, it is there.",
          "Truly amazing experience. It opens at 10:00 am and goes into the night. Not as busy before 1:00 pm. Be sure to visit the children\u2019s area and the stalls off to the sides and those on the walk to the train station. Wonderful gifts and fantastic food. Lots of gingerbread.",

          "Do not go for the opening ceremony or on a weekend unless you enjoy wall to wall, shoulder to shoulder crowds. It is waaaaay too packed and they smoke in your face. I will never do this again. Do yourself a favor and go at midday or on a weekday or watch it on tv. We couldn't",
          "We have been meaning to visit a European Christmas market for some time after happening upon the Christmas markets in Manchester, England, a couple of years ago. We decided to try Nuremberg as its listed as one of the largest and oldest markets around. Me and the husband",
          "We expected it to be busy and sure enough, there are thousands of people but not as unpleasant as we have experienced in other places. The aisles between the stalls are wider than in other markets we have been to in Europe. The wares are very similar to elsewhere. We were lead",
          "Hundreds of vendor booths! And thousands of people, dogs, baby carriages! I'll put it in the same category as Oktoberfest; it's one of those things everyone living in Germany should do once, and then opt for the more relaxing smaller town Christmas Markets that have room to",
          "Nuremberg Christmas Market is billed as the biggest and it is true there are so many vendors but it can be overwhelming when the crowds are out on the weekend. Found the pace to be much better early in the morning compared to late night when it can become a bit festive.",
          "I have lived in Germany off and on for over a decade, and I finally managed to find my way to the Nuremberg Christmas Market. I have visited Nuremberg before during the summer and had a fantastic time, so I believed the hype about the Christmas Market and went prepared to be",
          "When you want to visit this famous Christmas market , avoid the weekends if possible. Take a cup of mulled wine and just enjoy the surrounding. There are many stalls where you can buy some nice Christmas decorations, even things made by hand from Germany. For food you can",

          "It is still magic, although more and more commercial, and it keeps its charm. You should just take some time to stroll around, biting some franconian sausage and drinking gluhwein. Then at midday the magic will increase: from all around town the churches bells will start playing",
          "This is the one for your bucket list. Laid out in the town center Christmas Market in Nuremberg brings all the treats, food, sights and sounds into one fantastic presentation. If for nothing else the gingerbread and Nurnberger bratwurst is worth the trip. Great place to visit",

          "Out of all the Christmas Markets I went to this was my favourite. Something about the small cobbled street town adds to the cozy Christmas feel. I went to the opening ceremonies which heightened my Christmas spirit even though I don\u2019t speak German. However, the crowd was packed",

          "This is among the best-known Christmas markets in Germany, so it's a magnet for tourists. That means it's pretty much always extremely crowded to the extent that it can be difficult to actually see the booths. If you want to skip the huge crowds, I recommend going on a weekday.",
          "Heard great comments, and we had been to many Christmas markets in historic cities. It was very poor, ends afternoon Christmas Eve. Sausages, mulled wine with very little if any alcohol in, and little else, very boring. Friendly locals could not understand why anyone would",

          "This is one of Germany's more popular and famous Christmas markets, but it's also a little disappointing. No doubt it's huge, with tons of stands and thousands of people, but as a result it also doesn't have much of its own personality. Yes, there's lots of things to buy which",
          "Had a lovely time at the Christmas market, but once you get beyond the gluhwein and the sausages, all the stalls seem to be selling the same things (ornaments, smokers, nutcrackers, gingerbread and one or two other things). I thought there would be more handcrafted merchandise",

          "What a wonderful and magical experience to visit Nuremberg during the opening ceremony of Nurnberger Christkindlesmarkt on Nov. 25, 2016. To see The Golden Rausch Angel followed by music and songs. Afterwards, you get to have some Gluhwein, Sausage sandwiches and Potato",
          "Rode by rail to travel from Munich to Nuremberg for the Christmas Market. Easy day trip. Billed as the largest, it certainly lives up to its reputation. Variety? No. Lots of the same? Yes. Throngs and throngs of people. Reminds me of a carnival atmosphere. Shoulder to shoulder",
          "The market was exactly how I imagined it would be: The air was scented with frying Christmas goodies, there were a good many locally made crafts, and a dose of Bavarian atmosphere -- with lots of twinkling lights -- made the experience amazing!",
          "If this is your 1st Christmas market then maybe you'll be impressed by it. The location is pretty and they have a separate area for the 'kids market' which was super cute. Food wise, very small selection, 99% of the stalls were just bratwurst. I was there on a Wednesday and it",
          "This is one of the larger Christmas markets in Germany, but isn't overwhelming. Lebkuchen (gingerbread) is a Nuremburg specialty and this is one of the best markets to get different varieties and cute tins for the cookies. It's crowded on the weekends and in the evenings but",

          "Really good markets, and not as repetitive as many other christmas markets. Lots of local goods, crafts and foods on sale. It does get VERY busy though, especially in the evenings and at the weekends. We went on Friday morning, and then again Saturday evening, and it was like 2",
          "We spend a day strolling, eating and drinking on this Christmas market. We were lucky because, although it was cold, it was a very sunny day. So that was a bonus. We also purchased some nice Christmas decorations whilst we were at it!! We had a ball of a time, was an amazing",

          "The best and the biggest! So many wonderful craftsmen are here, with intricate and unusual Christmas decorations, hand-made toys, delicious sausages, gluhwein, and lebkuchen, etc. It is by far the best Christmas market we visited in a 7-day cruise on the Danube, highlighting",
          "This is a beautiful Old Town (although it's been rebuilt since being destroyed in WWII). The fountain and old cathedral are spectacular. And the market has hundreds of stalls with every kind of German craft. We are on a tour which happened to come here Saturday December 3. It",
          "This was the last of seven markets we visited in Southwest Germany. The big distinction I\u2019d make for this one verses the others, besides its lovely location adjacent to the church, is that it had more items available for purchase than any others we visited. Most of the others",

          "What a memorable experience at the Nuremberg Christmas Market. We visited on the first weekend, and it was wall to wall people, but still a wonderful experience. The sights, and smells, and sounds get you in the holiday spirit. I thought prices were very reasonable. Go hungry,",
          "Nuremberg is famous for their Christmas markets, it's one of the most popular tourist locations in December. We had the loveliest time in Nuremberg site-seeing the little village, exploring the Christmas markets and drinking dozens of mulled wine. We also did a little road trip",
          "The Christmas market in Nurnberg is one of the popular ones, so get ready for crowds. But don't be afraid - nothing can spoil the magical Christmas atmosphere. Just enjoy yummy specialties and hot wine and soak up the festive mood surrounded by the Old Town.",
          "We were fortunate to have one day on our 2 wk. cruise to spend in Nuremberg, Germany. It was the most charming town center that we saw on the whole trip. The Hauptmarket is the large area in the center of Nuremburg. Fortunately, there was a market going on while we were there,",
          "Europe's best and biggest Christmas market located in the Altstadt Platz in an awesome medieval city just two hours from the uninspiring Frankfurt. Shoppe, eat and drink to your hearts content...hand made toys and ornaments, wurst, bier, pretzels and gl\u00fcwein. A fantadtic time",

          "I love Christmas! So when my partner surprised me with a visit here I was over the moon. It was very surprising at how many people were squeezed into the area. It can be very hard to move around and just for safety reasons I would make sure you don't take bags that are easily",
          "Even though we were here in September, it was great to see and experience. We did buy a couple of items as mementos of our visit. Would be fun to visit during the Christmas season sometime, but at least we know where it is and can say, \"we've visited.\" Glad we were here.",
          "...and that is not a bad thing. It has all the local christmassy stuff, that you would expect, and in very charming surroundings. Well worth a visit. Try the little sausages.",

          "We visited in late November, in the rain unfortunately, but thoroughly enjoyed the marker and surrounding old town. This market is located in the very large central square and takes up most of the area in 8 or 9 double sided rows of booths. To one end near the church is a",

          "Excellent Christmas Market, traveled it with a German, and learned what the Germans like and buy. The Flaming Cauldron of Yumminess, Mulled Wine on Fire!!!! Delicious. The surrounding churches (Dusk 3:30) in December are a sight to behold. Sleep late, enjoy a museum then head",
          "If you really love Christmas, the feel, smell and everything that goes with it this is the only Christmas market. We went to four different ones altogether and we started with Nuremberg and can only tell you spend it all here except maybe Rothenberg. Do look around and make sure",
          "This was our first European Christmas market, and the best. Set in the Nuremberg old town square, at night it was a sea of people enjoying the crafts, food and beverages on offer. Coming from a hot Australian December this was a unique and wonderful experience for our family.",
          "This was our third year in a row visiting the Christmas Market in Nuremberg. The first was just my wife and I and we loved it. I actually have memories of riding the Ferris Wheel and Carousel in the Kinderweihnacht when I was 7 years old. We enjoyed it so much we return the",

          "Well this is considered to be on of Germany's best market, not in vain. The old city , Sebald+ Lorenz, is a one big Christmas market....along the main street, near every church, in every square, and of course at the main market platz. You can find here delicacies which we didn't",
          "Over a period of a month, we visited a half dozen christmas markets in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and the Nuremberg markets stand out for their quality of goods and diversity of foods and crafts. Well worth a visit.",
          "I wouldn\u00b4t say is the best Christmas Market in Germany, but is really cool and worth the visit. The main problem is always too full, you can\u00b4t actually enjoy. But is very big, a lot of options of regional things and food. Typical german market. Very nice!",
          "We took the ICE train from Munich [where we were staying] and went to the Nuremberg Christmas Market for the day. Having been to Nuremberg before it is very simple from the Train station into the market (500m) under the bridge and you are in the center of bliss. My wife and I",
          "I have to say before going I have great expectation, but sorry that after visiting I think a night market in Taiwan may give me better impression. The market is large, almost has a 1000 little shops there. It has a big one, then another for kids, then another with shops from",
          "Nuremburg just offers an enchanting setting for a Christmas market in it's old town. The market is huge and there is much to see. We made the mistake of visiting it in the late afternoon on a Saturday in early December (I believe the 2nd Saturday of the month). We started at",
          "The Nuremberg Christmas Market was our last stop after having done four other ones in not only Germany but France and Switzerland as well. This is by far one of the best Markets not only because of its size but also because it is more of a traditional market focusing on handmade",
          "This was something big I've had on my bucket list. We are so HAPPY that we went to Nuremberg for the Christmas Market this year. We visited several of them throughout Germany's lower Rhine region beginning in Nuremberg. The lights, the singing, the shops, and booths, the food,",
          "Despite its low ranking here on Trip advisor, this really is one of the top attractions in the city. Obviously only a seasonal event but a must see if you are in Bavaria in December. Unfortunately the weather has been unseasonably warm this Christmas so it takes away some of the",
          "We visited this market two different days. Wonderful wide range of crafts (be sure to verify goods are made in Germany and not imported from China). Had delicious brats and tasty mulled wine. (Lots of different kinds of mulled wines, so sample several.) Vendors do not take",
          "I wanted to tell you about the chistkindl markt in town but it is not on the selection. The famos Christmas market with little booths selling everything from mulled wine to wood handcrafts is amazng. It is worth a days trip to see and to shop for something out of the ordinary.",
          "In December the ordinary market in Nuremberg, becomes the Christkindlesmarkt, with a multitude of lights, market stalls for Christmas decorations, and food and gluhwein from here to eternity. If you get a chance to visit at this time of year, not to be missed.",
          "We came to Nuremberg mostly to see the Christkindlemarket, which starts in late November for Advent, and runs until Christmas Eve. This is terrific! The market place is row after row, with the small Christmas Market stalls, numbering around 180, selling everything from",
          "A visit here during the Christmas Market is an adventure. It is packed with visitors (estimated to be more than 2 million visitors annually) and filled with the spirit of the season. The market square can become so clogged with people that movement of any kind is difficult. So,",
          "I've listed my review under Hauptmarket since there doesn't seem to be a specific review for Nurnbergs Spectacular Christmas market.... I just departed Bamberg where I enjoyed the charm of the city and the very lively cafe life that exists...but their Christmasmarket fell far",
          "The Hauptmarkt provides a very picturesque setting for the town's Christkindlesmarkt in December. They were busy setting up for the opening in a few days, so the square was very crowded. Saw the Schoner Brumen (Beautiful Fountain) which is surrounded by a grille with a \"famous\""

On the Pegnitz River (from its confluence with the Rednitz in F\u00fcrth onwards: Regnitz, a tributary of the River Main) and the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal, it lies in the Bavarian administrative region of Middle Franconia, and is the largest city and the unofficial capital of Franconia. Nuremberg forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring cities of F\u00fcrth, Erlangen and Schwabach with a total population of 798,867 (2018), while the larger Nuremberg Metropolitan Region has approximately 3.6 million inhabitants. The city lies about 170 kilometres (110 mi) north of Munich. It is the largest city in the East Franconian dialect area (colloquially: \"Franconian\"; German: Fr\u00e4nkisch), Nuremberg was one of the host cities of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nThere are many institutions of higher education in the city, including the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg). With 39,780 students in 2017, it is Bavaria's third-largest and Germany's 11th-largest university, with campuses in Erlangen and Nuremberg and a university hospital in Erlangen (Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen). Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg Georg Simon Ohm and Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg are also located within the city. Nuremberg Airport (Flughafen N\u00fcrnberg \u201cAlbrecht D\u00fcrer\u201c) is the second-busiest airport in Bavaria after Munich Airport, and the tenth-busiest airport in Germany.\nStaatstheater N\u00fcrnberg is one of the five Bavarian state theatres, showing operas, operettas, musicals, and ballets (main venue: Nuremberg Opera House), plays (main venue: Schauspielhaus N\u00fcrnberg), as well as concerts (main venue: Meistersingerhalle). Its orchestra, Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg, is Bavaria's second-largest opera orchestra after the Bavarian State Opera's Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich. Nuremberg is the birthplace of Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Johann Pachelbel.\nNuremberg was the site of major Nazi rallies, and it provided the site for the Nuremberg trials, which held to account many major Nazi officials.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe first documentary mention of the city, in 1050, mentions Nuremberg as the location of an Imperial castle between the East Franks and the Bavarian March of the Nordgau. From 1050 to 1571 the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade-routes. King Conrad III (reigning as King of Germany from 1138 to 1152) established the Burgraviate of Nuremberg, with the first burgraves coming from the Austrian House of Raab. With the extinction of their male line around 1190, the last Raabs count's son-in-law, Frederick I from the House of Hohenzollern, inherited the burgraviate in 1192.\nFrom the late 12th century to the Interregnum (1254\u201373), however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Hohenstaufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor (German: Reichsschulthei\u00df) from 1173/74. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city.\n \nNuremberg is often referred to as the \"unofficial capital\" of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly because the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg played an important role in the administration of the empire. The increasing demands of the Imperial court and the increasing importance of the city attracted increased trade and commerce in Nuremberg. In 1219 Emperor Frederick II granted the Gro\u00dfen Freiheitsbrief ('Great Letter of Freedom'), including town rights, Imperial immediacy (Reichsfreiheit), the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy - almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves. Nuremberg soon became, with Augsburg, one of the two great trade-centers on the route from Italy to Northern Europe.\nIn 1298 the Jews of the town were falsely accused of having desecrated the host, and 698 of them were killed in one of the many Rintfleisch massacres. Behind the massacre of 1298 was also the desire to combine the northern and southern parts of the city, which were divided by the Pegnitz. The Jews of the German lands suffered many massacres during the plague pandemic of the mid-14th century.\nIn 1349 Nuremberg's Jews suffered a pogrom. They were burned at the stake or expelled, and a marketplace was built over the former Jewish quarter. The plague returned to the city in 1405, 1435, 1437, 1482, 1494, 1520 and 1534.\n\nThe largest growth of Nuremberg occurred in the 14th century. Charles IV's Golden Bull of 1356, naming Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet, made Nuremberg one of the three most important cities of the Empire. Charles was the patron of the Frauenkirche, built between 1352 and 1362 (the architect was likely Peter Parler), where the Imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg. The royal and Imperial connection grew stronger in 1423 when the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg granted the Imperial regalia to be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 1796, when the advance of French troops required their removal to Regensburg and thence to Vienna.In 1349 the members of the guilds unsuccessfully rebelled against the patricians in a Handwerkeraufstand ('Craftsmen's Uprising'), supported by merchants and some by councillors, leading to a ban on any self-organisation of the artisans in the city, abolishing the guilds that were customary elsewhere in Europe; the unions were then dissolved, and the oligarchs remained in power while Nuremberg was a free city (until the early-19th century). Charles IV conferred upon the city the right to conclude alliances independently, thereby placing it upon a politically equal footing with the princes of the Empire. Frequent fights took place with the burgraves - without, however, inflicting lasting damage upon the city. After fire destroyed the castle in 1420 during a feud between Frederick IV (from 1417 Margrave of Brandenburg) and the duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, the city purchased the ruins and the forest belonging to the castle (1427), resulting in the city's total sovereignty within its borders.\nThrough these and other acquisitions the city accumulated considerable territory. The Hussite Wars (1419-1434), a recurrence of the Black Death in 1437, and the First Margrave War (1449-1450) led to a severe fall in population in the mid-15th century. Siding with Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria-Munich, in the Landshut War of Succession of 1503-1505 led the city to gain substantial territory, resulting in lands of 25 sq mi (64.7 km2), making it one of the largest Imperial cities.During the Middle Ages, Nuremberg fostered a rich, varied, and influential literary culture.\n\n\n=== Early modern age ===\n\nThe cultural flowering of Nuremberg, in the 15th and 16th centuries, made it the centre of the German Renaissance. In 1525, Nuremberg accepted the Protestant Reformation, and in 1532, the Nuremberg Religious Peace was signed there, preventing war between Protestants and Catholics for 15 years. During the 1552 revolution against Charles V, Nuremberg tried to purchase its neutrality, but the city was attacked without a declaration of war and was forced into a disadvantageous peace. At the Peace of Augsburg, the possessions of the Protestants were confirmed by the Emperor, their religious privileges extended and their independence from the Bishop of Bamberg affirmed, while the 1520s' secularisation of the monasteries was also approved. Families like the Tucher, Imhoff or Haller run trading businesses across Europe, similar to the Fugger and Welser families from Augsburg, although on a slightly smaller scale. \n\nThe state of affairs in the early 16th century, increased trade routes elsewhere and the ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade. During the Thirty Years' War, frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and League soldiers, the financial costs of the war and the cessation of trade caused irreparable damage to the city and a near-halving of the population. In 1632, the city, occupied by the forces of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, was besieged by the army of Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein. The city declined after the war and recovered its importance only in the 19th century, when it grew as an industrial centre. Even after the Thirty Years' War, however, there was a late flowering of architecture and culture \u2013 secular Baroque architecture is exemplified in the layout of the civic gardens built outside the city walls, and in the Protestant city's rebuilding of St. Egidien church, destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century, considered a significant contribution to the baroque church architecture of Middle Franconia.After the Thirty Years' War, Nuremberg attempted to remain detached from external affairs, but contributions were demanded for the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War and restrictions of imports and exports deprived the city of many markets for its manufactures. The Bavarian elector, Charles Theodore, appropriated part of the land obtained by the city during the Landshut War of Succession, to which Bavaria had maintained its claim; Prussia also claimed part of the territory. Realising its weakness, the city asked to be incorporated into Prussia but Frederick William II refused, fearing to offend Austria, Russia and France. At the Imperial diet in 1803, the independence of Nuremberg was affirmed, but on the signing of the Confederation of the Rhine on 12 July 1806, it was agreed to hand the city over to Bavaria from 8 September, with Bavaria guaranteeing the amortisation of the city's 12.5 million guilder public debt.\n\n\n=== After the Napoleonic Wars ===\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the city's trade and commerce revived; the skill of its inhabitants together with its favourable situation soon made the city prosperous, particularly after its public debt had been acknowledged as a part of the Bavarian national debt. Having been incorporated into a Catholic country, the city was compelled to refrain from further discrimination against Catholics, who had been excluded from the rights of citizenship. Catholic services had been celebrated in the city by the priests of the Teutonic Order, often under great difficulties. After their possessions had been confiscated by the Bavarian government in 1806, they were given the Frauenkirche on the Market in 1809; in 1810 the first Catholic parish was established, which in 1818 numbered 1,010 souls.In 1817, the city was incorporated into the district of Rezatkreis (named for the river Franconian Rezat), which was renamed to Middle Franconia (German: Mittelfranken) on 1 January 1838. The first German railway, the Bavarian Ludwigsbahn, from Nuremberg to nearby F\u00fcrth, was opened in 1835. The establishment of railways and the incorporation of Bavaria into Zollverein (the 19th-century German Customs Union), commerce and industry opened the way to greater prosperity. In 1852, there were 53,638 inhabitants: 46,441 Protestants and 6,616 Catholics. It subsequently grew to become the more important industrial city of Southern Germany, one of the most prosperous towns of southern Germany, but after the Austro-Prussian War it was given to the Prussia as part of their telegraph stations they had to give up. In 1905, its population, including several incorporated suburbs, was 291,351: 86,943 Catholics, 196,913 Protestants, 3,738 Jews and 3,766 members of other creeds.\n\n\n=== Nazi era ===\n\nNuremberg held great significance during the Nazi Germany era. Because of the city's relevance to the Holy Roman Empire and its position in the centre of Germany, the Nazi Party chose the city to be the site of huge Nazi Party conventions \u2014 the Nuremberg rallies. The rallies were held in 1927, 1929 and annually from  1933 through 1938. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 the Nuremberg rallies became huge Nazi propaganda events, a centre of Nazi ideals. The 1934 rally was filmed by Leni Riefenstahl, and made into a propaganda film called Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will).\nAt the 1935 rally, Hitler specifically ordered the Reichstag to convene at Nuremberg to pass the Nuremberg Laws which revoked German citizenship for all Jews and other non-Aryans. A number of premises were constructed solely for these assemblies, some of which were not finished. Today many examples of Nazi architecture can still be seen in the city. The city was also the home of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher, the publisher of Der St\u00fcrmer.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Nuremberg was the headquarters of Wehrkreis (military district) XIII, and an important site for military production, including aircraft, submarines and tank engines. A subcamp of Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp was located here, and extensively used slave labour. The city was severely damaged in Allied strategic bombing from 1943 to 1945. On 29 March 1944, the RAF endured its heaviest losses in the bombing campaign of Germany. Out of more than 700 planes participating, 106 were shot down or crash-landed on the way home to their bases, and more than 700 men were missing, as many as 545 of them dead. More than 160 became prisoners of war.On 2 January 1945, the medieval city centre was systematically bombed by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Army Air Forces and about ninety percent of it was destroyed in only one hour, with 1,800 residents killed and roughly 100,000 displaced. In February 1945, additional attacks followed. In total, about 6,000 Nuremberg residents are estimated to have been killed in air raids.\nNuremberg was a heavily fortified city that was captured in a fierce battle lasting from 17 to 21 April 1945 by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, 42nd Infantry Division and 45th Infantry Division, which fought house-to-house and street-by-street against determined German resistance, causing further urban devastation to the already bombed and shelled buildings. Despite this intense degree of destruction, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent restored to its pre-war appearance, including the reconstruction of some of its medieval buildings. Much of this reconstructive work and conservation was done by the organisation 'Old Town Friends Nuremberg'. However, over half of the historic look of the center, and especially the northeastern half of the old Imperial Free City was not restored.\n\n\n=== Nuremberg trials ===\n\nBetween 1945 and 1946, German officials involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity were brought before an international tribunal in the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union had wanted these trials to take place in Berlin. However, Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trials for specific reasons:\n\nThe city had been the location of the Nazi Party's Nuremberg rallies and the laws stripping Jews of their citizenship were passed there. There was symbolic value in making it the place of Nazi demise.\nThe Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few that had remained largely intact despite extensive Allied bombing of Germany). The already large courtroom was reasonably easily expanded by the removal of the wall at the end opposite the bench, thereby incorporating the adjoining room. A large prison was also part of the complex.\nAs a compromise, it was agreed that Berlin would become the permanent seat of the International Military Tribunal and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg. Due to the Cold War, subsequent trials never took place.Following the trials, in October 1946, several prominent German Nazi politicians and military leaders were executed in Nuremberg.\nThe same courtroom in Nuremberg was the venue of the Nuremberg Military Tribunals, organized by the United States as occupying power in the area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSeveral old villages now belong to the city, for example Grossgr\u00fcndlach, Kraftshof, Thon, and Neunhof in the north-west; Ziegelstein in the northeast, Altenfurt and Fischbach in the south-east; and Katzwang, Kornburg in the south. Langwasser is a modern suburb.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNuremberg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) with a certain humid continental influence (Dfb), categorized in the latter by the 0 \u00b0C isotherm. The city's climate is influenced by its inland position and higher altitude. Winters are changeable, with either mild or cold weather: the average temperature is around \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) to 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F), while summers are generally warm, mostly around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the afternoon. Precipitation is evenly spread throughout the year, although February and April tend to be a bit drier whereas July tends to have more rainfall.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNuremberg has been a destination for immigrants. 39.5% of the residents had an immigrant background in 2010 (counted with MigraPro).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nNuremberg for many people is still associated with its traditional gingerbread (Lebkuchen) products, sausages, and handmade toys. Pocket watches \u2014 Nuremberg eggs \u2014 were made here in the 16th century by Peter Henlein. Only one of the districts in the 1797-1801 sample was early industrial; the economic structure of the region around Nuremberg was dominated by metal and glass manufacturing, reflected by a share of nearly 50% handicrafts and workers. In the 19th century Nuremberg became the \"industrial heart\" of Bavaria with companies such as Siemens and MAN establishing a strong base in the city.  Nuremberg is still an important industrial centre with a strong standing in the markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Items manufactured in the area include electrical equipment, mechanical and optical products, motor vehicles, writing and drawing paraphernalia, stationery products and printed materials.\nThe city is also strong in the fields of automation, energy and medical technology. Siemens is still the largest industrial employer in the Nuremberg region but a good third of German market research agencies are also located in the city. The Nuremberg International Toy Fair is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nNuremberg is Bavaria\u2019s second largest city after Munich, and a popular tourist destination for foreigners and Germans alike. It was a leading city 500 years ago, but 90% of the town was destroyed in 1945 during the war. After World War II, many medieval-style areas of the town were rebuilt.\n\n\n===== Attractions =====\nBeyond its main attractions of the Imperial Castle, St. Lorenz Church, and Nazi Trial grounds, there are 54 different museums for arts and culture, history, science and technology, family and children, and more niche categories, where visitors can see the world's oldest globe (built in 1492), a 500-year-old Madonna, and Renaissance-era German art. There are several types of tours offered in the city, including historic tours, those that are Nazi-focused, underground and night tours, walking tours, sightseeing buses, self guided tours, and an old town tour on a mini train. Nuremberg also offers several parks and green areas, as well as indoor activities such as bowling, rock wall climbing, escape rooms, cart racing, and mini golf, theaters and cinemas, pools and thermal spas. There are also six nearby amusement parks. The city's tourism board sells the Nurnberg Card which allows for free use of public transportation and free entry to all museums and attractions in Nuremberg for a two-day period.\n\n\n===== Culinary Tourism =====\nNuremberg is also a destination for food lovers. Culinary tourists can taste the city's famous lebkuchen, gingerbread, local beer, and N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrstchen, or Nuremberg sausages. There are hundreds of restaurants for all tastes, including traditional franconian restaurants and beer gardens. Also offers 17 vegan and vegetarian restaurants, seven fully organic restaurants. Nuremberg also boasts a two Michelin Star rated restaurant, Essigbr\u00e4tlein.\n\n\n===== Pedestrian zones =====\nLike many European cities, Nuremberg offers a pedestrian-only zone covering a large portion of the old town, which is a main destination for shopping and specialty retail, including year-round Christmas stores where tourists and locals alike can purchase Christmas ornaments, gifts, decorations, and additions to their toy Christmas villages. The Craftsmen's Courtyard, or Handwerkerhof, is another tourist shopping destination in the style of a medieval village. It houses several local family-run businesses which sell handcrafted items from glass, wood, leather, pottery, and precious metals. The Handwerkerhof is also home to traditional German restaurants and beer gardens.The Pedestrian zones of Nuremberg host festivals and markets throughout the year, most well known being Christkindlesmarkt, Germany's largest Christmas market and the gingerbread capital of the world. Visitors to the Christmas market can peruse the hundreds of stalls and purchase local wood crafts, nutcrackers, smokers, and prune people, while sampling Christmas sweets and traditional gluhwein.\n\n\n===== Hospitality =====\nIn 2017, Nuremberg saw a total of 3.3 million overnight stays, a record for the town, and is expected to have surpassed that in 2018, with more growth in tourism anticipated in the coming years. There are over 175 registered places of accommodation in Nuremberg, ranging from hostels to luxury hotels, bed and breakfasts, to multi-hundred room properties. As of 19 April 2019, Nuremberg had 306 AirBnB listings.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nNuremberg was an early centre of humanism, science, printing, and mechanical invention. The city contributed much to the science of astronomy. In 1471 Johannes Mueller of K\u00f6nigsberg (Bavaria), later called Regiomontanus, built an astronomical observatory in Nuremberg and published many important astronomical charts.\nIn 1515, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, a native of Nuremberg, created woodcuts of the first maps of the stars of the northern and southern hemispheres, producing the first printed star charts, which had been ordered by Johannes Stabius. Around 1515 D\u00fcrer also published the \"Stabiussche Weltkarte\", the first perspective drawing of the terrestrial globe.Printers and publishers have a long history in Nuremberg. Many of these publishers worked with well-known artists of the day to produce books that could also be considered works of art. In 1470 Anton Koberger opened Europe's first print shop in Nuremberg. In 1493, he published the Nuremberg Chronicles, also known as the World Chronicles (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated history of the world from the creation to the present day. It was written in the local Franconian dialect by Hartmann Schedel and had illustrations by Michael Wohlgemuth, Wilhelm Pleydenwurff, and Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Others furthered geographical knowledge and travel by map making. Notable among these was navigator and geographer Martin Behaim, who made the first world globe.\nSculptors such as Veit Stoss, Adam Kraft and Peter Vischer are also associated with Nuremberg.\nComposed of prosperous artisans, the guilds of the Meistersingers flourished here. Richard Wagner made their most famous member, Hans Sachs, the hero of his opera Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel was born here and was organist of St. Sebaldus Church.\nThe academy of fine arts situated in Nuremberg is the oldest art academy in central Europe and looks back to a tradition of 350 years of artistic education.\nNuremberg is also famous for its Christkindlesmarkt (Christmas market), which draws well over a million shoppers each year.  The market is famous for its handmade ornaments and delicacies.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n \nGermanisches Nationalmuseum\nHouse of Albrecht D\u00fcrer\nKunsthalle N\u00fcrnberg\nKunstverein N\u00fcrnberg\nNeues Museum N\u00fcrnberg (Modern Art Museum)\nNuremberg Toy Museum\nNuremberg Transport Museum\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nThe Nuremberg State Theatre, founded in 1906, is dedicated to all types of opera, ballet and stage theatre.

The State Philharmonic Nuremberg (Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg) is the orchestra of the State Theatre. Its name was changed in 2011 from its previous name: The Nuremberg Philharmonic (N\u00fcrnberger Philharmoniker). It is the second-largest opera orchestra in Bavaria. Besides opera performances, it also presents its own subscription concert series in the Meistersingerhalle. Christof Perick was the principal conductor of the orchestra between 2006\u20132011. Marcus Bosch heads the orchestra since September 2011  .\nThe Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra (N\u00fcrnberger Symphoniker) performs around 100 concerts a year to a combined annual audience of more than 180,000. The regular subscription concert series are mostly performed in the Meistersingerhalle but other venues are used as well, including the new concert hall of the Kongresshalle and the Serenadenhof. Alexander Shelley has been the principal conductor of the orchestra since 2009.\nThe Nuremberg International Chamber Music Festival (Internationales Kammermusikfestival N\u00fcrnberg) takes place in early September each year, and in 2011 celebrated its tenth anniversary. Concerts take place around the city; opening and closing events are held in the medieval Burg.

In the centre of the city, on the bank of the river Pegnitz, stands the Hospital of the Holy Spirit. Founded in 1332, this is one of the largest hospitals of the Middle Ages. Lepers were kept here at some distance from the other patients. It now houses elderly persons and a restaurant.\nThe Hauptmarkt, dominated by the front of the unique Gothic Frauenkirche (Our Lady's Church), provides a picturesque setting for the famous Christmas market. A main attraction on the square is the Gothic Sch\u00f6ner Brunnen (Beautiful Fountain) which was erected around 1385 but subsequently replaced with a replica (the original fountain is kept in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum). The unchanged Renaissance bridge Fleischbr\u00fccke crosses the Pegnitz nearby.\nThe Gothic Lorenzkirche (St. Laurence church) dominates the southern part of the walled city and is one of the most important buildings in Nuremberg. The main body was built around 1270\u20131350.\nThe even earlier and equally impressive Sebalduskirche is St. Lorenz's counterpart in the northern part of the old city.\nThe church of the former Katharinenkloster is preserved as a ruin, the charterhouse (Kartause) is integrated into the building of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum and the choir of the former Franziskanerkirche is part of a modern building.\nOther churches located inside the city walls are: St. Laurence's, Saint Clare's, Saint Martha's, Saint James the Greater's, Saint Giles's, and Saint Elisabeth's.\nThe Germanisches Nationalmuseum is Germany's largest museum of cultural history, among its exhibits are works of famous painters such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Rembrandt, and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner.\nThe Neues Museum N\u00fcrnberg is a museum for modern and contemporary art.\nThe Walburga Chapel and the Romanesque Doppelkapelle (Chapel with two floors) are part of Nuremberg Castle.\nThe Johannisfriedhof is a medieval cemetery, containing many old graves (Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Willibald Pirckheimer, and others).

They won their first regional title in the Southern German championship in 1916 closely followed by their first national title in 1920. Besides the eleven regional championships they won they were the German championship for a total of seven times. With this they held the record for the most German championship titles until 1986 when the current record holder FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen surpassed them.  The current chairmen are Nils Rossow and Robert Palikuca. They play in Max-Morlock-Stadion which was refurbished for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and accommodates 50,000 spectators. \n\nGerman Champion: 1920, 1921, 1924, 1925, 1927, 1936, 1948, 1961, 1968\nGerman Cup: 1935, 1939, 1962, 2007TuS Bar Kochba is a league that was founded in 1913 as a social-sport club for the Jewish community in N\u00fcrnberg.

Since then, teams from Nuremberg have attempted to return to Germany's elite league. The recently founded N\u00fcrnberg Falcons BC have already established themselves as one of the main teams in Germany's second division ProA and aim to take on the heritage of the SELLBYTEL Baskets N\u00fcrnberg. The Falcons play their home games at the Halle im Berufsbildungszentrum (BBZ).\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nNuremberg is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Associated cities ===\nApart from the official twin towns (sister cities), there are a number with which Nuremberg maintains \"cordial relations\":\n\n\n=== Cooperation ===\nNuremberg also engages in cooperation with various other cities internationally:\n Bologna, Italy 2006\n Changping, China 2006\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nThe ArtsMichael Wolgemut (1434\u20131519) a German painter and printmaker \nHans Folz (ca.1437\u20131513) a German author and poet\nVeit Stoss (ca.1450\u20131533) a Renaissance German sculptor, mostly in wood \nPeter Vischer the Elder  (ca.1455\u20131529) a German sculptor \nAdam Kraft (ca.1460\u20131509) a German stone sculptor, master builder and architect \nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer (1471\u20131528) a painter, engraver, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance \nHans Leonhard Sch\u00e4ufelein (ca.1480\u20131540) an artist, painter and designer of woodcuts \nAugustin Hirschvogel (1503\u20131553) an artist, mathematician and cartographer\nMichael Sigismund Frank (1770\u20131847) a Catholic artist, rediscovered glass-painting \nLorenz Ritter (1832\u20131921) a German painter and etcher \nPhilipp Rupprecht (1900\u20131975) a German cartoonist of anti-Semitic caricatures\nHermann Kesten (1900-1996) novelist and dramatist\nEliyahu Koren (1907\u20142001) a master typographer, graphic artist and designer\nPeter Angermann (born 1945) a German painter \nChristoph Dreher (born 1952) a German filmmaker, musician and scriptwriter \nKaty Garretson (born 1963) an American TV director and producer \nMartina Schradi (born 1972) author, cartoonist and psychologistMusicConrad Paumann (ca.1410\u20131473) a German organist, lutenist and composer\nHans Sachs (1494\u20131576) a German Meistersinger, poet, playwright, and shoemaker \nSebald Heyden (1499\u20131561) a musicologist, cantor, theologian and hymn-writer\nJohann Pachelbel (1653\u20131706) a composer, organist, and teacher \nHugo Distler (1908\u20131942) a German organist, choral conductor, teacher and composer\nMartha M\u00f6dl (1912\u20132001) a German Wagner soprano/mezzo-soprano\nChaya Arbel (1921\u20132007) an Israeli female classical composer \nSiegfried Jerusalem (born 1940) a German operatic tenor\nKevin Coyne (1944\u20132004) an English musician, singer, composer, film-maker, and writer \nRudi Mahall (born 1966) a contemporary jazz bass clarinet playerActingMargarete Haagen (1889\u20131966) a German stage and film actress \nWolfgang Preiss (1910\u20132002) a German theatre, film and TV actor \nHeinz Bernard (1923\u20131994) a British actor and director and theatre manager \nAnnette Carell (1926\u20131967) an American actress of stage, screen, and television \nGeorge Clooney (born 1961) an American actor, director, producer and filmmaker \nSandra Bullock (born 1964) an American actress, producer, and philanthropist \nTom Beck (born 1978) a German actor, singer, and entrepreneur Science & BusinessAnton Koberger (ca.1440/1445\u20131513) a goldsmith, printer and publisher \nKaterina Lemmel (1466-1533) a patrician businesswoman and Birgittine nun\nPeter Henlein (1485-1542) locksmith and clockmaker, invented the world's first watch\nKunz Lochner (1510-1567), plate armourer, blacksmith and silversmith\nJoachim Camerarius the Younger (1534\u20131598) a physician, botanist and zoologist \nJohann Christoph Volkamer (1644\u20131720) a German merchant, manufacturer and botanist\nMaria Sybilla Merian (1647\u20131717) a naturalist and scientific illustrator\nJohann Philipp von Wurzelbauer (1651-1725), astronomer\nJohn Miller (1715\u2013ca.1792) a German engraver and botanist active in London \nJohann Kaspar Hechtel (1771\u20131799) a brass factory owner, non-fiction writer and designer of parlour games\nErnst von Bibra (1806\u20131878) a German scientist, naturalist and author\nFriedrich Sigmund Merkel (1845-1919) anatomist and histopathologist\nSiegfried Bettmann (1868-1951) bicycle, motorcycle and car manufacturer\nErnst Freiherr Stromer von Reichenbach (1871\u20131952) a paleontologist\nUlrich R\u00fcck (1882\u20131962 collector of musical instruments, chemist and dealer in pianos\nKarl Bechert (1901\u20131981) a theoretical physicist in atomic physics and politician\nPeter Owen (1927\u20132016) a British publisher, founded Peter Owen Publishers \nManfred M.

          "Loved the art work selections. The art is tastefully curated, beautifully and boldly displayed in an incredibly sophisticated contemporary art space. This museum is more discreet in what it shows and is not about volume but more about substance. Of course one has to like the",
          "Neues Museum is located near the main train station (5min walk). Entrance is free for children and/or with the Nurnberg Card. The Museum is opened every day except Monday. Building is very modern as the spirit of the museum focused on design and art, When I visited there was a",
          "The collection is very small and far from impressive. Some rooms looked nearly empty. It felt like a waste of 7\u20ac altogether.",
          "If you like contemporary art, this is the place. Extensive collection and intriquing soecial exhibits.",
          "OK the building is fab. The mian exbitiion we saw was on Japanese aesthetic. The exhibits were interesting but werehard to connect together and understand the significance of. Maybe an audio guide or a trail would help?",

          "12.13.17 This is located close to HauptBahnhof and the Grand Le Meridian Hotel where we stay a lot so we headed over. Some interesting things and some totally blah stuff. It is a 4/5 and worth it to walk around for exercise. Give it a try. the Doctor Hit me with some LOVE",
          "Contemporary art is what i deeply cherish. Everywhere I go I try not to miss the local museum of modern art. Neues Museum makes no difference. And it didn't disappoint me. I really loved the exhibitions, the building, everything. If you are a fan of modern art like me, make time",
          "Museum Can be interesting, but receptionist is very rude. We asked if Museum was in english language and She replied: \"we are in German, so is Just in german\" That's not true: Museum has english texts but not always -> that's ridicoulus for a National Museum! I don't speak",
          "I'm surprised that this art gallery ranks quite low on TA - I spent a very interesting couple of hours here. Modern art isn't everyone's cup of tea, but this gallery has a varied collection and you should find something you like. The architecture of the building itself is worth",
          "So after allowing myself a few days to get a perspective I still maintain this was one of the more excruciating museum trips I have been on. To get it into context my Kids and I were killing time before our evening flight. They are well behaved but enthusiastic five and ten",
          "The architecture of this museum is very interesting and worth seeing. I enjoyed the exhibits, but at the same time I found there was very little information about individual works or artists compared to other modern art museums I have visited. It also seemed fairly small, it",
          "This is a very cool but hard to find museum it is located only a few blocks from the HauptBahnhof and after walking over an hour to find it I will give the scoop. It is hidden behind buildings down a narrow alley. So the easy way is to start at train station walk directly",
          "This is for the serious modern art lovers. As with most modern art museums (except the MOMA in NYC which is cramped and crowded), the building itself is as interesting as the exhibits. The minimalist impact here in a white background is just stunning. In the courtyard as you",
          "....but I did not find it as interesting as I hoped. If contemporary art is your thing, definitely go. The building itself is cold and rather odd, to my eye. A nice gift shop, no restaurant. For my money, see the art (several locations) in the German National Museum. But if you",

          "Interesting architecture and (when I was there) very well put up exhibitions. DDR vs BDR show was great!",
          "This modern building is just besides the city wall, and has a striking architecture. However if you are not into late-20 century German art, you can just take a look to the entrance hall and skip the museum.",
          "Amazing building though the content of the exhibition is rather limited and not breathtaking at all. Cheap admission fee 6eur. Even if Kids behave very well, staff give immediately and multiple orders not to touch anything, speak loudly or run. So not childfriendly at all.",
          "A pompous, overblown building with a less than exciting collection. It was almost deserted on our visit, not surprising in my opinion. An amazing lack of signage, presumably it would sully the architecture.",

          "I enjoyed the structure itself, high ceilings, lots of glass, concrete, interesting angles and stairways. However, the beautiful building overshadowed the collection, which seemed very sparse. The special exhibition about faces and masks was interesting, but for me most of the",
          "In addition to the very contemporary displays of modern art (you really have to like contemporary conceptual art!), the building is simply amazing. It is also juxtaposed next to some 16th century buildings, and viewing the contrast is striking.",
          "This museum is a must have seen. there are always great exhibitions. Go there and see. A great place for photographers. the mirroring outside wall gives great pictures at the blue hour time.",
          "Though its full name includes the words Kunst (Art) and Design, there is not much of either. Like the Bilbao Guggenheim, this is all building, and hardly any art. It looks massive from the outside, but inside there are only a very few items on permanent display - a few examples",
          "I was given a free ticket into this from the hotel I was staying at in Nuremberg. I was glad I took the time to visit the Museum. It certainly challenges your views on art, but only in a good away. The building itself is an interesting structure, especially as it is within the",
          "Nice to have such museum but weak collection for a city as N\u00fcrnberg. I like more the bookshop then the gallery. Huge building for a little art. But need to see anyway for Gerhard Richter.",
          "This museum will not only fascinate you with its art but also with its architecture. There was quite some controversy when this ultra-modern building was incorporated into what is essentially Nuremberg's \"old town\", but the architecture and interior design have a way of drawing",
          "Eclectic and welcoming, this museum did impress. The building architecture is stunning. The works on display during our visit was unique and at times quite inspiring. The Sunday entrance of only 1 euro was very nice. The museum is small, so you can make it through in a",
          "Amazing modern art museum with stunning pieces, simply a must see. We were the only people there except the staff which seemed somewhat strange, but what can I say? it was fantastic, reminded me a little of the one in Barcelona.",
          "This is a small but impressive new museum and worth a visit, but on the whole, the collection is not as impressive as the architecture and the design department in particular is disappointing. There are a few highlights nonetheless (liked Ai Wei Wei's Tea Cube!!) and a good",
          "Ultra modern building nestled between 18th century buildings, and the contrast of buildings is (to me) part of the experience. And a tour of this museum DOES feel like an experience! Though the contemporary art was not my husband's favorite, he was just fascinated taking photos",
          "The Neues Museum bills itself as a museum of modern art and design \u2014 for some reason \"design\" appears in English \u2014 and having seen some great German and Austrian design museums, I was looking forward to this new museum, whose building is very impressive. Unfortunately, it has",
          "We like the entrance coming from a small square. NIce people at the reception. The interior is really interesting and unexpected. Exhibition maybe a bit unequal but for sure enough thrilling and interesting.",
          "Tucked away in the Old Town is this beautiful modern building with a wonderful collection of modern art. In addition to being a great museum, it also provides a nice counterpoint to the many historical attractions of Nurnberg. The museum also has a very nice gift shop."

On the Pegnitz River (from its confluence with the Rednitz in F\u00fcrth onwards: Regnitz, a tributary of the River Main) and the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal, it lies in the Bavarian administrative region of Middle Franconia, and is the largest city and the unofficial capital of Franconia. Nuremberg forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring cities of F\u00fcrth, Erlangen and Schwabach with a total population of 798,867 (2018), while the larger Nuremberg Metropolitan Region has approximately 3.6 million inhabitants. The city lies about 170 kilometres (110 mi) north of Munich. It is the largest city in the East Franconian dialect area (colloquially: \"Franconian\"; German: Fr\u00e4nkisch), Nuremberg was one of the host cities of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nThere are many institutions of higher education in the city, including the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg). With 39,780 students in 2017, it is Bavaria's third-largest and Germany's 11th-largest university, with campuses in Erlangen and Nuremberg and a university hospital in Erlangen (Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen). Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg Georg Simon Ohm and Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg are also located within the city. Nuremberg Airport (Flughafen N\u00fcrnberg \u201cAlbrecht D\u00fcrer\u201c) is the second-busiest airport in Bavaria after Munich Airport, and the tenth-busiest airport in Germany.\nStaatstheater N\u00fcrnberg is one of the five Bavarian state theatres, showing operas, operettas, musicals, and ballets (main venue: Nuremberg Opera House), plays (main venue: Schauspielhaus N\u00fcrnberg), as well as concerts (main venue: Meistersingerhalle). Its orchestra, Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg, is Bavaria's second-largest opera orchestra after the Bavarian State Opera's Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich. Nuremberg is the birthplace of Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Johann Pachelbel.\nNuremberg was the site of major Nazi rallies, and it provided the site for the Nuremberg trials, which held to account many major Nazi officials.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe first documentary mention of the city, in 1050, mentions Nuremberg as the location of an Imperial castle between the East Franks and the Bavarian March of the Nordgau. From 1050 to 1571 the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade-routes. King Conrad III (reigning as King of Germany from 1138 to 1152) established the Burgraviate of Nuremberg, with the first burgraves coming from the Austrian House of Raab. With the extinction of their male line around 1190, the last Raabs count's son-in-law, Frederick I from the House of Hohenzollern, inherited the burgraviate in 1192.\nFrom the late 12th century to the Interregnum (1254\u201373), however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Hohenstaufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor (German: Reichsschulthei\u00df) from 1173/74. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city.\n \nNuremberg is often referred to as the \"unofficial capital\" of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly because the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg played an important role in the administration of the empire. The increasing demands of the Imperial court and the increasing importance of the city attracted increased trade and commerce in Nuremberg. In 1219 Emperor Frederick II granted the Gro\u00dfen Freiheitsbrief ('Great Letter of Freedom'), including town rights, Imperial immediacy (Reichsfreiheit), the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy - almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves. Nuremberg soon became, with Augsburg, one of the two great trade-centers on the route from Italy to Northern Europe.\nIn 1298 the Jews of the town were falsely accused of having desecrated the host, and 698 of them were killed in one of the many Rintfleisch massacres. Behind the massacre of 1298 was also the desire to combine the northern and southern parts of the city, which were divided by the Pegnitz. The Jews of the German lands suffered many massacres during the plague pandemic of the mid-14th century.\nIn 1349 Nuremberg's Jews suffered a pogrom. They were burned at the stake or expelled, and a marketplace was built over the former Jewish quarter. The plague returned to the city in 1405, 1435, 1437, 1482, 1494, 1520 and 1534.\n\nThe largest growth of Nuremberg occurred in the 14th century. Charles IV's Golden Bull of 1356, naming Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet, made Nuremberg one of the three most important cities of the Empire. Charles was the patron of the Frauenkirche, built between 1352 and 1362 (the architect was likely Peter Parler), where the Imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg. The royal and Imperial connection grew stronger in 1423 when the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg granted the Imperial regalia to be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 1796, when the advance of French troops required their removal to Regensburg and thence to Vienna.In 1349 the members of the guilds unsuccessfully rebelled against the patricians in a Handwerkeraufstand ('Craftsmen's Uprising'), supported by merchants and some by councillors, leading to a ban on any self-organisation of the artisans in the city, abolishing the guilds that were customary elsewhere in Europe; the unions were then dissolved, and the oligarchs remained in power while Nuremberg was a free city (until the early-19th century). Charles IV conferred upon the city the right to conclude alliances independently, thereby placing it upon a politically equal footing with the princes of the Empire. Frequent fights took place with the burgraves - without, however, inflicting lasting damage upon the city. After fire destroyed the castle in 1420 during a feud between Frederick IV (from 1417 Margrave of Brandenburg) and the duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, the city purchased the ruins and the forest belonging to the castle (1427), resulting in the city's total sovereignty within its borders.\nThrough these and other acquisitions the city accumulated considerable territory. The Hussite Wars (1419-1434), a recurrence of the Black Death in 1437, and the First Margrave War (1449-1450) led to a severe fall in population in the mid-15th century. Siding with Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria-Munich, in the Landshut War of Succession of 1503-1505 led the city to gain substantial territory, resulting in lands of 25 sq mi (64.7 km2), making it one of the largest Imperial cities.During the Middle Ages, Nuremberg fostered a rich, varied, and influential literary culture.\n\n\n=== Early modern age ===\n\nThe cultural flowering of Nuremberg, in the 15th and 16th centuries, made it the centre of the German Renaissance. In 1525, Nuremberg accepted the Protestant Reformation, and in 1532, the Nuremberg Religious Peace was signed there, preventing war between Protestants and Catholics for 15 years. During the 1552 revolution against Charles V, Nuremberg tried to purchase its neutrality, but the city was attacked without a declaration of war and was forced into a disadvantageous peace. At the Peace of Augsburg, the possessions of the Protestants were confirmed by the Emperor, their religious privileges extended and their independence from the Bishop of Bamberg affirmed, while the 1520s' secularisation of the monasteries was also approved. Families like the Tucher, Imhoff or Haller run trading businesses across Europe, similar to the Fugger and Welser families from Augsburg, although on a slightly smaller scale. \n\nThe state of affairs in the early 16th century, increased trade routes elsewhere and the ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade. During the Thirty Years' War, frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and League soldiers, the financial costs of the war and the cessation of trade caused irreparable damage to the city and a near-halving of the population. In 1632, the city, occupied by the forces of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, was besieged by the army of Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein. The city declined after the war and recovered its importance only in the 19th century, when it grew as an industrial centre. Even after the Thirty Years' War, however, there was a late flowering of architecture and culture \u2013 secular Baroque architecture is exemplified in the layout of the civic gardens built outside the city walls, and in the Protestant city's rebuilding of St. Egidien church, destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century, considered a significant contribution to the baroque church architecture of Middle Franconia.After the Thirty Years' War, Nuremberg attempted to remain detached from external affairs, but contributions were demanded for the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War and restrictions of imports and exports deprived the city of many markets for its manufactures. The Bavarian elector, Charles Theodore, appropriated part of the land obtained by the city during the Landshut War of Succession, to which Bavaria had maintained its claim; Prussia also claimed part of the territory. Realising its weakness, the city asked to be incorporated into Prussia but Frederick William II refused, fearing to offend Austria, Russia and France. At the Imperial diet in 1803, the independence of Nuremberg was affirmed, but on the signing of the Confederation of the Rhine on 12 July 1806, it was agreed to hand the city over to Bavaria from 8 September, with Bavaria guaranteeing the amortisation of the city's 12.5 million guilder public debt.\n\n\n=== After the Napoleonic Wars ===\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the city's trade and commerce revived; the skill of its inhabitants together with its favourable situation soon made the city prosperous, particularly after its public debt had been acknowledged as a part of the Bavarian national debt. Having been incorporated into a Catholic country, the city was compelled to refrain from further discrimination against Catholics, who had been excluded from the rights of citizenship. Catholic services had been celebrated in the city by the priests of the Teutonic Order, often under great difficulties. After their possessions had been confiscated by the Bavarian government in 1806, they were given the Frauenkirche on the Market in 1809; in 1810 the first Catholic parish was established, which in 1818 numbered 1,010 souls.In 1817, the city was incorporated into the district of Rezatkreis (named for the river Franconian Rezat), which was renamed to Middle Franconia (German: Mittelfranken) on 1 January 1838. The first German railway, the Bavarian Ludwigsbahn, from Nuremberg to nearby F\u00fcrth, was opened in 1835. The establishment of railways and the incorporation of Bavaria into Zollverein (the 19th-century German Customs Union), commerce and industry opened the way to greater prosperity. In 1852, there were 53,638 inhabitants: 46,441 Protestants and 6,616 Catholics. It subsequently grew to become the more important industrial city of Southern Germany, one of the most prosperous towns of southern Germany, but after the Austro-Prussian War it was given to the Prussia as part of their telegraph stations they had to give up. In 1905, its population, including several incorporated suburbs, was 291,351: 86,943 Catholics, 196,913 Protestants, 3,738 Jews and 3,766 members of other creeds.\n\n\n=== Nazi era ===\n\nNuremberg held great significance during the Nazi Germany era. Because of the city's relevance to the Holy Roman Empire and its position in the centre of Germany, the Nazi Party chose the city to be the site of huge Nazi Party conventions \u2014 the Nuremberg rallies. The rallies were held in 1927, 1929 and annually from  1933 through 1938. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 the Nuremberg rallies became huge Nazi propaganda events, a centre of Nazi ideals. The 1934 rally was filmed by Leni Riefenstahl, and made into a propaganda film called Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will).\nAt the 1935 rally, Hitler specifically ordered the Reichstag to convene at Nuremberg to pass the Nuremberg Laws which revoked German citizenship for all Jews and other non-Aryans. A number of premises were constructed solely for these assemblies, some of which were not finished. Today many examples of Nazi architecture can still be seen in the city. The city was also the home of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher, the publisher of Der St\u00fcrmer.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Nuremberg was the headquarters of Wehrkreis (military district) XIII, and an important site for military production, including aircraft, submarines and tank engines. A subcamp of Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp was located here, and extensively used slave labour. The city was severely damaged in Allied strategic bombing from 1943 to 1945. On 29 March 1944, the RAF endured its heaviest losses in the bombing campaign of Germany. Out of more than 700 planes participating, 106 were shot down or crash-landed on the way home to their bases, and more than 700 men were missing, as many as 545 of them dead. More than 160 became prisoners of war.On 2 January 1945, the medieval city centre was systematically bombed by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Army Air Forces and about ninety percent of it was destroyed in only one hour, with 1,800 residents killed and roughly 100,000 displaced. In February 1945, additional attacks followed. In total, about 6,000 Nuremberg residents are estimated to have been killed in air raids.\nNuremberg was a heavily fortified city that was captured in a fierce battle lasting from 17 to 21 April 1945 by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, 42nd Infantry Division and 45th Infantry Division, which fought house-to-house and street-by-street against determined German resistance, causing further urban devastation to the already bombed and shelled buildings. Despite this intense degree of destruction, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent restored to its pre-war appearance, including the reconstruction of some of its medieval buildings. Much of this reconstructive work and conservation was done by the organisation 'Old Town Friends Nuremberg'. However, over half of the historic look of the center, and especially the northeastern half of the old Imperial Free City was not restored.\n\n\n=== Nuremberg trials ===\n\nBetween 1945 and 1946, German officials involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity were brought before an international tribunal in the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union had wanted these trials to take place in Berlin. However, Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trials for specific reasons:\n\nThe city had been the location of the Nazi Party's Nuremberg rallies and the laws stripping Jews of their citizenship were passed there. There was symbolic value in making it the place of Nazi demise.\nThe Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few that had remained largely intact despite extensive Allied bombing of Germany). The already large courtroom was reasonably easily expanded by the removal of the wall at the end opposite the bench, thereby incorporating the adjoining room. A large prison was also part of the complex.\nAs a compromise, it was agreed that Berlin would become the permanent seat of the International Military Tribunal and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg. Due to the Cold War, subsequent trials never took place.Following the trials, in October 1946, several prominent German Nazi politicians and military leaders were executed in Nuremberg.\nThe same courtroom in Nuremberg was the venue of the Nuremberg Military Tribunals, organized by the United States as occupying power in the area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSeveral old villages now belong to the city, for example Grossgr\u00fcndlach, Kraftshof, Thon, and Neunhof in the north-west; Ziegelstein in the northeast, Altenfurt and Fischbach in the south-east; and Katzwang, Kornburg in the south. Langwasser is a modern suburb.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNuremberg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) with a certain humid continental influence (Dfb), categorized in the latter by the 0 \u00b0C isotherm. The city's climate is influenced by its inland position and higher altitude. Winters are changeable, with either mild or cold weather: the average temperature is around \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) to 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F), while summers are generally warm, mostly around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the afternoon. Precipitation is evenly spread throughout the year, although February and April tend to be a bit drier whereas July tends to have more rainfall.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNuremberg has been a destination for immigrants. 39.5% of the residents had an immigrant background in 2010 (counted with MigraPro).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nNuremberg for many people is still associated with its traditional gingerbread (Lebkuchen) products, sausages, and handmade toys. Pocket watches \u2014 Nuremberg eggs \u2014 were made here in the 16th century by Peter Henlein. Only one of the districts in the 1797-1801 sample was early industrial; the economic structure of the region around Nuremberg was dominated by metal and glass manufacturing, reflected by a share of nearly 50% handicrafts and workers. In the 19th century Nuremberg became the \"industrial heart\" of Bavaria with companies such as Siemens and MAN establishing a strong base in the city.  Nuremberg is still an important industrial centre with a strong standing in the markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Items manufactured in the area include electrical equipment, mechanical and optical products, motor vehicles, writing and drawing paraphernalia, stationery products and printed materials.\nThe city is also strong in the fields of automation, energy and medical technology. Siemens is still the largest industrial employer in the Nuremberg region but a good third of German market research agencies are also located in the city. The Nuremberg International Toy Fair is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nNuremberg is Bavaria\u2019s second largest city after Munich, and a popular tourist destination for foreigners and Germans alike. It was a leading city 500 years ago, but 90% of the town was destroyed in 1945 during the war. After World War II, many medieval-style areas of the town were rebuilt.\n\n\n===== Attractions =====\nBeyond its main attractions of the Imperial Castle, St. Lorenz Church, and Nazi Trial grounds, there are 54 different museums for arts and culture, history, science and technology, family and children, and more niche categories, where visitors can see the world's oldest globe (built in 1492), a 500-year-old Madonna, and Renaissance-era German art. There are several types of tours offered in the city, including historic tours, those that are Nazi-focused, underground and night tours, walking tours, sightseeing buses, self guided tours, and an old town tour on a mini train. Nuremberg also offers several parks and green areas, as well as indoor activities such as bowling, rock wall climbing, escape rooms, cart racing, and mini golf, theaters and cinemas, pools and thermal spas. There are also six nearby amusement parks. The city's tourism board sells the Nurnberg Card which allows for free use of public transportation and free entry to all museums and attractions in Nuremberg for a two-day period.\n\n\n===== Culinary Tourism =====\nNuremberg is also a destination for food lovers. Culinary tourists can taste the city's famous lebkuchen, gingerbread, local beer, and N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrstchen, or Nuremberg sausages. There are hundreds of restaurants for all tastes, including traditional franconian restaurants and beer gardens. Also offers 17 vegan and vegetarian restaurants, seven fully organic restaurants. Nuremberg also boasts a two Michelin Star rated restaurant, Essigbr\u00e4tlein.\n\n\n===== Pedestrian zones =====\nLike many European cities, Nuremberg offers a pedestrian-only zone covering a large portion of the old town, which is a main destination for shopping and specialty retail, including year-round Christmas stores where tourists and locals alike can purchase Christmas ornaments, gifts, decorations, and additions to their toy Christmas villages. The Craftsmen's Courtyard, or Handwerkerhof, is another tourist shopping destination in the style of a medieval village. It houses several local family-run businesses which sell handcrafted items from glass, wood, leather, pottery, and precious metals. The Handwerkerhof is also home to traditional German restaurants and beer gardens.The Pedestrian zones of Nuremberg host festivals and markets throughout the year, most well known being Christkindlesmarkt, Germany's largest Christmas market and the gingerbread capital of the world. Visitors to the Christmas market can peruse the hundreds of stalls and purchase local wood crafts, nutcrackers, smokers, and prune people, while sampling Christmas sweets and traditional gluhwein.\n\n\n===== Hospitality =====\nIn 2017, Nuremberg saw a total of 3.3 million overnight stays, a record for the town, and is expected to have surpassed that in 2018, with more growth in tourism anticipated in the coming years. There are over 175 registered places of accommodation in Nuremberg, ranging from hostels to luxury hotels, bed and breakfasts, to multi-hundred room properties. As of 19 April 2019, Nuremberg had 306 AirBnB listings.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nNuremberg was an early centre of humanism, science, printing, and mechanical invention. The city contributed much to the science of astronomy. In 1471 Johannes Mueller of K\u00f6nigsberg (Bavaria), later called Regiomontanus, built an astronomical observatory in Nuremberg and published many important astronomical charts.\nIn 1515, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, a native of Nuremberg, created woodcuts of the first maps of the stars of the northern and southern hemispheres, producing the first printed star charts, which had been ordered by Johannes Stabius. Around 1515 D\u00fcrer also published the \"Stabiussche Weltkarte\", the first perspective drawing of the terrestrial globe.Printers and publishers have a long history in Nuremberg. Many of these publishers worked with well-known artists of the day to produce books that could also be considered works of art. In 1470 Anton Koberger opened Europe's first print shop in Nuremberg. In 1493, he published the Nuremberg Chronicles, also known as the World Chronicles (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated history of the world from the creation to the present day. It was written in the local Franconian dialect by Hartmann Schedel and had illustrations by Michael Wohlgemuth, Wilhelm Pleydenwurff, and Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Others furthered geographical knowledge and travel by map making. Notable among these was navigator and geographer Martin Behaim, who made the first world globe.\nSculptors such as Veit Stoss, Adam Kraft and Peter Vischer are also associated with Nuremberg.\nComposed of prosperous artisans, the guilds of the Meistersingers flourished here. Richard Wagner made their most famous member, Hans Sachs, the hero of his opera Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel was born here and was organist of St. Sebaldus Church.\nThe academy of fine arts situated in Nuremberg is the oldest art academy in central Europe and looks back to a tradition of 350 years of artistic education.\nNuremberg is also famous for its Christkindlesmarkt (Christmas market), which draws well over a million shoppers each year.  The market is famous for its handmade ornaments and delicacies.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n \nGermanisches Nationalmuseum\nHouse of Albrecht D\u00fcrer\nKunsthalle N\u00fcrnberg\nKunstverein N\u00fcrnberg\nNeues Museum N\u00fcrnberg (Modern Art Museum)\nNuremberg Toy Museum\nNuremberg Transport Museum\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nThe Nuremberg State Theatre, founded in 1906, is dedicated to all types of opera, ballet and stage theatre.

The State Philharmonic Nuremberg (Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg) is the orchestra of the State Theatre. Its name was changed in 2011 from its previous name: The Nuremberg Philharmonic (N\u00fcrnberger Philharmoniker). It is the second-largest opera orchestra in Bavaria. Besides opera performances, it also presents its own subscription concert series in the Meistersingerhalle. Christof Perick was the principal conductor of the orchestra between 2006\u20132011. Marcus Bosch heads the orchestra since September 2011  .\nThe Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra (N\u00fcrnberger Symphoniker) performs around 100 concerts a year to a combined annual audience of more than 180,000.

In the centre of the city, on the bank of the river Pegnitz, stands the Hospital of the Holy Spirit. Founded in 1332, this is one of the largest hospitals of the Middle Ages. Lepers were kept here at some distance from the other patients. It now houses elderly persons and a restaurant.\nThe Hauptmarkt, dominated by the front of the unique Gothic Frauenkirche (Our Lady's Church), provides a picturesque setting for the famous Christmas market. A main attraction on the square is the Gothic Sch\u00f6ner Brunnen (Beautiful Fountain) which was erected around 1385 but subsequently replaced with a replica (the original fountain is kept in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum). The unchanged Renaissance bridge Fleischbr\u00fccke crosses the Pegnitz nearby.\nThe Gothic Lorenzkirche (St. Laurence church) dominates the southern part of the walled city and is one of the most important buildings in Nuremberg.

          "I was really impressed by the collections in the museum. It is quite big, so you can spend a even few hours, if you want to. You will see part of ancient history of where Germany is nowadays, up to amazing paintings of German art. Facts about religion, as well. Medieval",

          "This museum has a very extensive collection of artifacts. One of the sections deals with the history of Germany and the Germans. You could spend several days to see all the exhibits in detail so it is best to make plans. A museum with a church inside has to be worth a look.",
          "I was expecting a bit more. The plan of the museum is very confusing. Some lovely works, of course, but the vibe here was strange. Work of Veit Sto\u00df was the reason to visit here. Great Middle Ages religious sculptures. It just was not presented in a cohesive manner.",

          "We were pleased to note it was free when we arrived at 5Pm but it also closes at 6Pm and there is nowhere near enough time to see everything. It contains something from everyone from art to religion to war but if you do want to see everything, give yourself some hours as it's",
          "We arrived about an hour before closing, and were told that, because of that, entrance was free. The downside is that an hour isn't nearly enough time to see all of the absorbing exhibits. Bags and purses need to be put in lockers.",

          "There is so much to German history - though I have read Neil McGregor's book, you soon realise how we have over-simplified German history to the before and after the second world war. What a shame! But you can put all this in its place by visiting this museum. Loads of floor",
          "We had high hopes of this museum, having read so many good reviews and knowing what it contains, but we were very disappointed. Navigation around the museum is a nightmare: it's a complicated set of buildings at the best of times but current on-site works have made it necessary",
          "The 5 stars are not enough. I've visited quite a few museums. This one has it all. It covers a few buildings all connected to each other. Covers from prehistory to modern. You will need at least 4 hours. Worth a visit.",
          "We visited specifically to view the oldest globe in the world. The museum is vast & with limited time we viewed the pieces most interested in seeing. We also enjoyed the c 1629 Rembrandt's self portrait. The museum entry is 8 euros per person. Lockers offered for belongings at 1",
          "Interesting look at German history from a people perspective. Beautiful building and statuary if you like that kind of thing.",
          "Only half of the museum was open the rest was under renovation and not accessible. However it was such a large museum that even half was quite an extensive collection. The medieval art collection was quite extensive as was the temporary exhibit on the fashion collection. Much of",

          "Located within walking distance of N\u00fcrnberg\u2019s main train station, the Germanic National Museum is a treasure trove of German artistic, cultural, and historic artifacts. The wide variety of permanent exhibitions share the spotlight with special exhibitions that can cover topics",
          "I was very impressed by this museum which I would highly recommend for a visit. The building is modern light and has a lovely caf\u00e9/restaurant and conference area, also a well stocked shop. But the real attraction are the exhibits of which there are many and various types which",
          "I highly recommend this museum to all visitors of Nuremberg who like to have an overview of Bavarian history and culture. You should not expect to see everything, the museum is really large, so better start your tour on something you're really interested in. As usual, if you",
          "Large, very modern building that is very hard to navigate and find way around. (I could not figure out how to get to top two levels and I am very good with maps). Appeared to have a very extensive and high quality collection of art, Emphasis on fine arts, no significant amount",

          "I left my visit to this museum until the end of my stay in Nuremberg, and really regretted doing so as it was the highlight of my time in the city. The museum has a huge and very varied collection, with the galleries on ancient German history and the Holy Roman Empire being the",
          "I had no idea of the quality and range of exhibits on display here. Beautiful medieval section, German painting of high quality from all periods, lovely decorative arts, built around a existing monastery church and cloister. Wow. If you like musical instruments, you'll go nuts",
          "The building is a bit of a maze, but there are helpful staff to direct the visitor. Excellent collections of major importance for German culture (including folk culture). Interpretation in English as well as German. An old-fashioned museum interested in showing as much of the",
          "Its a large museum, make sure you get a map and look for the not so obvious rooms or you might miss them, specially the ones ext to the Kloster. Very good collection and it has explanations in English, which helped a lot.",
          "We found many excellent exhibits and fascinating items. Many of the exhibits are in both German and English. We got lost in the museum and found some of the exhibits a little confusing. But, still well worth a visit.",
          "This is a stunning museum. The collection of significant artifacts is breathtaking. There are also great artwork. The audio guide is a must. Not only can it lead you around, give very complete descriptions, but it has additional material on it's screen",
          "Nuremberg's Germanisches Nationalmuseum is a very well organized museum displaying the authentic culture and artifacts of Nuremberg and Bavaria as well as certain masterpieces by renowned world painters and sculptors. The range of artifacts stretches from antiquity to modern",
          "I could easily spend a whole day in this great museum. During my 3 hour visit (including a free tour) I wasn't even able to see all the exhibitions I found most interesting. I think the great variety of excellent exhibits make this one of the best museums in Germany. The",
          "The Germanisches Nationalmuseum is located inside a number of buildings, including a previous cloister, so even the structure has a certain level of interest. What is exceptional, however, are the range and scope of items within this museum. There is a whole floor devoted to",
          "Very extensive collection of material relating to the Germanic peoples. Particularly impressed with the religious architecture and wooden carvings., as well as the scientific instruments. Will need to come back to see all the things time did not allow.",
          "We were very keen to visit the museum but were extremely disappointed in the unfriendly and unhelpful attitude of the staff at the ticket desk. At first they wouldn't even acknowledge us as we waited patiently to buy a ticket and then refused to greet us. As we were paying for",

          "Great museum! You can easily spend 3-4 hours there. If you really want to know about the history of German-speaking part of Europe that's the place to go. It has a huge collection of artefacts all the way back from neolithic period to younger history. Very nice collection of",

          "The collections in this museum are incredible- prehistoric artifacts, Celtic jewelry, medieval art, housewares and decorative objects, toys (a completely furnished dollhouse from the 1600s was surprisingly cool), weapons and armor, baroque paintings. Impossible to see",
          "This museum is quite large. It is spread between two buildings. While it was a little confusing for us to figure out the layout, it was certainly worth the effort. Definitely get the audio guide, which costs 2 euros extra. It iis like a smart phone, and it uses the screen to",

          "This is quite interesting museum. Artifacts and historical items are excellent. we really enjoyed the pre-1492 globe, since it gave a glimpse of what the European perception of the world was at that time. You should allow at least a few hours to tour the museum!",
          "Great selection of artefects from all ages - especially Byzantine. Well laid out and signposted. An enormous museum. Well worth the visit.",
          "This is vast. There is so much to see it is a bit overwhelming. I think you could easily spend half a day or more in here and still not see it al. A must see if you are in the city for a few days",
          "Don\u00b4t take me wrong - I love this museum! You could spend a week there and still find new things to admire. The staff at the museum is very helpfull, you can have a nice meal at the museum cafe . We came to see the Cranach exhibition (fantastic) and after lunch decided to see",

          "I cannot summarize accurately what a wonderful experience I had at the GNM. First, I must say that I completely underestimated the amount of time to spend here. I thought I would give the museum 1-2 hrs. It would fully merit 3-4 hours, in my opinion. The museum does a fantastic",

          "We spent a day here, to visit this Museum. There was a Cranach exhibition on, which is why we visited. There are however so many other stunning exhibitions, you could easily spend a whole week here. I can highly recommend their toy museum, they have the most phenomenal doll",
          "This museum is well worth a visit. It has fascinating collections of art, clothes, musical instruments. Staff are very friendly.",
          "It would probably take a full day or more to see all the collections: pick your favorites... weapons and armours or religious paintings and sculptures from the middle ages or musical instruments or 20th century paintings or.... Unfortunately the recorded audio tour is available",
          "We spent several, very interesting, hours visiting only a rather small part of this very rich museum. One will need several visits in order to enjoy all the exhibition rooms.",
          "One reads this is one of the best museums in the world and it is easy to see why. The structures which house it are fascinating in and of themselves. Many inventions come from Nuremberg, for example the pocketwatch and the globe, and the originals are in the museum. There is",
          "The German National Museum is a must when visiting Nuremberg, Germany. It is laid out exceptionally well and photographs are permitted. This museum rivals the Victoria and Albert in London.",
          "It would take days to see all the treasures in this museum. We were overwhelmed by its size and the variety of its content. Contains both art treasures (D\u00fcrer, Rembrandt, Cranach, etc.) and historic objects. Wonderfully organized. Excellent cafe. Not to be missed!",
          "This is an excellent museum. If you've gone to some historic sites in Europe and wonder where some of the interesting things that were in these buildings went, you can find some of them here. I spent 5 hours at this Museum recently and really enjoyed seeing all of the items in",
          "This museum is huge and overwhelming, but amazing. The displays for the most part are beautifully done and clearly presented. There is so much to see, though. Rooms of carved wooden crosses, cases of religious folk art, regional folk costumes, musical instruments, fragments",
          "It's just a place full of history and has some great pieces. I highly recommend going there and to bring something to write down.",
          "Today made visit #2 to this amazing museum. I'm able to visit often because I live 30 minutes South of the city. This museum is set in a great location right in the heart of Nuremberg and is in a phenomenal old building that has been mixed with new conatruction, so it is a great",
          "This museum is a collection of interconnected buildings. It started in one in the late 1800s and it's just grown since then. The armory is my favorite room. Its collection of swords and other weapons is lovely, plus the last time I went they had a life-sized model jouster set up",
          "This museum has the Way of Human Rights outdoor sculpture along the walkway leading to the main entrance of the museum. There is no admission charge from 6:00 P.M. to 9:00 P.M. on Wednesday nights and I used this three hour time frame to get an overview of the diverse and",
          "I spent two afternoons here and barely scratched the surface. Be sure to pick up an audio guide, as it explains works in more depth. The physical guides to each room's theme helps you acquaint yourself to the works and decide if you're interested or not. You can find them in",
          "The building is impressive but I did not find the collections inside excited. I really enjoyed the temporary exhibition of pocet watches which ends April 12",
          "Do take time to visit this excellent museum which presents a survey or German art and craft. I especially enjoyed the wood carvings. Look for the large angel that peers down from above as you enter the cloister section.",
          "This museum is huge and offers a great variety of exhibits. I would have never expected anything like that in a city like nuremberg. If this museum would be located in berlin, evryone would know it. Go there and experience german history, culture and art in a way you have never",
          "Be sure you have enough time reserved for the visit, it is THE museum to see in Nuremberg if you are a historian or history enthusiast. You'll get, inevitably lost, but it makes the discovery experience even more interesting. Thematic exhibitions/units spice things up! It's a",
          "This is a modern building with very nice museography, the pieces are nicely displayed and cover several centuries of German history. Wednesdays is a day when it closes late so you can take advantage of it.",
          "This had all different items including stone tools from ancient man (and a small horse cave drawing too), guild artifacts, ancient scientific instruments, a full pharmacy set-up, musical instruments, weapons, clothing, tapestries, paintings and sculptures etc. I only saw about",
          "great collections, diverse. Try to wear light close, is very warm in the most spaces inside . It worth to visit, maybe two days spent here would make the visit more enjoyable.",
          "This is a huge museum, so just go to the areas you want to go about as it's too big to see at one time. There's a lot here. We went to the ancient rooms and some of the boards are in english but not all of them. There were also some translation issues and the boards did not read",
          "This museum is huge. You can spend half a day in it and still can't say you covered it all. However, this is mainly a history museum and if you are not a fan of those, this museum would not change your mind. That being said, the organization of this museum seemed to be a mess.",
          "Well this is the place to come! From artwork to costumes, musical instruments to actual life size historical rooms, there is something to cater for all. The museum is a bargain for a family as it was only 10 euros. This is the English website",
          "I am not a fun of museums but this is something different. This museum shows all the history of Germany and a lot more... Be prepared, you will need all the morning hours to see everything. Also, we went there on Wednesday at 6-9 pm it is free.",
          "If you want to learn more about the rich history of Germany, please visit this wonderfull museum. On the top floor there is a compleet furnished old farmerhouse.",
          "After the castle and the old town, we have found this museum to be a must visit attraction. It is large and diverse. Chose what you want to see, otherwise you we be overwhelmed and there all day. The museum is Germany's most important. There is an archialogical collection,",
          "This very large museum, devoted to German history and culture contains a number of different collections spanning prehistoric times till present day. It's not the kind of museum you visit in one day. I would advise checking out their web site and deciding what's of most interest",
          "The museum is situated right in the center of the city. It has all kinds of exhibitions, from technics, to musical instruments . So you better check before, which exhibitions are your selection",
          "Many great exhibits so a very good place to learn German history and culture. Everyone will find something interesting. Had to check my tote because someone thought it too large. Not enthusiastic about that.",
          "There really is something for everyone here; this museum has at least a little bit of everything. Artifacts from the Middle Ages, Renaissance paintings, a reconstructed chapel and an alpine house, old furniture, an impressive collection of old scientific instruments, and more.",
          "Friendly and helpful reception. Very assorted collection, with diferent thematic sections. You should go there with at least 2 or 3 hours to spend, cause it's very big. For architects or architecture enthusiasts the building itself is worth the visit! The museum's cafe is great",
          "We got to visit the Zepplin Field where Hitler had started to build a coloseum for his Nazi Party rallies were held. We took a bus inside the place, and it was very uncomfortable for me to be there. Our bus look like an ant inside. The building was never finished. This is",
          "This is the place to go to see Durer's artwork. There is much more. I liked the globe that did not show North or South America because these continents had not been discovered, the entire chapels on the ground floor, the carved altars, and the regional religious statues. I",
          "Lots of exhibits and collections depicting German art and culture shedding light on the history of Nuremberg. It is said to be Germany's largest museum of cultural history so best to get the audio guide and / or map out what you want to see and how to get to that exhibit.",
          "A sensational range of artefacts and works of art, all displayed in a well-designed and elegant way. We were short of time, so had to cram it all into half a day. You need at least twice that to do it justice.",
          "The first point to make about this museum in downtown Nuremburg is that it represents the most ungainly mixture of various buildings and collections of different kinds of art and historical objects that I've ever seen--and I've been to a LOT of museums. The second point is that",
          "We only had one day to visit this vast museum featuring all things German from prehistoric to present. Thus we could only see a small fraction of what they had on offer but what we did see, we spent the entire day and the time really flew. Among the highlights are paintings by",
          "Great range of exhibition material. Could have spent all day there. Friendly staff, nice cafe...go and be amazed",
          "If it has a history or relates to Germany, it's in here. Three very full floors full of Religious, Art and daily living artifacts. We took a break in the middle to watch the glockenspeil at the Frauenkirche.",
          "No matter what you're interested in--science, design, fashion, art--chances are you can explore it here for as long as time allows. And you'll probably leave wishing you could have stayed longer. At this extraordinary place, you can see Germany's impact, for good and ill, on",
          "I was here during the Xmas week, and this spacious museum was a wonderful place to spend a quiet afternoon. Plenty of medieval items, paintings, ceramics, many with English descriptions. Spent more time than I expected to.",
          "I've been to this museum before some 4 years ago and it keeps getting better as my visit this time proved. You could spend a couple of days here which most of us can't spare, so give it at least half a day. It's the best museum in Germany about Germany from pre-history to the",
          "This is not to miss: from art history, to primitive tools through revolutionary war instruments, to a collection of musical instruments dating back to medieval times, this museum was a hit with us!",
          "The collection is very large - we were there for three hours and still had to skip a lot of stuff. Also, because it is housed in various buildings from different ages the flow from one exhibition hall to the other is somewhat disrupted, often you have to double back. The map",
          "The museum is superb, very bright and spacious, it feels so uncluttered considering how much there is to see, allow plenty time, it's like a maze. Had to have a break in the basement coffee shop.",

          "A very LARGE museum! Contains some very valuable and interesting pieces going back through the various ages. Talking of ages you will need it to see everything. We spent 2 hours in the place and we only really touched the sides of it. Looks like it's a very useful resource for",
          "This is a wonderful display of German history and art. At 8 euros a person it is well worth the money. We spent most of one day just visiting the first floor. The second and third floor will have to wait for another visit.",
          "This museum had a wide range of artifacts dating back to prehistory and an excellent armoury display.Don't expect the British Museum or the Louvre here but it is very well laid out. Again, as with so many things in Nuremburg, most of the displays are accompanied by German only",
          "We were very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this museum. We had a few hours to kill after visiting the Christmas market, and since it was near the train station (and free on Wednesday nights), it fit the bill. And it might have been the best museum we saw in all of",
          "An excellent museum with something to appeal to all tastes. Very large - you need a long time to get round particularly (if you are like us) you find it very confusing. The map they provide is far from clear on how to get from one section to another and the signs are not",
          "A very big museum on the theme of German culture and history (and pre-history). Great artifacts well presented with English text as well as German. Do push open the doors that seem closed as there are hidden treasures in the enormous complex of older passageways and buildings.",
          "This museum, which had extremely helpful staff, was very confusing to figure out. It is very large and I could've spent at least a day or a day and a half looking all around it. The museum has quite an extensive history into the beauty and pride of all that is Germany.",
          "We liked the museum and the variety of exhibits. The only drawback for us was the layout was a bit confusing. Loved the porcelain and antique musical instrument exhibit.",
          "This museum is definitely worth a visit but allow lots of time to see all its treasures! We made two visits and still did not see it all.",
          "This a very large museum, close to the main rail station, which is an amalgam of a number of buildings and consists of a number of sections dealing with German culture and art through the centuries. Despite the map and signs we had great difficulty in finding what we looking for",
          "This is a really magnificent museum where the exhibits are beautifully displayed. We plan to revisit Nuremberg early next year just to do the museum justice. I could spend days in it!",
          "We arrived 1 hour 10 minutes before closing and were informed by the most helpful lady to take out time putting our bags and coats in the lockers available and then entry would be free of charge! She was so helpful and super friendly advising the best way to get the most from",
          "There is so much wonderful history in this museum. We allowed ourselves only five hours and could have spent two days. Lots of fascinating treasures, very well presented.",
          "This outstanding Museum stands at Kornmarkt, near Lorenzkirche. Structurally, it is a masterpiece of architectural design with sunlight (when available) penetrating gracefully its well insulated external \"skin\". There are 2 long huge buildings in parallel, thus you need more",
          "First thing - this museum is massive, you would need a full day to really see everything and even then it might be at a rush. Collection range from medieval sculpture to paintings, musical instruments and prehistoric flint tools. Although the collection is very traditional in",
          "Whether you love art, armor, or archaeology, this museum is a wonderful place to spend a day. You don't want to hurry through, and I recommend getting here early, enjoying lunch in the nice restaurant, and then walking it off the rest of the afternoon. Not especially \"kid\"",
          "It is worth visiting this museum as it very much focuses on German art and culture. Therefore it is not one of those museums which holds international collections so you could be in any European capital. There is much to see and could be worth more than one visit if you want to",
          "For museum buffs, this is a must. However, the collections are so vast that it is hopeless trying to see them all, even over a couple of days. The prehistory section was one of the best we have seen. Loved the medieval art as well as collections of old scientific instruments.",
          "Ther German National Museum has a wide selection across multiple centuries - from Stone Age to 19th century - in a large building that is unique to walk in all by itself. Some displays have English translations, but not all. More disappointing, many displays show only an item",
          "It's difficult to see all for a short time. And you can take pictures here. I hope you enjoy paintings and more.",
          "This is an all day experience if you really want to see and experience it all. It is very much like the Smithsonian. Just when you think you have seen it all, you walk into another gallery and see more. Originally I wanted to see some of Albrecht Durer's works. Three hours",
          "Yes, it's an absolutely magnificent collection, but the problem lies in trying to navigate your way round it. I asked for a plan at the information desk, but for some reason they only gave me leaflets on the temporary exhibitions so I don't know if there is even a visitors' plan",
          "To take in the whole museum is an ambitious undertaking. As others said it is layed out across several buildings all connected, but not easy to find the section you might be looking for. Highlights were the Prehistoric section, the musical instruments section. It is worth",
          "This is a museum to watch and understand the German history and culture; there are also English guided tours.",
          "Although this is primarily a historical museum, and an outstandingly good one, it is also home to many great works of art, from the Middle Ages into the 17th century. The collection of German painting and sculpture -- Riemenschneider, Cranach, Duerer, Atldorfer, Bruyn, etc. --",
          "Had a day off from business trip and took a trip to the museum. On the main strip of Downtown Nuremberg the maps on the street and the unique building make it easy to find if you walk into town. During my visit they had a Albert Durer exhibit which was one of a kind. Albert",
          "It was my first museum visit in Germany and I had enjoyed it a lot, the best experience for me in Nuremberg. Nice and interesting medieval collection, don't miss out the armory and weapons section and as others pointed out, you can easily lose your way in the museum and find",
          "A big museum with lots of exhibits. Some are a little dated, but others are obviously recently renewed. The (temporary) exhibit on Crafts and Guilds was excellent as was the (permanent) exhibit about medieval cities.",
          "We left exhausted and knew we could never do this museum justice in a single visit. We spent five hours listening to the excellent English language audio guide and wandering through the fabulous museum with exhibits from pre and ancient history that were simply amazing -- to",
          "No mistake found while wanderig through the museum rooms. Magnificient; with a lot valuable historical findings. Perfectly organized (also English translations provided). I recommend!!",
          "This is a museum that takes your breath away by its sheer scale and scope. German/Germanic art and artefacts coming from over 2000 years are here, magnificently laid out, but overwhelming in number. We spent 2 hours, and barely cherry-picked the collection. You need to have a",
          "This museum was so much more than I expected. My friends and I spend about 3 hours in there and we did NOT see everything. Please budget several hours if you are really interested in art. You won't be sorry",
          "I've never been in a museum where, when I ask where something is, no one can tell me how to get to it, but will lead me through corridors, rooms, up and down staircases, etc. to reach it. Perhaps if you have half a day to wander around aimlessly, this is a good museum. I was",
          "I was only in Nuremberg for 1 afternoon and 1 night, so I went into the museum an hour and a half before closing thinking that this would be enough time. Boy, was I wrong. There is so much to see there that I could have easily burned at least 4 more hours in there. They have",
          "My husband and I made the mistake of only giving ourselves 1.5 hours to visit this museum. We had no idea how massive it was! It has something for everyone - prehistoric artifacts, religious relics, art, clothing, recreations of rural life in Germany, musical instruments,",
          "We went here for a special exhibit about Albrecht Duerer, but there is always plenty to see and do. The tour guides are excellent and are available, for a fee, in many languages. There are also audio guides, so you can enjoy the museum on your own. Exhibits range form the",

          "We spent about 3 hours in this museum but you could really allot a full day if you enjoy these types of displays. As others have said, they have a HUGE collection that has artifacts from the stone age to the present day. They do have English audioguides but there aren't",
          "Again we were blown away by the sheer volume of information and exhibitions, but the lack of an English Audio guide made the visit drawn out and a bit of a drag. We left after viewing the first 2 wings out of the 4 wings available as it simply got too tiresome and long winded to",
          "I went to this museum for my partner. It's \u20ac6 each. You get a guide in English and they later made a tannic announcement about a guided tour in English. All coats andbags much be left in the lockers for a \u20ac1 fee. The museum is huge, and I found it difficult to find my way",
          "I heard that most of the displays do not have English descriptions, this is not true. In fact, they are very accommodating to the English speaker and many, if not most displays had English language descriptions. We enjoyed just about the entire museum, understanding the maps and",
          "We visited this museum in both 2006 and 2012, and a day should be spent at leisure at this museum, which has everything from stone age prehistory to modern day art--and everything in between. There is something for everyone here--armor and weapons, traditional country home",
          "The museum has been designed to give visitors and nationals alike an insight to the past. Well worth a visit.",
          "The museum itself is pretty nice, and it may well be, as it claims, the largest museum of cultural history within the German-speaking region, but you might find it a bit disappointing if what you love are paintings. We had the misfortune of arriving to Nuremberg a few days only",
          "Spent a lovely afternoon here last summer, when there was NOT a special exhibit going on. This makes for a very different experience: no lines at all, quiet almost deserted halls, a peaceful experience. Some areas are closed off until you ask a guard to unlock the elevator &",
          "The queues are often very long here and although easy to find the lack of sign posts could deter some people. The website for the museum is very good and should be checked before a visit so one can see what is going on.",

It was great to see these in person, although as always with these high profile, popular shows, hard to get close enough or spend any time with the detailed and small sketches. Although it was obviously pertinent to the theme of his early work, a",
          "There is a huge variety of items and artifacts to view here. There is a family ticket that will save money on entry. They have lockers near the entrance to put up bags for 1 Euro, and the money is returned when you retrieve your items. The oldest globe in the world is located",
          "Would definitely recommend going here - excellent collection. We especially enjoyed the furniture gallery. Quite large - we probably spent about 3 hours here. We pretty much had the place to ourselves.",
          "The time frame coverers in the museum is quiet large, so take some time if you want to explore all. The exhibits are presented well, I recommend to spend a crew short visits at this great hotel ...",
          "Like all of the German National Museums, this one has an outstanding collection. This one specilizes in art, musical instruments, clothing and some weaponry and armor. Of particular interest are the musical instrument and clothing halls, which hold examples that I've only seen",
          "If you are in Nurnberg go and see the Durer exhibit. It is amazing. The rest of the museum is icing on the cake.",
          "My husband and I absolutely loved this museum. He could spend hours just looking at all of the guns and militaria on display. The part that I loved the most was the scientific instruments and castle locks as well as the compasses/clocks/astronomy section. The layout of the",
          "The Albrecht Durer show is a once in a lifetime museum exhibition and shows work from Durer's early life, documenting and elaborating upon his artistic development, inspiration, journeyman experiences, and artistic exploration.",
          "The museum was sprawling and if I weren't as tired, I would've explored the entire museum. They had a wonderful exhibit of Albrecht D\u00fcrer's work which was just stunning. Definitely a must-see for anyone there. The Way of Human Rights outside the museum is also breathtaking.",
          "Passing through Nuremberg I had a few hours to spare and decided to pop into the Museum. An amazing place, a huge collection covering culture, art, archaelogy, history and memorabilia. There are more sections than you could possibly see on a single visit, so study the (free)",
          "This is a huge museum where you can spend a whole day if you like. The collections involves paintings, armour, design, furniture, textile, sculpture and a period from long b.c to present day. The building can be disorientating and I must confess that the map didn't help much.",
          "Enormous collection of early German art -- a few by Durer, the native son. The museum itself it a beautiful building. At the side of the museum is a courtyard dedicated to human rights.",
          "I am astonished at the 2 terrible reviews of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum! Anyone who cannot find something fascinating in that huge museum would likely not find anything of interest in ANY museum. That or the search was flawed. We drive an hour each way and visit several",
          "You have collections for all tastes, from musical instruments to medieval weapons and of course, paintings and art pieces from the medieval times. This museum is so huge that it would take half day to see everything with time. However if you just want to have an idea of the",
          "A lot of history well displayed. Liked the music section as well as the Durer collection",
          "The museum is located inside the Old City walls, it has an amazing unexpected collection of Cranachs, Duerers and Rembrandts, on the first floor there is a historic exhibiotion. Definitely recommended for art lovers and families.",
          "Absolutely massive, high quality collection. Featuring Durer's works, of course!",

          "I went to this museum twice in 2 days because I really loved it! free photography, a huge collection, clear information and very nice guardians,. They helped me sometimes to get oriented in the galleries, they all speak english and sometimes even italian! Beautiful and variated",
          "We spent more than 2 hours in the museum - and didn't see more than half of it. We especially loved the costume/cloth-department. There is something to everyones taste - but I wish some more information had been in english as my german is not good enough to understand all the",
          "A huge place, with lots of exhibits and artifacts, none of which is too cramped, so it makes for easy viewing. Cheap too. Only 9 euro for the family. Only a five-minute walk from the train station. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because nothing was OMG, this is",
          "The museum is enormous. We were the for over 3 hours, and didn't see everything. It covers every aspect of Germanic history in great detail, so you can spend a lot of time on things that interest you and skip what doesn't. I was most impressed with the armour/weapons section,",
          "This museum is HUGE. We didn't go through all of museum it is too much to see in one visit. My husband had overload and was worn out so we left after a couple of hours.You can take pictures of exhibits. There is also a cafe which we ate at to break up tour of museum. The best",
          "During our visit to Nurnberg, we decided to stop by the Germanic National Museum. We grabbed the audioguide, hoping to fill in gaps in our art & German history knowledge and began to tour the museum. The first issue we ran into was the navigation - the building is laid out in an",

          "There is not much to go and see in that it is just a crumbling old piece of stone. But, the fact that it still stands and the history that went on there makes it worth going and seeing. You can get an idea for how large and how many people would have gone. As it is so unusual it",

          "We walked around the lake from the Dokumentationszentrum following the map boards provided every few hundred yards. The Zeppelin Field is close to the end of the route and at 1st we thought it was fenced in but if you carry on to the end of the fence you can get in. You can",

          "The Nazi Party parade ground is now in dire need of finding an identity. Indeed, the City and perhaps the regional or national government need to decide what to do with all the sites and facilities in the area where Adolf Hitler and Albert Speer had planned for the future",

          "A little different to what it was like during WWII but you can really get the feel of what went on here. We decided to check out the Documentation Centre first and get the background info before heading out on the 10 minute walk to Zeppelinfeld. Most of the main structure still",

          "We visited with our guide Ruth Hapke who explains that the Zeppelinfeld was Hitler\u2019s \u201cNazi field of dreams\u201d that has now divided contemporary Germans over whether it should be preserved along with its history or be allowed to crumble. Six rallies were held here from 1933-1938.",
          "We had heard reports of this venue and were glad we went. It was fascinating and eerie that we were sta ding where Hitler gave his speeches to the masses. We had heard you could go up to the podium where Hitler spoke but it was' t available when we went. Perhaps because it",
          "When we drove through Nuremberg where I had booked a trip to a conference, we passed this place on the way from the airport to the exhibitions centre. From the back its architecture struck as odd and Nazi-like, and I decided later to look it up, only to find out it in fact WAS",
          "On my recent vacation, I made a day trip from Munich to Nuremberg. Upon reaching Nuremberg, I stopped by the visitor center near the train station, and told the attendant I was interested in seeing the rally grounds. She said something like, \"I don't know why you'd want to see",

          "We drove down the Rally Grounds where 100,000 voices marched to salute Adolf Hitler. Here you will also see the unfinished (replica) Roman Colosseum. He had his own little podium built within the structure for people to march past to salute him. This is history people do not",
          "My German friend brought me here. She explained that it is such a dark part of history the locals are afraid of talking up about preserving it for fear of being labelled. She is in favor of it being preserved and she is in her 70's and has some terrible memories of the war time.",
          "When you are standing on the starting grid of the Zeppelinfeld Road Race it is fascinating to think that thousands of Nazi soldiers had paraded along the same stretch of road in front of Adolf Hitler taking the salute at the 1930s Nazi Party Rally, and watched by thousands of",
          "I highly recommend a visit here on a trip to Nuremberg. It's an incredible structure, it's a shame so much of it was destroyed after the war because seeing it in its full glory would have been breathtaking. There are plenty of information signs in english and if you go to the",

          "I have seen this place so many times on WW II documentary's. Having spent over 20 years in the Army, I just had to see this place. Wow, what a place. It is in need of some maintenance, and while we were there it looks like they were starting on that. I hope so, this is a place",
          "Our family (children ages 10 and 12) visited the site on a very hot day, and found the site interesting and informative, if not terribly well preserved or well-kept. Signs indicate that the city is working to restore the site and add more visitor-information, which will be a",
          "We braved the Zeppelinfeld in rainy weather, but it was something I had to see for real. For many - and understandable - reasons the area has been left to crumble. In some ways it would be good to see it restored, but in others it may not be wise. It is an essential reminder",
          "We drove over to Zeppelin fields after visiting the documentation centre (although it is possible to walk it in about half an hour). as it was a half hour walk and we only had a day in Nuremburg. I don't think it's an absolute must do, but if you have time it's certainly worth",
          "Great location to learn more about WWIi, take the train out, this is very easy to do and walk around the site, you can stand where Hitler addressed the masses, just take in the size of the place, also make sure you go the near by document centre, the display there is excellent",
          "We visited on a very hot, humid day. We drove and parked up, for free, right by the Zeppelinfeld. It is in need of some TLC, which is planned, but this kind of added to the atmosphere. It was weird to imagine thehuge Nazi rallies taking place in this vast space.",
          "If you have any interest in WWII or history in general then this is a go to site if youre in Nuremberg. Its a strange feeling standing on the same place where Hitler once stood in his glory days. Its a bit of a shame that the city hasnt done more to preserve it and restore it",
          "To stand on the exact footsteps the \"F\u00fchrer\" stept... The feeling you get when imagining it all, is undiscribable!",
          "We wanted to visit because our father fought in the battle of Nuremberg. According to his letters and his stories, the battle was fiercely wretched and lasted several days. At one point, he and a buddy were pinned down in the middle of the river with sniper fire and artillery",
          "We visited this site as part of a tour during our Vantage River Cruise. Today the whole site is a memorial, and parts are used as the Norisring motor racing track, which had just had a race the weekend before we visited. It was very noisy because items used for the race were",
          "This is the Nazi party rally grounds. Everything is still intact, in fact you can see a faint outline of the swastika on the marble viewing stand where Hitler spoke to his followers. The area is still used for racing cars and outdoor rock concerts.",
          "Unless you have a real interest in WW2 this is not worth visiting. The impressiveness of it has been allowed to deteriorate over the years and the stadium is now used as a storage facility. You can still stand on the podium where Hitler addressed the troops but the immensity of",
          "We took a bus tour of The Zeppelinfeld which was the location where Hitler made annual speeches to huge crowds. We have seen newsreels of the speeches many times and it was interesting to see the place in person. It is possible to walk around the site if you have the time.",
          "This is where Hitler reviewed his troops and addressed his followers. Most of the film footage of the Nazi rallies was taken from here. You can walk all around the stadium and even stand on the exact steps. You must visit it if you are in Nuremburg. I recommend going there",
          "One of my favourite race circuits in the world, an unusual place to be racing around what with the WW2 connection to history which is worth looking at on its own (which we did 11 years ago) but this trip was all about the DTM. A great and well organised event getting up close to",
          "Fascinating historical site. The site make famous (notorious) by Hitler speaking for hours to 100 000s of people mesmerised by his words (rants) in a hypnotic frenzy of propaganda. The scale of the site is immense and the main gallery totally accessible, including the platform",
          "Visiting the Zeppelinfeld was part of the tour we took on the Nuremberg World War II Tour which addressed the rise and fall of the Nazi regime. The Zeppelin Field is the former Nazi Party Rally Grounds - huge concrete bleachers where Hitler addressed 100,000.",
          "I was here after having visited the Dokuzentrum, so still very impressed by everything I got to know there. And in this context, Zeppelin fied - and Zeppelin Tribune in particular - gives a very weird feeling. To be honest, standing on the Hitler's rostrum, from which he",
          "This vast concrete area is ringed with the mounds used as the zeppelin holding grounds. It has a huge set of concrete bleachers used as part of those huge rallies the Nazis held for propaganda in the early years. Now it serves as a rally ground for car and cycle racers. Easy",
          "This is the stadium in which the infamous Nazi Nuremberg Rallies took place. It is huge but the scale is lost because it has been broken up with parks and sports fields. To get a real sense of it you need to visit the D.R, and see the movie \"The Triumph Of the Will\" which filmed",
          "The sense of power - scale of display - mind's image from 'Triumph of the Will' - this set of concrete steps/podium fronting a barren field surrounded by towers is chilling in so many ways. Many may view this as a waste of time, little to see or lacking guide books and signage.",
          "Vast space to the south east of the city where the Nazis held their rallies. The scale is astonishing with 700,000 people fitting inside and many more lining the streets outside. Makes it difficult to accept the post-war argument of many Germans that they didn't know what was",
          "I was really looking forward to visiting this location. I am interested in the history and had seen this on many documentaries and news reels. However not much of the original remains and what is left was blighted by skateboarders and motorbikes. It's a shame that it's being",
          "Enormous area when you see where all four corners of the steps are. Just imagine the place in history that this square occupies.",
          "This is a must see in Dresden. There is a charm of such a beautiful town such as Dresden but when you see the areas where the Nazi's Rallied - Cold, Concrete, Faceless structures with no artistic beauty just functionality. Such a difference. Standing there in this area that once",
          "Well what can you say about a place that was the yearly gathering of Nazi Germany. Awesome and completely forbidding, what a place to stir the emotions. The sight is easily accessible by tram, train or bus, I took the train from central and it cost 12 euros for a family of four.",
          "After a visit to the Documentation centre we walked round outside to the Nazi Party Rally Grounds and down the Grande Strass, round the lake to Zeppellenfield. There was a weirdness to the sheer size of the Grande Strass and the history that has walked down it. To be able to",
          "The whole area is located somewhat outside of the city centre, but absolutely worth a trip. Although it opens the memories to the darkest part of German history, this is an absolutely incredible place. Especially if you are familiar with the history. Before going, it is well",
          "This is part of the 8 rally grounds which are spread out next to each other on 7 sq.kilometer, the first structure you will see is the Colosseum, Zeppelinfeld is located on the other side of the lake (15 min walk) or you can drive 3 minutes and park in front of it for free. Make",
          "If you have seen the old black & white films of the Nazi party rallies here in the 1930s, you cannot help but be chilled by this location.",
          "We walked all around the lake there and walked up the granite grandstand used by Hitler, very moving. It's well worth a visit, and they have info signs around the lake to discuss why the buildings are there and what Hitler had plans for that he didn't complete. We couldn't",
          "There is not a lot to see here, but there is a platform where Hitler stood and addressed the people, the building is derelict and the field a racing track, but you can imagine what it was like. It is worth a visit, it is just a short walk from the museum, to see a bit of German",
          "Had an afternoon in the documentation museum and then a walk around the grounds and spent an hour at the old rally centre. Good to do whilst there",
          "When I was looking at it on streetview I was not sure if you can actually get on the gallery where the audience of the nazi parades were sitting but you actually can, the object is open.You can stand at the exact place where Adolf Hitler did stand. It looks better than on many",
          "If you have an eye for nature and stuff like that i would say your going to like it, it was on the gps map as one of sights to see on the way to the castle",
          "This is where Hitler once held huge stadium rallies, a massive concrete edifice that can hold 100s of thousands of people...now used for expositions, fairs and concerts, I first came here in 1979 for an all-day rock concert featuring the Who, AC/DC, Cheap Trick, the Scorpions",
          "I loved being here and getting a sense of the spectacles that were held there. Not a surprise Nuremberg doesn't really know what to do with the big outdoor space that represents it's Nazi past - mostly a truck - park now.",
          "If you visit here you need your imagination..you need to think back to the 1930s to what it was like..to stand on the platform & look out..there are information boards scattered around..great place..well done Nuremberg because many a city would have ripped it all up and put",
          "This quiet unassuming place, so steeped in history inconceivable. Was surreal to walk around and let your mind wander. Informative plaques fill in the blanks and photographs transport you back in time and another lifetime ago.",
          "Anyone visiting Nuremburg should stop here. It isn't well maintained or dramatically displayed... but I consider that to be a plus. To be presented more elaborately would validate the evil of what it was... better to show it as a remnant of history's trash heap.",
          "We visited Zepplinfield as part of a tour with a local guide, who had an extensive knowledge of the history of Nuremberg and who provided an interesting commentary, Zepplinfeld and its stadiums and buildings are largely in disrepair now and debate continues over what to do",
          "Not somewhere you can go without having read a little about the history of the Zepplinfeld although there are some information boards around. The scale of the place only becomes apparent when you climb the steps and stand where the Nazi dignitaries would have stood. It has a",
          "Just drove through it on a tour and it was still quite moving to be in front of the dais where Hitler and his cronies spoke. Its broken up now and serves as soccer fields where the masses use to stand.",
          "So this is a great place to stop. Must know the history and if you have children explain prior to arrival. There is plenty of concrete to explore but not well taken care of. It was definitely a strange feeling though as we stood where Hitler gave his speeches. For the history",
          "There is not a lot to see here unless you are familiar with what you are going to see. Go with a tour and enjoy the experience a lot more.",
          "We had attending an FCN soccer match and I was stunned to see this was right next to the stadium. We came back the next day and I'm glad we did. The stadium is in disrepair, but you can get a sense of the scale of the crowds that were around in the Nazi rallies.",
          "You must go to zeppelinfeld if you are really interested in history. Otherwise, the place is a little disapointing. It is something like a \"non-place\", half a way between the past (a place for massive Nazi demonstrations) and the present (a parking for trucks and containers).",
          "Standing in the parade ground looking at the grandstands was eerie. Our tour guide had photos of massive Nazi rallies and we could see where we were standing. An important historical location. You can look across the lake and see Congress Hall. Scary",
          "Although now being used by FC Nurnburg and mostly for sporting reasons, the steps and podium can be climbed to stand and see where armies would've been addressed, mad to think 150,000 people used to stand there!",
          "Going through the Dokumenzentrum before any of the Rally Grounds sites is highly advisable so you can appreciate the full import and the history of all the individual sites. You can stand at the Pergamon altar, and also at the vantage point where Hitler used to address the",
          "Take just a short stroll from the Dokumentations Zentrum Museum to see where Hilter held his Nazi parades and rallies. Let us not forget - let us prevent such a madman from rising to power ever again. This area consists of stadium bleachers and a long straight road for the",
          "Currently the area is basically a large open space with the remains of the large concrete viewing platform at one end. All the same it is a chilling reminder go the huge Nazi rallies that once took place here. It is certainly worth while researching its history. The sad thing is",
          "It is in disrepair and I'd say it's all the more chilling because of that, but well worth visiting to see what the maniac Hitler was trying to do before he ended up destroying his own country.",
          "This site, like many in Nuremberg, is not restored nor fully preserved. That said, you have to go and stand in front of the reviewing stand to understand the size of the structure and it's place in history. If you have an imagination and can look around to see in your mind how",
          "The expanse! It is hard to imagine the noise and hype of having tens of thousands of dedicated soldiers ooccupying this area!",
          "This was an interesting place to visit- the site of the Nazi gatherings. Its hard to imagine as so much is gone. The guide tried to make a case that the Nazis had been fascinating to people but it was hard to get excited- rather it was depressing that they were able to whip up",
          "This place is a must to see when in the Nuremburg area.The size of the place is impressive when you imagine what it would have been like in its prime with Hitler shouting to his troops. The place is very run down as no money is being put into it.Glad I visited if only for the",
          "Most of the main structure has been taken down and it is in a bit of disrepair - weeds. There is a road through it and car parking. This does take away from appreciating the magnitude of the place and what it must have been like to be there in the 1930's. However it is still",
          "You can absolutely feel the history once stepping on the upper fa\u00e7ade of the parade grounds. I wish they would have upkept the area more, but I understand why it is closed off and somewhat degrading. however, it is a must see for any historian!",
          "We saw a few sites in Nuremberg reacted to the days of the rise to power of the Nazi Party. This one showed the power of architectural intimidation. Designed to impress, you could see why it would. Shiver!!! Worth visiting, to remember, and make sure it doesn't happen again.",
          "We visited this place as we wanted to see where history had happened and you really get the feel of it despite the car park and the playing fields that now fill it. You can climb right up the grandstand even though it is decaying. Get there by S Ban to Frankenstadion or U Bahn",
          "This is the place where Hitler held his rally campaign before the 2nd World War. There's a picture of one of the rallies and of a Zeplin. Whilst standing in front of the stand, you can just imagine thousands of Hitler followers there. The original toilet blocks are still there.",
          "We walked from the document center. It was quite a walk without much to see on the way. Still, I was happy to witness where the history happened.",
          "Many people told us this place was in disrepair and not to go. We decided to go anyway and were very glad we went. Don't miss seeing this historic venue. It brings to life the power Hitler held over the people. Standing in the place wher Hitler delivered many speeches , will",
          "A place where your history books come to life. A great point of interest for history buffs, but only requires a quick 30 minutes or so. I was able to go on a weekday when there were no conversations to overhear (thank god) and I could really take a few moments to wrap my head",
          "The visit really gives perspective to how extreme and controlling Hitler and his regime were. Go soon as the repair and maintenance of this venue is contested and unresolved so may not be available much longer.",
          "Our tour guide told us the Germans are still debating as to whether or not to preserve this area or tear it down. I for one believe it should be preserved so that generations in the future never forget the horrors that once existed. Therefore I believe this is a must see when",
          "Definitely visit Zepplinfield. There is a complete transformation from what this once was and symbolized during Hitler's reign to today. You are able to stand on the same podium where Hitler address the Nazi, and see the remains of the grandstands and the field itself. Standing",
          "Read lots on line about a visit to this historical site. Not much left but ruins but incredible to see and think of the power that Hitler held at that time. Visit Congress Hall before walking across the other side of the lake to see the ruins of Zeppelinfield.",
          "Definitely make the time for this when you go to the documentation center. You walk about 3/4 a mile through a busy park that got taken over by the Nazis and has been taken back by the locals who walk, bicycle and boat on the lake. The grounds are enormous and chilling when",
          "I took a bike tour of the area in a very sunny day and got very impressed about the size of the field. Climbing to the podium gave me a weird feeling, knowing who stood there and everything that happened during that time.... If you interested in WWII history, this as well as",
          "The sheer size of this place is something to behold. The grandstand is in a state of decay and the pillars that used to stand here were destroyed for safety reasons but the podium and the surrounding area still remain intact. You can stand on the very spot where Hitler gave many",
          "We still can't believe what went on there in the masses, wholly, wow the shear size of this place and the stories told behind it ,puts a lot of what Hitler did into reality, not that we didn't believe before ,and to see the pictures of truth ,unbelievable! .",
          "You need a guide or information before you visit this site.....that is my recommendation anyway. Otherwise you cannot really get a feel for the amazing history that surrounds this place. It really is the starting point of the Nazi's and the place where Hitler won rounds his",
          "A majestetic, but also chilling stadium, where Hitler and the nazis had parades and speeches. The grounds are enourmous, and it feels like they go on forever. Looks bigger in real life than it does in photos, and is really worth a visit.",
          "This location is where Hitler and the Nazis held their annual rallies. It was originally designed by Albert Speer, and could accommodate up to fifty thousand spectators and up to one hundred and fifty thousand on the parade grounds. There is still part of the grand stands,",
          "The size of the parade grounds is enormous. It is amazing to imagine that this field was filled with hundreds of thousands of people attending a rally lead by AH. It is an eerie feeling to be in this place.",
          "Must be seen with a guide. Must imagine the NAZI marching groups consuming the field, the bands, the exhibitions of power Hitler showed to his people; need the help of a good guide, like Kevin.",
          "A very interesting site. The main layout is still the same although obviously the huge Swastika was blown up after the war, it is still possible to stand on the main podium.",
          "Zeppelinfeld is where all the rallies took place that helped Hitler win over the hearts of the German people - He inched his way taking more power with each speech. Inches quickly multiplied into miles as it was thru these rallies that he became a dictator and a want to be world",
          "We were surprised to see the number of groups/tours walking this off the beaten path attraction. The scale of the stadium was remarkable and one can only imagine this in it's prime.",
          "The Zeppelin Grandstand and parade ground were used by Hitler during the annual Nazi Rallies to view his military marching by. Thousands of spectators found seats on this grandstand as well as on the Zeppelin Field, the size of many football fields, in order to also view the",
          "I stood on the dais where Hitler addressed the faithful prior to WW2 at these Nazi rally grounds and experienced a chilling feeling. I tried to understand the insanity that was unleashed by this psychopath at this very spot. It's a very foreboding place in spite of some parts of",
          "We went to the documentation museum and were very interested to see the Zeppelinfeld. Unfortunately a lot of the area was closed off as they were preparing for a 'Rock I'm park' concert. We did however manage to see the area where Hitler delivered his speeches to the masses.",
          "We visited the Zeppelin field on a recent trip; so named because Count Zeppelin landed his dirigible there in 1909. This preserved field and stands is where Hitler spoke to huge crowds at the Nazi party rallies from 1933 to 1938. You will recognize the place from newsreels of",
          "The sheer size of this stadium is amazing, when you consider it was built for the 1936 Olympics, long before the sporting event became commercialised. Hitler found lavish events in this arena a way to attract people to his cause with yearly, and changing \"entertainment\". Today",
          "This place serves as a reminder to all that war and taking/occupying other countries is wrong. Hitler exploited the Hollywood / Roman Emperors theatrics here when he preached to the masses from his dominant position. What is left is a historical marker to remind us!",
          "This was a breathtaking stop but not in a positive way. It was incredulous to believe the numbers that could come to these rallies and actually stand on the same spot Hitler spoke. Also this is where I have seen on TV where the large Nazi stadium emblem was blown up.",
          "I didn't really know how I'd feel coming to this place. Yes, Hitler addressed the masses here to great adulation but today it merely hearkens to a past that many want to just go away. With imagination you can guess at the spectacle provided and the large doors behind the podium",
          "I had mixed feelings about standing on the Zeppelinfeld due to the association with the rise and horror of the Nazi regime. The Third Reich held huge conventions and sinister mass rallies here from 1927. After Hitlers rise to power in 1933 over 100000 people would stand on this",
          "As part of a visit to the Nazi Rally Grounds this is a must-see part of your walk around the lake. This is the place you will know from the old b/w footage of the Nazi rallies and the podium where Hitler stood is still there. Unfortunately many years ago the long rows of pillars",
          "After visiting the documentation centre museum, walked around the lake to Zeppelin field, to the place which is synonymous with the fanaticism and horror of Nazi Germany. If the hair on your neck doesn't stand up at some point while you're here, clearly reading history is not",
          "The sheer scale of this location is amazing, its a bit of a walk from the documentation center, but worth the view, there are signs that give you an indication of the scope they used this location for. It is also a nice place to relax and just enjoy life and the world.",
          "I visited as part of a trip to Nuremburg. I did it at the end of a walk around the area. Still very well preserved and very chilling to stand there. Still a great view and vast site to soak and you can feel the evil which was preached on the site",
          "We walked to Zepplin field after visiting the Documentaion Center. It was a bit of a walk and a day with some light showers, however it was well worth it. To stand in the exact spot where Hitler made his speeches is anchilling, but worthwhile worth while experience. We were a",
          "I did visit to Dokuzentrum a few days ago. But that day I could not visit here. I was conducted by German friend. He taught me a lots history of Nazi. Here is so impressed area. Why was this architected ? Who did build? How many people? I did think something.",
          "If you have ever seen any of the old newsreels of Hitler speaking to masses of people - then you have seen the Zepplinfield and parade grounds. Here you can walk up the steps and step on the exact spot where Hitler stood to make these speeches. Now the grounds are deteriorated",
          "This spot probably would not have been so significant if I we didn't have our awesome tour guide (in English) Kevin. Learned alot!",
          "I have visited this place a couple of times, and struggle to comprehend what it would have been like during the start of 1945 before parts of it were blown up/torn down. From what is left of it, though starting to become overgrown and the inside is unsafe for visitors, I feel a",
          "I've been to the Zeppelinfield many times and I am always amazed. Unfortunately you can not access the inside, but the outside views are spectacular.",
          "You need not spend much time here to really get the feel for what happened here. It's important to imagine how Hitler held rallies here.",
          "You can stand exactly where Hitler delivered his speeches to the masses, we sat up on the steps for a long time just thinking of the sheer evil that has come from this place... We went on a very cold, foggy day so it definitely created a more eerie vibe. Theres signs around the",
          "The site of Hitler's biggest and greatest rallies is open to the public but as an 'enter at your own risk' location. There is ample parking and a few informational signs, but overall, this location has been left to decay. It was worth the stop to take a moment to reflect on",
          "Quick stop on the tour. The guide pointed out the zeppelin landing site and explained where the pilons were located. It was interesting but more interesting was the reviewing stand next door which was recognizable from WW II movies. Seeing that was chilling.",
          "A place hard to forget. You can still feel the atmosphere when Adolf Hitler delivered his speeches. A must if you are in Nuremberg.",
          "The place is part of the large complex of buildings designed and partially built for the Nazi party rallies. The tribune of the Zeppelin Field is the most prominent part of it, and you can see it in many photos and vids of the time, with Hitler shouting from the balcony which is",
          "Make sure you visit the near by museum before you go to the Zeppelin fields because the museum has actual footage of the thousands of Nazis listening to Hitler speeches. The area is very creepy but definitely worth the visit.",
          "I knew of the Zeppelinfeld from having seen Leni Riefenstahl's ode to Hitler, \"Triumph of the Will\" (available on Youtube). The field is not well-marked and when I got to it there was a crew setting up in the field for what appeared to be a concert. The grounds are used for",
          "Really loved it. To contemplate the importance of this monument to war-time German citizens in an era gone by, as well as its symbolism for both good and bad parts of history, and be able to stand where history was made. The field has historical connections to the Zeppelin",
          "Chilling to stand where so much terror and horror had its inception. Despite the passage of time, there was a lingering atmosphere of the power and control that emanated from here. Massive Nazi rally's led by Hitler, atop the massive dais of concrete steps, overlooks the",
          "It was unbelievable to stand where all the big Nazi rallies took place. It's too bad that part of the structure (the columns on either side) had to be demolished as the were unsafe.",
          "Quite outside the city, you will need a car to reach Zeppelinfield. There are no street indicators so I had to find it on my GPS POI.",
          "Although lots of roadblocks and a rainy day it was a must do and see to climb the slippery, steep steps to the top and stand on dais. A place in history, a point of impending terror and tragedy that would lead to the deaths of millions of people. Our tour, I use the term very",
          "The stands and podium are still there overlooking the field and surrounding seating. The field has been repurposed for other events now such as car races. If you've seen films with the Nazi Party rallies, you have probably seen this field. It is near the colosseum that Hitler",
          "We visit this as part of a Segway tour. As with most things \"Nazi\" in Nuremberg, it has fallen in to disrepair. It is understandable because the Germans don't want to glorify the Nazis; yet the history is important. If you come to this site without the proper background or",
          "Everyone visiting Nuremberg want to visit and feel the power that was championed at the Nazis rallies. People want to see the original to understand the awe that was felt here in its heyday. Unfortunately that can't happen as it is just overgrown waste land with a few builders",
          "Can't imagine this place was such a great place back in Nazi ruling by hitler ! Nothing great to see unless you visited the museum of the Nazi party rally which would tell you more about this marching ground ! Worth to see after the 3 hours visit to museum !",
          "This is the arena where Adolf Hitler delivered speeches to the party members. As we drove in I wondered if we had arrived at the right place. I expected to be able to climb the steps, stand where Hitler stood and look down. Unfortunately the steps are fenced off, the whole area",
          "This is the area where Hitler delivered most of his speeches to the masses. When you realize where you are and the scale of this field a flood of pictures from history books and news reels come to mind. Lucky to have visited.",
          "This over grown and over fenced site could be mistaken for a demolition site. And if not for the whole Nazi fascination, it could have been demolished long ago. No one talked about how it came to be named Zepellin Field...that is a story I'd like to hear.",
          "The real name of this is Zeppelin Field and I would have rather heard about that story than hearing how Hitler suckered millions of Good Germans into doing bad things. The site is heavily fenced and used as a parking area for construction equipment. Watch Leni Reifinstahl's",
          "It's good they didn't demolish the structure so that future generations may learn a lesson. There was power here. But used in an awful manner.",
          "Not sure what I was going to see, but on arrival instantly recognised that this place was the history grounds of the Third Reich from past films. Standing where Hitler would have stood in front of thousands of followers in the vast grounds, made one think and try and visualise.",
          "This is a free place to visit, it was here that hitler mesmerized his crazies with his insane diatribes and propaganda. You can stand where he spoke from (now thankfully crumbling into the ash heap of history..though maintained just enough that this is never forgotten). It is",
          "Having seen the footage of Hitler standing on the steps at Nuremberg, didn't really prepare one for the magnitude of the place or the pure evil creepy feel. Knowing what happened later it still wasn't hard to be swept up and feel the euphoric emotion of a nation supposedly",
          "Impressive even though a lot of the towers and structure has been taken down. There is a feeling of being at a rally if you let your imagination go a bit. Worth a look!!",
          "I'll admit it - I saw the Zeppelinfeld as part of a tour through Viking River Cruises, and I had no idea what I was going to see. But then we reached the field, I turned to see the grandstand, and I realized I was in the place where so many photos of Nazi Germany had been",
          "Its not much at first but if you walk the ground and stand on the step its an impressive site. Imaginge how it must have looked during the war?",
          "The size is just amazing, and the history of what happened her is just as amazing. it is almost too big to walk around unless you have a nice weather day and good walking shoes.",
          "How can one rate a place of such shadows 'excellent'? The experience - ideally in gloomy overcast and drizzle - is startling, depressing, enlightening. To stand where the monster stood. To look out upon the nazi firebrand bearing shades goosestepping their way across now turned",
          "If you've watched \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" (Spencer Tracy), old WW II documentaries or Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda films, you might want to see the real thing once in your life. Most of it has been demolished after May 1945, but there is still some left. It feels eery to walk",
          "After seeing the documentaries of the rallies and Hitler's speeches that he delivered there I had to see this site. Its chilling to think about the large number of people that gathered here and were inspired by Hitler's speeches. Don't miss going to this field.",
          "After viewing the films of the Nazi rallies on television numerous times I could not leave Nurnberg without seeing the Nazi Party Rally Grounds. It was an chilling experience to stand where Hitler stood and try to imagine what took place there 75-80 years ago. Historical site",
          "I went to the nearby Documentation Museum first. But this is a required stop even if you are just passing through the area. I am pretty sure everyone in the 1st world and then some has seen pictures / video of Hitler making speeches and standing on a podium reviewing fields of",
          "It's a bit of a hike out and back from the Docuzentrum, but definitely worth it. Although the reviewing stand now overlooks a parking lot, the location alone is a reminder of the immensity of the crowds swayed by Hitler. Of course, it didn't hurt the mood that there was a soccer",
          "The Zeppelinfield is part of the the Nazi Party Rally Grounds. Today the area serves two purposes, a reminder of what happened during WWII and a look towards the future. The buildings have primarily been neglected since WWII and the area is a reminder of the atrocities that",
          "We finally found this during a visit to the Documentation Center (kinda got lost going around the lake). It's definitely in need of some maintenance. I was a little worried about climbing up, but it something you have to do. It's hard to picture it as it is shown in the old",
          "The Zeppelinfield is a decaying huge grandstand where Hitler viewed the thousands of troops that filled it in the 1930's. A lot of the structure was blown up straight after the war and in the 1960's for safety reasons and what is left is still massive!",
          "We visited the Zeppelin Field as part of a World War II tour of Nuremberg arranged by our River Cruise company. It was our first stop and it was useful to have a tour guide. It is a ruin of it's former self having been neglected for many years. Much if not all of the Nazi",
          "So this is better known as Hitler's Podium and in 1985 on my first visit there it was not marked, one couldn't find it and NO helped with directions including the Polizia who I asked. In 2014 they are now dealing with the horrors better. One must go and stand on that podium and",
          "Our Nuremberg WW2 Tour took us to a trio of unmissable attractions: the Zeppelin Field, the Documentation Centre Museum and the Nuremberg Trial Courtroom 600. It is best to do all three in sequence, starting with the Zeppelin Field from whose tribune Hitler spoke to the party",
          "This attraction, like others in the area and only interesting from an historical perspective. We are far enough removed from WWII that this and other sites are coupled only with old photographs.",
          "When you walk through the wonderful parkland and past the lake, it is worth remembering the key role this place held in the shaping of the 20th century. Truly a monument to the folly of man",
          "I would give this a 5 based on the historical significance of where you stand when you visit, but it is a bit of a trek off the beaten path if you are traveling by train/public transportation. The grounds are poorly kept as well, but it is still worth experiencing. I stood on",
          "We were baked when we payed this structure a visit. It was incredibly hot, so don't go there when it's more than 30 degrees. Anyways, the structure is massive and impressive. It's a very strange thought to be on the same stand and spot as the man who brought Europe dark years. I",
          "It really must be seen for it's historical context and not what it looks like now. I completely understand why the city of Nuremburg would like it to be something else and is not keen to spend money on the upkeep. I quite 'like' the idea that it is being used as a race car",
          "Ok so this place is going to rack and ruin. The city and its residents are understandably reluctant to deal with its future. However, it's an absolute must for a visit. Still very chilling to this day. A real reminder of what happened here all those years ago.",
          "Germans would prefer not to acknowledge Hitler or the Nazi violence ever occurred. Zeppelinfield has been named a historic site. Nonetheless, it is not taken care of. Many parts shown in historic pictures are no longer there - removed due to safety risks?",
          "It is quite interesting learning about the history of that place and on top of that you get the chance to actually go to the podium where Hitler was giving his speeches. If you speak, you can realise that this exact podium was positioned exactly where it was supposed to be, so",
          "...on how and where the big parades of Parteitage took place. The stairs are the same as well as the point from which Hitler addressed to the troops and people. In other words, an imponent piece of history.",
          "Walk to see this when you have been to the documentation centre. It's the parade ground used by the nazi party. It now appears to be part of the race track as the area is used for recreation Worth seeing to put into perspective the size of the rallies held by hitler",
          "Our guide was a youngish German woman who was very serious (perhaps because of her topic) but engaging and informative. We stopped first at the Zeppelin Field, the site of big Nazi rallies. It's all in ruins now, but our guide had black-and-white pictures of the site in its",
          "I've seen the historical documentaries showing this field and buildings, but there is nothing like seeing it in person. It was easy to stand at the top of the stadium where Hitler entered and gave his speeches to thousands and imagine the crowds. I was shocked at the amount of",
          "Of course this is a great historical site, this is where the national socialists held their rallies during their reign in the 30s and 40s. I think what astounded me the most was the condition it was in and what had become of it. I was there in 05. the grandstand was",
          "Standing in this famous field is quite amazing and really brings home the sheer scale of the Nazi regime. Having seen the famous film footage of the Hitler speeches to the massed ranks of Nazis it was rather spooky to be stood in the same spot.",
          "We had an excellent passionate young German guide who brought this dreadful place alive. And also explained how today's young people are obliged to learn about the past as part of their curriculum and as a warning. All people of a certain age will have seen Adolf Hitler",
          "The Zeppelinfeld is a historic gathering ground, once used for the launch of the famous Zeppelin aircraft. It was also a popular gathering place where Hitler would address the German youth in the run-up to the second world war. Now somewhat derelict, it is still an",
          "I have photographs and videos of this place many times. I never thought I would be standing at such a historical site. It is amazing and disturbing at the same time. Our guide did an amazing job describing some of the events that occurred here. It is in a somewhat state of",
          "We wanted to walk around the lake and Zepplinfeld was on the other side of the lake. There is not much left of what used to be Zepplinfeld, mostly large concrete structures that look like a stadium might look after decades of neglect and misuse. Graffiti on the concrete and",
          "standing heer in the actual spot where all of the rallies were held and that hitler rallied his forces is amazing. IT is in a state of neglect. But good that the public can utilise the area for recreational purposes. Great to actually experience",
          "Please do not go here unless you have a real interest in World War II. This is the remains of the great stadium where the Nazis held their annual meetings, the stadium of light. It is chilling to think of the people that stood looking down on the massed followers of this",
          "This site, home of the Nazi Party rallies and an enormous amount of history requires some imagination to picture how it was in the days of the rallies that made it famous. It is perhaps somewhat of a shame that it has been left to crumble and be vandalised in the way that it",
          "After having seen this place so many times on television documentaries it was a thrill to actually go there. No admission fee either! Yes, I stood where Hitler stood when he gave his speeches. The place is so big that it would cost a fortune to try to remove it, so the locals",
          "The Nuremburg authorities clearly find this crumbling edifice a bit of an embarrassment, as they are simply letting it crumble away. The pillars at the back are long gone and weeds now sprout from the terraced steps. Despite this municipal neglect, what remains is still a",
          "What was once the place where everyone who was anyone wanted to be seen every September, now sits in ruins in Nuremberg, Germany. Just like the Nazi regime itself, Zepplinfeld was a facade built in haste but never meant to last.",

          "In this place the Nazy used to show their power to the nation, with huge military parades. It's very well maintened, next to the Dokumentation Zentrum. The visit is worth for it's historical value, but there is really not much to see besides how big it was, and imagine all the",
          "Built to showcase a 1,000 Third Reich, the cracks were already visible shortly after it opened in 1936 & today it displays both Albert Speer's vision & the poor quality of some Nazi construction. The National Socialists first began having rallies here in 1933, when Speer",
          "Sadly defaced by both grafitti and attempts to erase it from history. However it remains a powerful edifice.",
          "If you've seen Reifenstahl's \"Triumph of the Will\" or any of the archival films of Hitler addressing those huge torchlit rallies of Nazi party faithful -- this is the place. You can actually stand where he did and try to imagine the feeling of mass devil worship. Well worth a",
          "A must see when in Nuremberg if you are interested in history. The area is in a ruined stage now and not likely to be restored. The sheer size of it amazed me although I have seen old newsreel footage of it. When you visit the museum you will come across it first.",
          "The zeppelinfeld area is a large area which was not fully completed the way 'der fuhrer' wanted to finish it. The large bleachers were completed to have his troops watch as they paraded by. I believe his intent was to have a bridge across the lake to join the colosseum and",
          "I visited for this years 'Rock im Park'. Even as it was set up for the festival, it was still an impressive site and a grim reminder of a dark part of European history. Well worth a visit if you are in the area.",
          "We visited as part of a city tour when we were on a river cruise. It's chilling when you think what went on here all those years ago when it was used as the nazi rally grounds. The stadium part is now weathered and worn down. If you are in the area it might be worth visiting but",
          "We took a trip here on a day visit from Munich. Again, all you can do is imagine what it would've looked like all those years ago. There's not a lot left of it, though what is left is nice, it's suffered through the years. The main field is now a sports field. If you walk right",
          "If you go to the Dokument museum (and I recommend you do), it can be interesting to walk around here, too, on a nice day...but I wouldn't come across town just for this. Main grandstand is interesting to walk up and along but don't walk around the whole thing as it's gated off,",
          "As part of a riverboat cruise, my wife & I toured briefly on Sunday 5/4. The sheer scope of Zeppelinfeld was impressive, but even with a guide & narration there was not much to see & understand. However, later that same day, with visits to other parts of the Nazi rally grounds",
          "The Zeppenfeld is an impressive and substantive ground where some of the most notorious Nazi party rallies were held. The Zeppenfeld was the only completed Nazi structure of a grander vision. But get perspective from a guide or the nearby museum beforehand and during for a",

          "we did this as part of a guided ww2 tour from our cruise and had a fantastic guide that made the experiance worth while , with out his input this would just have been an old concrete grandstand.",
          "We came here with a group. I was taken aback of the size. Believe it or not, I thought it was actually bigger than what I saw. Standing in the same places as the high Nazi party officials and knowing what had gone on there was a little hard to behold. It is in great",
          "We did not get to go in and actually be in the Zeppelinfeld, it was blocked off for renovation and they are also setting up for some kind of event. But seeing it was impressive, to imagine what took place there. To see pictures and actually be there was surreal. Well worth the",
          "Probably the most iconic site on the Nazi party rally grounds, Zeppelinfeld is about a ten minute walk from the Congress Hall. I visited once with a tour guide and then walked the ground alone two days later on a return visit. Somewhat appropriately lying in a dilapidated",
          "A place that you can feel the history and not all of it good. The city of Nuremberg did not really know what to do with it so just left it for many years. Have been twice - the first time it was quite and a bit eerie They have not really repaired anything. Although on this",
          "Unfortunately, it became too costly to maintain the pillars of the structure, so they were destroyed. It is now a ruins, but gives a great prospective of the grand nature of the parade grounds",
          "I was surprised to see in my mind the film of Hitler ranting and raving so much from the area fenced in on this historic Zeppelinfeld. It was difficult to control my emotion as the thought of the Nazis invasion of Europe and the terrible things they did in the name of 'war'.",
          "As others have said, there is little remaining but standing on the grandstand podium you just need a little imagination to feel what it would have been like filled with 200,000 people. A decaying symbol of a very sad part of history.",
          "The Zeppelin Field is worth a visit. It's neglected but walking there, reading the dings along the way gives you an understanding of the whole area. Standing on the podium you the understand the intention of it all. The lake area is a nice walk. Easy tram ride to area from old",
          "visited april 14...its such a shame that so little remains because it really must have been some sight in its heyday",
          "The Zeppelinfled is one of the ruins of the Nazi Party Rally Grounds. This was the only site of this immense building project that was actually completed (this, and the Luitpold Arena grandstands). Hitler reviewed Nazi groups such as the Hitler Youth, Labor Service, and",
          "Intensely evocative of the huge party rallies once held there, and instantly recognisable from Riefenstahl's film, of all the Nazi-era sites in Nuremberg this is the most eloquent - all the more so for the neglect and gradual decay of the ruins today. Like the glory that was",
          "The Zeppelinfeld is where the massive Nazi Party rallies were held in the 1930s. Although much of the Grandstand building has now been demolished it is still possible to stand where Hitler and other Nazi leaders addressed up to 200,000 adoring supporters. The scale of the"

          "This is a tourist must, and it shows because there are a lot of people. Yet the Fachwerkhaus part is high enough up to take photos without getting too many strangers in your photo. However, my suggestion would be to come early in the morning before anyone else.",
          "As we walked part of our walking tour, we walked this charming street with charming timber framed houses which unbelievably survived the bombing of WWII. You find some shops, cafes, and an ice cream parlour... quite charming.",
          "Charming short street with timber frame houses, some of which survived Allied bombing. Highlights include the coffee shop near the beginning and ice cream shop near the end!",
          "It's a few houses, but they are cute and really one of the only parts of the city that wasn't bombed in WWII. If going from east to west, it ends right by the oldest chain bridge on the continent (1824) and a beer garden.",
          "Picturesque old wooden bridge with good views of the old buildings around it. Ok for wheelchairs/disabled.",
          "After seeing it on the internet and TripAdvisor as a must-see, we went to have a look. The street with the part where you can see the historical houses is actually very very short. It's just a couple of houses. You can see them here and there in other parts of the old town as",
          "Lovely road with loads of history although I can imagine it was destroyed during the bombings. Get the horse drawn carriage. looks very authentic",
          "One can see some old wooden houses which are multicoloured and well preserved. A street worth walking through. It is in the very centre of Nuremberg.",
          "Visited with a walking tour and enjoyed it a lot. Beautiful buildings and it is a gem that must be seen. The well maintained buildings and the overall state of the street is so good and accessible that it is a must visit.",
          "Nice and silent, colourful too. Not too long. Very near to main market square so a short walk could be good to hear",
          "Take time to see the street of old half timber architecture that is captivating in its structure and colors. A great place to walk and take in the local scene. A perfect place for the photographer to get a lovely shot.",
          "Charming street in the old town of Nuremberg! Typical houses , cobbled street, little eateries lining the street makes this gem a place worth to make a detour to see it.",
          "Picturesque street in the Old Town with good examples of period properties - mostly renovated/ restored after WW2. Bit of a tourist magnet for some reason- nothing to do but walk it really.",
          "What a nice way to spend half an hour on a sunny afternoon! This street is just a nice place to walk on your way through the city center. Beautiful buildings; lots of opportunities for selfies!",
          "This is an absolute beautiful, colorful, and historic street to walk down and see. Bring a camera and take pictures!",
          "This is a lovely street to take a stroll. Great architecture on both sides of the street. You will spend a lot of time looking upwards!",
          "Wow. This street is so historical lined with immaculate architecture that I just sat and viewed the detailed homes for a while.",
          "Walking through this area of Nuremberg provides one with examples of old architecture as well as with a number of photo opportunities. It is free, easily accessible, and worth a few minutes of one's time.",
          "Picture perfect street in the middle of old town with shopping and cafes. It is hard to walk as you are looking up at all the beautiful old buildings.",
          "Located directly inside the Halletor (Gate), is the largest collection of half-timber structures in Nuremburg. The name comes from the tanners who lived on this street during the Middle Ages. Stand where the street meets Maxpaltz for an excellent photo. (Like the one here.)",
          "Just to look at. Quaint, nice, but not much to do otherwise. Good for photo-opsbut easily walked through within minutes.",
          "A pearl in the middle of this old town, colorful buildings in the half timbered style... try to get lost in the middle of this German scenario...",
          "We enjoyed our walk around the old town and included this street in it. It's a beautiful street where locals go about their everyday business. It's not much more than this and a photo opportunity but I suppose it's all we expected.",
          "Visited this street as listed in most tourist guides a must see, but was hugely underwhelmed. Some lovely houses, but nothing particularly special to make this stand out.",
          "I was there during the Fischtage Festival, and it was delightful! We had fried fish, watched a bunch of tiny old German men sing English sailor songs, and ate candied nuts. It was simply glorious and there were things for the children to do. So much good food and fun things!",
          "Just about every tourist guide identifies this street as a must-see destination. But what a disappointment! The street is surprisingly short, it does not comprise entirely (or mostly) of half-timbered structures. There are plenty other German cities that can legitimately",
          "Very picturesque street - Bavarian houses/buildings with the snow. It was a short cut from the Castle to the River.",
          "One of those quaint places like Nyhavn in Copenhagen that you must see, but apart from the fascinating houses there is nothing to keep you. Perhaps best to make sure you pass through it on your way to the castle or Albrech Durer's house",
          "This curving, lovely, cobbled street is lined by colorful half-timbered houses, which make it look as though it was taken from a fairy tale. It is highly recommended to walk through it.",
          "Not far from one of the main 3 churches so easy to find. Even on a rainy day it was very pretty, lovely colourful houses - some shops too but these were closed as we visited later in the evening. Worth seeing while wandering around.",
          "Amazing architecture and stunning little street. The street was very colorful and the houses were very nice decorated. It was at a 5 minute walk from the Hauptmarkt. The street wasn't very long.",
          "We walked up this lovely little street with half timbered houses when we walked from the train station, through the old town, up to the castle. There's not a lot to do here as such, but it's a nice place to stroll past and take photos.",
          "This street is the most beautiful one in Nuremberg, you can take lovely pictures or just have a very nice walk",
          "The Weissgerbergasse pictures are clever, I went down this street thinking it would be a long stretch of typical Germanic houses, but it's not the case! What you see in the picture, is what you get. Don't get me wrong, it's a lovely street, but lower your expectations if you",
          "Typical houses , such a calm street during the day , nearly no one was on the street so this is the best thing for photographers, take as much photos as you can . It is a short street as I discovered, so it will take you 10 min max to discover it",
          "Smaller than expected a lot of people really do rave about this we really liked it just expected more",
          "Picture perfect place. Go early to avoid the crowds! It's easy to walk from the Altstadt and there are many shops and cafes lining the street.",
          "Based on the reviews I\u00b4ve read I went to see this street, only to find few houses, during a 5 minute walk. Nice to see, but don\u00b4t expect too much.",
          "What is today a scenic walk through sanitized history was probably one of the smelliest sections of a very smelly city. These houses were the living quarters and work places of the tanners who produced light colored leather. (The Rotgerber produced dark leather.) If you have",
          "Beautiful street in Nuremburg! nice architecture and cute houses and in quite area. Good spot for photos and have a walk.",
          "The facades and architectures are excellent. A great view of medieval buildings with shopping and cafes. Worth the walking.",
          "A major photographed street in Nuremburg with the cute half-timbered houses. It is quiet and easy to get a shot with no one in it. It is not far from the castle. If you are on the opposite side of the old city, it will take you about 20 minutes to walk to. It will only take",
          "After the crush of the castle and of the Market Square , this quaint old city street was welcome for my frazzled nerves. The street is lined with old houses, many still residences while only a few are now businesses. It is a great photo op for anyone that loves old architecture.",
          "Very beautiful old-style street,with some(not too many...) interesting,colorful buildings.It's a short street,no longer than 250m so you don't need more than 15 minutes to see it.",
          "This street is lovely to walk down and not hard to find \u2013 it was right on our tourist map from our hotel. Walk along the city wall from the Albrecht Durer house and the street will come up on your left after while. It\u2019s only a few houses but they are worth seeing and",
          "Leads downtown between the museum and the Schranke. FeTures rows of charming old artisan houses both of stone and timbering and decorated with altar niches and bay windows. Has views of the city's fortifications at the end of the lane and from Maxplatz. Crosses into the River",

          "Weissgerbergasse is worth visiting in order to take pictures of the colourful buildings and to see the architecture. It's also nice to know that its one of the streets that survived the war. Just go and have a look.",
          "This area is quite pretty with all the different colored buildings. We took a lot of pictures and sat at one of the cafes along the way.",
          "Quite a walk across town from Hauptbahnhof to see this and to be honest - not worth the effort. Apparently it comes to life in an evening when the bars open, have to say from what we saw in the daytime there wasn't much to come to life! Walk this way if in the area visiting",
          "Great street once found. A few shops, one restaurant, great old buildings. Don't think I'd go out of my way to find.",
          "Beautiful, small Street on the side of the main attractions and not on the way. But it's worth the detour if you are a photo enthusiast.",
          "A nice area to wander while visiting the city. interesting shops and a few restaurants. I took way to many pictures but the old half timber building style is very picturesque.",
          "We passed this beautiful alley while taking a stroll in a Christmas carriage.The combination of the antique building right at the middle of a more modern city is very unique.",
          "This area is an original part of Nuremberg that survived the war. It has some beautiful colors and architecture.",
          "while strolling around Old Town, make sure you wander to this famous street. Hard not to take photos along this street!!!",
          "All part of the Nuremberg experience must see homes from the 1700 and 1800 almost like a movie set and a worth while walk",
          "This is the oldest street in Nuremberg and a must see attraction. It has lovely Half Timbered houses and is very picturesque.",

          "Another interesting area of the Old Town. A must is a walk along Tanner's Lane and the the old painted and timber buildings that appear to leap onto your camera with ease.",
          "We thought we'd wander down here on our final day from the Imperial Castle. I was disappointed to say the least. On the internet it had said it had some nice cafes etc but nothing was really open (I think because it was a Sunday). The buildings were nice and historic but mixed",
          "One of the beautiful streets in Nuremberg! The buildings are 3-4 floors, road is made from paving stone.",
          "This street is my absolute favourite. Small coloured houses, each with a different story and different offerings. Even some locals don't know this street so well since it is right in the middle of the city center without gaining too much attention. But that is what Nuremberg and",

        "wiki": "Nuremberg ( NEWR-\u0259m-burg; German: N\u00fcrnberg [\u02c8n\u028f\u0281nb\u025b\u0281k] (listen); Bavarian: Niamberg; East Franconian: N\u00e4rrnberch or N\u00e4mberch, locally N\u00e4rmberch) is the second-largest city of the German federal state of Bavaria after its capital Munich, and its 511,628 (2016) inhabitants make it the 14th largest city in Germany. On the Pegnitz River (from its confluence with the Rednitz in F\u00fcrth onwards: Regnitz, a tributary of the River Main) and the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal, it lies in the Bavarian administrative region of Middle Franconia, and is the largest city and the unofficial capital of Franconia. Nuremberg forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring cities of F\u00fcrth, Erlangen and Schwabach with a total population of 798,867 (2018), while the larger Nuremberg Metropolitan Region has approximately 3.6 million inhabitants. The city lies about 170 kilometres (110 mi) north of Munich. It is the largest city in the East Franconian dialect area (colloquially: \"Franconian\"; German: Fr\u00e4nkisch), Nuremberg was one of the host cities of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nThere are many institutions of higher education in the city, including the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg). With 39,780 students in 2017, it is Bavaria's third-largest and Germany's 11th-largest university, with campuses in Erlangen and Nuremberg and a university hospital in Erlangen (Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen). Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg Georg Simon Ohm and Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg are also located within the city. Nuremberg Airport (Flughafen N\u00fcrnberg \u201cAlbrecht D\u00fcrer\u201c) is the second-busiest airport in Bavaria after Munich Airport, and the tenth-busiest airport in Germany.\nStaatstheater N\u00fcrnberg is one of the five Bavarian state theatres, showing operas, operettas, musicals, and ballets (main venue: Nuremberg Opera House), plays (main venue: Schauspielhaus N\u00fcrnberg), as well as concerts (main venue: Meistersingerhalle). Its orchestra, Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg, is Bavaria's second-largest opera orchestra after the Bavarian State Opera's Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich. Nuremberg is the birthplace of Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Johann Pachelbel.\nNuremberg was the site of major Nazi rallies, and it provided the site for the Nuremberg trials, which held to account many major Nazi officials.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe first documentary mention of the city, in 1050, mentions Nuremberg as the location of an Imperial castle between the East Franks and the Bavarian March of the Nordgau. From 1050 to 1571 the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade-routes. King Conrad III (reigning as King of Germany from 1138 to 1152) established the Burgraviate of Nuremberg, with the first burgraves coming from the Austrian House of Raab. With the extinction of their male line around 1190, the last Raabs count's son-in-law, Frederick I from the House of Hohenzollern, inherited the burgraviate in 1192.\nFrom the late 12th century to the Interregnum (1254\u201373), however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Hohenstaufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor (German: Reichsschulthei\u00df) from 1173/74. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city.\n \nNuremberg is often referred to as the \"unofficial capital\" of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly because the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg played an important role in the administration of the empire. The increasing demands of the Imperial court and the increasing importance of the city attracted increased trade and commerce in Nuremberg. In 1219 Emperor Frederick II granted the Gro\u00dfen Freiheitsbrief ('Great Letter of Freedom'), including town rights, Imperial immediacy (Reichsfreiheit), the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy - almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves. Nuremberg soon became, with Augsburg, one of the two great trade-centers on the route from Italy to Northern Europe.\nIn 1298 the Jews of the town were falsely accused of having desecrated the host, and 698 of them were killed in one of the many Rintfleisch massacres. Behind the massacre of 1298 was also the desire to combine the northern and southern parts of the city, which were divided by the Pegnitz. The Jews of the German lands suffered many massacres during the plague pandemic of the mid-14th century.\nIn 1349 Nuremberg's Jews suffered a pogrom. They were burned at the stake or expelled, and a marketplace was built over the former Jewish quarter. The plague returned to the city in 1405, 1435, 1437, 1482, 1494, 1520 and 1534.\n\nThe largest growth of Nuremberg occurred in the 14th century. Charles IV's Golden Bull of 1356, naming Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet, made Nuremberg one of the three most important cities of the Empire. Charles was the patron of the Frauenkirche, built between 1352 and 1362 (the architect was likely Peter Parler), where the Imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg. The royal and Imperial connection grew stronger in 1423 when the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg granted the Imperial regalia to be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 1796, when the advance of French troops required their removal to Regensburg and thence to Vienna.In 1349 the members of the guilds unsuccessfully rebelled against the patricians in a Handwerkeraufstand ('Craftsmen's Uprising'), supported by merchants and some by councillors, leading to a ban on any self-organisation of the artisans in the city, abolishing the guilds that were customary elsewhere in Europe; the unions were then dissolved, and the oligarchs remained in power while Nuremberg was a free city (until the early-19th century). Charles IV conferred upon the city the right to conclude alliances independently, thereby placing it upon a politically equal footing with the princes of the Empire. Frequent fights took place with the burgraves - without, however, inflicting lasting damage upon the city. After fire destroyed the castle in 1420 during a feud between Frederick IV (from 1417 Margrave of Brandenburg) and the duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, the city purchased the ruins and the forest belonging to the castle (1427), resulting in the city's total sovereignty within its borders.\nThrough these and other acquisitions the city accumulated considerable territory. The Hussite Wars (1419-1434), a recurrence of the Black Death in 1437, and the First Margrave War (1449-1450) led to a severe fall in population in the mid-15th century. Siding with Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria-Munich, in the Landshut War of Succession of 1503-1505 led the city to gain substantial territory, resulting in lands of 25 sq mi (64.7 km2), making it one of the largest Imperial cities.During the Middle Ages, Nuremberg fostered a rich, varied, and influential literary culture.\n\n\n=== Early modern age ===\n\nThe cultural flowering of Nuremberg, in the 15th and 16th centuries, made it the centre of the German Renaissance. In 1525, Nuremberg accepted the Protestant Reformation, and in 1532, the Nuremberg Religious Peace was signed there, preventing war between Protestants and Catholics for 15 years. During the 1552 revolution against Charles V, Nuremberg tried to purchase its neutrality, but the city was attacked without a declaration of war and was forced into a disadvantageous peace. At the Peace of Augsburg, the possessions of the Protestants were confirmed by the Emperor, their religious privileges extended and their independence from the Bishop of Bamberg affirmed, while the 1520s' secularisation of the monasteries was also approved. Families like the Tucher, Imhoff or Haller run trading businesses across Europe, similar to the Fugger and Welser families from Augsburg, although on a slightly smaller scale. \n\nThe state of affairs in the early 16th century, increased trade routes elsewhere and the ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade. During the Thirty Years' War, frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and League soldiers, the financial costs of the war and the cessation of trade caused irreparable damage to the city and a near-halving of the population. In 1632, the city, occupied by the forces of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, was besieged by the army of Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein. The city declined after the war and recovered its importance only in the 19th century, when it grew as an industrial centre. Even after the Thirty Years' War, however, there was a late flowering of architecture and culture \u2013 secular Baroque architecture is exemplified in the layout of the civic gardens built outside the city walls, and in the Protestant city's rebuilding of St. Egidien church, destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century, considered a significant contribution to the baroque church architecture of Middle Franconia.After the Thirty Years' War, Nuremberg attempted to remain detached from external affairs, but contributions were demanded for the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War and restrictions of imports and exports deprived the city of many markets for its manufactures. The Bavarian elector, Charles Theodore, appropriated part of the land obtained by the city during the Landshut War of Succession, to which Bavaria had maintained its claim; Prussia also claimed part of the territory. Realising its weakness, the city asked to be incorporated into Prussia but Frederick William II refused, fearing to offend Austria, Russia and France. At the Imperial diet in 1803, the independence of Nuremberg was affirmed, but on the signing of the Confederation of the Rhine on 12 July 1806, it was agreed to hand the city over to Bavaria from 8 September, with Bavaria guaranteeing the amortisation of the city's 12.5 million guilder public debt.\n\n\n=== After the Napoleonic Wars ===\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the city's trade and commerce revived; the skill of its inhabitants together with its favourable situation soon made the city prosperous, particularly after its public debt had been acknowledged as a part of the Bavarian national debt. Having been incorporated into a Catholic country, the city was compelled to refrain from further discrimination against Catholics, who had been excluded from the rights of citizenship. Catholic services had been celebrated in the city by the priests of the Teutonic Order, often under great difficulties. After their possessions had been confiscated by the Bavarian government in 1806, they were given the Frauenkirche on the Market in 1809; in 1810 the first Catholic parish was established, which in 1818 numbered 1,010 souls.In 1817, the city was incorporated into the district of Rezatkreis (named for the river Franconian Rezat), which was renamed to Middle Franconia (German: Mittelfranken) on 1 January 1838. The first German railway, the Bavarian Ludwigsbahn, from Nuremberg to nearby F\u00fcrth, was opened in 1835. The establishment of railways and the incorporation of Bavaria into Zollverein (the 19th-century German Customs Union), commerce and industry opened the way to greater prosperity. In 1852, there were 53,638 inhabitants: 46,441 Protestants and 6,616 Catholics. It subsequently grew to become the more important industrial city of Southern Germany, one of the most prosperous towns of southern Germany, but after the Austro-Prussian War it was given to the Prussia as part of their telegraph stations they had to give up. In 1905, its population, including several incorporated suburbs, was 291,351: 86,943 Catholics, 196,913 Protestants, 3,738 Jews and 3,766 members of other creeds.\n\n\n=== Nazi era ===\n\nNuremberg held great significance during the Nazi Germany era. Because of the city's relevance to the Holy Roman Empire and its position in the centre of Germany, the Nazi Party chose the city to be the site of huge Nazi Party conventions \u2014 the Nuremberg rallies. The rallies were held in 1927, 1929 and annually from  1933 through 1938. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 the Nuremberg rallies became huge Nazi propaganda events, a centre of Nazi ideals. The 1934 rally was filmed by Leni Riefenstahl, and made into a propaganda film called Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will).\nAt the 1935 rally, Hitler specifically ordered the Reichstag to convene at Nuremberg to pass the Nuremberg Laws which revoked German citizenship for all Jews and other non-Aryans. A number of premises were constructed solely for these assemblies, some of which were not finished. Today many examples of Nazi architecture can still be seen in the city. The city was also the home of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher, the publisher of Der St\u00fcrmer.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Nuremberg was the headquarters of Wehrkreis (military district) XIII, and an important site for military production, including aircraft, submarines and tank engines. A subcamp of Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp was located here, and extensively used slave labour. The city was severely damaged in Allied strategic bombing from 1943 to 1945. On 29 March 1944, the RAF endured its heaviest losses in the bombing campaign of Germany. Out of more than 700 planes participating, 106 were shot down or crash-landed on the way home to their bases, and more than 700 men were missing, as many as 545 of them dead. More than 160 became prisoners of war.On 2 January 1945, the medieval city centre was systematically bombed by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Army Air Forces and about ninety percent of it was destroyed in only one hour, with 1,800 residents killed and roughly 100,000 displaced. In February 1945, additional attacks followed. In total, about 6,000 Nuremberg residents are estimated to have been killed in air raids.\nNuremberg was a heavily fortified city that was captured in a fierce battle lasting from 17 to 21 April 1945 by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, 42nd Infantry Division and 45th Infantry Division, which fought house-to-house and street-by-street against determined German resistance, causing further urban devastation to the already bombed and shelled buildings. Despite this intense degree of destruction, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent restored to its pre-war appearance, including the reconstruction of some of its medieval buildings. Much of this reconstructive work and conservation was done by the organisation 'Old Town Friends Nuremberg'. However, over half of the historic look of the center, and especially the northeastern half of the old Imperial Free City was not restored.\n\n\n=== Nuremberg trials ===\n\nBetween 1945 and 1946, German officials involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity were brought before an international tribunal in the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union had wanted these trials to take place in Berlin. However, Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trials for specific reasons:\n\nThe city had been the location of the Nazi Party's Nuremberg rallies and the laws stripping Jews of their citizenship were passed there. There was symbolic value in making it the place of Nazi demise.\nThe Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few that had remained largely intact despite extensive Allied bombing of Germany). The already large courtroom was reasonably easily expanded by the removal of the wall at the end opposite the bench, thereby incorporating the adjoining room. A large prison was also part of the complex.\nAs a compromise, it was agreed that Berlin would become the permanent seat of the International Military Tribunal and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg. Due to the Cold War, subsequent trials never took place.Following the trials, in October 1946, several prominent German Nazi politicians and military leaders were executed in Nuremberg.\nThe same courtroom in Nuremberg was the venue of the Nuremberg Military Tribunals, organized by the United States as occupying power in the area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSeveral old villages now belong to the city, for example Grossgr\u00fcndlach, Kraftshof, Thon, and Neunhof in the north-west; Ziegelstein in the northeast, Altenfurt and Fischbach in the south-east; and Katzwang, Kornburg in the south. Langwasser is a modern suburb.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNuremberg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) with a certain humid continental influence (Dfb), categorized in the latter by the 0 \u00b0C isotherm. The city's climate is influenced by its inland position and higher altitude. Winters are changeable, with either mild or cold weather: the average temperature is around \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) to 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F), while summers are generally warm, mostly around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the afternoon. Precipitation is evenly spread throughout the year, although February and April tend to be a bit drier whereas July tends to have more rainfall.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNuremberg has been a destination for immigrants. 39.5% of the residents had an immigrant background in 2010 (counted with MigraPro).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nNuremberg for many people is still associated with its traditional gingerbread (Lebkuchen) products, sausages, and handmade toys. Pocket watches \u2014 Nuremberg eggs \u2014 were made here in the 16th century by Peter Henlein. Only one of the districts in the 1797-1801 sample was early industrial; the economic structure of the region around Nuremberg was dominated by metal and glass manufacturing, reflected by a share of nearly 50% handicrafts and workers. In the 19th century Nuremberg became the \"industrial heart\" of Bavaria with companies such as Siemens and MAN establishing a strong base in the city.  Nuremberg is still an important industrial centre with a strong standing in the markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Items manufactured in the area include electrical equipment, mechanical and optical products, motor vehicles, writing and drawing paraphernalia, stationery products and printed materials.\nThe city is also strong in the fields of automation, energy and medical technology. Siemens is still the largest industrial employer in the Nuremberg region but a good third of German market research agencies are also located in the city. The Nuremberg International Toy Fair is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nNuremberg is Bavaria\u2019s second largest city after Munich, and a popular tourist destination for foreigners and Germans alike. It was a leading city 500 years ago, but 90% of the town was destroyed in 1945 during the war. After World War II, many medieval-style areas of the town were rebuilt.\n\n\n===== Attractions =====\nBeyond its main attractions of the Imperial Castle, St. Lorenz Church, and Nazi Trial grounds, there are 54 different museums for arts and culture, history, science and technology, family and children, and more niche categories, where visitors can see the world's oldest globe (built in 1492), a 500-year-old Madonna, and Renaissance-era German art. There are several types of tours offered in the city, including historic tours, those that are Nazi-focused, underground and night tours, walking tours, sightseeing buses, self guided tours, and an old town tour on a mini train. Nuremberg also offers several parks and green areas, as well as indoor activities such as bowling, rock wall climbing, escape rooms, cart racing, and mini golf, theaters and cinemas, pools and thermal spas. There are also six nearby amusement parks. The city's tourism board sells the Nurnberg Card which allows for free use of public transportation and free entry to all museums and attractions in Nuremberg for a two-day period.\n\n\n===== Culinary Tourism =====\nNuremberg is also a destination for food lovers. Culinary tourists can taste the city's famous lebkuchen, gingerbread, local beer, and N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrstchen, or Nuremberg sausages. There are hundreds of restaurants for all tastes, including traditional franconian restaurants and beer gardens. Also offers 17 vegan and vegetarian restaurants, seven fully organic restaurants. Nuremberg also boasts a two Michelin Star rated restaurant, Essigbr\u00e4tlein.\n\n\n===== Pedestrian zones =====\nLike many European cities, Nuremberg offers a pedestrian-only zone covering a large portion of the old town, which is a main destination for shopping and specialty retail, including year-round Christmas stores where tourists and locals alike can purchase Christmas ornaments, gifts, decorations, and additions to their toy Christmas villages. The Craftsmen's Courtyard, or Handwerkerhof, is another tourist shopping destination in the style of a medieval village. It houses several local family-run businesses which sell handcrafted items from glass, wood, leather, pottery, and precious metals. The Handwerkerhof is also home to traditional German restaurants and beer gardens.The Pedestrian zones of Nuremberg host festivals and markets throughout the year, most well known being Christkindlesmarkt, Germany's largest Christmas market and the gingerbread capital of the world. Visitors to the Christmas market can peruse the hundreds of stalls and purchase local wood crafts, nutcrackers, smokers, and prune people, while sampling Christmas sweets and traditional gluhwein.\n\n\n===== Hospitality =====\nIn 2017, Nuremberg saw a total of 3.3 million overnight stays, a record for the town, and is expected to have surpassed that in 2018, with more growth in tourism anticipated in the coming years. There are over 175 registered places of accommodation in Nuremberg, ranging from hostels to luxury hotels, bed and breakfasts, to multi-hundred room properties. As of 19 April 2019, Nuremberg had 306 AirBnB listings.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nNuremberg was an early centre of humanism, science, printing, and mechanical invention. The city contributed much to the science of astronomy. In 1471 Johannes Mueller of K\u00f6nigsberg (Bavaria), later called Regiomontanus, built an astronomical observatory in Nuremberg and published many important astronomical charts.\nIn 1515, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, a native of Nuremberg, created woodcuts of the first maps of the stars of the northern and southern hemispheres, producing the first printed star charts, which had been ordered by Johannes Stabius. Around 1515 D\u00fcrer also published the \"Stabiussche Weltkarte\", the first perspective drawing of the terrestrial globe.Printers and publishers have a long history in Nuremberg. Many of these publishers worked with well-known artists of the day to produce books that could also be considered works of art. In 1470 Anton Koberger opened Europe's first print shop in Nuremberg. In 1493, he published the Nuremberg Chronicles, also known as the World Chronicles (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated history of the world from the creation to the present day. It was written in the local Franconian dialect by Hartmann Schedel and had illustrations by Michael Wohlgemuth, Wilhelm Pleydenwurff, and Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Others furthered geographical knowledge and travel by map making. Notable among these was navigator and geographer Martin Behaim, who made the first world globe.\nSculptors such as Veit Stoss, Adam Kraft and Peter Vischer are also associated with Nuremberg.\nComposed of prosperous artisans, the guilds of the Meistersingers flourished here. Richard Wagner made their most famous member, Hans Sachs, the hero of his opera Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel was born here and was organist of St. Sebaldus Church.\nThe academy of fine arts situated in Nuremberg is the oldest art academy in central Europe and looks back to a tradition of 350 years of artistic education.\nNuremberg is also famous for its Christkindlesmarkt (Christmas market), which draws well over a million shoppers each year.  The market is famous for its handmade ornaments and delicacies.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n \nGermanisches Nationalmuseum\nHouse of Albrecht D\u00fcrer\nKunsthalle N\u00fcrnberg\nKunstverein N\u00fcrnberg\nNeues Museum N\u00fcrnberg (Modern Art Museum)\nNuremberg Toy Museum\nNuremberg Transport Museum\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nThe Nuremberg State Theatre, founded in 1906, is dedicated to all types of opera, ballet and stage theatre. During the season 2009/2010, the theatre presented 651 performances for an audience of 240,000 persons. The State Philharmonic Nuremberg (Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg) is the orchestra of the State Theatre. Its name was changed in 2011 from its previous name: The Nuremberg Philharmonic (N\u00fcrnberger Philharmoniker). It is the second-largest opera orchestra in Bavaria. Besides opera performances, it also presents its own subscription concert series in the Meistersingerhalle. Christof Perick was the principal conductor of the orchestra between 2006\u20132011. Marcus Bosch heads the orchestra since September 2011  .\nThe Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra (N\u00fcrnberger Symphoniker) performs around 100 concerts a year to a combined annual audience of more than 180,000. The regular subscription concert series are mostly performed in the Meistersingerhalle but other venues are used as well, including the new concert hall of the Kongresshalle and the Serenadenhof. Alexander Shelley has been the principal conductor of the orchestra since 2009.\nThe Nuremberg International Chamber Music Festival (Internationales Kammermusikfestival N\u00fcrnberg) takes place in early September each year, and in 2011 celebrated its tenth anniversary. Concerts take place around the city; opening and closing events are held in the medieval Burg. The Bardentreffen, an annual folk festival in Nuremberg, has been deemed the largest world music festival in Germany and takes place since 1976. 2014 the Bardentreffen starred 368 artists from 31 nations.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nNuremberg is known for N\u00fcrnberger Bratwurst, which is shorter and thinner than other bratwurst sausages.\nAnother Nuremberg speciality is N\u00fcrnberger Lebkuchen, a kind of gingerbread eaten mainly around Christmas time.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nNuremberg offers 51 public and 6 private elementary schools in nearly all of its districts. Secondary education is offered at 23 Mittelschulen, 12 Realschulen, and 17 Gymnasien (state, city, church, and privately owned). There are also several other providers of secondary education such as Berufsschule, Berufsfachschule, Wirtschaftsschule etc.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\nNuremberg hosts the joint university Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, two Fachhochschulen (Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg and Evangelische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg), an art school (Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste N\u00fcrnberg), and a music conservatoire (Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg). There are also private schools such as the Akademie Deutsche POP N\u00fcrnberg offering higher education.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nNuremberg Castle: the three castles that tower over the city including central burgraves' castle, with Free Reich's buildings to the east, the Imperial castle to the west.\nHeilig-Geist-Spital. In the centre of the city, on the bank of the river Pegnitz, stands the Hospital of the Holy Spirit. Founded in 1332, this is one of the largest hospitals of the Middle Ages. Lepers were kept here at some distance from the other patients. It now houses elderly persons and a restaurant.\nThe Hauptmarkt, dominated by the front of the unique Gothic Frauenkirche (Our Lady's Church), provides a picturesque setting for the famous Christmas market. A main attraction on the square is the Gothic Sch\u00f6ner Brunnen (Beautiful Fountain) which was erected around 1385 but subsequently replaced with a replica (the original fountain is kept in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum). The unchanged Renaissance bridge Fleischbr\u00fccke crosses the Pegnitz nearby.\nThe Gothic Lorenzkirche (St. Laurence church) dominates the southern part of the walled city and is one of the most important buildings in Nuremberg. The main body was built around 1270\u20131350.\nThe even earlier and equally impressive Sebalduskirche is St. Lorenz's counterpart in the northern part of the old city.\nThe church of the former Katharinenkloster is preserved as a ruin, the charterhouse (Kartause) is integrated into the building of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum and the choir of the former Franziskanerkirche is part of a modern building.\nOther churches located inside the city walls are: St. Laurence's, Saint Clare's, Saint Martha's, Saint James the Greater's, Saint Giles's, and Saint Elisabeth's.\nThe Germanisches Nationalmuseum is Germany's largest museum of cultural history, among its exhibits are works of famous painters such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Rembrandt, and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner.\nThe Neues Museum N\u00fcrnberg is a museum for modern and contemporary art.\nThe Walburga Chapel and the Romanesque Doppelkapelle (Chapel with two floors) are part of Nuremberg Castle.\nThe Johannisfriedhof is a medieval cemetery, containing many old graves (Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Willibald Pirckheimer, and others).

The Nuremberg\u2013Ingolstadt\u2013Munich high-speed line with 300 km/h (186 mph) operation opened 28 May 2006, and was fully integrated into the rail schedule on 10 December 2006.

FC N\u00fcrnberg, known locally as Der Club (English: \"The Club\"), was founded in 1900 and currently plays in the Bundesliga. The official colours of the association are red and white, but the traditional colours are red and black. They won their first regional title in the Southern German championship in 1916 closely followed by their first national title in 1920. Besides the eleven regional championships they won they were the German championship for a total of seven times.

          "Nice museum. A combination of a transportation museum and a communications museum. Interesting presentations are a combination of past and future. It is a pity that all explanations and information are in German only.\nEasy access, within walking distance of the main train station",
          "Fantastic transport and communication museum. You can easily spend 2 hours there alone or a whole day with the kids. They have real trains and a kid's corner.",
          "All about railways from the early days to now. Get up close with life-size replica of the earliest steam engines and modern high speed ones. Lots of model trains, an excellent play area for kids and an hourly model train show make to make the visit memorable.",
          "The last floor is suitable for kids. Our 5 year old and 1 year old enjoyed it a lot. Must see if u have kids. You can spend there at least 2 hours.",
          "The oldest rail museum in Germany, has a fully enclosed space making it an all weather space. There are adequate test rooms and a cafe. The exhibits trace a detailed history of the development of the railways and related technologies, evolution of roles and dress and historic role of the railways. A must visit when in Nuremberg.",
          "The museum is much larger than it looks, with two indoor exhibit halls, an outside exhibit area, and a railroad switch tower overlooking the railroad. It is well put together and covers the history of railroads in Germany and around the world.",
          "The display is awesome, the trains are beautiful.  You feel very much a kid whilst viewing the exhibit, you don't want to leave.",
          "Great place to visit if you are a railway enthusiast. Note in the winter the outside exhibits close early due to darkness, and in frosty/icy weather may be closed altogether. Not many displays have English translation, but it is a German Railways museum!",
          "Really fun afternoon with our 14 month old boy. Very child friendly with lots to explore. It even has a huge play area. Great value and a brilliant way to spend 2-3 hours",
          "Frustratingly only German text, and no audio guide available. As ignorant as I know I am for not speaking the language, all I could do was stare blankly at the trains and pictures! Lovely set-up, and good exhibitions, though.",
          "Not massively interesting. Plenty of models, and a modest display of old locos and coaches. Best bits for me showed how the system had to cope with territorial changes in war and after, and how the DDR coped with having to upgrade links to Rostock (just about its only port) and to create new routes around West Berlin.",
          "If you like trains a little, you'll probably like them alot after visiting this museum.  Actual trains, excellent models of others and lots of demonstrations including cutaway steam engines.  I could have slowed down to spend a half a day \u2026",
          "Nice place to visit especially if you are fun of old trains and etc.",
          "Combined communication and Transport.\nA very interesting museum to visit \ud83e\udd70",
          "Afraid unless you're a train enthusiast it's not the place to go. Nothing interactive just endless reading. Also, weirdly although there was endless reading only one line of each paragraph was translated into English on all the exhibits. It \u2026",
          "Awesome history.. And great place for kids..",
          "Very interesting museum. Was not the first choice of visit at N\u00fcrnberg but the place positively surprised me. A great history lesson on German railways",
          "Fun place where you can go with your family also during Sunday.",
          "A nice museum.  You can plan to spend about 2-3 hours there.  I dont suggest it for children 6 and under.",
          "This museum is really awesome. It was the most impressive transport museum I have been. 6 Euros is really cheap for its exhibition! But if you want to see everything, arrive by 10 am, have a big breakfast before,  cause I took 5h there (and \u2026",
          "Excellent museum to know the history of train.\n\nRequires 5 to 6 hours to see the museum.\n\nThere is also play area for kids.",
          "For those who love trains, DB museum provides a snapshot of the trains used. Also has artefacts of communication and arts.",
          "Fun place for the whole family (including younger children). There is a lot to explore and see. Interesting objects and stories",
          "Very well organised, very educative, very well equiped",
          "interesting museum,  it was a very nice day",
          "they havent descriptions in english, they only in german.",
          "Absolutely wonderful place for train lovers and not only for them.",
          "Small but it was informative from the beginning of railways to present day",
          "A complete and interactive experience! Give it a try, you woun't be disapointed.",
          "Awesome \"time travel\" Museum",
          "A \"must visit\" for any rail enthusiast. Alongside the many rail vehicles are many large scale models. Also a nice touch was the signalbox that you can visit. Definitely worth a few hours and very close to the main train station.",
          "Great experience for the whole family.",
          "This is actually one of three Deutsche Bahn (German Railway) museums in Germany. It is really a fantastic museum. Excellent exhibits give a great history of railways in general, and in Germany. For example on the invention of railways and \u2026",
          "Doesn't duck talking about or showing what happened with transport during the 30s and 40s, nor the later Cold War era.  But mainly about Germany's first passenger railway (built by the British) and the modern era.  Don't worry about the \u2026",
          "This place is great for adults and kids! Not every display is in English. You may need a headset. They had a neat traveling exhibit. It was very kid friendly, as an entire area was made for them to run and play!",
          "A great museum of German railway history. Many oigional exhibits are in German language only but all new exhibits are in English also. Allow at least 2hrs to see all floors and the exterior exhibit.",
          "Great and adventurous place for all who love trains.",
          "Very good transportation museum. Esp for kids good.",
          "One of the most entertaining and interactive museums i've been in. our visit to this museum was not planned, it was just in the way but oh my! was it worth it!!! Really cool, don't miss it!",
          "It is a fantastic place for train enthusiasts and for those who are interested in communication too. The showrooms have great material, the problem is that all the information is in German only. Yes, I know it is widely spoken here, but the \u2026",
          "Nice inner exposition of railway related memorabilia, lots of different things. Unfortunately, almost everything only with german infotex. Second exhibition hall -> overstuffed with locomotives and waggons, impossible to take fotographs of \u2026",
          "Cheap, comprehensive, Kibala, the Adler, model railway and stuff for the kids..",
          "This transport Museum at Nuremberg has a lot of locomotives kept on display right from the early ages of development of steam engines till the latest eye candy - ICE. It has a toy train where kids can sit on each bogies and the train takes \u2026",
          "Best place to visit. \nLots of information about the locomotive. \nAnd great place for the kids.",
          "Nice and historical museum.",
          "Add knowledge about the trains history in Germany. Very recommended, good for family, and we can see trains model that made precisely the same with an original train.",
          "Lots of awesome activities for kids.  The kids play area is out of this world!  The trains around the museum first floor are pretty awesome.  The audio recorder explains some things in English, but not everything.  Best to bring someone who can read German.",
          "This is a history! And I like model railway))",
          "Nice museum. Impressive railway collection. It's  multi story and big, reserve  some time to visit. Be sure to ask for an audio guide. They don't ask it themselves if you need one even do the written text is only in German. So without  the audio guide you'll miss alot.",
          "Amazing Museum for fans of the history of trains!! Huge museums with a love for details. Great, large trains exhibited. Also amazing model trains. Very close to N\u00fcrnberg downtown. Highly recommended!!!",
          "Although its very interesting , there is no English explanation in most of the exhibits .",
          "Amazing place! Our little boy's dream come true! Incredible interactive kid's area, with ride-on  train and huge, well-stacked  train table. Wonderful exhibits...just fantastic. We spent the entire day here, and could have easily spent more.",
          "Pretty interesting one with overloaded information and quite amazing ways to depict the history to transport!",
          "A must visit for any train enthusiast. Please note, that vehicles are probably in rotation between museums, so if you are going to see something particular, consult with staff if it is there (red E19 wasn't there, for example).",
          "The history and myth and toys of trains and railway. Perfect for adults and children!",
          "Great fun. We spent an enjoyable few hours here and learnt a lot. Would like to take some of their ideas back to the UK!",
          "Brilliant. Well set out. Reasonable entry fee. More english would have been good but the NRM at York has no German in so i cannot complain",
          "Loved it. Great play area for kids in 2nd floor. Only disappointed that the kids train runs only every 30 min even if it's very busy. \nGreat to the see the outdoor space too.",
          "My kids love to go there. Many interesting things to see, play with or learn. Additionally, there is nice playground for children (both inside and outside).",
          "The exhibits were great. Specially loved the locomotive engine with a cross section cut out.",
          "This place must be visited if u are traveling in Germany.",
          "We enjoyed our afternoon in this child friendly museum. This is a very important collection of locomotives, trains and other transport items. Maybe the most impressive part of the train exhibition were the royal wagons of Ludwig II, the \u2026",
          "Greate place for every fan of trains and transportation.",
          "Very nice museum! Lots of great exhibits. From model trains in all sizes (even moving ones), to real ones as well as train art; from the early to modern times. Nice setting and a very nice kids section. Very reasonable entrance fee. Certainly worth a visit, independent of whether you're a train person or not.",
          "Been on my bucket list, for many years. I did expect more steam engines. Germany has a great History of steam Engines",
          "The best railway museum that I've ever seen. The collection is in good condition, the timeline of German railway's evolution saved perfectly. From first railways and steam powered engines to modern high-speed trains, but modern train is only maquette, and it's sad.",
          "Interesting visit, worth the trip, but there could have been more attractions and exhibits. Honestly, it was worth just for the gift shop and the idea of people actually buying a DB branded fidget spinner.",
          "Very interesting museum for railroad fans. The museum shows the history of German railways from the first start with the \"Adler\" (eagle) in 1835 to today.\nThe miniature railroad dates from the 1970s and many much better and bigger ones exist nowadays.\nBest are the wonderful scale models and the King's Luxury Train.",
          "There are basically two museums in the same building that can be seen with the same ticket. For people on a one-day tour, you need to prioritise. I wanted to see the transportation museum (Deutsche Bahn museum) but unknowingly entered \u2026",
          "Super nice museum for kids and parents!",
          "Very informative, well laid out.",
          "Perfect place to visit on a Sunday!  The museum is fascinating and the treatment of the sensitive 1939-1945 period is especially well done.  The exhibition narrative is 99% in German language so non-German speakers will need the audio guide \u2026",
          "Have been here with kids. Everyone loved this museum. A must place while visiting Nuremberg. Many things to see, learn and do.",
          "Great experience! I thought 1 hour would be enough to visit, but if you are enthusiastic about trains you might get lost for a few hours.\nShortly there are 3 things you can see: history of trains, small model trains and many real trains. \u2026",
          "Very interesting, a lot of exhibitions, very interactive for children! we also enjoyed restaurant inside.",
          "Better than expected, highly recommended :)",
          "Spent 2hrs here on a rainy afternoon n barely scratched the surface. Lots of informative well done displays with English translation. Didn't even go to outdoor displays, will be going back.",
          "Quite big museum. Entry fees is reasonable. Shows from yesteryear trains to latest ICE. Worth visiting once.",
          "Entertaining and Educating. This museum goes beyond only a transport museum to also serve as greatly communication museum. This place does absolutely deserve a visit, I spent almost 3 hours exploring and learning in each corner I stepped in. Unfortunately, the content is 80% German.",
          "Great place to bring kids. On the top floor, they have a whole room for kids to play, dress up, and ride a mini train. On the ground floor, there is a royal carriage that belonged to Ludwig II.",
          "Amazing for kids but not only, there are true locomotives you can hop on! Sadly though there's no English panels or guides available.",
          "I would rate this 4 or 5 if I could read German.  As it is, I rate it 2 for English speakers, but gave 3 stars to not overly punish it because I am unilingual.\n\nThere are facinating displays of all things train related, from the first days \u2026",
          "Fascinating little place which is more about history but does have a few locomotives. Also has a good array of model locomotives. The only down side is it's all in German so if you don't speak German you have to rely on your existing railway knowledge",
          "Amazing! Great value for money, the tickets are cheap and you get to see a lot of cool things. You get the Deutsche Bahn Museum, Communication Museum and a lot of smaller but equally fascinating museums. There's a big playground for kids, \u2026",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the Museum thank you Nuremberg.",
          "Very interesting museum dedicated to \ud83d\ude86 train transport, but also with a section on communication and even a small area dedicated to the Post. It's a very good way to experience from the old steam locomotives to the royal Bavarian \u2026",
          "Very interesting if you like trains and the technological progression of them. Fair warning, though, the exhibition had very few texts that aren't in German, so you should get the audio guide.",
          "Very interesting place for kids and parents",
          "It\u2019s so worth visiting, we became quickly excited, I consider they should invest more in promoting this museum. \nDefinitely a museum for dudes, but girls can also enjoy it",
          "Very interesting. Reserve at least 3 hours",
          "Great exhibition and court 600 seems earie",
          "Exceptional transport museum in the city of Germany's first railway line. Beautiful modern, well maintained exhibits, wonderfully laid out. \n\nOnly minor issue is all the explanations are in German only. Of course this is not a huge problem, \u2026",
          "Exelent",
          "Very informative on the evolution of German railway",
          "Really interesting exhibitions. \n\nMost of the of the information wasn't translated into English and I couldn't seem to see Audio Guides (certainly they weren't obvious).\n\nThe building was very impressive and overall really enjoyable morning spent here.",
          "Very nice museum. Beautiful exhibition of trains.",
          "Amazing collection of historical  information and artifacts.  Well worth the visit!",
          "My 5 year old son & my 63 year old day were in heaven. With a very detailed history of the evolution of trains in Germany we got a good over view of the history. With beautiful exhibits & interactive display kids of all ages were engaged. \u2026",
          "Great collection but limited English explanation. Not very interactive.",
          "The kids had a blast, for grown ups it is very educational",
          "Entertaining and Educative. This museum goes beyond only a transport museum to  also serve as greatly a communication museum. I loved my time here and took the time to explore every bit of the building.",
          "A great view of railroad transport throughout the years, but not limited to just trains, lots of other associated displays too.",
          "I love the whole idea behind it because I love trains. But the place was in some need of attention and upkeep. The outside portion wasn't exactly up to standard but was still just fine. The admission price was worth it and it's still a nice \u2026",
          "Great train and transport and post exhibition. Model railway was amazing and the outdoor trains as well.",
          "It was a good experience! A lot of beautiful things kids would like.",
          "3 Hours or even more of fun, for adults and children",
          "Fantastic children's train play area with Brio toys.",
          "Very nice exebition , more of the information should be on English.",

          "Great train museum. Lots If German hystory and beautiful displays",
          "if u are a fan of train, this is a must go! also lot of fun for kid as well.",
          "very nice !!",
          "It is a nice museum with a lot to see. However, everything is in German. Audio guide in English is available (\u20ac1 for each). The admission fee is included if you have purchased the Nuremberg 2 days pass, but not the audio guide.",
          "Great museum! We stayed in the communications and children's activity floor at the top (second or third floor, depending on where you are from) and spent at least two hours in that space alone. If we had had small children with us, we could \u2026",

          "Superb museum. Well presented and displayed. Good catering too\ud83d\ude00",
          "A fun and informative museum! I take my visiting family often and they always enjoy it. As a parent however the real attraction is the Kibala, a train themed playground on the second floor. My sons always have a blast there it is our go to for rainy days.",
          "Great museum for an afternoon with the family. Lots of trains of all sizes and good historic context. Top floor is a playzone for kids between 2-8 years old.",
          "Nice museum with loads of information .. One of the rarest places where you see some good projections of AH .. My kid liked the toy train ride and toys on the top floor .. Nice visit ..",
          "You'll keep some hours busy in the different sections. There's a detailed German train history exposition with lots of original pieces. Specially the locomotive and the Kaiser wagons are interesting to see. With a railway model you'll get a \u2026",
          "If you like trains...  the DB Museum is for you! A great museum for kids too.",
          "Nice museum. All signs are only in german. They offer an audio guide in English for 1 euro but info is very limited.",

          "I like trains",
          "Amazing museum! Very interesting with tons of interactive activities. I learned a lot and had so much fun at the same time. However, some of the staff were a little rude; not sure if it was because we were tourists.",

          "Good range of things to see. Make sure you're on the first floor Model Railway at 1030 when it runs. Also note there is a second outdoor part over the road. There's a lot of light reflection from the glass of some cabinets around the place.",
          "Most of the museum is in German. It's a good idea to get audioguide for some English explainations. Overall it is pretty interesting museum. Love the big model trains.",

          "It's very cool museum, everything moves. Especially I liked the communication museum on the top floor, you can write a secret message and send it to your friends. Also there is a continuation of the museum on the street, where you can see live trains, enjoy the views. N.B. You",
          "A very diverse collection of german railway equipment is on display at this museum. For the train enthusiast, this museum is a great place to visit not just for the exhibits but also for the outside display in the railyard next to the main station. A large collection of vehicles",
          "The museum houses a diverse collection of railway equipment, including many items from before the DB existed. Everything is well presented and is generally interesting to the general tourist and enthralling for train nuts ( like me ).",
          "Free for Interrail pass holders so only costing us 1 Euro each for the audio guide the museum made for an excellent value morning activity. Almost all the written material is in German only but the audio guide brought the artefacts to life. Possibly German speakers could get",
          "If trains are your thing, then do not miss this museum. It nicely covers the history of the german railway system for close to two hundred years. Unfortunately, there were very few visitors when I was there. I speak german, so I did not notice if the displays had adequate",
          "Deutsche Bahn Museum is located one stop U-Bahn from main train station. It's opened every day except Monday. The main exhibition, charting almost two centuries of rail history, starts on the ground floor and continues with more recent exhibits on the 1st floor. Also there\u2019s",
          "Lots of information and sights to see, would have liked to have had some translated to English since it is all in German. We still liked it either way.",
          "Great museum with some very interesting exhibits. Reasonable entrance charge, and the visit also included an open air section across the road, which we nearly missed!",

          "DB Museum offers a overall view of the german railway services, from its beginning to actual time. Some machines were exposed, as weel as a wonderful collection of models in scale 1:10 of engines and wagons. There is also a room with an huge electric train, with presentations",
          "I've visited many railway museums around the world so my expectations of this one were high but were not met. Firstly there is no help for non german speakers so it becomes quickly boring for foreigners. There are some mustn't miss items Adler, King Ludwigs Coaches, and",

          "It was \u20ac6 for an adult and it was worth it in terms of the number of trains and models on show. The model railway was fun as were the descriptions and the scaled down models on the first floor, as they were in English. The huge trains on the ground floor were good to see up",

          "The DB museum is very interesting, big and modern, it is suited for families, my kids loved it. It is not too expensive.",
          "This is a 2 for 1 museum with the co-located DB (rail) Museum and the Museum for Post and Communication in the one ticket. Two major exhibit areas in the rail museum have been closed for some time for renovation. In this day of ready digital text translation tools it would not",
          "A very good museum for the train fanatics telling the history of German railways from the start. If you got there by train (as we did) take your ticket and you get in at a lower rate. Lots of the displays have only German descriptions but get the audio guide as it explains all",
          "This museum systematically takes the journey from the beginning of train travel to the present day. The past, the use of trains during the war and the present day goals were all well set out. I only wished they had an audio or dual descriptors. The models and full scale replicas",
          "The DB Museum is located just a few minutes' walk from the main railway station in central Nuremberg. Entry costs EUR\u20ac6.00, plus EUR\u20ac1.00 for the multilingual audio guide (remember to take some form of identification, such as a drivers' license, as security for the audio guide).",
          "Really good mix of trains and historical information about German railways over the years. Plenty of displays both indoors and outdoors. The outdoor section has signal box and many trains that are accessible for you to wander around. Well worth a visit if you like rail and rail",

          "Four adults and two children ages 2 and 5 spent almost 4 hours touring the museum. It is really well done and shows development of German railways from the earliest days to present. There are lots of actual trains to see as well as models. They show extensive history of the",
          "I visited this museum when on a short tour of Bavaria (Bayern) last week First off, a word of warning to anybody visiting this year; the exhibition from the war years until 1989 is currently undergoing renovations until the New Year. This cut a good hour off my visit as this",
          "I really enjoy trains so naturally had an excellent time, with a wide range of exhibits. English language audio guide gets you a lot of information, and recommended if your German is lacking as a lot of the exhibits are German-language only. Would go again just for the model",
          "We spent a lot of time in the Communications Museum so we were not able to visit everything. We focused on the first building which had lots to see. The highlight was the 'living room' on wheels. One critic though... I am a parent, and I can understand the challenges of going",
          "set out over so many floors with outdoor displays as well a very good insight into the origins of the German Rail system which I think today is second to none, fast, cheap and efficient. Wonderful old locomotives and carriages everywhere including the Adler",
          "Visited the museum when staying in Munich. A very well equipped museum about German railway history. Was very impressed with the large scale model railway, as well as the miniature or larger scale models. I would say it is on the same level as the railway museum in York,",
          "Very nice exhibition of actual, refurbished and replica trains. Hear the story of what brought the railway to Germany and it's impact through the turbulent history of war and peace",
          "Really great way to spend 2 hours here. Excellent selection of models and actual trains from the very first to now. Thoroughly enjoyed this with my wife.",
          "We found this display to be a very well detailed exhibition of railway history from \"Adler\" the first steam loco on the mainland Continent of Europe, right through to the current era of high speed trains. And missing very little on the way through. Dealt in detail with the war",
          "The museum is in a huge building and includes all sorts of trains, from 1900 to present days. Real steam locomotives in which visitors can enter. The secind and third floor are with a lot of train miniatures and history of communication. A little more visitor interaction would",
          "Listed as the oldest train museum in Europe it is quite impressive. The Adler, the first steam engine to operate in Germany in 1832 is on display. We were surprised to learn the first rail lin ran from Furth to Nurenberg. Several engines and rolling stock are on display",

          "Visited with my 5 year old train mad son, and he loved it. Caters for both adults and kids - there's a play area upstairs for kids - just brilliant. Price is very reasonable too. WIll be visiting again!",
          "The museum displays are currently being updated but there is still a fine range of displays covering the time from the birth of railways in Germany up until the Second World War. Unsurprisingly though the information provided is largely in German! There are some fine locos",
          "This museum would be great for all the family. We went with our four year old grandson and he loved it & spent six and a half hours there. The displays are well presented with full size trains and models of various sizes. There is a very large model train which runs for about 15",

          "The museum has a good selection of items, photos and old trains. There aren't many descriptions in English which was a little disappointing. They do however offer an audio guide which we didn't take, so maybe that fills in the gaps in the written information. Some of the",
          "This museum is beautiful for train lovers, but something disappointed me: I can't understand why every single explanation and information was written ONLY in German. Tourists come from everywhere and I think it's obvious that writing in an unknown language, will not encourage",
          "An excellent museum with a good range of displays, all very well presented. We particularly enjoyed seeing the royal carriages.",
          "This is the perfect place to learn about Deutsche Bahn. There is a place for kids to play and learn about trains. It is worth to visit if you are alone or travel with kids.",

          "Variety of trains for the kids to explore but most of the exhibits on the ground floor were in German. Rent the audio for a better experience. We spent most of our time on the 3rd floor with the train ride and playing with the toy trains. Good option especially during winter",
          "Unfortunately we weren't offered the audio guide in English, so we struggled a bit. Saying, that however, we both found the museum and the exhibits absorbing. There are hundreds of photos and artifacts which spoke for themselves, although a bit of help with the German script",
          "Only interesting if you are really into trains. I've been there before and really enjoyed it, but the refurbishment cuts the space and exhibition significantly, so until it is done, I really don't think it is worth it unless you have a city card and an extra hour.",

          "I have been visiting the DB Museum since I was a small child, some 40+ years ago and it is still a wonderful visit. Make sure that you DEFINITELY visit the model railway, which is really interesting too. Truly massive trains and bags of history. If you are visiting Nurnberg,",

          "Get the english audio guide if you do not speak German. ALL of the exhibits on the first floor are in German without descriptions of other languages. It's a pity because I missed out almost everything from the history to development of DB. Maybe it's not meant to be understood",

          "A really interesting tour of the german railway history. Very interesting set-up, construction and lighting for the scenographic demonstration. The only disadvantage is that everything (apart from some titles) is only in German, so you definitely need a guided tour.",
          "Good museum for rail fans and those interested in the history of the German railroads. There is a great HO scale model railroad upstairs that will be of interest to children and adults. There are also locomotive and rail cars outside in the rail yard.",

          "A highlight for any train buff. Fantastic original steam and other historic locomotives and carriages. Next to it a well done exhibition how the rise of trains changed life and society in the 19th century. Ground floor gets five stars! Middle floor is clearly work in progress,",
          "The exhibition is well-organised, logical, and comprehensive. Exhibits comprehensively explained with the assistance of the audio guide, hired at the cost of 1 Euro. The organisers do not shirk from the responsibility for describing the involvement of German Railways in wartime",

          "This is the place to see for small and big train fans. the exhibitions are great with a great deal on history",
          "We were interested to visit the place because of my husband's ancestor who has been a part of the railway back then. A very good museum indeed. It's worth visiting, just a few minute walk from the central station, well sign posted.",
          "for 5 euro(adult) you can visit the db museum and museum for telecommunication. the db museum have all the information about the train. from the history until the future of the db itself. the main star of the museum is The \"Adler\". for family the museum is perfect. there are",
          "This museum had so many things to look at, we especially loved the locomotives it was fun to see how different they are from the newer ones that are running today, they had old passenger cars, they had an impressive model train set up upstairs that is operational. I would go",
          "Really good displays and information. A fun and informative experience. The model railway is superb and the life size rolling stock is amazing, especially the older carriages and the ICE3.",
          "If you're into trains - this is great! Really interesting, full of models and trains to climb over - the cut-in-half steam train was great for seeing how a stream train actually works!",
          "Truly, the greatest railway museum in Germany. Family friendly, children orientated, great facilities, food and drink at reasonable prices, easily accessible for disabled and small children. Educational, multi-media displays in all major languages, really cheap. Nothing to",
          "I'm a railway enthusiast and I loved this museum. True it doesnt have as many locos on display as York but I think it has enough - the enthusiast can take time to appreciate what's there and the less keen are less likely to suffer from saturation fatigue. There is certainly",
          "This museum is a gem. We did not expect to like this museum as much as we did. The communication museum collocated to it is also great, especially for the kids. Tip: There is a 80 sq meters area with model trains located in the DB museum. The performance times are Tuesday to",
          "As I wrote on the title, this museum is also a MUST when visiting Nuremberg. Our 3 y.o. son got really excited, there are different sections at every floor for trains and communication and on the upper floor there is KIMBALA, a large playground for kids. Also at the entrance",
          "My Son and I visited the DB museum and had a blast! We both love the old transportation pieces and this museum does not disappoint! Highly recommend if in the Nuernberg area!",
          "The birthplace of rrailway in Germany. That's what this musuem sshowcase. The vist was worth it for a sunday afternoon visit to nuremburg. I enjoyed particularly the cinema hall that shows the history of railway in deutschland",
          "I live in England and often visit Britain's Railway Museum at York so I was expecting something similar at Nuremberg, but I was disappointed. There really aren't that many trains to see. it really is a history museum of German railways, but the signage is entirely in German, so",
          "I was expecting big things here having been to several other rail museums on my travels. It is quite slick at telling the story of German railways without dumbing down for the kids too much. What isn't made very clear is that there are two sites - the main building with the",
          "But again, I like technology oriented museums, so that should be no surprise. The point about everything being in German is well taken, but most countries are like that. With technology museums the fun comes from seeing how things are put together and how they work, and that",
          "It's big and full of history. But I ended up finding it a bit boring and, since it's big and has lots of stuf to see, it turned out to be tiring. Also didn't have all the information in english, just some part. Interesting for those who like trains a lot. Otherwise, I would",
          "It was my second time and this time I could read and understand german language. That helped a lot, because all the informations are in german. The museum takes you through the history from the first trains and onwards on how the train changed the world, mostly Germany. The told",
          "I would only recommend this museum if you are German speaking. Although an English audio guide can be rented, the actual locations for the audio guide are very limited. A vast amount of information is entirely in German and of no value for those visitors who are not fluent in",
          "a good museum to visit with children and all train enthusiasts! lots of hands on displays...travel through history of german train travel!",
          "Having been to a number of railway museums in Northern Europe I have to be honest and say that this is not the best for looking at actual trains. There is only a few (well maintained) trains on the ground floor (for obvious reasons). The other floors focus on the history of DB",
          "Great museum more then just trains. German history of communication too. Lots to see, doesn't take long to get through but for 5 Euro great value.",
          "This is one of three sites for the DB museum, the others are at Koblenz and Halle where most of the large exhibits are. This site has a few locomotives and coaches but concentrates more on the social history side of railways. I am the rail enthusiast but my wife (with little",

          "A minor collection with a very good interpretive display. In German. The Bayern royal carriages and the replica Adler are worth seeing.",
          "Overall a good museum to visit, very interesting and informative. However, as an English speaking guest we were a little dismayed. We did rent the English audio headsets but we found a lot of German information boards with no English translation available. It seemed that every",
          "One would expect DB with its wonderful rail system to have an equally wonderful railway museum. It doesn't. This place may have been adequate when it was originally built but nowadays it really is a poor relation of its British , French and Japanese equivalents in York,",
          "I was rather disappointed by this museum. Although it is the official museum of the official German carrier it seemed very low key. I had visited the French equivalent in Mulhouse a few days before and that was far superior. There seemed a lack of \"spark\" about the whole place,",
          "Regular readers will notice that transport museums are a bit of a thing with me! I was quite impressed by the general layout charting the development of the railways in Germany and they have a small but interesting collection of full sized rolling stock including a royal coach",
          "A good day out for our family, the musemum thinks nicely of kids. Even without kids there is enough to see, specially if you are train buff. Service was nice and friendly. The cafe was nothing special, but get the job done.",
          "The museum was more extensive than expected and the exhibits are described in German - naturally. I should have gotten the English guide.",
          "Even with the audio guide, I found the information lacking in English as there was about 1 audio clip per 10 or more boards with information in German. The flow was a bit difficult to follow, which can get frustrating. The museum is worth a visit nonetheless as everything I",
          "Non German speakers need to use the translator machines as all exhibits are in German. The outdoor area is worth a visit as is the model railway. Unfortunately the model railway is only run for about 5 minutes every hour",
          "We spend almost whole hour in this museum. They have real locomotives from 1800s and 1900s and modern train from 1997. There are also lots of models and demonstrations how everything work. There is also big working model or train station with trains, cars, etc...",
          "Excellent displays with sensible lighting of the old locomotives and carriages.Some but not all signage in English as well as German... Imaginative children's section. The history did not duck the awkward bits- e.g. the role of the railways in the WW2 holocaust.",
          "This is arguably the first railway museum in the world and offers a valuable insight into German social history in addition to engineering genius. A definite must do!",
          "I first visited this museum way back in the late 1960\u2019s\u2026 it has been greatly expanded since then. It now also houses a communication museum, but since our time was limited, we had to concentrate on the rail exhibits. You can easily spend several hours learning about the",
          "There was no English on any of the displays, but the history of the rail from birth thru the current day including, engineering, railroads part in the wars, the Princes rail cars, were all outstanding!",
          "At the same time as the British, the Germans developed a very effective railway network which contributed to the development of the country as an industrial power. That started in XIX century, well before Germany existed as we know it now, when a string of kingdoms shared the",
          "Although a lot smaller than a museum like the NRM in York, the DB Museum packs in a lot of interesting history, from the story of the first German railway (told via an entertaining 10 minute film, with English subtitles) to a lengthy discourse of the railway's employment in",
          "It's amazing how many trains and train parts they fit in that building. I was pretty glad they have a play area upstairs though... My kids don't have the longest attention spans.",
          "Unfortunately I cannot write positive review from the visit, although I really wish I could. The problem is opening hours. We arrived soon before 5 p.m. but the receptionist did not allow us to visit the place. I understand his point of view - who would like to stay overtime? -",
          "This outstanding museum not only has full-size trains ranging from the first freight car in Germany (a clunky coal car) to a king's gaudy Victorian passenger cars but informative displays explaining the growth of railways in Germany, their role from 1930-1945, and the",
          "Even if you are not mad keen on trains, this museum still has so much to offer. Well worth your time. I was particularly interested in learning about the history of the German rail system during WWII. Big trains on display from steam to modern day, including the carriage of",

          "Lots of trains but also social history as well. An enjoyable couple of hours here spent understanding the development of German railways including the post war era (East and West). Some English translations but you need to speak some German to get the most from this.",
          "I was particularly impressed by the variety of the exhibits - yes, obviously the real locomotives are the star attraction, but the historical displays are very detailed and interesting. Even if you know all about German history, the DB museum gives you a completely different",
          "It's a very interesting for people how like trains and even who are not train lovers would find it interesting. Worth seeing",
          "We visited the museum together with our adult son. He is journalist and of course he must see the museum of \"Communication\". And indeed, the museum is very interesting whether your interest is technic, history, or communication. Just before the visit we had a nice lunch in the",
          "The DB Museum is about trains, lots and lots of trains. It's well organized and has both the history of trains, especially in Germany, and plenty of old and new trains to see and climb around in. Give yourself a few hours to see it all then go over to the Germanisches",
          "I used to think that such museums are mostly for guys but I've changed my opinion having visited DB Museum which provides lots of historic materials beginning from the very foundation of DB and up to nowadays, visual aids of different kind, the most impressive were trains and",
          "Entry to this museum was free for us as we had an interrail ticket and this was an offer to promote the anniversary of interrail. The rail service of deutsche bahn is brilliant and the museum lets you appreciate the history of the railway. You can choose to get lots of facts",

          "Liked this museum a lot. Excellent collection both of actual train engines and cars, and of paraphernalia about the DB. Exhibits are all in German but they have audio tours in various languages. Very interesting exploration of history of rail in Germany and an open and frank",
          "Although I was apprehensive about going to a train museum, it was in fact rather interesting, ranging from Mad King Ludwig's decadent carriage, to WW2 trains and cold war trains. I am not a huge train lover, but it was interesting to see how trains were used and how they have",
          "Spent best part of a day wandering around this museum. Great exibits and well layed out. The audio guide in English was very useful since my German is rudimentary at best. Great value for money. The only drawback is that there very few places to sit down which can make the visit",
          "My husband went here in both 2006 and 2012, so that he could show it to his adult son--I went in 2006. That was enough for me, as it is truly exhaustive in every detail of trains and their historic development. A world class museum on the subject",
          "Near the Opera, this museum houses several full sized engines and cars from the past. There is an excellent model railway on the third floor of interest to most. One problem is a lack of English (or other) language signs",
          "A lot of work and planning has been carried out to ensure the visitor enjoys the experience of German train in Bavaria since the late 19th century to present day. King Ludwig II and Otto von Bismark's carriages are very interesting.",
          "It's great if you like trains. My little boy does so he loved it it. Although moves to more of a social-ecconomic theme after the train hall on the ground floor. It is worth noting that if you produce tickets from public transport (bus or trains) then you get discount. If",

          "This is the national railroad museum for Germany. The full-sized equipment on display is a good mixture of original and replica engines and rolling stock, including an amazing replica of Stevenson's Rocket. Also look for Ludwig II's rail car. The scale models on display are",
          "I arrived here late in the day and had to rush through the exhibits. There is a limited amount of old rolling stock on display. Perhaps the most interesting exhibit is one depicting the road of DB in Nazi Germany. There was also an extensive section for children, which seemed",

        "wiki": "The Nuremberg trials (German: N\u00fcrnberger Prozesse) were a series of military tribunals held after World War II by the Allied forces under international law and the laws of war. The trials were most notable for the prosecution of prominent members of the political, military, judicial, and economic leadership of Nazi Germany, who planned, carried out, or otherwise participated in the Holocaust and other war crimes. The trials were held in Nuremberg, Germany, and their decisions marked a turning point between classical and contemporary international law.\nThe first and best known of the trials was that of the major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT).  It was described as \"the greatest trial in history\" by Sir Norman Birkett, one of the British judges present throughout. Held between 20 November 1945 and 1 October 1946, the Tribunal was given the task of trying 24 of the most important political and military leaders of the Third Reich. Primarily treated here is the first trial, conducted by the International Military Tribunal. Further trials of lesser war criminals were conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 at the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunal (NMT), which included the Doctors' trial and the Judges' Trial.\nThe categorization of the crimes and the constitution of the court represented a juridical advance that would be followed afterward by the United Nations for the development of an international jurisprudence in matters of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and wars of aggression, and led to the creation of the International Criminal Court. For the first time in international law, the Nuremberg indictments also mention genocide (count three, war crimes: \"the extermination of racial and national groups, against the civilian populations of certain occupied territories in order to destroy particular races and classes of people and national, racial, or religious groups, particularly Jews, Poles, and Gypsies and others.\")\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nA precedent for trying those accused of war crimes had been set at the end of World War I in the Leipzig War Crimes Trials held in May to July 1921 before the Reichsgericht (German Supreme Court) in Leipzig, although these had been on a very limited scale and largely regarded as ineffectual. At the beginning of 1940, the Polish government-in-exile asked the British and French governments to condemn the German invasion of their country. The British initially declined to do so; however, in April 1940, a joint declaration was issued by the British, French and Polish. Relatively bland because of Anglo-French reservations, it proclaimed the trio's \"desire to make a formal and public protest to the conscience of the world against the action of the German government whom they must hold responsible for these crimes which cannot remain unpunished.\"Three-and-a-half years later, the stated intention to punish the Germans was much more trenchant. On 1 November 1943, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States published their \"Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe\", which gave a \"full warning\" that, when the Nazis were defeated, the Allies would \"pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth ... in order that justice may be done. ... The above declaration is without prejudice to the case of the major war criminals whose offences have no particular geographical location and who will be punished by a joint decision of the Government of the Allies.\" This intention by the Allies to dispense justice was reiterated at the Yalta Conference and at Potsdam in 1945.British War Cabinet documents, released on 2 January 2006, showed that as early as December 1944 the Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, had then advocated a policy of summary execution in some circumstances, with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles, being dissuaded from this only by talks with US and Soviet leaders later in the war.\n\nIn late 1943, during the Tripartite Dinner Meeting at the Tehran Conference, the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, proposed executing 50,000\u2013100,000 German staff officers. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt joked that perhaps 49,000 would do. Churchill, believing them to be serious, denounced the idea of \"the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country\" and that he would rather be \"taken out in the courtyard and shot\" himself than partake in any such action. However, he also stated that war criminals must pay for their crimes and that, in accordance with the Moscow Document which he himself had written, they should be tried at the places where the crimes were committed. Churchill was vigorously opposed to executions \"for political purposes.\" According to the minutes of a meeting between Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta, on 4 February 1945, at the Livadia Palace, President Roosevelt \"said that he had been very much struck by the extent of German destruction in Crimea and therefore he was more bloodthirsty in regard to the Germans than he had been a year ago, and he hoped that Marshal Stalin would again propose a toast to the execution of 50,000 officers of the German Army.\"Henry Morgenthau Jr., US Secretary of the Treasury, suggested a plan for the total denazification of Germany; this was known as the Morgenthau Plan. The plan advocated the forced de-industrialisation of Germany and the summary execution of so-called \"arch-criminals\", i.e. the major war criminals. Roosevelt initially supported this plan, and managed to convince Churchill to support it in a less drastic form. Later, details were leaked generating widespread condemnation by the nation's newspapers. Roosevelt, aware of strong public disapproval, abandoned the plan, but did not adopt an alternative position on the matter. The demise of the Morgenthau Plan created the need for an alternative method of dealing with the Nazi leadership. The plan for the \"Trial of European War Criminals\" was drafted by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and the War Department. Following Roosevelt's death in April 1945, the new president, Harry S. Truman, gave strong approval for a judicial process. After a series of negotiations between Britain, the US, Soviet Union, and France, details of the trial were worked out. The trials were to commence on 20 November 1945, in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Creation of the courts ==\nOn 20 April 1942, representatives from the nine countries occupied by Germany met in London to draft the \"Inter-Allied Resolution on German War Crimes\". At the meetings in Tehran (1943), Yalta (1945), and Potsdam (1945), the three major wartime powers, the United Kingdom, United States, and the Soviet Union, agreed on the format of punishment for those responsible for war crimes during World War II. France was also awarded a place on the tribunal. The legal basis for the trial was established by the London Charter, which was agreed upon by the four so-called Great Powers on 8 August 1945,  and which restricted the trial to \"punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis countries.\"\nSome 200 German war crimes defendants were tried at Nuremberg, and 1,600 others were tried under the traditional channels of military justice. The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany. Political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council which, having sovereign power over Germany, could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939.\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nLeipzig and Luxembourg were briefly considered as the location for the trial. The Soviet Union had wanted the trials to take place in Berlin, as the capital city of the 'fascist conspirators', but Nuremberg was chosen as the site for two reasons, with the first one having been the decisive factor:\nThe Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few buildings that had remained largely intact through extensive Allied bombing of Germany), and a large prison was also part of the complex.\nNuremberg was considered the ceremonial birthplace of the Nazi Party. It had hosted the Party's annual propaganda rallies and the Reichstag session that passed the Nuremberg Laws. Thus it was considered a fitting place to mark the Party's symbolic demise.As a compromise with the Soviets, it was agreed that while the location of the trial would be Nuremberg, Berlin would be the official home of the Tribunal authorities. It was also agreed that France would become the permanent seat of the IMT and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg.Most of the accused had previously been detained at Camp Ashcan, a processing station and interrogation center in Luxembourg, and were moved to Nuremberg for the trial.\n\n\n=== Participants ===\nEach of the four countries provided one judge and an alternative, as well as a prosecutor.\n\n\n==== Judges ====\nMajor General Iona Nikitchenko (Soviet main)\nLieutenant Colonel Alexander Volchkov (Soviet alternate)\nLord Justice Colonel Sir Geoffrey Lawrence (British main), President of the Tribunal\nSir Norman Birkett (British alternate)\nFrancis Biddle (American main)\nJohn J. Parker (American alternate)\nEdward Francis Carter (American alternate)\nProfessor Henri Donnedieu de Vabres (French main)\nRobert Falco (French alternate)\n\n\n==== Chief prosecutors ====\nAttorney General Sir Hartley Shawcross (United Kingdom)\nAssociate Justice Robert H. Jackson (United States)\nLieutenant-General Roman Andreyevich Rudenko (Soviet Union)\nFran\u00e7ois de Menthon, later replaced by Auguste Champetier de Ribes (France)Assisting Jackson were the lawyers Telford Taylor, William S. Kaplan and Thomas J. Dodd, and Richard Sonnenfeldt, a US Army interpreter. Assisting Shawcross were Major Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe and Sir John Wheeler-Bennett. Mervyn Griffith-Jones, who was later to become famous as the chief prosecutor in the Lady Chatterley's Lover obscenity trial, was also on Shawcross's team. Shawcross also recruited a young barrister, Anthony Marreco, who was the son of a friend of his, to help the British team with the heavy workload.\n\n\n==== Defence counsel ====\nThe vast majority of the defense attorneys were German lawyers. These included Georg Fr\u00f6schmann, Heinz Fritz (Hans Fritzsche), Otto Kranzb\u00fchler (Karl D\u00f6nitz), Otto Pannenbecker (Wilhelm Frick), Alfred Thoma (Alfred Rosenberg), Kurt Kauffmann (Ernst Kaltenbrunner), Hans Laternser (general staff and high command), Franz Exner (Alfred Jodl), Alfred Seidl (Hans Frank), Otto Stahmer (Hermann G\u00f6ring), Walter Ballas (Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach), Hans Fl\u00e4chsner (Albert Speer), G\u00fcnther von Rohrscheidt (Rudolf Hess), Egon Kubuschok (Franz von Papen), Robert Servatius (Fritz Sauckel), Fritz Sauter (Joachim von Ribbentrop), Walther Funk (Baldur von Schirach), Hanns Marx (Julius Streicher), Otto Nelte (Wilhelm Keitel), and Herbert Kraus/Rudolph Dix (both working for Hjalmar Schacht). The main counsel were supported by a total of 70 assistants, clerks and lawyers. The defense witnesses included several men who took part in war crimes themselves during World War II, such as Rudolf H\u00f6ss. The men testifying for the defense hoped to receive more lenient sentences. All of the men testifying on behalf of the defense were found guilty on several counts.\n\n\n== The trial ==\nThe International Military Tribunal was opened on 19 November 1945 in the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg. The first session was presided over by the Soviet judge, Nikitchenko. The prosecution entered indictments against 24 major war criminals and seven organizations \u2013 the leadership of the Nazi party, the Reich Cabinet, the Schutzstaffel (SS), Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the Gestapo, the Sturmabteilung (SA) and the \"General Staff and High Command\", comprising several categories of senior military officers. These organizations were to be declared \"criminal\" if found guilty.\nThe indictments were for:\n\nParticipation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of a crime against peace\nPlanning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace\nParticipating in War crimes\nCrimes against humanityThe 24 accused were, with respect to each charge, either indicted but not convicted (I), indicted and found guilty (G), or not charged (\u2014), as listed below by defendant, charge, and eventual outcome:\n\n\n== Intelligence tests and psychiatric assessments ==\nThe Rorschach test was administered to the defendants, along with the Thematic Apperception Test and a German adaptation of the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Test. All were scored as having above average intelligence, several considerably so.\n\nThroughout the trials, specifically between January and July 1946, the defendants and a number of witnesses were interviewed by American psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn.

Twelve of the accused were sentenced to death, seven received prison sentences (ranging from 10 years to life sentence), three were acquitted, and two were not charged.\n\n\n== Executions ==\n\nThe death sentences were carried out on 16 October 1946 by hanging using the standard drop method instead of long drop. The U.S. Army denied claims that the drop length was too short, which may cause the condemned to die slowly from strangulation instead of quickly from a broken neck, but evidence remains that some of the condemned men choked in agony for 14 to 28 minutes. The executioner was John C. Woods. The executions took place in the gymnasium of the court building (demolished in 1983).Although the rumor has long persisted that the bodies were taken to Dachau and burned there, they were actually incinerated in a crematorium in Munich, and the ashes scattered over the river Isar. The French judges suggested that the military condemned (G\u00f6ring, Keitel and Jodl) be shot by a firing squad, as is standard for military courts-martial, but this was opposed by Biddle and the Soviet judges, who argued that the military officers had violated their military ethos and were not worthy of the more dignified death by shooting. The prisoners sentenced to incarceration were transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947.\nOf the 12 defendants sentenced to death by hanging, two were not hanged: Martin Bormann was convicted in absentia (he had, unknown to the Allies, died while trying to escape from Berlin in May 1945), and Hermann G\u00f6ring committed suicide the night before the execution. The remaining 10 defendants sentenced to death were hanged.\n\n\n== Nuremberg principles ==\nThe definition of what constitutes a war crime is described by the Nuremberg principles, a set of guidelines document which was created as a result of the trial. The medical experiments conducted by German doctors and prosecuted in the so-called Doctors' Trial led to the creation of the Nuremberg Code to control future trials involving human subjects, a set of research ethics principles for human experimentation.\nOf the indicted organizations the following were found not to be criminal:\n\nReichsregierung\n\"The General Staff and High Command\" was found not to comprise a group or organization as defined by Article 9 of the London Charter 14 Members of the High Command were tried as Criminals at the high command trial case 12 of the Subsequent Nuremberg ProceedingsSturmabteilung\n\n\n== Subsidiary and related trials ==\nThe American authorities conducted subsequent Nuremberg Trials in their occupied zone.\nOther trials conducted after the first Nuremberg trial include the following:\n\nAuschwitz trial\nBelsen trial\nBelzec trial before the 1st Munich District Court in the mid-1960s, of eight SS men of the Belzec extermination camp\nChe\u0142mno trials of the Che\u0142mno extermination camp personnel, held in Poland and in Germany. The cases were decided almost twenty years apart\nDachau trials\nFrankfurt Auschwitz trials\nMajdanek trials, the longest Nazi war crimes trial in history, spanning over 30 years\nMauthausen-Gusen camp trials\nHamburg Ravensbr\u00fcck trials\nSobib\u00f3r trial held in Hagen, Germany, in 1965 against the SS men of the Sobibor extermination camp\nTreblinka trials in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n\n\n== American role in the trial ==\n\nWhile Sir Geoffrey Lawrence of Britain was the judge who was chosen to serve as the president of the court, arguably, the most prominent of the judges at the trial was his American counterpart, Francis Biddle. Prior to the trial, Biddle had been Attorney General of the United States but had been asked to resign by Truman earlier in 1945.Some accounts argue that Truman had appointed Biddle as the main American judge for the trial as an apology for asking for his resignation. Ironically, Biddle was known during his time as Attorney General for opposing the idea of prosecuting Nazi leaders for crimes committed before the beginning of the war, even sending out a memorandum on 5 January 1945 on the subject. The note also expressed Biddle's opinion that instead of proceeding with the original plan for prosecuting entire organizations, there should simply be more trials that would prosecute specific offenders.Biddle soon changed his mind, as he approved a modified version of the plan on 21 January 1945, likely due to time constraints, since the trial would be one of the main issues which was to be discussed at Yalta. At trial, the Nuremberg tribunal ruled that any member of an organization convicted of war crimes, such as the SS or Gestapo, who had joined after 1939 would be considered a war criminal. Biddle managed to convince the other judges to make an exemption for any member who was drafted or had no knowledge of the crimes being committed by these organizations.Justice Robert H. Jackson played an important role in not only the trial itself, but also in the creation of the International Military Tribunal, as he led the American delegation to London that, in the summer of 1945, argued in favour of prosecuting the Nazi leadership as a criminal conspiracy. According to Airey Neave, Jackson was also the one behind the prosecution's decision to include membership in any of the six criminal organizations in the indictments at the trial, though the IMT rejected this on the grounds that it was wholly without precedent in either international law or the domestic laws of any of the Allies. Jackson also attempted to have Alfried Krupp be tried in place of his father, Gustav, and even suggested that Alfried volunteer to be tried in his father's place. Both proposals were rejected by the IMT, particularly by Lawrence and Biddle, and some sources indicate that this resulted in Jackson being viewed unfavourably by the latter.Thomas Dodd was a prosecutor for the United States. There was an immense amount of evidence backing the prosecutors' case, especially since meticulous records of the Nazis' actions had been kept. There were records taken in by the prosecutors that had signatures from specific Nazis signing for everything from stationery supplies to Zyklon B gas, which was used to kill the inmates of the deathcamps. Thomas Dodd showed a series of pictures to the courtroom after reading through the documents of crimes committed by the defendants. The showing consisted of pictures displaying the atrocities performed by the defendants. The pictures had been gathered when the inmates were liberated from the concentration camps.Henry F. Gerecke, a Lutheran pastor, and Sixtus O'Connor, a Roman Catholic priest, were sent to minister to the Nazi defendants. Photographs of the trial were taken by a team of about a dozen US Army still photographers, under the direction of chief photographer Ray D'Addario.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nThe Tribunal is celebrated for establishing that \"crimes against international law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced.\" The creation of the IMT was followed by trials of lesser Nazi officials and the trials of Nazi doctors, who performed experiments on people in prison camps. It served as the model for the International Military Tribunal for the Far East which tried Japanese officials for crimes against peace and crimes against humanity. It also served as the model for the Eichmann trial and for present-day courts at The Hague, for trying crimes committed during the Balkan wars of the early 1990s, and at Arusha, for trying the people responsible for the genocide in Rwanda.\nThe Nuremberg trials had a great influence on the development of international criminal law. The Conclusions of the Nuremberg trials served as models for:\n\nThe Genocide Convention, 1948.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948.\nThe Nuremberg Principles, 1950.\nThe Convention on the Abolition of the Statute of Limitations on War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, 1968.\nThe Geneva Convention on the Laws and Customs of War, 1949; its supplementary protocols, 1977.The International Law Commission, acting on the request of the United Nations General Assembly, produced in 1950 the report Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the N\u00fcrnberg Tribunal and in the Judgement of the Tribunal (Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1950, vol. II). See Nuremberg Principles.\nThe influence of the tribunal can also be seen in the proposals for a permanent international criminal court, and the drafting of international criminal codes, later prepared by the International Law Commission.\nTourists can visit courtroom 600 on days when no trial is on. A permanent exhibition has been dedicated to the trials.\n\n\n=== Establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court ===\nThe Nuremberg trials initiated a movement for the prompt establishment of a permanent international criminal court, eventually leading over fifty years later to the adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. This movement was brought about because during the trials, there were conflicting court methods between the German court system and the U.S. court system. The crime of conspiracy was unheard of in the civil law systems of the Continent. Therefore, the German defense found it unfair to charge the defendants with conspiracy to commit crimes, while the judges from common-law countries were used to doing so.\n It [IMT] was the first successful international criminal court, and has since played a pivotal role in the development of international criminal law and international institutions.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nCritics of the Nuremberg trials argued that the charges against the defendants were only defined as \"crimes\" after they were committed and that therefore the trial was invalid, and thus seen as a form of \"victor's justice\".As Michael Biddiss observed in a 1995 edition of History Today, \"the Nuremberg Trial continues to haunt us. ... It is a question also of the weaknesses and strengths of the proceedings themselves.\"\nQuincy Wright, writing eighteen months after the conclusion of the IMT, explained the opposition to the Tribunal thus:The assumptions underlying the Charter of the United Nations, the Statute of the International Court of Justice, and the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal are far removed from the positivistic assumptions which greatly influenced the thought of international jurists in the nineteenth century. Consequently, the activities of those institutions have frequently been vigorously criticized by positivistic jurists ... [who] have asked: How can principles enunciated by the Nuremberg Tribunal, to take it as an example, be of legal value until most of the states have agreed to a tribunal with jurisdiction to enforce those principles? How could the Nuremberg Tribunal have obtained jurisdiction to find Germany guilty of aggression, when Germany had not consented to the Tribunal? How could the law, first explicitly accepted in the Nuremberg Charter of 1945, have bound the defendants in the trial when they committed the acts for which they were indicted years earlier?Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Harlan Fiske Stone called the Nuremberg trials a fraud. \"(Chief U.S. prosecutor) Jackson is away conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg, ... I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas\", Stone wrote.Jackson, in a letter discussing the weaknesses of the trial, in October 1945 told U.S. President Harry S. Truman that the Allies themselves \"have done or are doing some of the very things we are prosecuting the Germans for. The French are so violating the Geneva Convention in the treatment of prisoners of war that our command is taking back prisoners sent to them. We are prosecuting plunder and our Allies are practising it. We say aggressive war is a crime and one of our allies asserts sovereignty over the Baltic States based on no title except conquest.\"Associate Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas charged that the Allies were guilty of \"substituting power for principle\" at Nuremberg. \"I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled,\" he wrote. \"Law was created ex post facto to suit the passion and clamor of the time.\"U.S. Deputy Chief Counsel Abraham Pomerantz resigned in protest at the low caliber of the judges assigned to try the industrial war criminals, such as those at I.G. Farben.Robert A. Taft, a US Senate Majority Leader from Ohio and son of William Howard Taft, criticized the Nuremberg Trials for trying Nazi war criminals under ex post facto laws, which resulted in his failure to secure the Republican nomination for President in 1948.A number of Germans who agreed with the idea of punishment for war crimes admitted trepidation concerning the trials. A contemporary German jurist said:\n\nThat the defendants at Nuremberg were held responsible, condemned and punished, will seem to most of us initially as a kind of historical justice. However, no one who takes the question of guilt seriously, above all no responsibly thoughtful jurist, will be content with this sensibility nor should they be allowed to be. Justice is not served when the guilty parties are punished in any old way, even if this seems appropriate with regard to their measure of guilt. Justice is only served when the guilty are punished in a way that carefully and conscientiously considers their criminal errors according to the provisions of valid law under the jurisdiction of a legally appointed judge.\nThe validity of the court has been questioned on a number of grounds:\n\n\n=== Legitimacy ===\n\nOne criticism that was made of the IMT was that some treaties were not binding on the Axis powers because they were not signatories. This was addressed in the judgment relating to war crimes and crimes against humanity, which contains an expansion of customary law: \"the [Hague] Convention expressly stated that it was an attempt 'to revise the general laws and customs of war,' which it thus recognised to be then existing, but by 1939 these rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war which are referred to in Article 6 (b) of the [London] Charter.\"\n\n\n== Introduction of extempore simultaneous interpretation ==\n\nThe Nuremberg Trials employed four official languages: English, French, German and Russian. In order to address the complex linguistic issues that clouded over the proceedings, interpretation and translation departments had to be established. However, it was feared that consecutive interpretation would slow down the proceedings significantly. What is therefore unique in both the Nuremberg tribunals and history of the interpretation profession was the introduction of an entirely new technique, extempore simultaneous interpretation. This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter to listen to a speaker in a source (or passive) language and orally translate that speech into another language in real time, that is, simultaneously, through headsets and microphones. Interpreters were split into four sections, one for each official language, with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth (their mother tongue). For instance, the English booth consisted of three interpreters, one working from German into English, one working from French, and one from Russian, etc. Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with consecutive court interpreters. Some of the languages heard over the course of the proceedings included Yiddish, Hungarian, Czech, Ukrainian, and Polish.\nThe equipment used to establish this system was provided by IBM, and included an elaborate setup of cables which were hooked up to headsets and single earphones directly from the four interpreting booths (often referred to as \"the aquarium\"). Four channels existed for each working language, as well as a root channel for the proceedings without interpretation. Switching of channels was controlled by a setup at each table in which the listener merely had to turn a dial in order to switch between languages. People tripping over the floor-laid cables often led to the headsets getting disconnected, with several hours at a time sometimes being taken in order to repair the problem and continue on with the trials.\nInterpreters were recruited and examined by the respective countries in which the official languages were spoken: the United States, United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, as well as in special cases Belgium and the Netherlands. Many were former translators, army personnel, and linguists, some were experienced consecutive interpreters, others were ordinary individuals and even recent secondary school-graduates who led international lives in multilingual environments. It was, and still is believed, that the qualities that made the best interpreters were not just a perfect understanding of two or more languages, but more importantly a broad sense of culture, encyclopedic knowledge, inquisitiveness, as well as a naturally calm disposition.\n\nWith the simultaneous technique being extremely new, interpreters practically trained themselves, but many could not handle the pressure or the psychological strain. Many often had to be replaced, many returned to the translation department, and many left. Serious doubts were given as to whether interpretation provided a fair trial for the defendants, particularly because of fears of mistranslation and errors made on transcripts. The translation department had to also deal with the overwhelming problem of being understaffed and overburdened with an influx of documents that could not be kept up with. More often than not, interpreters were stuck in a session without having proper documents in front of them and were relied upon to do sight translation or double translation of texts, causing further problems and extensive criticism. Other problems that arose included complaints from lawyers and other legal professionals with regard to questioning and cross-examination. Legal professionals were most often appalled at the slower speed at which they had to conduct their task because of the extended time required for interpreters to render an interpretation properly. Additionally, a number of interpreters protested the idea of using vulgar language, especially if it referred to Jews or the conditions of the Nazi concentration camps. Bilingual/trilingual members who attended the trials picked up quickly on this aspect of character and were equally quick to file complaints.\nYet, despite the extensive trial and error, without the interpretation system the trials would not have been possible and in turn revolutionized the way multilingual issues were addressed in tribunals and conferences. A number of the interpreters following the trials were immediately recruited into the newly formed United Nations, while others returned to their ordinary lives, pursued other careers, or worked freelance. Outside the boundaries of the trials, many interpreters continued their positions on weekends interpreting for dinners, private meetings between judges, and excursions between delegates. Others worked as investigators or editors, or aided the translation department when they could, often using it as an opportunity to sharpen their skills and to correct poor interpretations on transcripts before they were available for public record.\nFor further reference, a book titled The Origins of Simultaneous Interpretation: The Nuremberg Trial, written by interpreter Francesca Gaiba, was published by the University of Ottawa Press in 1998.\nToday, all major international organizations, as well as any conference or government that uses more than one official language, uses extempore simultaneous interpretation. Notable bodies include the Parliament of Kosovo with three official languages, the Parliament of Canada with two official languages, the Parliament of South Africa with eleven official languages, the European Union with twenty-four official languages, and the United Nations with six official working languages.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNuremberg Trials bibliography\nCommand responsibility\nDora Trial\nEichmann in Jerusalem\nEinsatzgruppen Trial\nInternational Military Tribunal for the Far East\nJudgment at Nuremberg (1961 film)\nNuremberg (2000 film)\nList of Axis personnel indicted for war crimes\nNuremberg Diary, an account of observations and discussions with the defendants by an American psychiatrist\nResearch Materials: Max Planck Society Archive\nSuperior orders\nTokyo War Crimes Tribunal\nTransitional justice\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n==== Avalon Project ====\nThese citations refer to documents at \"The International Military Tribunal for Germany\".

        "wiki": "Nuremberg ( NEWR-\u0259m-burg; German: N\u00fcrnberg [\u02c8n\u028f\u0281nb\u025b\u0281k] (listen); Bavarian: Niamberg; East Franconian: N\u00e4rrnberch or N\u00e4mberch, locally N\u00e4rmberch) is the second-largest city of the German federal state of Bavaria after its capital Munich, and its 511,628 (2016) inhabitants make it the 14th largest city in Germany. On the Pegnitz River (from its confluence with the Rednitz in F\u00fcrth onwards: Regnitz, a tributary of the River Main) and the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal, it lies in the Bavarian administrative region of Middle Franconia, and is the largest city and the unofficial capital of Franconia. Nuremberg forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring cities of F\u00fcrth, Erlangen and Schwabach with a total population of 798,867 (2018), while the larger Nuremberg Metropolitan Region has approximately 3.6 million inhabitants. The city lies about 170 kilometres (110 mi) north of Munich. It is the largest city in the East Franconian dialect area (colloquially: \"Franconian\"; German: Fr\u00e4nkisch), Nuremberg was one of the host cities of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nThere are many institutions of higher education in the city, including the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg). With 39,780 students in 2017, it is Bavaria's third-largest and Germany's 11th-largest university, with campuses in Erlangen and Nuremberg and a university hospital in Erlangen (Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen). Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg Georg Simon Ohm and Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg are also located within the city. Nuremberg Airport (Flughafen N\u00fcrnberg \u201cAlbrecht D\u00fcrer\u201c) is the second-busiest airport in Bavaria after Munich Airport, and the tenth-busiest airport in Germany.\nStaatstheater N\u00fcrnberg is one of the five Bavarian state theatres, showing operas, operettas, musicals, and ballets (main venue: Nuremberg Opera House), plays (main venue: Schauspielhaus N\u00fcrnberg), as well as concerts (main venue: Meistersingerhalle). Its orchestra, Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg, is Bavaria's second-largest opera orchestra after the Bavarian State Opera's Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich. Nuremberg is the birthplace of Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Johann Pachelbel.\nNuremberg was the site of major Nazi rallies, and it provided the site for the Nuremberg trials, which held to account many major Nazi officials.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe first documentary mention of the city, in 1050, mentions Nuremberg as the location of an Imperial castle between the East Franks and the Bavarian March of the Nordgau. From 1050 to 1571 the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade-routes. King Conrad III (reigning as King of Germany from 1138 to 1152) established the Burgraviate of Nuremberg, with the first burgraves coming from the Austrian House of Raab. With the extinction of their male line around 1190, the last Raabs count's son-in-law, Frederick I from the House of Hohenzollern, inherited the burgraviate in 1192.\nFrom the late 12th century to the Interregnum (1254\u201373), however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Hohenstaufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor (German: Reichsschulthei\u00df) from 1173/74. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city.\n \nNuremberg is often referred to as the \"unofficial capital\" of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly because the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg played an important role in the administration of the empire. The increasing demands of the Imperial court and the increasing importance of the city attracted increased trade and commerce in Nuremberg. In 1219 Emperor Frederick II granted the Gro\u00dfen Freiheitsbrief ('Great Letter of Freedom'), including town rights, Imperial immediacy (Reichsfreiheit), the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy - almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves. Nuremberg soon became, with Augsburg, one of the two great trade-centers on the route from Italy to Northern Europe.\nIn 1298 the Jews of the town were falsely accused of having desecrated the host, and 698 of them were killed in one of the many Rintfleisch massacres. Behind the massacre of 1298 was also the desire to combine the northern and southern parts of the city, which were divided by the Pegnitz. The Jews of the German lands suffered many massacres during the plague pandemic of the mid-14th century.\nIn 1349 Nuremberg's Jews suffered a pogrom. They were burned at the stake or expelled, and a marketplace was built over the former Jewish quarter. The plague returned to the city in 1405, 1435, 1437, 1482, 1494, 1520 and 1534.\n\nThe largest growth of Nuremberg occurred in the 14th century. Charles IV's Golden Bull of 1356, naming Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet, made Nuremberg one of the three most important cities of the Empire. Charles was the patron of the Frauenkirche, built between 1352 and 1362 (the architect was likely Peter Parler), where the Imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg. The royal and Imperial connection grew stronger in 1423 when the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg granted the Imperial regalia to be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 1796, when the advance of French troops required their removal to Regensburg and thence to Vienna.In 1349 the members of the guilds unsuccessfully rebelled against the patricians in a Handwerkeraufstand ('Craftsmen's Uprising'), supported by merchants and some by councillors, leading to a ban on any self-organisation of the artisans in the city, abolishing the guilds that were customary elsewhere in Europe; the unions were then dissolved, and the oligarchs remained in power while Nuremberg was a free city (until the early-19th century). Charles IV conferred upon the city the right to conclude alliances independently, thereby placing it upon a politically equal footing with the princes of the Empire. Frequent fights took place with the burgraves - without, however, inflicting lasting damage upon the city. After fire destroyed the castle in 1420 during a feud between Frederick IV (from 1417 Margrave of Brandenburg) and the duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, the city purchased the ruins and the forest belonging to the castle (1427), resulting in the city's total sovereignty within its borders.\nThrough these and other acquisitions the city accumulated considerable territory. The Hussite Wars (1419-1434), a recurrence of the Black Death in 1437, and the First Margrave War (1449-1450) led to a severe fall in population in the mid-15th century. Siding with Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria-Munich, in the Landshut War of Succession of 1503-1505 led the city to gain substantial territory, resulting in lands of 25 sq mi (64.7 km2), making it one of the largest Imperial cities.During the Middle Ages, Nuremberg fostered a rich, varied, and influential literary culture.\n\n\n=== Early modern age ===\n\nThe cultural flowering of Nuremberg, in the 15th and 16th centuries, made it the centre of the German Renaissance. In 1525, Nuremberg accepted the Protestant Reformation, and in 1532, the Nuremberg Religious Peace was signed there, preventing war between Protestants and Catholics for 15 years. During the 1552 revolution against Charles V, Nuremberg tried to purchase its neutrality, but the city was attacked without a declaration of war and was forced into a disadvantageous peace. At the Peace of Augsburg, the possessions of the Protestants were confirmed by the Emperor, their religious privileges extended and their independence from the Bishop of Bamberg affirmed, while the 1520s' secularisation of the monasteries was also approved. Families like the Tucher, Imhoff or Haller run trading businesses across Europe, similar to the Fugger and Welser families from Augsburg, although on a slightly smaller scale. \n\nThe state of affairs in the early 16th century, increased trade routes elsewhere and the ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade. During the Thirty Years' War, frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and League soldiers, the financial costs of the war and the cessation of trade caused irreparable damage to the city and a near-halving of the population. In 1632, the city, occupied by the forces of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, was besieged by the army of Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein. The city declined after the war and recovered its importance only in the 19th century, when it grew as an industrial centre. Even after the Thirty Years' War, however, there was a late flowering of architecture and culture \u2013 secular Baroque architecture is exemplified in the layout of the civic gardens built outside the city walls, and in the Protestant city's rebuilding of St. Egidien church, destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century, considered a significant contribution to the baroque church architecture of Middle Franconia.After the Thirty Years' War, Nuremberg attempted to remain detached from external affairs, but contributions were demanded for the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War and restrictions of imports and exports deprived the city of many markets for its manufactures. The Bavarian elector, Charles Theodore, appropriated part of the land obtained by the city during the Landshut War of Succession, to which Bavaria had maintained its claim; Prussia also claimed part of the territory. Realising its weakness, the city asked to be incorporated into Prussia but Frederick William II refused, fearing to offend Austria, Russia and France. At the Imperial diet in 1803, the independence of Nuremberg was affirmed, but on the signing of the Confederation of the Rhine on 12 July 1806, it was agreed to hand the city over to Bavaria from 8 September, with Bavaria guaranteeing the amortisation of the city's 12.5 million guilder public debt.\n\n\n=== After the Napoleonic Wars ===\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the city's trade and commerce revived; the skill of its inhabitants together with its favourable situation soon made the city prosperous, particularly after its public debt had been acknowledged as a part of the Bavarian national debt. Having been incorporated into a Catholic country, the city was compelled to refrain from further discrimination against Catholics, who had been excluded from the rights of citizenship. Catholic services had been celebrated in the city by the priests of the Teutonic Order, often under great difficulties. After their possessions had been confiscated by the Bavarian government in 1806, they were given the Frauenkirche on the Market in 1809; in 1810 the first Catholic parish was established, which in 1818 numbered 1,010 souls.In 1817, the city was incorporated into the district of Rezatkreis (named for the river Franconian Rezat), which was renamed to Middle Franconia (German: Mittelfranken) on 1 January 1838. The first German railway, the Bavarian Ludwigsbahn, from Nuremberg to nearby F\u00fcrth, was opened in 1835. The establishment of railways and the incorporation of Bavaria into Zollverein (the 19th-century German Customs Union), commerce and industry opened the way to greater prosperity. In 1852, there were 53,638 inhabitants: 46,441 Protestants and 6,616 Catholics. It subsequently grew to become the more important industrial city of Southern Germany, one of the most prosperous towns of southern Germany, but after the Austro-Prussian War it was given to the Prussia as part of their telegraph stations they had to give up. In 1905, its population, including several incorporated suburbs, was 291,351: 86,943 Catholics, 196,913 Protestants, 3,738 Jews and 3,766 members of other creeds.\n\n\n=== Nazi era ===\n\nNuremberg held great significance during the Nazi Germany era. Because of the city's relevance to the Holy Roman Empire and its position in the centre of Germany, the Nazi Party chose the city to be the site of huge Nazi Party conventions \u2014 the Nuremberg rallies. The rallies were held in 1927, 1929 and annually from  1933 through 1938. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 the Nuremberg rallies became huge Nazi propaganda events, a centre of Nazi ideals. The 1934 rally was filmed by Leni Riefenstahl, and made into a propaganda film called Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will).\nAt the 1935 rally, Hitler specifically ordered the Reichstag to convene at Nuremberg to pass the Nuremberg Laws which revoked German citizenship for all Jews and other non-Aryans. A number of premises were constructed solely for these assemblies, some of which were not finished. Today many examples of Nazi architecture can still be seen in the city. The city was also the home of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher, the publisher of Der St\u00fcrmer.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Nuremberg was the headquarters of Wehrkreis (military district) XIII, and an important site for military production, including aircraft, submarines and tank engines. A subcamp of Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp was located here, and extensively used slave labour. The city was severely damaged in Allied strategic bombing from 1943 to 1945. On 29 March 1944, the RAF endured its heaviest losses in the bombing campaign of Germany. Out of more than 700 planes participating, 106 were shot down or crash-landed on the way home to their bases, and more than 700 men were missing, as many as 545 of them dead. More than 160 became prisoners of war.On 2 January 1945, the medieval city centre was systematically bombed by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Army Air Forces and about ninety percent of it was destroyed in only one hour, with 1,800 residents killed and roughly 100,000 displaced. In February 1945, additional attacks followed. In total, about 6,000 Nuremberg residents are estimated to have been killed in air raids.\nNuremberg was a heavily fortified city that was captured in a fierce battle lasting from 17 to 21 April 1945 by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, 42nd Infantry Division and 45th Infantry Division, which fought house-to-house and street-by-street against determined German resistance, causing further urban devastation to the already bombed and shelled buildings. Despite this intense degree of destruction, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent restored to its pre-war appearance, including the reconstruction of some of its medieval buildings. Much of this reconstructive work and conservation was done by the organisation 'Old Town Friends Nuremberg'. However, over half of the historic look of the center, and especially the northeastern half of the old Imperial Free City was not restored.\n\n\n=== Nuremberg trials ===\n\nBetween 1945 and 1946, German officials involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity were brought before an international tribunal in the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union had wanted these trials to take place in Berlin. However, Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trials for specific reasons:\n\nThe city had been the location of the Nazi Party's Nuremberg rallies and the laws stripping Jews of their citizenship were passed there. There was symbolic value in making it the place of Nazi demise.\nThe Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few that had remained largely intact despite extensive Allied bombing of Germany). The already large courtroom was reasonably easily expanded by the removal of the wall at the end opposite the bench, thereby incorporating the adjoining room. A large prison was also part of the complex.\nAs a compromise, it was agreed that Berlin would become the permanent seat of the International Military Tribunal and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg. Due to the Cold War, subsequent trials never took place.Following the trials, in October 1946, several prominent German Nazi politicians and military leaders were executed in Nuremberg.\nThe same courtroom in Nuremberg was the venue of the Nuremberg Military Tribunals, organized by the United States as occupying power in the area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSeveral old villages now belong to the city, for example Grossgr\u00fcndlach, Kraftshof, Thon, and Neunhof in the north-west; Ziegelstein in the northeast, Altenfurt and Fischbach in the south-east; and Katzwang, Kornburg in the south. Langwasser is a modern suburb.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNuremberg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) with a certain humid continental influence (Dfb), categorized in the latter by the 0 \u00b0C isotherm. The city's climate is influenced by its inland position and higher altitude. Winters are changeable, with either mild or cold weather: the average temperature is around \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) to 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F), while summers are generally warm, mostly around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the afternoon. Precipitation is evenly spread throughout the year, although February and April tend to be a bit drier whereas July tends to have more rainfall.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNuremberg has been a destination for immigrants. 39.5% of the residents had an immigrant background in 2010 (counted with MigraPro).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nNuremberg for many people is still associated with its traditional gingerbread (Lebkuchen) products, sausages, and handmade toys. Pocket watches \u2014 Nuremberg eggs \u2014 were made here in the 16th century by Peter Henlein. Only one of the districts in the 1797-1801 sample was early industrial; the economic structure of the region around Nuremberg was dominated by metal and glass manufacturing, reflected by a share of nearly 50% handicrafts and workers. In the 19th century Nuremberg became the \"industrial heart\" of Bavaria with companies such as Siemens and MAN establishing a strong base in the city.  Nuremberg is still an important industrial centre with a strong standing in the markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Items manufactured in the area include electrical equipment, mechanical and optical products, motor vehicles, writing and drawing paraphernalia, stationery products and printed materials.\nThe city is also strong in the fields of automation, energy and medical technology. Siemens is still the largest industrial employer in the Nuremberg region but a good third of German market research agencies are also located in the city. The Nuremberg International Toy Fair is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nNuremberg is Bavaria\u2019s second largest city after Munich, and a popular tourist destination for foreigners and Germans alike. It was a leading city 500 years ago, but 90% of the town was destroyed in 1945 during the war. After World War II, many medieval-style areas of the town were rebuilt.\n\n\n===== Attractions =====\nBeyond its main attractions of the Imperial Castle, St. Lorenz Church, and Nazi Trial grounds, there are 54 different museums for arts and culture, history, science and technology, family and children, and more niche categories, where visitors can see the world's oldest globe (built in 1492), a 500-year-old Madonna, and Renaissance-era German art. There are several types of tours offered in the city, including historic tours, those that are Nazi-focused, underground and night tours, walking tours, sightseeing buses, self guided tours, and an old town tour on a mini train. Nuremberg also offers several parks and green areas, as well as indoor activities such as bowling, rock wall climbing, escape rooms, cart racing, and mini golf, theaters and cinemas, pools and thermal spas. There are also six nearby amusement parks. The city's tourism board sells the Nurnberg Card which allows for free use of public transportation and free entry to all museums and attractions in Nuremberg for a two-day period.\n\n\n===== Culinary Tourism =====\nNuremberg is also a destination for food lovers. Culinary tourists can taste the city's famous lebkuchen, gingerbread, local beer, and N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrstchen, or Nuremberg sausages. There are hundreds of restaurants for all tastes, including traditional franconian restaurants and beer gardens. Also offers 17 vegan and vegetarian restaurants, seven fully organic restaurants. Nuremberg also boasts a two Michelin Star rated restaurant, Essigbr\u00e4tlein.\n\n\n===== Pedestrian zones =====\nLike many European cities, Nuremberg offers a pedestrian-only zone covering a large portion of the old town, which is a main destination for shopping and specialty retail, including year-round Christmas stores where tourists and locals alike can purchase Christmas ornaments, gifts, decorations, and additions to their toy Christmas villages. The Craftsmen's Courtyard, or Handwerkerhof, is another tourist shopping destination in the style of a medieval village. It houses several local family-run businesses which sell handcrafted items from glass, wood, leather, pottery, and precious metals. The Handwerkerhof is also home to traditional German restaurants and beer gardens.The Pedestrian zones of Nuremberg host festivals and markets throughout the year, most well known being Christkindlesmarkt, Germany's largest Christmas market and the gingerbread capital of the world. Visitors to the Christmas market can peruse the hundreds of stalls and purchase local wood crafts, nutcrackers, smokers, and prune people, while sampling Christmas sweets and traditional gluhwein.\n\n\n===== Hospitality =====\nIn 2017, Nuremberg saw a total of 3.3 million overnight stays, a record for the town, and is expected to have surpassed that in 2018, with more growth in tourism anticipated in the coming years. There are over 175 registered places of accommodation in Nuremberg, ranging from hostels to luxury hotels, bed and breakfasts, to multi-hundred room properties. As of 19 April 2019, Nuremberg had 306 AirBnB listings.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nNuremberg was an early centre of humanism, science, printing, and mechanical invention. The city contributed much to the science of astronomy. In 1471 Johannes Mueller of K\u00f6nigsberg (Bavaria), later called Regiomontanus, built an astronomical observatory in Nuremberg and published many important astronomical charts.\nIn 1515, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, a native of Nuremberg, created woodcuts of the first maps of the stars of the northern and southern hemispheres, producing the first printed star charts, which had been ordered by Johannes Stabius. Around 1515 D\u00fcrer also published the \"Stabiussche Weltkarte\", the first perspective drawing of the terrestrial globe.Printers and publishers have a long history in Nuremberg. Many of these publishers worked with well-known artists of the day to produce books that could also be considered works of art. In 1470 Anton Koberger opened Europe's first print shop in Nuremberg. In 1493, he published the Nuremberg Chronicles, also known as the World Chronicles (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated history of the world from the creation to the present day. It was written in the local Franconian dialect by Hartmann Schedel and had illustrations by Michael Wohlgemuth, Wilhelm Pleydenwurff, and Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Others furthered geographical knowledge and travel by map making. Notable among these was navigator and geographer Martin Behaim, who made the first world globe.\nSculptors such as Veit Stoss, Adam Kraft and Peter Vischer are also associated with Nuremberg.\nComposed of prosperous artisans, the guilds of the Meistersingers flourished here. Richard Wagner made their most famous member, Hans Sachs, the hero of his opera Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel was born here and was organist of St. Sebaldus Church.\nThe academy of fine arts situated in Nuremberg is the oldest art academy in central Europe and looks back to a tradition of 350 years of artistic education.\nNuremberg is also famous for its Christkindlesmarkt (Christmas market), which draws well over a million shoppers each year.  The market is famous for its handmade ornaments and delicacies.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n \nGermanisches Nationalmuseum\nHouse of Albrecht D\u00fcrer\nKunsthalle N\u00fcrnberg\nKunstverein N\u00fcrnberg\nNeues Museum N\u00fcrnberg (Modern Art Museum)\nNuremberg Toy Museum\nNuremberg Transport Museum\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nThe Nuremberg State Theatre, founded in 1906, is dedicated to all types of opera, ballet and stage theatre. During the season 2009/2010, the theatre presented 651 performances for an audience of 240,000 persons. The State Philharmonic Nuremberg (Staatsphilharmonie N\u00fcrnberg) is the orchestra of the State Theatre. Its name was changed in 2011 from its previous name: The Nuremberg Philharmonic (N\u00fcrnberger Philharmoniker). It is the second-largest opera orchestra in Bavaria. Besides opera performances, it also presents its own subscription concert series in the Meistersingerhalle. Christof Perick was the principal conductor of the orchestra between 2006\u20132011. Marcus Bosch heads the orchestra since September 2011  .\nThe Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra (N\u00fcrnberger Symphoniker) performs around 100 concerts a year to a combined annual audience of more than 180,000. The regular subscription concert series are mostly performed in the Meistersingerhalle but other venues are used as well, including the new concert hall of the Kongresshalle and the Serenadenhof. Alexander Shelley has been the principal conductor of the orchestra since 2009.\nThe Nuremberg International Chamber Music Festival (Internationales Kammermusikfestival N\u00fcrnberg) takes place in early September each year, and in 2011 celebrated its tenth anniversary. Concerts take place around the city; opening and closing events are held in the medieval Burg. The Bardentreffen, an annual folk festival in Nuremberg, has been deemed the largest world music festival in Germany and takes place since 1976. 2014 the Bardentreffen starred 368 artists from 31 nations.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nNuremberg is known for N\u00fcrnberger Bratwurst, which is shorter and thinner than other bratwurst sausages.\nAnother Nuremberg speciality is N\u00fcrnberger Lebkuchen, a kind of gingerbread eaten mainly around Christmas time.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nNuremberg offers 51 public and 6 private elementary schools in nearly all of its districts. Secondary education is offered at 23 Mittelschulen, 12 Realschulen, and 17 Gymnasien (state, city, church, and privately owned). There are also several other providers of secondary education such as Berufsschule, Berufsfachschule, Wirtschaftsschule etc.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\nNuremberg hosts the joint university Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, two Fachhochschulen (Technische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg and Evangelische Hochschule N\u00fcrnberg), an art school (Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste N\u00fcrnberg), and a music conservatoire (Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik N\u00fcrnberg). There are also private schools such as the Akademie Deutsche POP N\u00fcrnberg offering higher education.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nNuremberg Castle: the three castles that tower over the city including central burgraves' castle, with Free Reich's buildings to the east, the Imperial castle to the west.\nHeilig-Geist-Spital. In the centre of the city, on the bank of the river Pegnitz, stands the Hospital of the Holy Spirit. Founded in 1332, this is one of the largest hospitals of the Middle Ages.

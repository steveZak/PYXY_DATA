        "wiki": "The Hassan II Mosque (Arabic: \u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a\u200e, French: Grande Mosqu\u00e9e Hassan II) is a mosque in Casablanca, Morocco. It is the largest functioning mosque in Africa and is the 7th largest in the world. Its minaret is the world's second tallest minaret at 210 metres (689 ft). Completed in 1993, it was designed by Michel Pinseau under the guidance of King Hassan II and built by Moroccan artisans from all over the kingdom. The minaret is 60 stories high topped by a laser, the light from which is directed towards Mecca. The mosque stands on a promontory looking out to the Atlantic Ocean; worshippers can pray over the sea but there is no glass floor looking into the sea.  The walls are of hand-crafted marble and the roof is retractable. A maximum of 105,000 worshippers can gather together for prayer: 25,000 inside the mosque hall and another 80,000 on the mosque's outside ground.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe mosque is located at Bd Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdallah in Casablanca.  The 9-hectare (22-acre) complex nestles between the harbor and the El Hank lighthouse.  From the nearest train station at Casa-Port it is about a 20-minute walk to the mosque. The ten-lane boulevard with shopping avenues has its at the southern facade of the mosque and extends to the gates of the Palace Oued el Makhazine in the middle of the city. The basilical plan of the mosque justifies this layout of the boulevard.\n\nThe mosque rises above the Atlantic Ocean. The building is built partially on land and partially over the ocean. This siting was accomplished by creating a platform linking a natural rock outcrop reclaimed from the sea, where a swimming pool had previously been located. Two large breakwaters were also built, to protect the mosque from the erosive action of the ocean waves, which can be up to 10 metres (33 ft) in height. A temporary pier 800 metres (2,600 ft) in length had to be erected to protect the foundations of the pillars from the sea during the construction period. Its environmental advantage is that it is free of noise and pollution and receives a fresh breeze from the sea.Apart from the mosque, other structures in the area are a madrasa (Islamic school), hammams (bathhouses), a museum on Moroccan history, conference halls, and a very large library said to be the \"most comprehensive in the Islamic world.\" The 41 fountains in the courtyard are all well decorated. The garden around the mosque is well tended and is a popular location for family picnics. The traditionally designed madrasa occupies an area of 4,840 square metres (52,100 sq ft) including the basement. Two stories in height, it is constructed in a semi-circular shape, with abutting qibla wall and the mihrab section.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe historical context of the mosque began with the death of King Mohammed V in 1961. King Hassan II had requested for the best of the country's artisans to come forward and submit plans for a mausoleum to honour the departed king; it should \"reflect the fervor and veneration with which this illustrious man was regarded.\" In 1980, during his birthday celebrations, Hassan II had made his ambitions very clear for creating a single landmark monument in Casablanca by stating:\nI wish Casablanca to be endowed with a large, fine building of which it can be proud until the end of time ... I want to build this mosque on the water, because God's throne is on the water. Therefore, the faithful who go there to pray, to praise the creator on firm soil, can contemplate God's sky and ocean.\nThe building was commissioned by King Hassan II to be the most ambitious structure ever built in Morocco. It was designed by the French architect Michel Pinseau who had lived in Morocco, and was constructed by the civil engineering group Bouygues.Work commenced on July 12, 1986, and was conducted over a seven-year period. Construction was scheduled to be completed in 1989 ready for Hassan II's 60th birthday. During the most intense period of construction, 1400 men worked during the day and another 1100 during the night. 10,000 artists and craftsmen participated in building and beautifying the mosque. However, the building was not completed on schedule which delayed inauguration. The formal inauguration was subsequently chosen to be the 11th Rabi' al-Awwal of the year 1414 of the Hijra, corresponding to 30 August 1993, which also marked the eve of the anniversary of Prophet Muhammad\u2019s birth. It was dedicated to the Sovereign of Morocco.\n\n\n=== Financing ===\nConstruction costs, estimated to be about 585 million euro, were an issue of debate in Morocco, a lower mid-income country. While Hassan wished to build a mosque which would be second in size only to the mosque at Mecca, the government lacked funds for such a grand project. Much of the financing was by public subscription. Twelve million people donated to the cause, with a receipt and certificate given to every donor. The smallest contribution was 5 DH. In addition to public donations and those from business establishments and Arab countries (such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia), western countries provided construction loans, which Morocco repaid!\n\n\n== Architecture and fittings ==\nIn the words of the authors of the book Morocco Country Study Guide, the Hassan II Mosque \"undeniably marks the continuity of a modernized ancestral art and bears the sign of innovations that are due not only to technical reasons but also to a fertile exploration of new aesthetic possibilities.\" The building dimensions are 200 metres (660 ft) in length and 100 metres (330 ft) in width. All of the granite, plaster, marble, wood and other materials used in the construction, were extracted from around Morocco, with the exception of some Italian white granite columns and 56 glass chandeliers. Six thousand traditional Moroccan artisans worked for five years to create the abundant and beautiful mosaics, stone and marble floors and columns, sculpted plaster moldings, and carved and painted wood ceilings. The exterior surfaces of the mosque display titanium, bronze, and granite finishes. It is ornamented with pale blue marble and Zellige tilework. A particular feature in the mosque is that all structures are made of reinforced cement concrete and all decorations are of traditional Moroccan design. The construction work involved engagement of 35,000 workers and working of over 50 million hours. The mosque has capacity to accommodate 25,000 devotees for prayers in the main hall and another 80,000 in the plaza squares around it.\n\nNotable architectural features include the conspicuous columns, the horseshoe arches, and the innumerable muqarnas embellishing the ceilings. The dome, arches and walls give a grand ambiance to the mosque. The first-class sound system is discreetly hidden. The ablution room and a vast public hammam are in the basement, with its own entrance. Tadelakt, a plastering technique which adds egg yolks and black soap into mixed plaster, was used in the hammam baths.\n\n\n=== Design ===\nThe building blends Islamic architecture and Moroccan elements, and reflects Moorish influences, while featuring an urban design. It displays elements found in other Moroccan buildings such as the unfinished mosque in Rabat and the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakesh. There are features from an old Roman fort converted into the tomb of King Mohammed V of Rabat. Other elements come from the Tour Hassan Mosque, the Dome of the Rock (also known as Qubbat al Sakhra 688\u2013692 AD), the Great Mosque of Madina (705\u2013710 AD), Kairouan Mosque in Tunisia (663 AD), the Great Mosque of Damascus (705\u2013715 AD), the Great Mosque of Cordoba (785\u2013786 AD), Quarawiyyin Mosque (956 and 1135 AD) in Morocco, the Great Mosque of Tlemcen (1136), and Djamaa el Kebir (1096).  Its layout is known as the basilican plan, which is different from the common practice of a T shaped plan adopted in many North African countries. The qibla wall is perpendicular to the naves which is said to be an unconventional layout, given that it is customary for the rows of worshipers facing Mecca to be as wide as possible rather than extend farther back (Halod and Khan 1997, 61). The adoption of this plan has been described as \"a conflict between King Hassan II the ancient aristocrat and King Hassan II the contemporary leader who must develop commerce and industry in order meet the needs of his country.\"\n\n\n=== Prayer hall ===\n\nThe prayer hall is on the ground floor. The central hall is centrally heated, and provides spectacular underwater views of the Atlantic Ocean. The decorations in the hall are elaborate and exquisite made possible by involving 6000 master artisans of Morocco working on it. It is so large that it can easily accommodate the house of the Notre Dame of Paris or St Peter's of Rome. The woodcarvings, the zellij work and the stucco mouldings are of elaborate and highly impressive design; the wood used for carving is cedar from the middle Atlas mountains, the marble is from Agadir and granite is brought from Tafraoute.The prayer hall is built to a rectangular plan of 200 metres (660 ft) length and 100 metres (330 ft) width with three naves, which are perpendicular to the qibla wall. The central nave of the hall is 40 metres (130 ft) and larger than the side naves which are 27 metres (89 ft) high. The central hall is undulating with a succession of numerous domes from which glass chandeliers, imported from Murano, are hung. On either side of the hall, there are mezzanine floors with carved dark wood furnishings, which are reserved for women. The doors are electrically operated. A \"triptyich marble partition with open work and central window flanked by two smaller sized windows\" are built on the wall of the fa\u00e7ade. Such panels, built with multicolored arches, engraved with ornamented floral designs, appear like a geometrical framework when viewed from the outside. The gates are embellished with marble bars which have faux voussoirs (alternately smooth or sculpted). The pillars of 13 metres (43 ft) height are square in shape with engaged columns and cruciform joining a series of pillars. Geometrically shaped polychromatic zellji with carved plaster are noted with floral and geometric designs with epigraphy. Carved or painted marble or shaped wood are used for these elegant designs, which highlight Islamic art forms.The roof is retractable, illuminating the hall with daytime sunlight and allowing worshippers to pray under the stars on clear nights. It weighs 1100 tons and can be opened in five minutes; it measures 60 metres (200 ft) high, with an area of 3,400 square metres (37,000 sq ft). The roof is covered with cast-aluminium tiles, (similar to the Fez tiles), stronger and more reliable than traditional ceramic tiles, and about 35 percent lighter. The prayer hall is also illuminated by light from the glass gates on the northern wall.\n\n\n=== Minaret ===\n\nAt 210 metres (690 ft) in height the minaret is the second tallest minaret in the world. It has a laser beam fitted at the top, which is electronically operated in the evening. It is oriented towards Mecca, across the sea and has a range of 30 kilometres (19 mi). The minaret is said to enhance the visual alignment of the boulevard. It is square in shape thrusting skyward. The base to the top width ratio of 1 to 8 (between basement and the summit) has a marble covering on the exterior with austere decoration. The faces of the facade have carved ornamentation with different materials. There are stitches of roudani tracetine on a 100,000 MP surface. This decorative material (with chrome and green as dominant colours), is a substitute for the use of bricks, the material used in many other notable minarets, and has given the mosque an extraordinary elegance. Green tiles decorate the minaret for one third of the height from the top, and then changes colour to deep green or turquoise blue; it is said that in the Hassan II minaret, the designer had used his sea-foam green and God\u2019s blue to celebrate the life of a king. The concrete used for the minaret was a special high-grade type, which could perform well under severe conditions of a combined action of strong wind and seismicity. This was achieved by the Science Department of the Bouygues Group, the contractors for the project, who developed an extra-strength concrete four times stronger than ordinary concrete. Called B.H.P (highly resistant concrete), it offers a resistance to compression value of 1200 bars per sqcm (claimed to be a world record) and has a very quick setting time. This enabled the building of a taller structure with due underpinning of the foundation, while adhering to the construction schedule. Cranes were also designed to suit the height of the minaret for concreting.\n\n\n=== Hassan II Mosque Museum ===\nThe museum opened its doors to the public after the construction of the mosque. It showcases art pieces from various traditional Moroccan arts as well as unused architectural elements of the mosque, such as carved stucco, painted wood ceilings, and zellij walls.\n\n\n== Restoration works ==\nStructural deterioration in the concrete wall was observed ten years after the mosque's completion. This was explained as being due to exposure to the salt water of the Atlantic Ocean, into which nearly half of the mosque\u2019s foundation projects. Salt water migrating into the porous concrete caused the rusting of the rebar steel reinforcements resulting in expansion of the steel and causing cracking of concrete. Salt water had penetrated beyond the steel bar also into the structures.Effective restoration works were instituted in April 2005. This involved use of moly-grade stainless steel combined with high-grade concrete to make the structure resistant to chloride attack, a process that evolved during 3 years of research. This is expected to enhance the building's life by 100 years. The works were carried out in four phases. In the first phase a leak-proof coffer dam was constructed to isolate and dry the work area. This was built 5 metres (16 ft) below the highest water level. In the second phase, the voids seen in the prayer hall were filled with concrete. In the third phase, the structural slabs and pillars on the exterior part of mosque exposed to the sea were demolished; 6,000 cubic metres (210,000 cu ft) of concrete was removed. In the fourth phase, new exterior protection works were built using high-strength concrete with 2205 (conforming to UNS S 32205 EN 1.442 standards) stainless steel rods as reinforcements for effective erosion control. Even though the many structural changes were made as per detailed design, still during execution of works, 100 external pillars, called \u201ccombs\u201d because of their wave breaking characteristics, were exposed to salt water and wave action and had to be replaced with new pillars. These were made from high-strength concrete with 2205 stainless steel reinforcements. This necessitated an additional leak-proof dyke to be built behind the earlier one; total dyke quantity involved was 20,000 cubic metres (710,000 cu ft). All of these works involved use of 1300 tons of special steel (with 40 tons of Mo) of 8\u201320 millimetres (0.31\u20130.79 in) bars with yield strength of 850 N per mm2. The concrete quantity poured involved 100,000 cubic metres (3,500,000 cu ft) of non-reinforced bulk concrete and 10,000 cubic metres (350,000 cu ft) of high-strength concrete. The entire work was done at a cost of 50 million euros.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nLists of mosques \nList of mosques in Africa\nList of mosques in Morocco\nIslamic art\nTimeline of Muslim history\nList of tallest minarets\nList of tallest mosques\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nElleh, Nnamdi (2002).

          "Worth visiting in any circumstance, especially as it's the only mosque you'll be able to enter in Morocco not being a muslim. Magnificent in all aspects, an obligatory stop in any well planned moroccan excursion. Casablanca as a city is surprising and merits a detour anyway, and",

It\u2019s 130 MAD to get into the mosque- which is about 13 euros each. Make sure you cover your shoulders and knees otherwise they won\u2019t let you in.",

          "The only downside is that instructions are not very clear as to how to get into the mosque. We have run into another couple from Italy and all of us had problems trying to figure out how to get in. Nevertheless, simply taking pictures from the outside is good enough!",
          "This is the largest mosque in Africa and one of the largest in the world. It's a must-see if you are in Casablance. It's set in a huge traditionally-walled campus, flanked by its own museum and its library building, with a vast plaza capable of holding 250,000 worshppers. This",

          "Compared to wider Morocco, Casablanca is an underwhelming town. I suspect that for the average westerner of a certain age the expectations have at least in part been created by the eponymous movie. Largely, and I apologise to the native Casablancans, the town is missable.",

          "This mosque was very stunning and one of the most beautiful mosques I've seen but unfortunately feels like it's only for tourist not for muslims who want to pray without having to pay. They should have sections where this can be possible like the blue mosque in Turkey does.",
          "This is a vanity project, but a very good looking one. This is one of the biggest mosques in the world and in a unique spot on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. You don't realise quite how big it is till you get close up. The doors open at prayer times for muslims only, however",

Located in the central-western part of Morocco bordering the Atlantic Ocean, it is the largest city in the Maghreb region and the eighth-largest in the Arab world. Casablanca is Morocco's chief port and one of the largest financial centers in Africa. According to the 2019 population estimate, the city has a population of about 3.71 million in the urban area and over 4.27 million in the Greater Casablanca. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center of Morocco, although the national political capital is Rabat.\nThe leading Moroccan companies and many international corporations doing business in the country have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca holds its recorded position as the primary industrial zone of the nation. The Port of Casablanca is one of the largest artificial ports in the world, and the second largest port of North Africa, after Tanger-Med 40 km (25 mi) east of Tangier. Casablanca also hosts the primary naval base for the Royal Moroccan Navy.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe original name of Casablanca was Anfa (Neo-Tifinagh: \u2d30\u2d4f\u2d3c\u2d30), in Berber language, by at least the seventh century BC. After the Portuguese took control of the city in the 15th century AD, they rebuilt it, changing the name to Casa Branca ([kaz\u0250'b\u027e\u0250\u0303k\u0250]), meaning 'white house' in Portuguese. The present name, which is the Spanish version (pronounced [ka\u0320sa\u0320\u02c8\u03b2\u031ela\u0320\u014bka\u0320]), came when the Kingdom of Portugal came under Spanish control through the Iberian Union. During the French protectorate in Morocco, the name remained Casablanca (pronounced [kazabl\u0251\u0303ka]). In 1755 an earthquake destroyed most of the town. It was rebuilt by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah who changed the name into the local Arabic Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101' (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), although occasionally \"Casablanca\" is written in Arabic (\u0643\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0627, K\u0101z\u0101bl\u0101nk\u0101). The city is still nicknamed Casa by many locals and outsiders to the city. In many other cities with a different dialect, it is called Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101, instead.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by Berbers by at least the seventh century BC. It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans. In his book Description of Africa, Leo Africanus refers to ancient Casablanca as \"Anfa\", a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of Barghawata in 744 AD. He believed Anfa was the most \"prosperous city on the Atlantic Coast because of its fertile land.\" Barghawata rose as an independent state around this time, and continued until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1068. Following the defeat of the Barghawata in the 12th century, Arab tribes of Hilal and Sulaym descent settled in the region, mixing with the local Berbers, which led to widespread Arabization. During the 14th century, under the Merinids, Anfa rose in importance as a port. The last of the Merinids were ousted by a popular revolt in 1465.\n\n\n=== Portuguese conquest and Spanish influence ===\n\nIn the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers, leading to it being targeted by the Portuguese, who bombarded the town which led to its destruction in 1468. The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a military fortress in 1515. The town that grew up around it was called Casa Branca, meaning \"white house\" in Portuguese.\nBetween 1580 and 1640, the Crown of Portugal was integrated to the Crown of Spain, so Casablanca and all other areas occupied by the Portuguese were under Spanish control, though maintaining an autonomous Portuguese administration. As Portugal broke ties with Spain in 1640, Casablanca came under fully Portuguese control once again. The Europeans eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 following an earthquake which destroyed most of the town.The town was finally reconstructed by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah (1756\u20131790), the grandson of Moulay Ismail and an ally of George Washington, with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called ad-D\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02bc (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), the Arabic translation of the Portuguese Casa Branca.\n\n\n=== Colonial struggle ===\nIn the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in Britain and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing gunpowder tea, used in Morocco's national drink, mint tea). By the 1860s, around 5,000 residents were there, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s. Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of French colonialists in 1906. By 1921, this rose to 110,000, largely through the development of shanty towns.\n\n\n=== French rule and influence ===\n\nThe Treaty of Algeciras of 1906 formalized French preeminence in Morocco and included three measures that directly impacted Casablanca: that French officers would control operations at the customs office and seize revenue as collateral for loans given by France, that the French holding company La Compagnie Marocaine would develop the port of Casablanca, and that a French-and-Spanish-trained police force would be assembled to patrol the port.To build the port's breakwater, narrow-gauge track was laid in June 1907 for a small Decauville locomotive to connect the port to a quarry in Roches Noires, passing through the sacred Sidi Belyout graveyard. In resistance to this and the measures of the 1906 Treaty of Algeciras, tribesmen of the Chaouia attacked the locomotive, killing 9 Compagnie Marocaine laborers\u20143 French, 3 Italians, and 3 Spanish.In response, the French bombarded the city with multiple gunboats and landed troops inside the town, causing severe damage and 15,000 dead and wounded. In the immediate aftermath of the bombardment and the deployment of French troops, the European homes and the Mellah, or Jewish quarter, were sacked, and the latter was also set ablaze.The bombardment and military invasion of the city effectively began the French military conquest of Morocco, although French control of Casablanca was not formalized until the French Protectorat was established by the Treaty of Fes March 1912.\nGeneral Hubert Lyautey assigned the planning of the new colonial port city to Henri Prost. As he did in other Moroccan cities, Prost designed a European ville nouvelle outside the walls of the medina. In Casablanca, he also designed a new \"ville indig\u00e8ne\" to house Moroccans arriving from other cities.Europeans formed almost half the population of Casablanca.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAfter Philippe P\u00e9tain of France signed the armistice with the Nazis, he ordered French troops in France's colonial empire to defend French territory against any aggressors\u2014Allied or otherwise\u2014applying a policy of \"asymmetrical neutrality\" in favor of the Germans. French colonists in Morocco generally supported P\u00e9tain, while politically conscious Moroccans tended to favor de Gaulle and the Allies.Operation Torch, which started on 8 November 1942, was the British-American invasion of French North Africa during the North African campaign of World War II. The Western Task Force, composed of American units led by Major General George S. Patton and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, carried out the invasions of Mehdia, Fedhala, and Asfi. American forces captured Casablanca from Vichy control when France surrendered November 11, 1942, but the Naval Battle of Casablanca continued until American forces sank German submarine U-173 on November 16.Casablanca was the site of the Nouasseur Air Base, a large American air base used as the staging area for all American aircraft for the European Theater of Operations during World War II. The air field has since become Mohammed V International Airport.\n\n\n==== Anfa Conference ====\n\nCasablanca hosted the Anfa Conference (also called the Casablanca Conference) in January 1943. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed the progress of the war. Also in attendance were the Free France generals Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud, though they played minor roles and didn't participate in the military planning.\nIt was at this conference that the Allies adopted the doctrine of \"unconditional surrender,\" meaning that the Axis powers would be fought until their defeat. Roosevelt also met privately with Sultan Muhammad V and expressed his support for Moroccan independence after the war. This became a turning point, as Moroccan nationalists were emboldened to openly seek complete independence.\n\n\n=== Toward independence ===\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting.\nApril 7, 1947, a massacre of working class Moroccans, carried out by Senegalese Tirailleurs in the service of the French colonial army, was instigated just as Sultan Muhammed V was due to make a speech in Tangier appealing for independence.Riots in Casablanca took place from December 7\u20138, 1952, in response to the assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist Farhat Hached by La Main Rouge\u2014the clandestine militant wing of French intelligence. Then, on 25 December 1953 (Christmas Day), Muhammad Zarqtuni orchestrated a bombing of Casablanca's Central Market in response to the forced exile of Sultan Muhammad V and the royal family on August 20 (Eid al-Adha) of that year.\n\n\n=== Since independence ===\nMorocco gained independence from France in 1956.\n\n\n==== Casablanca Group ====\nJanuary 4\u20137, 1961, the city hosted an ensemble of progressive African leaders during the Casablanca Conference of 1961. Among those received by King Muhammad V were Gamal Abd An-Nasser, Kwame Nkrumah, Modibo Ke\u00efta, and Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, Ferhat Abbas.\n\n\n==== Jewish emigration ====\nCasablanca was a major departure point for Jews leaving Morocco through Operation Yachin, an operation conducted by Mossad to secretly migrate Moroccan Jews to Israel between November 1961 and spring 1964.\n\n\n==== 1965 riots ====\nThe 1965 student protests organized by the National Union of Popular Forces-affiliated National Union of Moroccan Students, which spread to cities around the country and devolved into riots, started on March 22, 1965 in front of Lyc\u00e9e Mohammed V in Casablanca. The protests started as a peaceful march to demand the right to public higher education for Morocco, but expanded to include concerns of laborers, the unemployed, and other marginalized segments of society, and devolved into vandalism and rioting. The riots were violently repressed by security forces with tanks and armored vehicles; Moroccan authorities reported a dozen deaths while the UNFP reported more than 1,000.King Hassan II blamed the events on teachers and parents, and declared in a speech to the nation on March 30, 1965: \"There is no greater danger to the State than a so-called intellectual. It would have been better if you were all illiterate.\u201d\n\n\n==== 1981 riots ====\nOn June 6, 1981, the Casablanca Bread Riots took place. Hassan II appointed the French-trained lawyer Driss Basri, who would later become a symbol of the Years of Lead, with quelling the protests. The government stated that 66 people were killed and 100 were injured, while opposition leaders put the number of dead at 637, saying that many of these were killed by police and army gunfire.\n\n\n==== Mudawana ====\nIn March 2000, more than 60 women's groups organized demonstrations in Casablanca proposing reforms to the legal status of women in the country. About 40,000 women attended, calling for a ban on polygamy and the introduction of divorce law (divorce being a purely religious procedure at that time). Although the counter-demonstration attracted half a million participants, the movement for change started in 2000 was influential on King Mohammed VI, and he enacted a new mudawana, or family law, in early 2004, meeting some of the demands of women's rights activists.On 16 May 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a multiple suicide bomb attack carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to al-Qaeda. Twelve suicide bombers struck five locations in the city.Another series of suicide bombings struck the city in early 2007. These events illustrated some of the persistent challenges the city faces in addressing poverty and integrating disadvantaged neighborhoods and populations. One initiative to improve conditions in the city's disadvantaged neighborhoods was the creation of the Sidi Moumen Cultural Center.As calls for reform spread through the Arab world in 2011, Moroccans joined in, but concessions by the ruler led to acceptance. However, in December, thousands of people demonstrated in several parts of the city, especially the city center near la Fontaine, desiring more significant political reforms.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCasablanca is located on the Atlantic coast of the Chaouia Plains which have historically been the breadbasket of Morocco. Apart from the Atlantic coast, the Bouskoura forest is the only natural attraction in the city. The forest was planted in the 20th century and consists mostly of eucalyptus, palm, and pine trees. It is located halfway to the city's international airport. \nThe only watercourse in Casablanca is oued Bouskoura, a small seasonal creek that until 1912 reached the Atlantic Ocean near the actual port. Most of oued Bouskoura's bed has been covered due to urbanization and only the part south of El Jadida road can now be seen. The closest permanent river to Casablanca is Oum Rabia, 70 km (43.50 mi) to the south-east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCasablanca has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). The cool Canary Current off the Atlantic coast moderates temperature variation, which results in a climate remarkably similar to that of coastal Los Angeles, with similar temperature ranges. The city has an annual average of 72 days with significant precipitation, which amounts to 412 mm (16.2 in) per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) and \u22122.7 \u00b0C (27.1 \u00b0F), respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is 178 mm (7.0 in) on 30 November 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Grand Casablanca region is considered the locomotive of the development of the Moroccan economy. It attracts 32% of the country's production units and 56% of industrial labor. The region uses 30% of the national electricity production. With MAD 93 billion, the region contributes to 44% of the industrial production of the kingdom. About 33% of national industrial exports, MAD 27 billion, comes from the Grand Casablanca; 30% of the Moroccan banking network is concentrated in Casablanca.One of the most important Casablancan exports is phosphate. Other industries include fishing, fish canning, sawmills, furniture production, building materials, glass, textiles, electronics, leather work, processed food, spirits, soft drinks, and cigarettes.The Casablanca and Mohammedia seaports activity represent 50% of the international commercial flows of Morocco. Almost the entire Casablanca waterfront is under development, mainly the construction of huge entertainment centres between the port and Hassan II Mosque, the Anfa Resort project near the business, entertainment and living centre of Megarama, the shopping and entertainment complex of Morocco Mall, as well as a complete renovation of the coastal walkway. The Sindbad park is planned to be totally renewed with rides, games and entertainment services.Royal Air Maroc has its head office at the Casablanca-Anfa Airport. In 2004, it announced that it was moving its head office from Casablanca to a location in Province of Nouaceur, close to Mohammed V International Airport. The agreement to build the head office in Nouaceur was signed in 2009.The biggest CBD of Casablanca and Maghreb is in the North of the town in Sidi Maarouf near the mosque of Hassan II and the biggest project of skycrapers of Maghreb and Africa Casablanca Marina.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nCasablanca is a commune, part of the region of Casablanca-Settat. The commune is divided into eight districts or prefectures, which are themselves divided into 16 subdivisions or arrondissements and one municipality. The districts and their subdivisions are:\nA\u00efn Chock (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642) \u2013 A\u00efn Chock (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642)\nA\u00efn Seba\u00e2 - Hay Mohammadi (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a) \u2013 A\u00efn Seba\u00e2 (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639), Hay Mohammadi (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a), Roches Noires (\u0631\u0648\u0634 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631).\nAnfa (\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627) \u2013 Anfa (\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627), Ma\u00e2rif (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0641), Sidi Belyout (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0637).\nBen M'Sick (\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643) \u2013 Ben M'Sick (\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643), Sbata (\u0633\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647).\nSidi Bernoussi (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0635\u064a) \u2013 Sidi Bernoussi (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0635\u064a), Sidi Moumen (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0645\u0646).\nAl Fida - Mers Sultan (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u2013 \u0645\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646) \u2013 Al Fida (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621); Mechouar (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0648\u0631) (municipality), Mers Sultan (\u0645\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646).\nHay Hassani (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a) \u2013 Hay Hassani (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a).\nMoulay Rachid (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f) \u2013 Moulay Rachid (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f), Sidi Othmane (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646).\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nThe list of neighborhoods is indicative and not complete:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe commune of Casablanca recorded a population of 3,359,818 in the 2014 Moroccan census. About 98% live in urban areas. Around 25% of them are under 15 and 9% are over 60 years old. The population of the city is about 11% of the total population of Morocco. Grand Casablanca is also the largest urban area in the Maghreb. 99.9% of the population of Morocco are Arab and Berber Muslims.\nDuring the French protectorate in Morocco, European Christians formed almost half the population of Casablanca. Since independence in 1956, the European population has decreased substantially.The city also is still home for a small community of Moroccan Christians, as well as a small group of foreign resident Roman Catholics.\n\n\n=== Judaism in Casablanca ===\nJews have a long history in Casablanca. A Sephardic Jewish community was in Anfa up to the destruction of the city by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750, the Rabbi Elijah Synagogue was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.Approximately 28,000 Moroccan Jews immigrated to the State of Israel between 1948 and 1951, many through Casablanca. Casablanca then became a departure point in Operation Yachin, the covert Mossad-organized migration operation from 1961\u20131964. In 2018 only 2,500 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca, while according to the World Jewish Congress only 1,000 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca.Today, the Jewish cemetery of Casablanca is one of the major cemeteries of the city, and many synagogues remain in service, but the city's Jewish community has dwindled. The Moroccan Jewish Museum is a museum established in the city in 1997.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nPublic: University of Hassan II Casablanca\nPrivate:\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Mundiapolis\nUniversit\u00e9 Internationale de Casablanca\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nInternational schools:\n\nBelgium: \u00c9cole Belge de Casablanca\nFrench:\nColl\u00e8ge Anatole France\nLyc\u00e9e Lyautey\nGroupe Scolaire Louis Massignon\nLyc\u00e9e La R\u00e9sidence\nLyc\u00e9e Ma\u00efmonide (FR)\nLyc\u00e9e L\u00e9on l'Africain\n\u00c9cole Normale H\u00e9bra\u00efque\n\u00c9cole Al Jabr\nItalian: Scuola \"Enrico Mattei\"\nSpanish: Instituto Espa\u00f1ol Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez\nAmerican:\nCasablanca American School\nAmerican Academy Casablanca\nGeorge Washington Academy\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nMost of the city's places of worship are Muslim mosques. Some of the city's synagogues, such as Ettedgui Synagogue, also remain.

Raja's symbol is an eagle and Wydad's symbol is a star and crescent which means a symbol of Islam. These two popular clubs have produced some of Morocco's best players, such as: Salaheddine Bassir, Abdelmajid Dolmy, Baddou Zaki, Aziz Bouderbala, and Noureddine Naybet. Other football teams on top of these two major teams based in the city of Casablanca include Rachad Bernoussi, TAS de Casablanca, Majd Al Madina, and Racing Casablanca.\n\n\n=== Tennis ===\nCasablanca hosts The Grand Prix Hassan II, a professional men's tennis tournament of the ATP tour.

Morocco was scheduled to host the 2015 African Nations Cup, but decided to decline due to Ebola fears. Morocco was expelled and the tournament was held in Equatorial Guinea.\n\n\n==== Venues ====\nStade Larbi Zaouli\nStade Mohamed V\nStade Sidi Bernoussi\nComplexe Al Amal de CasablancaThe Grand Stade de Casablanca is the proposed title of the planned football stadium to be built in the city. Once completed in 2014, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of Raja Casablanca, Wydad Casablanca, and the Morocco national football team. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 93,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the Stade Mohamed V. The initial idea of the stadium was for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to South Africa. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2025. The idea of the stadium was also for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to Canada, Mexico and United States. It is now hoping for the 2030 FIFA World Cup which Morocco is co-bidding with either African neighbors Tunisia and Algeria or two European nations Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nal-Haja al-Hamdawiya, one of the most iconic figures in aita music, was born in Casablanca.

With his staged nude postcard photos taken in Casablanca's colonial brothel quarter, Flandrin was also responsible for disseminating the orientalist image of Moroccan women as sexual objects.Casablanca has a thriving street photography scene. Yoriyas is prominent among photographers capturing the economic capital's street scenes, and has attracted international attention.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Casablanca had many movie theaters, such as Cinema Rialto, Cinema Lynx and Cinema Vox\u2014the largest in Africa at the time it was built.The 1942 American film Casablanca is supposedly set in Casablanca and has had a lasting impact on the city's image, though it was filmed entirely in California and doesn't feature a single Moroccan character with a speaking role. Salut Casa! was a propaganda film brandishing France's purported colonial triumph in its mission civilizatrice in the city.Love in Casablanca (1991), starring Abdelkarim Derqaoui and Muna Fettou, is one of the first Moroccan films to deal with Morocco's complex realities and depict life in Casablanca with verisimilitude.

Hicham Lasri and Said Naciri also from Casablanca.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nCasablanca's architecture and urban development are historically significant. The city is home to many notable buildings in a variety of styles, including traditional Moroccan architecture, various colonial architectural styles, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Neo-Mauresque, Streamline Moderne, Modernism, Brutalism, and more. During the French Protectorate, the French government described Casablanca as a \"laboratory of urbanism.\"The work of the Groupe des Architectes Modernes Marocains (GAMMA) on public housing projects\u2014such as Carri\u00e8res Centrales in Hay Mohammadi\u2014in a style described as vernacular modernism influenced modernist architecture around the world.Casam\u00e9moire and MAMMA. are two organizations dedicated to the preservation and appreciation of the city's architectural heritage.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rapid Transit ===\n\nThe Casablanca Tramway is the rapid transit tram system in Casablanca. As of 2019, the network consists of two lines covering 47.5 km (30 mi), with 71 stops; further lines (\u06373 and \u06374) are under construction.Since the 1970s, Casablanca had planned to build a metro system to offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality. However, the city council voted to abandon the metro project in 2014 due to high costs, and decided to continue expanding the already operating tram system instead.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nCasablanca's main airport is Mohammed V International Airport, Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve Marrakech, Rabat, Agadir, Oujda, Tangier, Al Hoceima, and Laayoune, as well as other cities.\nCasablanca is well-served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. New York City, Montreal, Paris, Washington D.C., London and Dubai are important primary destinations.\nThe older, smaller Casablanca-Anfa Airport to the west of the city, served certain destinations including Damascus, and Tunis, and was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It has been closed and destroyed to build the \"Casablanca Finance City\", the new heart of the city of Casablanca. Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport is located in the nearby community of Tit Mellil.\n\n\n=== Coach buses ===\nCompagnie de Transports au Maroc (CTM) offers private intercity coach buses on various lines run servicing most notable Moroccan towns, as well as a number of European cities. These run from the CTM Bus Station on Leo Africanus Street near the Central Market in downtown Casablanca. Supratours, an affiliate of ONCF, also offers coach bus service at a slightly lower cost, departing from a station on Wilad Zian Street. There is another bus station farther down on the same street called the Wilad Zian Bus Station; this station is the country's largest bus station, serving over 800 buses daily, catering more to Morocco's lower income population.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nRegistered taxis in Casablanca are coloured red and known as petit taxis (small taxis), or coloured white and known as grands taxis (big taxis). As is standard Moroccan practice, petits taxis, typically small-four door Dacia Logan, Peugeot 207, or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. Grands taxis, generally older Mercedes-Benz sedans, provide shared mini-bus like service within the city on predefined routes, or shared intercity service. Grands taxis may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.\n\n\n=== Trains ===\nCasablanca is served by three main railway stations run by the national rail service, the ONCF.\n\nCasa-Voyageurs is the main intercity station, from which trains run south to Marrakech or El Jadida and north to Mohammedia and Rabat, and then on either to Tangier or Meknes, Fes, Taza and Oujda/Nador. It also serves as the southern terminus of the Al-Boraq high speed line from Tangier. A dedicated airport shuttle service to Mohammed V International Airport also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.\n\nCasa-Port serves primarily commuter trains such as the Train Navette Rapide (TNR or Aouita) operating on the Casablanca \u2013 Kenitra rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark Casablanca Twin Center. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction, the station is still operational. From 2013, it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the city's new tram network.\nCasa-Oasis was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early 21st century, and officially reopened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern intercity train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to intercity standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nAlthough Mohammed V International Airport receives most international flights into Morocco, international tourism in Casablanca is not as developed as it is in cities like Marrakesh. Casablanca, however, attracts fewer tourists than those of cities such as Fes and Marrakech. \nThe Hassan II Mosque, which is the second largest mosque in Africa and the seventh largest in the world, is the city's main tourist attraction. Visitors also come to see the city's rich architectural heritage.Popular sites for national tourism include shopping centers such as Morocco Mall, Anfa Place, the Marina Shopping Center, and the Tachfine Center. Additional sites include the Corniche and the beach of Ain Diab, and parks such as the Arab League Park or the Sindibad theme park.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAmal Ayouch (born 1966) \u2013 stage and film actress\nSalaheddine Bassir \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nLaarbi Batma \u2013 Moroccan musician and artist, founding member of Nas El Ghiwan\nLarbi Benbarek \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMiriem Bensalah-Chaqroun \u2013 Moroccan businesswoman\nJean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes \u2013 French footballer\nFrida Boccara \u2013 French singer, Winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 1969\nMerieme Chadid \u2013 Moroccan astronomer\nSoufiane Choubani \u2013 Founder of the Moroccan National Debate Team\nJean-Charles de Castelbajac \u2013 French fashion designer\nDizzy DROS \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nGad Elmaleh \u2013 French/Canadian comedian\nLa Fouine \u2013 Moroccan-French rapper\nEl Haqed \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nSerge Haroche \u2013 French physicist who was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physics\nShatha Hassoun \u2013 Moroccan/Iraqi singer\nLydia Hatuel-Czuckermann \u2013 Israeli Olympic fencer\nHicham Mesbahi \u2013 Moroccan boxer\nFrench Montana \u2013 American rapper\nNawal El Moutawakel \u2013 Olympic champion\nNoureddine Naybet \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMostafa Nissaboury \u2013 Moroccan poet\nHakim Noury \u2013 Moroccan film director\nMaurice Ohana \u2013 French composer\nJean Reno \u2013 French Hollywood actor\nDaniel Sivan \u2013 professor\nAlain Souchon \u2013 French songwriter\nFrank Stephenson \u2013 award-winning automobile designer\nHassan Saada \u2013 Moroccan boxer arrested for alleged rape before Olympic match\nSidney Taurel \u2013 naturalized American CEO of Eli Lilly and Company from 1998 to 2008\nRichard Virenque \u2013 French cyclist\nMuhammad Zarqtuni \u2013 Moroccan nationalist and resistance leader\nAbdallah Zrika \u2013 Moroccan poet\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe 1942 film Casablanca (starring Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart) is supposed to have been set in Casablanca, although it was filmed entirely in Los Angeles and doesn't feature a single Arab or North African character with a speaking role. The film depicts Casablanca as the scene of power struggle between various foreign powers, which had much more to do with the Tangier of the time. The film has achieved worldwide popularity since its release. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, it won three, including Best Picture.\nA Night in Casablanca (1946) was the 12th Marx Brothers' movie. The film stars Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, and Harpo Marx. It was directed by Archie Mayo and written by Joseph Fields and Roland Kibbee. The film contains the song \"Who's Sorry Now?\", with music by Ted Snyder and lyrics by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. It is sung in French by Lisette Verea playing the part of Beatrice Rheiner, and then later sung in English. Liszt's \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\" is played twice, once by Chico on piano as an introduction to the \"Beer Barrel Polka\", and again by Harpo on the harp.\nThe city is featured in The Mysterious Caravan (1975), volume 54 in the original Hardy Boys series.\nCasablanca is the setting for several chapters in Doubleshot, a 2000 James Bond novel by Raymond Benson. In the novel, one of the characters mentions that the 1942 film was shot in Hollywood and not on location.\nCasablanca is one of the key locations in the 2006 video game Dreamfall, as it is where the primary protagonist of the game, Zo\u00eb Castillo, lives. Although the city is imagined in the year 2219, much of the present-day architecture is used for inspiration.\nCasablanca is the setting for the first act of the 2016 World War II romantic thriller film Allied starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nCasablanca is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nRabat Zoo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site of Casablanca\nOfficial Casablanca Tourism Website (in French)\nCasablanca photo gallery (buildings and other landmarks with a history dating back to the French Protectorate)\nOpen Air Museum of 20th century architecture\n Geographic data related to Casablanca at OpenStreetMap",

          "I was a bit surprised by this square and a tad disappointed as there is really very little there. We got our first glimpse of the water men, saw the Casablanca sign, wandered a little and left within a few minutes. There are a couple of nice buildings for architecture to look at",

          "I don't really understand what's the fuss is about with this square. It's unremarkable in every way. There are a few hawkers of cheap tat, the buildings round about are fairly utilitarian in appearance. I suppose the fountains could be nice if they were turned on. I wouldn't go",
          "It was a large park with fountains, copious numbers of children and pigeons. There were more pigeons than either of us have ever seen in one place at one time. In fact if you could take all the pigeons we\u2019ve ever seen through the entirety of either of our lives and put them all",

          "There is absolutely nothing to do at the square BUT you can meet those strange guys with a lot of copper or bronze cups, who pour water to the locals from a bag made of animal leather or maybe stomach and pose to the tourists for 5-20 dirhams.",
          "It was on the intinerary of our tour group to see this but for the life of me I don't know why. There was nothing there but maybe a million pigeons resting on a fountain. If you pass by this, glance over, but nothing worth stopping for.",
          "the square is divided in two, on one side the building is new, impressive with a very nice fountain and the opposite site is old, badly maintained with lots of people playing and sellng all kind of chineserie. There is a big plan for this square and it might be a very good one",

          "This being a place for the locals to come and meet and play in their spare time. I had time to spend before my train back to Marrakech. Watching the men play boule; youngsters congregating. A good distraction.",

          "This was part of our trip and what a lovely place. The square is quite big and is a haven of interest for local people and also tourists, consequently it can seem quite intimidating. The diversity of cultures here is amazing. The architecture is outstanding with many beautiful",

          "Very staged attraction for bus tours etc. Nothing special water carriers expected money for photographs as usual.",
          "This square has significance for locals - but really is just the same as squares around the world, fountains (that rise and fall in neat patterns), pigeons, large open space, hawkers, tourists and buildings.",
          "One side has the fountain with pigeons which people love to feed. Across from this is a park which leads up to the wonderful courthouse built in the style of all government buildings in Morocco. Just next to the square is a lovely Post Office decorated in wonderful blue tiles.",
          "Pretty much like trafalger square ...men in red cloaks expect a tip if taking photos..they are also the water sellers",
          "This was our second visit to the square. We enjoyed feeding the pigeons and taking out photos. The kids were excited",
          "Nothing special about this place other than the mass of pigeons. Sometimes the fountain works and sometimes they light it up at night.",
          "Usually interesting, but do not thing Jema el Finah in Marakesh. There are some attractions, and some vendors.",
          "The experience was unique. Such an interesting place to visit and so many things to see but the atmosphere is not very friendly. Beware that you will be asked (demanded) to pay money for taking photos of performance, people, goods. Watch for pickpockets (we were advised to carry",
          "It is amazing to me since I'm really fond of doves. It wasn't that clean though. There were also men with tradition costumes and one can take pictures with them.",
          "it is a good place to visit at any time of the day but the best is in the morning as it is empty and all the birds and pigeons will come to you to feed them and enjoy all of them flying around you and sitting in your hands to be fed. it is 3 minutes walk from the shopping center",
          "We found this square of very little interest ,it was filled with families enjoying being out,unfortunately the pidgeons have overtaken the fountain and the square and the droppings from them coat everything and if you stand still you are a target,cute to see the local children",
          "All around this square are government buildings, many built by the French in the 1920s. The Post Office is a must, plus the Majorelle paintings in - I think - the Town Hall.",
          "A quick view is sufficient, nothing really special to see and the nearby gardens are not properly maintained",
          "The different areas present & the excellent design of diiferent areas in addition to the shops present.",
          "We almost walked right past it. Very small square. Was great to see the vendors and carts full of baby chicks but don't try to touch or see unless you are buying.",
          "We travelled by train from fez to El Jadida. In Casablanca we make a short stop just to visit the square and the mosque. At the trainstation take a red taxi(like the rest of Morocco only drive by meter!). The ride takes max 10-15 min. Look around on the square and mosque for 60",
          "Very clean and well-kept square adjacent to the city hall and court. Good place to rest and people watching. Tramway station.",
          "Yes, this is a grand size square with billions of pigeons, and recommend not wearing sandals AND wear a hat, but there is so so much more of the colourful people watching. There are a limited amount of benches, so watch and grab.",
          "If you want a kickass picture with pigeons it's the place you should head to. You will find loads of people who sell food or to take pictures. Nothing more. There are beautiful buildings around but it's all about the pigeons. Talk a walk around the place it's nice :)",
          "For those too ill-informed to have acquainted themselves with some knowledge of the colonial architecture of the period of the Protectorate, this might just be a square \"full of pigeons\". For those with some cultural sensitivity, this is a marvel of Mauresque-style buildings.",
          "I read the prior reviews and made it a point to walk through this square. It is a plain square with pigeons. No architecture or photo ops here folks. Move on, there are many other things to see. This is not a \"must see\". Do not waste your valuable time.",
          "We went during the weekend and it was great to see families enjoying their time together. The square was crowded although not so much as to prevent us taking photographs of the many buildings Including the Prefecture, the law courts, the central post office and banks. Most of",
          "There are plenty of old buildings to see around the square., including the Tax Office, court, church and bank. Plenty of sellers around trying to prize some dirhams for artefacts",
          "It was ok for hang out while feeding pigeons. The square is not that big. Surroundings you can take pictures of buildings.",
          "This place is in the living center of Casa. Perfect for a break and watching the inner city life. Nothing special though",
          "Very impressive park and square filled with people on weekends. Very similar to other famous Squares around the world.",
          "Nothing much to say really. I needed to kill time and sat in cafes, the exclusive domain of Moroccan men (single female in mid 50's travelling alone) watching the comings and goings of life in the Square.",
          "I walked down Mohammed V Blvd. from the train station to here and am glad I did. You do have to watch for traffic while walking, like any city, but it was worth it when I got here. And that is because the square had real people. We're all the same the world over. Kids, moms,",
          "I enjoyed walking around the Mohammed V park. Sunday is very overcrowed and many people like to sit and relax on the park or play soccer anywhere if there enough space. I did enjoyed taking picture and be very careful what you are bring with because I heard there can be mugged",
          "Locals come here by the droves particularly with children. Buskers are there to attract their cash. The pigeon corral seems to be a popular photo op for families. Interesting look at life.",
          "there was a bit of entetainment going on and a lot of hustle and bustle in this area...it was nice to take a moment to watch and listen to the events going on in the square.",
          "This review is quite late. The Square of Mohammed V is a favorite hang out for locals and tourists. We spent some time watching the dancing water fountain and the pigeons at the park. Some locals were dressed in their national costume ready to pause with tourists for a snapshot",
          "I went there based on the recommendation from trip advisor. We did several things and sightseeing based on the reviews. Its really easy to access most of the sightseeing sites with the tramway which I highly recommend to use. On the square you can take a lot of pictures and",
          "If you're taking a tour of Casablanca your tour bus or cab driver is bound to stop here . There's not too much to see apart from water sellers bugging you take a photo of them in national costume",
          "it is nice walking place to enjoy nice weather and fresh air, but not much to do.. if you walk couple of meters after you can find some restaurants to eat",
          "Reminded me of squares that I had seen in Spanish towns and cities. Nice buildings. Cannons, no beggars, historic law courts etc..",
          "This is the heart of present day Casablanca. The gardens in the square are nice to wonder round. The square is surrounded by interesting mainly government buildings and the water sellers add local colour.",
          "This is a nice place to while away a few minutes but it would be much better with some street entertainment. There are plenty of bars and restaurants to sit outside and watch the world go by",
          "great and very live place which changes during day and night, you will enjoy the food in stalls at night. really worth it.",
          "Great place to take photos! I took a photo in front of the gold door, it came out beautifully. Also, very lovely flowers in late summer",
          "Nothing important to watch there.. except for a nice photo with locals and running with pigeons.. also a nice place to sit to plan for the rest of the day :D",
          "While most city square has pigeons, this one is a contender for most pigeons in a square at any one time. It is an interesting place to visit and spend a couple of minutes people watching (and avoiding flying pigeons). Some interesting buildings surround the square. The most",
          "While exploring Casablanca a bit, my wife and I made a brief stop at Mohammed V Square. This is a nice place to take a seat and people watch. There are people feeding pigeons and children playing with their friends. You will also see the water carriers in their striking red",
          "This is a nice square with a fountain and lots of pigeons, but given the amazing and beautiful places that this country is full of, the square, and Casablanca in general, is unspectacular.",
          "Great for kids to chase pigeons or feed them corn. Nice fountain as well. But I wouldn't dwell there, I just like it when I pass by. The area is not safe in the evening, so please avoid it for your own sake.",
          "Not a lot to see, but worth a fleeting stop. Very big area full of people. Didn't really have long enough to see properly, but will go again.",
          "There's not much to see there. I'm not sure it's worth the time. I recommend checking out other locations if time is short.",
          "it was a nice place to go there, just need to be reayd to spend some time here and walk, of course, nice place",
          "Very interesting! Good place to see and enjoy it. So mane people around it, walking and appreciating it.",
          "While touring in Casablanca make a five minute stop to take some pictures . Some Art Deco buildings arround Nothing really special.",
          "We did a very short stop here (like 10-15 minutes). As many reviewers have stated, worth a stop if you are passing by for a good photo but nothing more than that. I got stopped about 5 times in 3 minutes by ladies wanting to paint henna tattoos. I didn't want one mostly because",
          "No need to spend significant amount of time there, nothing unique other than fairly crowded. Skip if you are pressed for time.",
          "At night it's not very well lit and there isn't a lot of energy. Just a lot of idle individuals. It is better in the day time and if you drive by at night.",
          "A pleasant square with some interesting buildings. Worth a stop off if you are passing by on the tram, but not enough interest to make a special visit.",
          "OK place to visit, very large square but nothing special about it. Of course you can always say been there, done it. Just another photo stop in our book.",
          "Go to the square and then head towards the central market. Look up and admire all the French art nouveau architecture around you. And great to see that the government are trying to preserve these buildings even as they are put to modern use.",
          "Perhaps I was there at a very quiet time. Nothing special to see. Nice fountain. I preferred the older parts of the city.",
          "Except the pigeon.. nothing much to see here. The structure on how it is designed is the only thing that interest me. Otherwise, I would say you may consider to skip this place.",
          "Mohammed V Square was one of the most colorful places we saw in Casablanca. We got some great photos of the architecture and water sellers too. It is worth a 10 minute stop.",
          "Pigeons everywhere, not much to see apart of the nice buildings and the people. The fountain is nice when it works.",
          "This was an OK site to observe lots of pigeons and see the watermen attempt to be in photos (for a price).",
          "This square looks tired. There is really nothing of significance to see. I enjoyed watching all of the people scurry about but that was about it. There are lots of government buildings surrounding the square but if you don't have to... don't",
          "It was very nice in the square and quite comfortable to drink coffeee in one of the viewing seats with all the men sitting around. Tram very modern and runs frequently.",
          "The square itself is nothing special, apart from being a nice spot for people watching. However it is surrounded by some interesting administrative building like the law courts, main post office, police headquarters etc and it worth a visit for that. There is also a tourist",
          "The square is probably a nice thing to see, but I wouldn't say it's something you must not miss. If you happen to walk past, have a look around, but if not then so be it...",
          "Nice place to hang out Nothing really interesting to see expect pigeons and taking pictures with the locals",
          "Square of Mohammed V is just a short walk from city center (Blvd Muhammed V), equipped with many benches for people to rest and enjot the park. People are gathered here where some performances take place. There are some water sellers wearing local dress and henna hand painters.",
          "really not much to see except pigeons and people trying to sell you stuff. worth a stop for 15-20 minutes to see the buildings, take some pictures, etc.",
          "There is not really much to do on this square than to pass by. But the architecture of the buildings on it is stunning - very similar to what you see in Algiers. Be careful about the pickpockets, we saw one running away (and being caught).",
          "For the main square of a large city, there was nothing much to recomend it. If you had the time, it would be fine to sit and watch the world go by.",
          "The sheer size of it. The huge fountain is amazing. Made me want to run and jump in and wade around.",
          "The new tramway runs through the square now, adding a touch of modern glamour to the French-era buildings. Even in these colder winter months, the place is full at busy times. This is a place to come for a half an hour, unless you're a real architecture buff. It's one of",
          "We couldn't even get a feel for what this might look like, because it is fenced in and under construction. We had to walk all the way around it to try to find a place to catch a taxi.",
          "Very nice and large square. Green. Interesting architecture. Very pleasant to walk through. It's hard to miss it.",
          "The style of the buildings is called \"Mauresque\", I understand. I live in Morocco, so have been here often before and had a walk through the square last Saturday during a trip to Casa. I got approached by the guys wanting to scare the pigeons for me, but, been there done that",
          "This is the hub of Casablanca. You will pass through it at some point. Medina and big hotels nearby.",
          "I live in Casablanca, but I always like going through this square for the grandeur of its colonial buildings",
          "This is a pleasant place to people watch and take an afternoon walk. Don't miss the inside of the Sacre Cour nearby.",
          "City is pretty filthy and run down...very crowded....but you can see the former glory.",
          "Not much to see here besides the 1000s of pigeons! - the watersellers are obvious tourist attractions. Take a pic with them - make sure you have some money to give them.",
          "A big square, you can see the mosque well in it's full glory and you can see the sea, you can also have an idea of how full this must be during ramadan!. It is big, but empty... a square.",
          "It is one of the biggest mosks in the world, it worth to be visited",
          "Nothing too fancy; you can go there to see it if you have some time to kill.",
          "This is the best thing to see in casablanca. Take the tour if you can, it's worth it to see inside.",
          "The square was interesting. A lot of people just hanging out. There were several men there that would feed the pigeons and then another would come up and clap so tourists could take a picture of the birds all flying up. It was interesting...but scary the first time. Also note -",
          "Good place to take a short walk, admire the buildings, boulevards, and gardens, and take the pulse of the city. An animated place, with thousands of pigeons, street vendors, and many visitors. One of the nice city views in Casablanca.",
          "Interesting site, the Mausolem and Hassan the 2nd Mosque worth the stroll.",

At 13, she opted for the name Betty tired of the mockery of children about her misspelled name (Betsoul).Betty grew up with lots of scars which she could not get rid of, even in alcohol. She finished her humanities and continued at the FUNDP (University Faculties of Peace Namur) and studied economics (1984-1985). After a first dropout, she started studying law (1985 \u2013 1986), but had to interrupt for family reasons.

A fair against a background of resilience that allows different artistic disciplines (writing, painting, crafts, photography, pottery ...) to meet and collaborate.\nBetty Batoul was elected Woman of Peace of Belgium  for her actions in favor of peace. She received the king's invitation for a ceremony at the Laeken palace on May 8, 2012.

          "interior was gutted out and altars taken down - nice glass windows but rubbish here and there; i give it points at all because of the climb to top available for a fine view of the city; i think it might be used for exhibitions; the garden was nice enough too leading to a",
          "The clime to the top is well worth it! Fantastic view of the whole city from the top! and the interior of the \"church\" is very nice !!!",
          "We were told that the stain glassed windows at this 20th century cathedral were not to be missed. Having seen a lot of amazing churches throughout the world, I was somewhat skeptical. However, the stained glass really is a wonderful modernized version of Christian scenes",
          "This building has been deconsecrated so no longer has any religious significance (there is another fully functioning church in Casablanca) - still it is architecturally interesting and the stained glass style is quite unique so it is a shame that it is not better maintained It",
          "What a pity. I came here around 6.30 pm and it was dark from outside. The lighting was very poor. I couldnt see the decoration, the colored glass. It was like an abandoned old building. I cancelled to come in due to many youngster playing football wildly. Based on what I read,",
          "When I went into the church, there was a Chess Championship Tournament. I wasn't sure if I was allow to take picture of inside the beautiful, but rather very dirty church. I did take the picture which is good. Also, I already know about walking upstairs to the top (as I read",
          "This once magnificent cathedral is now just a sad shell. However there is a lovely leafy park surrounding it.",
          "The church was closed. Both church and park have not been maintained for years. A rather sad sight, even though we are in a country where the word maintanance has a very different meaning than in Norway.",

          "Only stopped to take a photo as I like the Sacre Coeur in Paris very much and this one is nothing like. When in Morocco, I prefer mosques.",
          "A tragic sense in this old cathedral. On the altar were pop bottles and a contemporary \"Madonna\". There was local art for sale--some quite good but the art is dwarfed by the size of the edifice. I just dropped by as it is one block from Abderrahman Slaoui Foundation",
          "One of the many symbols of the architectural treasures of Casa, the majestic white cathedral unfortunately remains under-exploited and should host much more events, exhibitions etc...",
          "I really enjoyed seeing the church and was the only tourist there. Not much to see inside except great stained glass windows. Didn't look like it is still used as a church but they were setting up for a concert on on the front entrance. Beautiful building worth the trip if",
          "when I visited there was an exhibit of modern Moroccan art underway (fee = 20 dirham) that was very interesting. The cathedral itself is modern and starkly white, which is not to my taste. There are some interesting (though rather small) stained glass windows. The surrounding",
          "The stained glass windows are extensive and impressive. The grotto isn't impressive, but the cathedral itself is beautiful and well worth the time to go see it.",
          "Beautiful architecturally, but no longer a Church, influence of Islam I imagine. Now a museum. Part of the French colonial past.",
          "The exterior architecture is fantastic but there isn\u2019t much to see inside. The place used to be a church and even up to now tourists really see it as a cathedral and nothing else. It\u2019s a nice place to visit but isn\u2019t something that\u2019s really breathtaking.",
          "This could be a very nice building if it would be maintained. But it's not ... and closed. And kids use the area for football ground. The garden is not worth to even look at it. So don't waste time to go there.",
          "Okay, so I know decommissioned isn't the right word, but it conveys what I mean, the place is no longer used as a church. I found it doing a colonial architecture walk from the lonely planet guide book, which is very much worth it. The architecture of the church is amazing,",
          "The church is gorgeous from the inside and out. but don't go expecting a church. this is now a community center and tourist destination which affords visitors a stunning view of Casa from the spires. there are always a lot of kids playing soccer right in front. don't mess up",
          "This cathedral looked better when I viewed it from a distance at Place Mohammed V. But at short distance, the outside looked not very well maintained. Dirty walls and broken windows. It didn't look to be a rich church ... and I guess perhaps it's not really popular with the",
          "The inside of the church is empty and a little eery, but if you pay the small admission fee you get to climb up a bunch of old, dilapidated stairs that take you to the roof where you are rewarded with AWESOME sites of Casablanca. Definitely recommend it.",
          "Moroccans are famous for their acceptance of other races cultures and religions. A great example is this church. What makes it worth a visit are its stained glass windows reported to weigh 20 tonnes. Recommended",
          "I went there with great expectations. The outside is very impressive, but the inside - empty! I don't know what they try to do with it, but it felt terrible to see it dirty, with wire in the room to prevent birds from flying around and over all the impression of a dirty place.",
          "Though the interesting modern art exhibition this was a disappointment. Former church has lost its glory and reminds me of the times behind the iron curtain. Plaster was falling on our heads from the ceiling.",
          "A great structure, very interesting to see. However, in such a bad state ... dead birds next to the stairs on the way up for the view, which is, however, stunning.",
          "If you like architecture you will like the outside french new style and the color glasses inside, but it is not used as a church but a run down exhibition place, outside is just a parking lot and children kicking football around. good that it is free",
          "We can worship God The Father, the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ anywhere but the elevation of the building compared to the surrounding street is good but at a very busy road junction. We did not park but an old guide book said this was one of the best views of the city from the",
          "This was obviously a beautiful building at some stage of its life but it is now a stripped our shell home to a few pigeons. There was evidence that it had been used for exhibitions at some time. There was a man at the door with a donations box but no evidence as to where the",
          "i quickly visited this place and loved it. it is interesting to see how a building like this stands in the middle of the city, within a muslim world, how this church fits just perfectly.",
          "We needed to tell the taxi exactly which street to go because he had no idea where this was. We used it as the start of a walking tour. We walked in and out, and that was about it. It hasn't been used for services in a long time.",
          "an AWESOME view of Casablanca worth the effort to climb the stairs. Beautiful architecture It needs more attention",
          "I have seen so many churches in my life that it's hard to find something unique at this point, but this church has it. Make sure you walk inside and watch the sun pouring through the multi-colored windows. It's a pride of Casablanca.",
          "Staff at the cathedral have let us upstairs for 20 Dh. The way up is smelly and covered with pigeon stool, but the view from the top is amazing on a sunny day. Caution - there's no safety measures taken (direct access to the roof).",
          "It is a relatively modern designed church, it is big and it has one nice window, but apart from that it is just empty..... For us we were disappointed that we went here, a waste of our time. For Muslims from some Arabic countries and for Christians that have never been to an",

          "Surprising, worth a 10-15-min visit, the cathedral is located just next to the Parc de la Ligue Arabe. It is no longer in use for religious purposes - I found an exhibition of young Moroccan artists accommodated inside. The building is physically degraded, but it would thrill a",
          "An old Catholic church surrounded by a very Muslim culture. This is not a place of worship anymore but the stained glass and white walls were beautiful.",

        "wiki": "Raja Club Athletic (Raja CA or RCA) or simply as Raja (Arabic: \u0646\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\u064a\u200e, romanized: N\u0101d\u012b ar-Raj\u0101\u02be ar-Riy\u0101\u1e0d\u012b) is a Moroccan sports club with sections in many different disciplines based in Casablanca City, Morocco. Founded in 1949, Raja CA is a club known for the success of its football section and is the finalists in the FIFA Club World Cup 2013 The club Greens played the finals against the Bavarians giant FC Bayern Munich and which is the most titled team in the history of African Football and the Moroccan Football History. The Greens Eagles plays its meetings at Stade Mohammed V since its inauguration in 1956.Raja CA is the first and one of only two Arab clubs to reach the final of the FIFA Club World Cup along with Al Ain FC which achieved this feat in 2018.\nRaja CA has longstanding rivalries with some clubs, including Wydad AC (the confrontation between the two clubs, the Casablanca derby, where the Green Eagle show a historical superiority over his rival in term of victories and goals.\nThe green club is chaired by Jaouad Ziyat since 13 September 2018, succeeding to the provisional committee of Mohamed Aouzal who led Raja for 5 months after the resignation of the controversial Said Hasbane. The Moroccan Jamal Sellami is the coach.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Raja Club Athletic (abbreviated to Raja CA or RCA) was founded on 20 March 1949 by the Moroccan resistance and more particularly by the honorary president Moulay Sassi Ben Ahmed El Alaoui Aboudarka and the heads of the Moroccan unions, in particular the first head of the Moroccan Labor Union, Mahjoub Ben Seddik, as well as the former president of the Union of Arab Lawyers and ex-prime minister Mohamed Ma\u00e2ti Bouabid.\nBoujemaa Kadri took care of the administrative organization necessary for the creation of the club. Other personalities are behind the club, such as Tibari, Salah Medkouri, Mustapha Chemseddine, Karim Hajjaj, Si Ahmed Skalli Haddaoui, Choukri, Daoudi, Hachmi Nejjar, Mohamed Charfaoui, Laachfoubi El Bouazzaoui, Abdelkader Jalal, Naoui, and some other Moroccan intellectuals and resistance fighters who met at Hmidou El Watani, owner of the Al Watan cafe, in Derb Sultan.\nThe ban on entrusting the presidency of the club to a Moroccan is circumvented by leaving the chair for six months to Ben Abadji Hejji, a Muslim of Algerian origin who thereby benefited from French nationality. The French authorities, caught off guard, are thus forced to accept the fact. After several attempts to find a name, a draw between the names Raja and Fath, allowed the name Raja, drawn three times in succession, to be chosen.\n\n\n=== The beginnings after independence (1956\u20131973) ===\n\nAfter the independence of Morocco in 1956, the royal Moroccan football federation is created and therefore replaces one of the twenty-two leagues of the French football federation during the time of the French Protectorate in Morocco which was called Ligue du Maroc de Football Association. For its first season, the FRMF receives the affiliations of 310 clubs grouping 6,087 licensees. The criterium replaced the championship and had to lead to play-offs, each team having to play three matches and gain as many victories to reach the elite. The Raja successively beats in its group the Sports Union of Ben Ahmed 4\u20131, Ennasr of Casablanca on the score of 2\u20130 (success of Moussa and Acila) and finally the Olympic of Ouezzane on a river score of 7\u20130 including 4 goals scored by Hamid Bahij. Raja was thus the first team to enter the first division because it had played this last match at 8:30 am, Kacem Kacemi who retired from his coaching position for personal reasons. The first match disputed by the Greens in the first division championship was lost to FUS (2\u20130), but they managed to beat SC Roches Noires in the second match with the score of 2\u20130. He ranks tenth this season by barely avoiding relegation. The following year, thanks to the arrival of Affani Mohamed Ben Lahcen known as \"P\u00e8re J\u00e9go\", the club finished fourth.\nDuring the 1959\u20131960 season, a controversy broke out at the end of the season after the FRMF decided to play a triangular tournament between the first three teams of the tied championship in terms of points while Raja was in the lead with the best goal difference. The club refused to participate in protest and the tournament was transformed into a play-off between FAR Rabat and KAC K\u00e9nitra. The latter won this match and the title of champion of Morocco while Raja was ranked third. Green forward Moussa Hanoune finished top scorer in the championship with 22 goals, a record at the time.\n\nIn 1964\u20131965, if the club finished twelfth and barely touched relegation to the second division, it still qualified for the throne cup final for the first time in its history, where it faced the Kawkab of Marrakech on 13 June 1965 at Stade Mohammed V. Match refereed by Salih Boukkili, KACM won the match 3\u20131 and the only goal scored by Raja was scored by Bhaija. It was the third consecutive coronation of the Merrakchis in the competition, and the first defeat in the Raja final. During this season, the Greens defeated Wydad in the quarterfinals with a score of two to one.\nRaja finished the 1966\u20131967 season in third place in the championship with 65 points, while striker Greens and the national team of the time Houmane Jarir finished top scorer with 18 goals.\nOn 14 July 1968 at the Stade d'honneur in Casablanca, the final of the Throne Cup took place, between Raja and RAC. The latter won the title for the first time in its history and the Rajaouis, still unable to claim their first title, lost on the score of 1\u20130.\n\n\n=== Three cuts in a decade (1973\u20131982) ===\nThe 1974 Throne Cup final pitted the semi-final winners, Raja who beat Wydad AC on penalties, against the Maghreb of Fez who eliminated Mouloudia Oujda. During a match played in the Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca on 28 July 1974, the Raja led by coach Mohammed Tibari, wins the cup against the MAS on the goal of El Arabi against Hamid Hazzaz (1\u20130). The Green Eagles thus won this competition for the first time and also won the first title in their history.\nOn 17 July 1977, Raja CA moved to the capital where it met the Difa\u00e2 of El Jadida at the Stade du FUS in Rabat on behalf of the Throne Cup final. The Greens won the match 1\u20130 on a penalty from Feu Abdellatif Beggar and therefore won the competition for the second time.\nIn 1980\u20131981, the Raja finished third in the championship, then fifth in 1981\u20131982, however, the Greens did not go out empty handed this season. On 14 March 1982 at the Stade Roches Noires in Casablanca, the final of the Throne Cup was played between Raja and the Renaissance of Kenitra. And as in 1977, it was the late Abdellatif Beggar who scored the only goal of the match, and offered Raja his third title in the competition.\nThis season will also witness the first appearance of Raja on the African scene, more precisely in the African Cup winners' cup, by opposing during the first round to the Senegalese of AS Police, the Greens bow to the Senegal (1\u20130), and do not manage to catch up with the return match in Casablanca which ends with a draw (0\u20130). Thus, the Raja CA, a team still inexperienced in continental competitions, was eliminated in the first round.\n\n\n=== First coronations in Africa and Morocco (1982\u20131995) ===\nIn 1982\u20131983, the Raja again finished fifth in the championship, and reached the final of the throne cup for the second consecutive time, this time against the Casablanca Olympic. The final takes place on 21 August 1983 at the Stade Mohamed V in Casablanca, the Raja loses the title this time on penalties (4\u20135), after the match ended in a draw (1\u20131).\nRaja finished vice-champion in the 1985\u20131986 championship, behind his rival Wydad, who edged him 2 points on the last day. However, he was eliminated in the cup by the future champion, AS Far in the round of 16 (2\u20130).\nThis year will also see the consecration of the national team in the 1986 World Cup. Led by captain rajaoui Abdelmajid Dolmy, the Moroccans manage to achieve an unprecedented feat for an African formation, and reach the knockout stages before losing to West Germany (1\u20130) on a goal by Lothar Matth\u00e4us in the 87th minute.

The radio has a list of four shows:\n\u2022 P\u00e8re J\u00e9go: Discussion of club news and news throughout the week.\n\u2022 L'oulad (youth in Arabic): Invitation of team players to bring them closer to the Rajaoui audience.\n\u2022 La Grande Storia: Invitation of former players and managers to commemorate their journey within the club.\n\u2022 Grandstand: a program that welcomes members of the club committee.\nThese shows were first broadcast live on Facebook, before being rebroadcast via the club's official channels on digital platforms YouTube, Spotify and iTunes.\nOn social networks, Rajaouis are very active, you can find hundreds of fan pages and channels on several social networks, reporting various photos, videos and news from their club.\nRaja also has official accounts on several social networks, all of which are the most followed for a sports club on the national and Maghreb level:\n\u2022 The Facebook page with +4.3 million likes.\n\u2022 The Instagram account with +800,000 subscribers.\n\u2022 The YouTube channel with +300,000 subscribers and +34,000,000 views.\nThese data therefore make Raja, the most followed team in Morocco and the Maghreb, the 65th in the world according to Digital Sports Media.\n\n\n== Presidents ==\n\n\n== Managers ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Current squad ==\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\n== Current technical staff ==\n\n\n== Notable players ==\n\n\n=== Notable former players ===\nHoussin Rajallah\n\n\n=== Goalscorers by season ===\n\n\n=== Transfers ===\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Club Logos and identity ==\n\n\n=== Colors and kits ===\nThe colors of the team are green and white. The green color was chosen by the club's founders because it symbolizes hope and growth. Green is also considered the traditional color of Islam. On top of that, green is one of the colors of the Moroccan flag. White is the color of the hometown of the club, Casablanca \nThese colors were used since the team's first matches in 1949.\nThe jersey of the Greens was long made by the German Adidas, during a period from 1968 to 1980, where he was replaced by Puma until 1995. In 1990, Raja entered into his first sponsorship deal with Chimicolor, making him the first Moroccan club to display a sponsor on his jersey. Comes after that the Moroccan bank of Africa and the East (BMAO) and ODEP 'known today as MarsaMaroc'. From 1995 to 1999, the club is sponsored by Danone and Lavazza for a year, but the club changes equipment manufacturer each season, and sees succeed successively Adidas, Uhlsport, Umbro and Adidas another time. After his victory in the 1999 CAF Champions League, Raja a contract Hummel valid until 2002, the jersey will be sponsored during this period by Western Union, Fiat, Caf\u00e9 ASTA and Coca-Cola, In 2001, Raja signed a contract with the French sports management company Transatlas Sports Management (TSM) which has made Raja one of the first clubs in Africa to have a commission for marketing and advertising. When the Hummel contract expires, the club gives his jersey to the Italian Kappa for a period of 6 years, and also signed with Siera who remains the main sponsor until now. Then, Lotto is the equipment supplier of the club from 2008 to 2013, then Adidas takes over again until 2017. Since 2017, it is the Italian Legea.\n\n\n=== Mascot ===\nThe eagle meanwhile, in a period marked by the colonization of the country and the resistance, represented for the founders the strong, prestigious and combative bird. The charisma of the animal is very representative of the history of the club, Raja was able to fly over his opponents despite difficulties. He naturally stands out as one of the club's emblems and mascots for many years.\n\n\n=== Stars ===\nMany football clubs around the world sport stars on their jerseys, and Raja is no exception. The jerseys of Raja have four golden stars. Each of his stars represents one of his victories in African or national competition. The first three (at the bottom of the logo) symbolize his three cups in the CAF Champions League of 1989, 1997 and 1999; the fourth (the biggest at the top of the logo) was added in 2011 following the tenth win in Botola Pro. \n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Mohamed V Stadium (D'honor) ===\nMohamed V Stadium was called the Marcel Cerdan stadium in 1955\u201356 and the Honnor stadium in 1956\u201381. It was inaugurated on 6 March 1955 and it knew two renovations in 1981 and 2000. It is the official stadium for the Raja Club Athletic and also for Wydad Club Athletic.\nMohamed V Stadium is part of a large sports complex in the heart of the city of Casablanca, specifically in the upscale neighbourhood of Ma\u00e2rif.\nIt has today a capacity of 67,000 spectators (more than 80,000 in 2000), not counting the North and South turns that have no seats, but where environments are warmer, and in 1997 it beat a record of 110,000 spectators in a match of Morocco against Ghana.\nThe south turn or \"Magana\" (the clock in Moroccan dialect) ended up with the main groups of Raja Casablanca fans.\nIn 2007, the stadium was equipped with a semi-artificial turf which is acceptable under international standards. As well, the seats in the stands, the sanitary facilities and athletics track were all replaced.\n\n\n=== Sport facilities ===\nSports facilities available to Raja Casablanca:\n\nRaja Oasis Sports Complex: Raja Oasis ports Centre is where Raja Casablanca trains. It houses the club's training facility which includes three football fields, a gym, a boarding school for the training center, a restaurant group ...\nRaja Academy\nComplex Tessema\nRoches Noires Stadium\nKahrama Stadium\n\n\n== Supporters ==\n\nThe southern part of Complexe Mohamed V is fully occupied by supporters (ultras) of the club; it is the famous area called LMAGANA. Four sectors of this area of the stadium can be distinguished:\n\nThe official gallery devoted in part to the leaders and members of the club.\nThe Tribune side, covered with green seats and a rostrum.\nThe Virage Sud, blank marked by the presence of a mythical scoreboard.\nThe Bleachers, covered with green seats and free forum.In 2013, according to a ranking that was done by a football website, the supporters of Raja Casablanca are among the world's 10 best football supporters, reaching fourth place. In 2014, after the amazing show of ultras of the club in the FIFA Club World Cup when Raja Casablanca had reached the final, they occupied first place in Africa and third in the whole world according to an annual ranking by Ultras World.\nThe supporters of Raja Casablanca are distributed in 2 ultras:\n\nUltras Green-Boys 05 (First Ultras In Morocco)\nUltras Eagles 06\n\n\n== Foundation ==\nThrough its foundation created in 2013, Raja carries out actions of general interest dedicated to children and young people to support them towards success, make them discover sport and its values and finally participate in the realization of their dreams by supporting d 'other associations. To better promote this foundation, Raja decided to display the Raja Foundation logo on the official jersey of its professional team from 20 February 2013 when it met against Raja Beni Mellal at the Mohamed V Complex.\nIn this same perspective, in 2007 Raja became the sponsor of the association of SOS Children's Villages (founded in 1949) in Morocco. By this agreement, the club opens the doors of its structures by authorizing the enrollment of a significant number of children and adolescents in its various sports disciplines and by providing them with the uniform and equipment necessary for the practice of their favorite sport.\n\n\n== Rivalries ==\n\n\n=== Casablanca Derby ===\n\nThe Casablanca derby (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0648\u064a\u200e) is a derby between the Moroccan football clubs Raja and Wydad. Matches are played in the Stade Mohamed V, often containing a fierce and vibrant crowd.\nThe Casablanca derby has extensive national media coverage and is a topic of debate for several days before and after the match between the fans of both clubs, whether in the streets, schools or workplace.\nThe first match between the two rivals was in 1956 in which Raja won 1\u20130.\nIn 1978, Raja players withdrew from the match against Wydad during the second half after their goalkeeper received a red card and a penalty was awarded.In 1996, Raja won 5\u20131 in the quarter-finals of the 1995\u201396 Coupe du Tr\u00f4ne; this score is the highest between the two rivals.\n\nAs of 15 April 2018\n\n\n=== The Classico ===\n\nClassic match between Raja CA and ASFAR. It is considered one of the greatest games of Botola after the derby, some times he even managed to overtake him. The rivalry between the two clubs does not lack history, there was a rivalry in the 1960s, after the Botola controversy of 1959\u20131960, where the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (Frmf) decided to take the title away from Raja, which was tied with ASFAR and KAC in points, but which exceeded them in terms of difference in goals. the rivalry continues with spectacular matches whether in Rabat or Casablanca in the coming years\nIn the 1980s, both teams were at their peak where ASFAR were crowned champions of Africa in 1985 and Raja in 1989, and they could be entertained by Moroccans with high level matches.\nIn the 1990s, this rivalry experienced a big decline because of the crushing superiority of Raja, which widely dominated all his rivals during this period, it is in the 2000s, exactly in 2005 that the Raja-ASFAR rivalry took a new breath and regained a lot of intensity, when the ASFAR have gained the title after beating Raja at Mohammed V stadium in the last day of the Botola. This match is a turning point in the history of the rivalry where it will take on a more intense dimension, where the hooligans of both teams will also increase the aggravation of tensions between the two big clubs.\nIn 2013, a season similar to that of 2005, but this time it is the consecration of Raja as champion of Morocco and the cup of the throne, and ASFAR, vice champion of the two competitions, the club more dream did not win the Moroccan classic\n\n\n== Sponsors ==\n\n\n=== Actual sponsors ===\nTransatlas Sport Management\nSiera\nAtlanta Assurance\nLegea\nMaroc Telecom\nHyundai\nMarsa Maroc\nNor'Dar\nNewmerique\nTransatlas Sport Management\nInfinix Mobile\nKoutoubia\nJunkers\nProdec\nOdyss\u00e9e\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRaja Casablanca relishing underdog run to Club World Cup final \u2013 Sports Illustrated, 20 December 2013\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nwww.raja2015.com",

          "Our tour guide,carried on a negotiation with the Palace Guard and we were allowed to enter the grounds and photograph the truly magnificent architecture. While we were there it was time for a call for prayer. From a nearby minaret came forth the cry that unifies one of the",
          "The King was not home though our guide told us the cooks still need to cook everyday for him in case he pops in???? Could not go inside but very impressive from the outside.",
          "We only saw the wall sorrounding the palace, because you need to show your pasport (mine was at the hotel)",
          "It is one of the many palaces in Morocco. It is beautiful to look at from the outside but the palace is not open to the public or at least was not when we visited.",
          "A good place to visit to take some photo and since the palace is closed you can take some photo in front of the doors, the visit will not exceed 15-20 minutes from your time.",
          "Make sure to visit with a guide because the history is so interesting and you wouldn't know the significance otherwise.",
          "If you have already seen the Royal Palace in Fez (the best) and the one in The Capital, Rabat. This one will not be as impressive as the others",
          "It is smaller than some of the European palaces but is has this charming Moroccan style we cherished a lot.",
          "The royal palace in the Habbous section of Casablanca, and is one of four royal palaces in Morocco (the others are in Rabat (the capital), Fez and Marrakesh). The king uses the Casablanca palace when there is state business or a ceremony there. As one would expect, the palace",
          "Palaces are overrated in Morocco as all you see are exterior walls, gates, guards and a distant view of the building. I was expecting to visit some rooms in a palace as is typical in Europe. A major disappointment in the tour.",
          "I went expecting to see something of the inside from a distance - like you can of the White House or Buckingham Palace. But all entrances were blocked and there was no vantage point. At one of the entrances the guard objected to me taking photos. My trip was not wasted as the",
          "Take the opportunity to see the two main gates to the royal palace when being in the Habous area of small shops and the olive market. The palace entrance is guarded and you have to approach the guards to get pass them to get access to the main courtyard with the rtwo main gates.",
          "The palace was completely blocked off by security, we couldn't even get close enough to see the front gate. The outside of it also doesn't look too special.",
          "Like the other royal palaces elsewhere in Morocco, including the king\u2019s official residence in Rabat, the Royal Palace of Casablanca is a magnificent example of traditional Islamic architecture. Unfortunately, like the other royal palaces, the one in Casablanca is also not open",
          "The walls are tall. The guards are on every corner/entrance and for security reasons they don't like/let you take pictures. If you are driving by the place, it is worth looking at while you drive. :(",
          "Apparently this Palace is only used for greeting foreign dignitaries these days. It's not open to the public but you can get your picture taken outside the gates. Lots of armed guards in the Square, so you have behave!",
          "Te palace can only be viewed from the plaza in front and only with a tour guide since it is guarded 24/7. Beautiful entry gate and design. Not a must see in Casblanca",
          "THe palace is never open, even the local population knows the building. The only part is the walls and the marvellous mains metal door with very elaborate mosaics. Fine sample of the rich maroccon artistic craftsmanship!",
          "Our tour took us to the Palace. The King was not there and apparently is rarely there. We did not get to go inside but just toured the grounds.",
          "The palace doors are massive works of art: intricate designs all excited by hand and obviously taking lots of time by highly skilled craftmen/ designers. The doors are magnificent and present great photo ops. A guide will inform of the rich legacy and traditions surroundings",
          "Of course this attraction is a must and go checkout the doors, many tourists were there to take photos of these amazing doors!",
          "This was one of our stops on our Casablanca Highlights tour. We were only able to see the outside of the palace. The entrance is beautiful. The guards were very colourful.",
          "While on a guided tour of the area we were allowed to walk outside but kept well away by security personnel. We were also told not to take photos of the police or soldiers. So cannot get any idea what is beyond those walls but I am sure it is very grand",
          "This is a palace in a big area.You can't get close or take photos.You can see while driving past.Nothing special.",
          "At first the guard let us through, then he called us back and told us we couldn't get in. Even though a big tourist bus was parked outside...",

          "The palace was a great stop in Casablanca. We were not able to see the inside. It was perfect for some high def picture taking. The big gates were unique. Less than one hour was enough to visit",
          "We walked around the Royal Palace of Casablanca, we learned that the kind has a Palace in evary big city of Morocco. And the main one is in Rabat. It is huge and impressive.",
          "A palace indeed fit for a king, the Royal Palace is the residence of the King of Morocco and his family. Unlike the Buckingham Palace, access is restricted and the palace grounds leading up to the palace is forbidden and heavily guarded by the king\u2019s guard. A masterpiece of",
          "You only need 10 minutes to take pictures and admire the excellent tile work. It is worth the stop. We did not go inside as it was closed.",
          "Saw this palace as part of a city tour. Most buildings in Casablanca are relatively new so this would be on the itinerary. Security tight. Some nice narrow streets nearby to experience local life.",
          "Best way to see and experience the atmosphere of the Royal Palace of Casablanca is on a booked guided tour. It's very stunning. The Medina inside is not as good as the old Medina. Hint: guided tour best. If the king is in Casablanca you will not see much and there will be",

          "Unfortunately the King was in town when we were there - There was a lot of traffic, many policemen (resist the urge to take their pictures - you will regret it). The shops around the palace are mundane and not worth the effort. All in All,I would suggest avoiding this",

          "We saw the outside of the royal palace as part of our city tour of Casablanca. It's located in the Quartier Habous. You just get to see the outside, for photos of its fantastic doors with Arabic arches. This is a nice addition to the city tour, as the grandeur of the palace is a",
          "Joined a tour to see the City of Casablanca. Guide brought us to the Royal Palace but did not see any except the outside of the Palace and see guards. Not even allowed to take picture of the guards, just the door. That's about it.",
          "We didn't stop there for too long. Our tour guide dropped us off for short and we just took a few great shots at the beautiful doors.",
          "On a city tour with our Gate1Travel group, we did a quick stop-and-take-pictures here at the Royal Palace, very beautiful.",
          "Lovely trees beside the palace. Really detailed gateway. Guards come from each of the armed forces plus the royal guard who was wearing his red winter uniform.",
          "Part of our tour, we stopped here to see some doors with a large area in front of it. If you are lucky, you might see wedding parties coming for a picture.",
          "we were unable to enter the grounds as the king was in residence but got an impression of the grandeur of the palace. Be careful when taking photos, one of our group had his camera taken by a policeman and photos deleted",
          "It was a shame we only could view this palace from the outside, would've love to go in and see, unfortunately that was not the case when we went or should I say dint know if we were allowed to go in or not, any ways from the outside it was nice to see a different historical",
          "As others have said, there isn't too much to see. As part of a tour we managed to get quite close to the exterior after the guide showed his ID to security but its a bit like looking at the outside of Buckingham Palace without being able to go inside. The carvings and tile work",
          "Okay its an impressive door, the fence around it is big and that is all I can say. They have armed guards protecting the place, I was not allowed in and neither was anyone else so there is little to tell.",
          "It is situated right next to the so-called artisan bazaar, but the place is heavily guarded on all sides, one side street next to it is also blocked. You just see the impressive walls ad gates and tops of the trees over the wall, and upper parts of the buildings inside - and",
          "It is huge. Mass building worth seeing but you don't get to know much other than what is showing from beyond it's walls.",
          "It is not open for public, never. Cant even take pictures of the gates, guards will have you walk away. It is advertised as a touristic attraction in most of the travel guides..but cant see more than some walls and nice gates. Overrated.",
          "We took a lot of photos of the Royal Palace of Casablanca, but it didnt really do much for me other than to look impressively grand. Worth hopping out if you are passing.",
          "The palace is located in the Habous district, which is Casablanca\u2019s new medina. Although this may be only one, of the many of the King\u2019s residencies throughout Morocco, it is his principal dwelling within Casablanca. Like many of the palace grounds and residencies, they are",
          "cant say much because we didnt enter the palace. Jus took photos at the seven doors. However, its near the Mellah. Interesting history.",
          "The palace is off limits to visitors so it can be seen only from outside. However the exterior was eye catching with its marvelous decorations.",
          "It is a great place and have a gorgeous garden & huge surrounding & not miss whilst you are in Casablanca",
          "Casablanca is a big city with everything you need to experience Morocco. If its the only place you go in Morocco, you'll love it. The Medina is great....I even got my hair cut there.",
          "Nice gardens, viewed from a distance as unable to go in. Building seems nicely ornate. A large wall hides it from public viewing",
          "A very memorable visit, this palace could not fail to impress visiting dignities and heads of state.",
          "The royal Palace of Casablanca was realy wonderful, very fameuse and geant, the architecture was very important, to have some pictures with m'y family was very interesting for some remembring , we like so much and we love it so much thanks a lot.",
          "This is one of the many palaces we saw in Morocco,they have a beautiful garden leading up to the gates. A large wall right around the building, the art work on the gates alone were amazing. The King was not there so we could not get in,the building has guards out side always.",
          "Worth a stop by but its only a wall at the end of a big square.Good for photo opportunities as the workmanship on the gates are beautiful.",
          "we were on an excursion from a cruise ship unfortunate for us the king was home so could only look around out side still worth a look though . Not much to see on outside but guide told us lots about the palace",
          "it' s a pitty when you see so many poor people and after you see the palace where the kings lives for summer holidays. we didn't visit it inside because it was forbidden but we enjoyed the view and the grea location near to the beach",
          "This is an absolutely beautiful place to visit - but be careful with your camera! They don`t have problems with photos... but we recorded a video and were 'politely' asked to delete it by the guards.",
          "Amazing tile work both inside and out. A beautiful structure arising out of the ordinary areas of suburban Casablanca. A great photo op standing in front of the giant metal doors and huge door knockers.",
          "Maybe it was because the royal family had just either driven away or arrived (we never knew which), but we couldn't get close to the royal palace and when a few of us walked into the street to take a long-distance photo of the gate, we were shooed away. So you could view some",
          "You cannot photograph the guards! The get very upset at the cameras. The entry gates are huge and gorgeous. Gorgeous gardens as well.",
          "The place was on lockdown due to the King being in town but it is another palace and not worth the time to check out unless you are in the area. The new medina is right next door so if you are in this area take a peak at the palace otherwise spend your time elsewhere.",
          "Well from the outside of the gate it looked good, however the fully armed guard decisively kept us out, even after our morrocan friend pleaded to let us in for 5 mins... Pity...",
          "It seems that every city and town has a palace in case the king visits.We obviously could only see the external frontage and the enormous open square at the front. We were amazed to see so many guards ( which was true of palaces and royal property throughout Morocco). Royal",
          "Unfortunately we were not able to go inside, but the stunning tile work is worth stopping and looking from outside. make sure you get up close as the colour of the tiles and patterns are stunning.",
          "This palace has, as all other royal palaces in Morocco, a very nice gate. But that is all you can see. Since it is a bit away from the center, you might omit this sight.",
          "The outside of the palace is quite attractive, but since it is a \"working\" royal palace you are not allowed inside, although I gather that sometimes you can gain admission. What you will see is a big plaza, nicely kept landscape, huge palace doors and palace walls. You can take",
          "I did an extensive walk around Casablanca yesterday and tried the Royal Palace yet again. Unfortunately, yet again, I wasn't allowed in. It seems that, from reviews posted here, some people have managed to gain entry and have even uploaded photos. I wish they had posted details",
          "The Royal Arcquitecture of Morocco apeard at the many places, gates, walls constituting a wonderful scenario. Very beatiful place to see....",
          "I dint went inside as it was closed on sunday and from outside is massive and looks beautiful. there are nice gardens inside and full of security round the royal palace",
          "If you are visiting Casablanca, this is a must see. I really admired the giant door outside the palace with its Moroccan decorations. One must visit the surroundings in order to see the entire place. I must suggest one should hire a guide who should be able to give the details",
          "Really not worth your time other than to say you've been there. You can not go in, so what you see is what you get, a view of a Royal Palace from the outside and some guards, The overall grounds are nice. Take a photo or just buy a postcard all the same.",
          "Can't really see anything as wall all round. Police did not like me taking a picture even of one of the gates!!",
          "The Palace seems nicely decorated and beautiful but cannot go inside. They do not allow visitors. Therefore it is not worth it. It is a waste of time to just go outside the gate. There are are better places to visit in Casablanca!",
          "from our cruise ship we found a building promising tourist information,the person inside offered us a guided tour of the city , a mercedes taxi arrived late and by its appearance it was 'late' as in dead.no handles inside,collapsed passenger seat,steering wheel that had to go",
          "We walked in, we walked out. That was it. Imposing structure. Disappointing that we could not see any more than the exterior.",
          "Lovely building with large courtyard garden with orange trees growing in the centre. When we went the oranges were still green. Well worth a visit.",
          "The Moroccon Royal Palace at Casablanca is a landmark place to visit. Though, it can be seen only from the outside it provides an impressive view - massive gates, guards on duty - Royal!",
          "We drove around the palace area and feel that it was not necessary to get out and walk around the area.",
          "The very excellent landscape work done on the grounds and the beautiful murals and the excellent lamps and tents. Unbelievably nice.",
          "This is a place to take one photo but not with soldiers ( not allowed). You cannot go inside so don't go out of your way to come here. The part that you can see (walls and gate) is very attractive.",
          "It is fine - but nothing really to see around there... I wasn't allowed to go in, so perhaps there are special opening times - but please verify this before you go.",

It has been central in the history of Casablanca.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe area outside the walls of the old medina that is now United Nations Square, used to be the location of the Souq Kbir (\u0633\u0648\u0642 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631), also referred to as le Grand Socco, before French colonization. In 1908, after the French bombardment and invasion of Casablanca, the French commander Charles Martial Joseph Dessigny ordered the construction of a clock tower in the area, which then took the name, Place de l'Horloge, \"Square of the Clock\". The square was then named Place de France, \"Square of France,\" and the surrounding area was developed by a team of French architects and urban planners chosen by the French R\u00e9sident g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Hubert Lyautey and led by Henri Prost.\nThe Magasins Paris-Maroc building (1914), constructed by Hippolyte Delaporte and Auguste Perret, was located at the southern end of Place de France. The Neo-Mauresque Hotel Excelsior, which remains today, was built in 1916.As the European ville nouvelle, or \"new city,\" expended eastward of the square, the square evolved from a marketplace to a contact point between the European city and the Casablanca medina, which French colonists described as the \"ville indig\u00e8ne.\"\n\nThe clock tower was demolished in 1948, and the square became a bus station for a period of time in the midcentury. A clock tower imitating the original's design was constructed a short distance closer to the medina in 1993.\nThe architect Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Zevaco designed the Kora Ardia (\u0643\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u0631\u0636\u064a\u0629), \"Globe,\" in 1975.The Casablanca Tramway transformed the square. Work started in 2009, and the first line was inaugurated December 12, 2012.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe square is reachable by Line 1 of the Tramway, which stops at United Nations Square Station.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCasablanca Clock Tower\nMedina of Casablanca\n\n\n== References ==",

Located in the central-western part of Morocco bordering the Atlantic Ocean, it is the largest city in the Maghreb region and the eighth-largest in the Arab world. Casablanca is Morocco's chief port and one of the largest financial centers in Africa. According to the 2019 population estimate, the city has a population of about 3.71 million in the urban area and over 4.27 million in the Greater Casablanca. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center of Morocco, although the national political capital is Rabat.\nThe leading Moroccan companies and many international corporations doing business in the country have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca holds its recorded position as the primary industrial zone of the nation. The Port of Casablanca is one of the largest artificial ports in the world, and the second largest port of North Africa, after Tanger-Med 40 km (25 mi) east of Tangier. Casablanca also hosts the primary naval base for the Royal Moroccan Navy.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe original name of Casablanca was Anfa (Neo-Tifinagh: \u2d30\u2d4f\u2d3c\u2d30), in Berber language, by at least the seventh century BC. After the Portuguese took control of the city in the 15th century AD, they rebuilt it, changing the name to Casa Branca ([kaz\u0250'b\u027e\u0250\u0303k\u0250]), meaning 'white house' in Portuguese. The present name, which is the Spanish version (pronounced [ka\u0320sa\u0320\u02c8\u03b2\u031ela\u0320\u014bka\u0320]), came when the Kingdom of Portugal came under Spanish control through the Iberian Union. During the French protectorate in Morocco, the name remained Casablanca (pronounced [kazabl\u0251\u0303ka]). In 1755 an earthquake destroyed most of the town. It was rebuilt by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah who changed the name into the local Arabic Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101' (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), although occasionally \"Casablanca\" is written in Arabic (\u0643\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0627, K\u0101z\u0101bl\u0101nk\u0101). The city is still nicknamed Casa by many locals and outsiders to the city. In many other cities with a different dialect, it is called Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101, instead.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by Berbers by at least the seventh century BC. It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans. In his book Description of Africa, Leo Africanus refers to ancient Casablanca as \"Anfa\", a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of Barghawata in 744 AD. He believed Anfa was the most \"prosperous city on the Atlantic Coast because of its fertile land.\" Barghawata rose as an independent state around this time, and continued until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1068. Following the defeat of the Barghawata in the 12th century, Arab tribes of Hilal and Sulaym descent settled in the region, mixing with the local Berbers, which led to widespread Arabization. During the 14th century, under the Merinids, Anfa rose in importance as a port. The last of the Merinids were ousted by a popular revolt in 1465.\n\n\n=== Portuguese conquest and Spanish influence ===\n\nIn the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers, leading to it being targeted by the Portuguese, who bombarded the town which led to its destruction in 1468. The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a military fortress in 1515. The town that grew up around it was called Casa Branca, meaning \"white house\" in Portuguese.\nBetween 1580 and 1640, the Crown of Portugal was integrated to the Crown of Spain, so Casablanca and all other areas occupied by the Portuguese were under Spanish control, though maintaining an autonomous Portuguese administration. As Portugal broke ties with Spain in 1640, Casablanca came under fully Portuguese control once again. The Europeans eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 following an earthquake which destroyed most of the town.The town was finally reconstructed by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah (1756\u20131790), the grandson of Moulay Ismail and an ally of George Washington, with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called ad-D\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02bc (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), the Arabic translation of the Portuguese Casa Branca.\n\n\n=== Colonial struggle ===\nIn the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in Britain and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing gunpowder tea, used in Morocco's national drink, mint tea). By the 1860s, around 5,000 residents were there, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s. Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of French colonialists in 1906. By 1921, this rose to 110,000, largely through the development of shanty towns.\n\n\n=== French rule and influence ===\n\nThe Treaty of Algeciras of 1906 formalized French preeminence in Morocco and included three measures that directly impacted Casablanca: that French officers would control operations at the customs office and seize revenue as collateral for loans given by France, that the French holding company La Compagnie Marocaine would develop the port of Casablanca, and that a French-and-Spanish-trained police force would be assembled to patrol the port.To build the port's breakwater, narrow-gauge track was laid in June 1907 for a small Decauville locomotive to connect the port to a quarry in Roches Noires, passing through the sacred Sidi Belyout graveyard. In resistance to this and the measures of the 1906 Treaty of Algeciras, tribesmen of the Chaouia attacked the locomotive, killing 9 Compagnie Marocaine laborers\u20143 French, 3 Italians, and 3 Spanish.In response, the French bombarded the city with multiple gunboats and landed troops inside the town, causing severe damage and 15,000 dead and wounded. In the immediate aftermath of the bombardment and the deployment of French troops, the European homes and the Mellah, or Jewish quarter, were sacked, and the latter was also set ablaze.The bombardment and military invasion of the city effectively began the French military conquest of Morocco, although French control of Casablanca was not formalized until the French Protectorat was established by the Treaty of Fes March 1912.\nGeneral Hubert Lyautey assigned the planning of the new colonial port city to Henri Prost. As he did in other Moroccan cities, Prost designed a European ville nouvelle outside the walls of the medina. In Casablanca, he also designed a new \"ville indig\u00e8ne\" to house Moroccans arriving from other cities.Europeans formed almost half the population of Casablanca.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAfter Philippe P\u00e9tain of France signed the armistice with the Nazis, he ordered French troops in France's colonial empire to defend French territory against any aggressors\u2014Allied or otherwise\u2014applying a policy of \"asymmetrical neutrality\" in favor of the Germans. French colonists in Morocco generally supported P\u00e9tain, while politically conscious Moroccans tended to favor de Gaulle and the Allies.Operation Torch, which started on 8 November 1942, was the British-American invasion of French North Africa during the North African campaign of World War II. The Western Task Force, composed of American units led by Major General George S. Patton and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, carried out the invasions of Mehdia, Fedhala, and Asfi. American forces captured Casablanca from Vichy control when France surrendered November 11, 1942, but the Naval Battle of Casablanca continued until American forces sank German submarine U-173 on November 16.Casablanca was the site of the Nouasseur Air Base, a large American air base used as the staging area for all American aircraft for the European Theater of Operations during World War II. The air field has since become Mohammed V International Airport.\n\n\n==== Anfa Conference ====\n\nCasablanca hosted the Anfa Conference (also called the Casablanca Conference) in January 1943. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed the progress of the war. Also in attendance were the Free France generals Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud, though they played minor roles and didn't participate in the military planning.\nIt was at this conference that the Allies adopted the doctrine of \"unconditional surrender,\" meaning that the Axis powers would be fought until their defeat. Roosevelt also met privately with Sultan Muhammad V and expressed his support for Moroccan independence after the war. This became a turning point, as Moroccan nationalists were emboldened to openly seek complete independence.\n\n\n=== Toward independence ===\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting.\nApril 7, 1947, a massacre of working class Moroccans, carried out by Senegalese Tirailleurs in the service of the French colonial army, was instigated just as Sultan Muhammed V was due to make a speech in Tangier appealing for independence.Riots in Casablanca took place from December 7\u20138, 1952, in response to the assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist Farhat Hached by La Main Rouge\u2014the clandestine militant wing of French intelligence. Then, on 25 December 1953 (Christmas Day), Muhammad Zarqtuni orchestrated a bombing of Casablanca's Central Market in response to the forced exile of Sultan Muhammad V and the royal family on August 20 (Eid al-Adha) of that year.\n\n\n=== Since independence ===\nMorocco gained independence from France in 1956.\n\n\n==== Casablanca Group ====\nJanuary 4\u20137, 1961, the city hosted an ensemble of progressive African leaders during the Casablanca Conference of 1961. Among those received by King Muhammad V were Gamal Abd An-Nasser, Kwame Nkrumah, Modibo Ke\u00efta, and Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, Ferhat Abbas.\n\n\n==== Jewish emigration ====\nCasablanca was a major departure point for Jews leaving Morocco through Operation Yachin, an operation conducted by Mossad to secretly migrate Moroccan Jews to Israel between November 1961 and spring 1964.\n\n\n==== 1965 riots ====\nThe 1965 student protests organized by the National Union of Popular Forces-affiliated National Union of Moroccan Students, which spread to cities around the country and devolved into riots, started on March 22, 1965 in front of Lyc\u00e9e Mohammed V in Casablanca. The protests started as a peaceful march to demand the right to public higher education for Morocco, but expanded to include concerns of laborers, the unemployed, and other marginalized segments of society, and devolved into vandalism and rioting. The riots were violently repressed by security forces with tanks and armored vehicles; Moroccan authorities reported a dozen deaths while the UNFP reported more than 1,000.King Hassan II blamed the events on teachers and parents, and declared in a speech to the nation on March 30, 1965: \"There is no greater danger to the State than a so-called intellectual. It would have been better if you were all illiterate.\u201d\n\n\n==== 1981 riots ====\nOn June 6, 1981, the Casablanca Bread Riots took place. Hassan II appointed the French-trained lawyer Driss Basri, who would later become a symbol of the Years of Lead, with quelling the protests. The government stated that 66 people were killed and 100 were injured, while opposition leaders put the number of dead at 637, saying that many of these were killed by police and army gunfire.\n\n\n==== Mudawana ====\nIn March 2000, more than 60 women's groups organized demonstrations in Casablanca proposing reforms to the legal status of women in the country. About 40,000 women attended, calling for a ban on polygamy and the introduction of divorce law (divorce being a purely religious procedure at that time). Although the counter-demonstration attracted half a million participants, the movement for change started in 2000 was influential on King Mohammed VI, and he enacted a new mudawana, or family law, in early 2004, meeting some of the demands of women's rights activists.On 16 May 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a multiple suicide bomb attack carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to al-Qaeda. Twelve suicide bombers struck five locations in the city.Another series of suicide bombings struck the city in early 2007. These events illustrated some of the persistent challenges the city faces in addressing poverty and integrating disadvantaged neighborhoods and populations. One initiative to improve conditions in the city's disadvantaged neighborhoods was the creation of the Sidi Moumen Cultural Center.As calls for reform spread through the Arab world in 2011, Moroccans joined in, but concessions by the ruler led to acceptance. However, in December, thousands of people demonstrated in several parts of the city, especially the city center near la Fontaine, desiring more significant political reforms.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCasablanca is located on the Atlantic coast of the Chaouia Plains which have historically been the breadbasket of Morocco. Apart from the Atlantic coast, the Bouskoura forest is the only natural attraction in the city. The forest was planted in the 20th century and consists mostly of eucalyptus, palm, and pine trees. It is located halfway to the city's international airport. \nThe only watercourse in Casablanca is oued Bouskoura, a small seasonal creek that until 1912 reached the Atlantic Ocean near the actual port. Most of oued Bouskoura's bed has been covered due to urbanization and only the part south of El Jadida road can now be seen. The closest permanent river to Casablanca is Oum Rabia, 70 km (43.50 mi) to the south-east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCasablanca has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). The cool Canary Current off the Atlantic coast moderates temperature variation, which results in a climate remarkably similar to that of coastal Los Angeles, with similar temperature ranges. The city has an annual average of 72 days with significant precipitation, which amounts to 412 mm (16.2 in) per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) and \u22122.7 \u00b0C (27.1 \u00b0F), respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is 178 mm (7.0 in) on 30 November 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Grand Casablanca region is considered the locomotive of the development of the Moroccan economy. It attracts 32% of the country's production units and 56% of industrial labor. The region uses 30% of the national electricity production. With MAD 93 billion, the region contributes to 44% of the industrial production of the kingdom. About 33% of national industrial exports, MAD 27 billion, comes from the Grand Casablanca; 30% of the Moroccan banking network is concentrated in Casablanca.One of the most important Casablancan exports is phosphate. Other industries include fishing, fish canning, sawmills, furniture production, building materials, glass, textiles, electronics, leather work, processed food, spirits, soft drinks, and cigarettes.The Casablanca and Mohammedia seaports activity represent 50% of the international commercial flows of Morocco. Almost the entire Casablanca waterfront is under development, mainly the construction of huge entertainment centres between the port and Hassan II Mosque, the Anfa Resort project near the business, entertainment and living centre of Megarama, the shopping and entertainment complex of Morocco Mall, as well as a complete renovation of the coastal walkway. The Sindbad park is planned to be totally renewed with rides, games and entertainment services.Royal Air Maroc has its head office at the Casablanca-Anfa Airport. In 2004, it announced that it was moving its head office from Casablanca to a location in Province of Nouaceur, close to Mohammed V International Airport. The agreement to build the head office in Nouaceur was signed in 2009.The biggest CBD of Casablanca and Maghreb is in the North of the town in Sidi Maarouf near the mosque of Hassan II and the biggest project of skycrapers of Maghreb and Africa Casablanca Marina.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nCasablanca is a commune, part of the region of Casablanca-Settat. The commune is divided into eight districts or prefectures, which are themselves divided into 16 subdivisions or arrondissements and one municipality. The districts and their subdivisions are:\nA\u00efn Chock (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642) \u2013 A\u00efn Chock (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642)\nA\u00efn Seba\u00e2 - Hay Mohammadi (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a) \u2013 A\u00efn Seba\u00e2 (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639), Hay Mohammadi (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a), Roches Noires (\u0631\u0648\u0634 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631).\nAnfa (\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627) \u2013 Anfa (\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627), Ma\u00e2rif (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0641), Sidi Belyout (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0637).\nBen M'Sick (\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643) \u2013 Ben M'Sick (\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643), Sbata (\u0633\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647).\nSidi Bernoussi (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0635\u064a) \u2013 Sidi Bernoussi (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0635\u064a), Sidi Moumen (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0645\u0646).\nAl Fida - Mers Sultan (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u2013 \u0645\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646) \u2013 Al Fida (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621); Mechouar (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0648\u0631) (municipality), Mers Sultan (\u0645\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646).\nHay Hassani (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a) \u2013 Hay Hassani (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a).\nMoulay Rachid (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f) \u2013 Moulay Rachid (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f), Sidi Othmane (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646).\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nThe list of neighborhoods is indicative and not complete:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe commune of Casablanca recorded a population of 3,359,818 in the 2014 Moroccan census. About 98% live in urban areas. Around 25% of them are under 15 and 9% are over 60 years old. The population of the city is about 11% of the total population of Morocco. Grand Casablanca is also the largest urban area in the Maghreb. 99.9% of the population of Morocco are Arab and Berber Muslims.\nDuring the French protectorate in Morocco, European Christians formed almost half the population of Casablanca. Since independence in 1956, the European population has decreased substantially.The city also is still home for a small community of Moroccan Christians, as well as a small group of foreign resident Roman Catholics.\n\n\n=== Judaism in Casablanca ===\nJews have a long history in Casablanca. A Sephardic Jewish community was in Anfa up to the destruction of the city by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750, the Rabbi Elijah Synagogue was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.Approximately 28,000 Moroccan Jews immigrated to the State of Israel between 1948 and 1951, many through Casablanca. Casablanca then became a departure point in Operation Yachin, the covert Mossad-organized migration operation from 1961\u20131964. In 2018 only 2,500 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca, while according to the World Jewish Congress only 1,000 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca.Today, the Jewish cemetery of Casablanca is one of the major cemeteries of the city, and many synagogues remain in service, but the city's Jewish community has dwindled. The Moroccan Jewish Museum is a museum established in the city in 1997.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nPublic: University of Hassan II Casablanca\nPrivate:\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Mundiapolis\nUniversit\u00e9 Internationale de Casablanca\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nInternational schools:\n\nBelgium: \u00c9cole Belge de Casablanca\nFrench:\nColl\u00e8ge Anatole France\nLyc\u00e9e Lyautey\nGroupe Scolaire Louis Massignon\nLyc\u00e9e La R\u00e9sidence\nLyc\u00e9e Ma\u00efmonide (FR)\nLyc\u00e9e L\u00e9on l'Africain\n\u00c9cole Normale H\u00e9bra\u00efque\n\u00c9cole Al Jabr\nItalian: Scuola \"Enrico Mattei\"\nSpanish: Instituto Espa\u00f1ol Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez\nAmerican:\nCasablanca American School\nAmerican Academy Casablanca\nGeorge Washington Academy\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nMost of the city's places of worship are Muslim mosques. Some of the city's synagogues, such as Ettedgui Synagogue, also remain.

Raja's symbol is an eagle and Wydad's symbol is a star and crescent which means a symbol of Islam. These two popular clubs have produced some of Morocco's best players, such as: Salaheddine Bassir, Abdelmajid Dolmy, Baddou Zaki, Aziz Bouderbala, and Noureddine Naybet. Other football teams on top of these two major teams based in the city of Casablanca include Rachad Bernoussi, TAS de Casablanca, Majd Al Madina, and Racing Casablanca.\n\n\n=== Tennis ===\nCasablanca hosts The Grand Prix Hassan II, a professional men's tennis tournament of the ATP tour.

Morocco was scheduled to host the 2015 African Nations Cup, but decided to decline due to Ebola fears. Morocco was expelled and the tournament was held in Equatorial Guinea.\n\n\n==== Venues ====\nStade Larbi Zaouli\nStade Mohamed V\nStade Sidi Bernoussi\nComplexe Al Amal de CasablancaThe Grand Stade de Casablanca is the proposed title of the planned football stadium to be built in the city. Once completed in 2014, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of Raja Casablanca, Wydad Casablanca, and the Morocco national football team. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 93,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the Stade Mohamed V. The initial idea of the stadium was for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to South Africa. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2025. The idea of the stadium was also for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to Canada, Mexico and United States. It is now hoping for the 2030 FIFA World Cup which Morocco is co-bidding with either African neighbors Tunisia and Algeria or two European nations Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nal-Haja al-Hamdawiya, one of the most iconic figures in aita music, was born in Casablanca.

With his staged nude postcard photos taken in Casablanca's colonial brothel quarter, Flandrin was also responsible for disseminating the orientalist image of Moroccan women as sexual objects.Casablanca has a thriving street photography scene. Yoriyas is prominent among photographers capturing the economic capital's street scenes, and has attracted international attention.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Casablanca had many movie theaters, such as Cinema Rialto, Cinema Lynx and Cinema Vox\u2014the largest in Africa at the time it was built.The 1942 American film Casablanca is supposedly set in Casablanca and has had a lasting impact on the city's image, though it was filmed entirely in California and doesn't feature a single Moroccan character with a speaking role. Salut Casa! was a propaganda film brandishing France's purported colonial triumph in its mission civilizatrice in the city.Love in Casablanca (1991), starring Abdelkarim Derqaoui and Muna Fettou, is one of the first Moroccan films to deal with Morocco's complex realities and depict life in Casablanca with verisimilitude.

Hicham Lasri and Said Naciri also from Casablanca.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nCasablanca's architecture and urban development are historically significant. The city is home to many notable buildings in a variety of styles, including traditional Moroccan architecture, various colonial architectural styles, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Neo-Mauresque, Streamline Moderne, Modernism, Brutalism, and more. During the French Protectorate, the French government described Casablanca as a \"laboratory of urbanism.\"The work of the Groupe des Architectes Modernes Marocains (GAMMA) on public housing projects\u2014such as Carri\u00e8res Centrales in Hay Mohammadi\u2014in a style described as vernacular modernism influenced modernist architecture around the world.Casam\u00e9moire and MAMMA. are two organizations dedicated to the preservation and appreciation of the city's architectural heritage.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rapid Transit ===\n\nThe Casablanca Tramway is the rapid transit tram system in Casablanca. As of 2019, the network consists of two lines covering 47.5 km (30 mi), with 71 stops; further lines (\u06373 and \u06374) are under construction.Since the 1970s, Casablanca had planned to build a metro system to offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality. However, the city council voted to abandon the metro project in 2014 due to high costs, and decided to continue expanding the already operating tram system instead.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nCasablanca's main airport is Mohammed V International Airport, Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve Marrakech, Rabat, Agadir, Oujda, Tangier, Al Hoceima, and Laayoune, as well as other cities.\nCasablanca is well-served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. New York City, Montreal, Paris, Washington D.C., London and Dubai are important primary destinations.\nThe older, smaller Casablanca-Anfa Airport to the west of the city, served certain destinations including Damascus, and Tunis, and was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It has been closed and destroyed to build the \"Casablanca Finance City\", the new heart of the city of Casablanca. Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport is located in the nearby community of Tit Mellil.\n\n\n=== Coach buses ===\nCompagnie de Transports au Maroc (CTM) offers private intercity coach buses on various lines run servicing most notable Moroccan towns, as well as a number of European cities. These run from the CTM Bus Station on Leo Africanus Street near the Central Market in downtown Casablanca. Supratours, an affiliate of ONCF, also offers coach bus service at a slightly lower cost, departing from a station on Wilad Zian Street. There is another bus station farther down on the same street called the Wilad Zian Bus Station; this station is the country's largest bus station, serving over 800 buses daily, catering more to Morocco's lower income population.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nRegistered taxis in Casablanca are coloured red and known as petit taxis (small taxis), or coloured white and known as grands taxis (big taxis). As is standard Moroccan practice, petits taxis, typically small-four door Dacia Logan, Peugeot 207, or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. Grands taxis, generally older Mercedes-Benz sedans, provide shared mini-bus like service within the city on predefined routes, or shared intercity service. Grands taxis may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.\n\n\n=== Trains ===\nCasablanca is served by three main railway stations run by the national rail service, the ONCF.\n\nCasa-Voyageurs is the main intercity station, from which trains run south to Marrakech or El Jadida and north to Mohammedia and Rabat, and then on either to Tangier or Meknes, Fes, Taza and Oujda/Nador. It also serves as the southern terminus of the Al-Boraq high speed line from Tangier. A dedicated airport shuttle service to Mohammed V International Airport also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.\n\nCasa-Port serves primarily commuter trains such as the Train Navette Rapide (TNR or Aouita) operating on the Casablanca \u2013 Kenitra rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark Casablanca Twin Center. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction, the station is still operational. From 2013, it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the city's new tram network.\nCasa-Oasis was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early 21st century, and officially reopened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern intercity train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to intercity standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nAlthough Mohammed V International Airport receives most international flights into Morocco, international tourism in Casablanca is not as developed as it is in cities like Marrakesh. Casablanca, however, attracts fewer tourists than those of cities such as Fes and Marrakech. \nThe Hassan II Mosque, which is the second largest mosque in Africa and the seventh largest in the world, is the city's main tourist attraction. Visitors also come to see the city's rich architectural heritage.Popular sites for national tourism include shopping centers such as Morocco Mall, Anfa Place, the Marina Shopping Center, and the Tachfine Center. Additional sites include the Corniche and the beach of Ain Diab, and parks such as the Arab League Park or the Sindibad theme park.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAmal Ayouch (born 1966) \u2013 stage and film actress\nSalaheddine Bassir \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nLaarbi Batma \u2013 Moroccan musician and artist, founding member of Nas El Ghiwan\nLarbi Benbarek \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMiriem Bensalah-Chaqroun \u2013 Moroccan businesswoman\nJean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes \u2013 French footballer\nFrida Boccara \u2013 French singer, Winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 1969\nMerieme Chadid \u2013 Moroccan astronomer\nSoufiane Choubani \u2013 Founder of the Moroccan National Debate Team\nJean-Charles de Castelbajac \u2013 French fashion designer\nDizzy DROS \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nGad Elmaleh \u2013 French/Canadian comedian\nLa Fouine \u2013 Moroccan-French rapper\nEl Haqed \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nSerge Haroche \u2013 French physicist who was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physics\nShatha Hassoun \u2013 Moroccan/Iraqi singer\nLydia Hatuel-Czuckermann \u2013 Israeli Olympic fencer\nHicham Mesbahi \u2013 Moroccan boxer\nFrench Montana \u2013 American rapper\nNawal El Moutawakel \u2013 Olympic champion\nNoureddine Naybet \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMostafa Nissaboury \u2013 Moroccan poet\nHakim Noury \u2013 Moroccan film director\nMaurice Ohana \u2013 French composer\nJean Reno \u2013 French Hollywood actor\nDaniel Sivan \u2013 professor\nAlain Souchon \u2013 French songwriter\nFrank Stephenson \u2013 award-winning automobile designer\nHassan Saada \u2013 Moroccan boxer arrested for alleged rape before Olympic match\nSidney Taurel \u2013 naturalized American CEO of Eli Lilly and Company from 1998 to 2008\nRichard Virenque \u2013 French cyclist\nMuhammad Zarqtuni \u2013 Moroccan nationalist and resistance leader\nAbdallah Zrika \u2013 Moroccan poet\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe 1942 film Casablanca (starring Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart) is supposed to have been set in Casablanca, although it was filmed entirely in Los Angeles and doesn't feature a single Arab or North African character with a speaking role. The film depicts Casablanca as the scene of power struggle between various foreign powers, which had much more to do with the Tangier of the time. The film has achieved worldwide popularity since its release. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, it won three, including Best Picture.\nA Night in Casablanca (1946) was the 12th Marx Brothers' movie. The film stars Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, and Harpo Marx. It was directed by Archie Mayo and written by Joseph Fields and Roland Kibbee. The film contains the song \"Who's Sorry Now?\", with music by Ted Snyder and lyrics by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. It is sung in French by Lisette Verea playing the part of Beatrice Rheiner, and then later sung in English. Liszt's \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\" is played twice, once by Chico on piano as an introduction to the \"Beer Barrel Polka\", and again by Harpo on the harp.\nThe city is featured in The Mysterious Caravan (1975), volume 54 in the original Hardy Boys series.\nCasablanca is the setting for several chapters in Doubleshot, a 2000 James Bond novel by Raymond Benson. In the novel, one of the characters mentions that the 1942 film was shot in Hollywood and not on location.\nCasablanca is one of the key locations in the 2006 video game Dreamfall, as it is where the primary protagonist of the game, Zo\u00eb Castillo, lives. Although the city is imagined in the year 2219, much of the present-day architecture is used for inspiration.\nCasablanca is the setting for the first act of the 2016 World War II romantic thriller film Allied starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nCasablanca is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nRabat Zoo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site of Casablanca\nOfficial Casablanca Tourism Website (in French)\nCasablanca photo gallery (buildings and other landmarks with a history dating back to the French Protectorate)\nOpen Air Museum of 20th century architecture\n Geographic data related to Casablanca at OpenStreetMap",

          "Feb 2017 the park is under construction, looks grand and great but with tons of bulldozers and dug out trees, not sure if they are replacing them or what. It's free and great to walk around as you transition from neighborhood to neighborhood or want to change trams.",

          "I had a walk around Casablanca a couple of days ago and I can see why people might say that part of the park is a mess. The renovations are finally taking place. The abandoned funfair has been dismantled. There is a lot of landscaping going on in the part of the park right next",
          "My (female) friend and I walked through here one morning at about 9am on our way to the Sacre Coeur. At the park entrance we saw a fair bit of rubbish strewn amongst the trees to either side. There were some employees cleaning up, so they probably just hadn't got to that part",

Established in 1997, it is the only museum devoted to Judaism in the Arab world. The museum, whose building originated in 1948 as a Jewish orphanage that housed up to 160 Jewish youth, was renovated in 2013.The museum was founded by Simon Levy, a former professor at the University of Rabat and founder of the Foundation for the Preservation of Moroccan Jewish Culture. Prior to his role in preserving Moroccan Jewish Culture, Levy (1934 \u2013 2011) was known as an independence and human rights activist from the time of colonialism through the reign of King Hassan II.Within the museum, visitors can find artifacts of Moroccan Jewry, including the bimah (c. 1944) from the Beni-Issakhar Synagogue in Casablanca, mezuzahs, and Hanukiah menorah. The museum also touts a considerable collection of Berber history, including costumes, jewelry, and Fatima pendants. Visitors can also observe a reconstructed jewelry-making shop, which was created using the workbench and tools of Moroccan Jew, Saul Cohen. One of the most notable additions, however, is the incorporation of the preamble of Morocco\u2019s updated 2011 constitution, which cites Hebraic influences as a pillar of national unity. Current museum director, Zhor Rehihil, was quoted declaring that, \u201cthe new constitution emphasizes both ethnic and religious pluralism in Morocco.\u201dThe building itself, which covers 700 square meters, consists of a large multipurpose room and three other exhibit rooms. The multipurpose room is known for displays of art from Jewish Moroccans, including paintings, photographs, and sculptures. The exhibit rooms contains artifacts focused on religious and family life, in addition to recreation of Moroccan synagogues.Moroccan Jews constitute an ancient community. Before the founding of Israel in 1948, there were about 250,000 to 350,000 Jews in the country, which gave Morocco the largest Jewish community in the Muslim world, but fewer than 2,500 or so remain today.\nIt was rededicated by King Mohammed VI of Morocco on December 20, 2016 after it was restored. In addition to King Mohammed VI and Moroccan government officials, the re-dedication was attended by Samuel L. Kaplan, the US ambassador to Morocco, and museum President Jaques Toledano.In January 2019, French Moroccan opera singer David Serero donated a large part of his Moroccan Judaica art collection, making it the largest donation of judaica artifacts ever donated to a Moroccan museum.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of the Jews in Morocco\nMaghrebi Jews\nList of Moroccan Jews\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "The day we came here it was closed for some reason and there were armed guards all around. Extremely disappointed. A city of muslims and mosque, no one pays much attention to the Catholic churches and I was a little tired of the non stop mosques and being to told to visit so",

          "Perhaps because it is not Art Deco but built in 1954 and somewhat overshadowed by the Gothic Deco masterpiece of Sacre Coeur, this church is not as visited. The interior stained glass walls are extraordinary in scale, colour and narrative. Don't miss it",
          "I've never seen entire walls of stain glass. It's absolutely gorgeous. The architecture of this church is very memorable. I'm happy we took the time. There's no admission or gift shop. Just a donation box.",
          "other than the stained glass. not much else can offer. If this is not one of the very few church in this Muslim country. just not worth to mention. surprised to see so many people in the Sunday service, all full, a lot of us get not seat.",
          "My wife and I attended services on Easter Sunday at this beautiful church. We got there about 30 minutes before the service and were able to find seating. We were warmly welcomed by the parishioners. The entire service was in French. I had French in highs school and college,",
          "As a Catholic it was moving to see this church and what it represents to the small Catholic/Christian community in Morocco. However, it seems to be a dumping ground for tour bus after tour bus to gawk at the stained glass and not understand what they are seeing.",
          "Some of the most beautiful stained glass I have ever seen. Take a moment to rest and admire the exquisite workmanship even if you are not religious",
          "It was strange to visit a Christian church in the center of Muslim Casablanca, but it\u2019s modern concrete architecture, full room length glass panels and ornately carved wooden ceiling make this worth a stop. The sunlight playing through the stained glass was beautiful.",
          "Well worth a visit - and don't miss seeing the grotto - very different. The stained glass windows are beautiful and the attendants welcoming of visitors.",
          "Stained glass is truly spectacular. Not sure I would have appreciated it as much without the help of our guide telling the story of each of the panels. The art in the glass had a Chagall feel to it - vibrant, beautiful, ethereal. Had never heard of the French artist who",
          "By its very existence, Notre Dame de Lourdes, is a symbol of the religious tolerance that exists in Morocco. It is large and proud and unhidden. And it is filled with beautiful mid 20th Century stained glass. (Think the New Coventry Cathedral). Tour groups mill in the small",
          "We loved this church in the middle of Casablanca It\u2019s made of reinforced concrete and the stained glass is very modern, but it has a very simple beauty. There was a real feeling of peace in the church and although not particularly religious I could have stayed their all day in",
          "This 1950s vintage Catholic church has a beautiful interior that includes stunning stained glass windows. Outside, in the church\u2019s courtyard, is a small \u201ccave\u201d meant as an hommage to the grotto at Lourdes, France, where St. Bernadette is said to have seen the Virgin Mary \u2014 this",
          "Notre Dame de Lourdes is a relatively modern church. It doesn't have much to offer except its stained glass windows. That alone is worth the short walk from the busier tourist districts.",
          "It is evident that at a time, not too long ago, there must have been a strong Catholic influence in Morocco - or at least at Casablanca. Completed in 1956, this is not a historically old cathedral, but it is the breathtaking stained glass windows that entirely cover one wall,",
          "Cathedral with a 'cave' at the entrance, lovely stained glass work. When we visited (on a Sunday), there was a choir group rehearsing which added a nice touch to the visit.",

          "As part of a city tour of Casablanca we stopped briefly at the cathedral. I was not expecting the beautiful stained glass that lined the walls. Well worth the stop.",
          "This great monument is currently under renovation and is planned to reopen in end of 2017. My last visit was prior to its closure and I am now looking for its re-opening. It is an imposing building right by a beautiful park in the heart of Casablanca",

          "Be sure to see the status of the remodeling BEFORE you go. We did not and after walking to the Cathedral we were only able to see a partial view from outside the fence. Looked like it would be amazing but for us we cannot say. Nice area to walk to but find other things to visit",
          "Nice church lovely architecture. Withe bigs windows .not big building but nice white color even it dirty with dust",
          "We were blown away by this little hidden gem in the middle of Casablanca. I loved the stained glass windows. Amazing artistry. A church that stands out and looks similar to its namesake in Paris. It left a big impression on me. Hint : check to see if it's open and opening",
          "Obviously extensive work on reconstruction is underway. The building site was enclosed by a fence so that the great church could only be experienced by far",
          "Outside the Architecture is clearly of its time and a bit brutalist. What really makes this building is the modern take on the installed stained Glass windows. Designs are primitive in style - to say the least! Really liked the depiction of the leaping red Devil !!!!",
          "Beautiful and unusual stained glass windows. Very large windows with unusual scenes for a Catholic church. Worth a short visit.",
          "This church is beautiful. The stained glass is something else and it was so peaceful I really loved this place.",
          "It was something to see a large Catholic Cathedral in this Muslim country. Outside there were restrooms for visitors and a grotto to view. Inside there were 20-30 large stained-glass mural windows to view as well as some outstanding sculpture. Even having seen Cathedrals in",
          "not worthwhile to visit unles for religious reason. Only nice the vitraux which are impressive, the rest is on a medium level",
          "As someone brought up in the Catholic faith, this church was not especially memorable, except for its very pretty glasswork. To be fair, we were on a flying visit as part of a five hour city tour. The main body of the church is shown in my photograph (apologies for a few",
          "Like many other reviewers, my first impression was of a mid-century modern, almost brutalist concrete exterior. Once inside, the glass is stunning. The panels run the entire length of the walls. The colors are marvelous, and continue up to the roofline between each of the",
          "The outside of this church is not overly impressive but the stained glass windows inside make it a worthwhile visit. It is a functioning Catholic Church. Some members of our tour wanted to light a candle there but there isn't a spot inside. They have a man made cave like area",
          "from the outside we thought it looked like a fifties concrete carbuncle. once you enter through the doors and into the sanctity of the church the concrete takes on a new meaning. the casting allows for cantilevers and majestic svelte pillars which give way to infills of awesome",
          "The inside of the church was amazing with very nice stained glass. The grotto outside reminds me of Lourdes in France.",
          "A modern design cathedral built by the French Catholic residents. Stop for a quick visit. The stained glass windows run uninterrupted for the length of the walls and are truly beautiful.",
          "One of the the only (still) active churchs in Morocco. It's has a typical modern gotic touch that makes it unique in the surroundings.",
          "Worth a quick visit to see the extensive stained glass windows and the soaring interior in Casablanca's only active Catholic church.",
          "By all means it is nothing to compare with the original Notre Dame de Paris yet it has a nice spiritual feeling to it.",
          "Had two reasons to visit the church -- for mass and to see the famed stained glass windows and lovely architecture. As the service progressed, one cant fail to appreciate the beauty of the sunlight filtering through the glass and striking the altars. It was simply magnificent.",
          "The outside of the building is very modern and does not reflect the beauty of the stained glass within. An interesting and ancient cave within the grounds is worth a visit, but the windows are by far the most colourful and thought provoking part of the tour. The entrance would",
          "This Cathedral is the only Christian monument still in use in Morocco. Unfortunately it was under renovation when we were there, so we couldn't enter and look at then beautful stained windows and artwork inside.",

          "The inside is a form of simple elegance - large concrete columns holding up a bare concrete roof set ablaze with full-length stained glass windows on the ground floor. Be sure to walk into the middle & look up to see the concrete light up. Entry is free, but you need to time it",
          "A lovely church worth a visit. The stained glass windows are very colourful and it is a peaceful place to sit and while away a few minutes. There is a grotto outside and you can light candles. (large and 50 cents each) The Church is on a very busy corner with coaches dropping",
          "Great to see this modern Church,,,,,,only Beton. with colourfull glass windows, The light makes these windows like magical wonderwall. I have seen a lot of modern Churches all around the world. This church reminds me by a church in Paris ..Le Reincy,, it was built in the 20ties",
          "Sadly the cathedral is closed. It is under renovation and can't get inside. One might be surprised to see a Catholic church in a Muslim nation, but there are over 100,000 Catholics in the country. It is a carry forward from the days of the French. The grounds are torn up because",

          "Tons of stained glass in this modern building, visited during a city tour on our Gate1Travel trip when we visited Casablanca. Enjoyed a short visit here, very peaceful and beautiful, with long wall panels of stained glass, and the ones I especially liked, the narrow windows on",
          "I like non-typical attractions. I like contemporary architecture. I loved stained glass windows in the Notre Dame de Lourdes. But unfortunately, this is the only thing I loved about it. Modern approach to a traditional problem just did not work out in this very case.",
          "Visited during time in Casablanca and was impressed by the extensive stained glass windows and large scale of the interior. Looks much better from the inside. Certainly worth a look if in the area.",
          "Notre Dame de Lourdes is a Catholic cathedral in Casablanca. It is a large church, striking, with beautiful stained glass windows alone each side. The stained glass windows are beautiful and well worth the visit. It does not require a great deal of time.",
          "I visited on a Saturday afternoon, and there was a small class or meeting being held in part of the church. The stained glass is very contemporary and very moving. It encompasses the entire side walls of the structure. Otherwise, the church is rather simple. Allow only about 15",
          "Notre Dame de Lourdes is a Catholic Church in Casablanca, it's a nice sized church, on the minimise side, beautiful stain glass windows, but in comparison UK and Spain and Italian churches not anywhere near as good. It shows a very tolerant attitude towards Christians within the",

          "We paid a quick visit to the cathedral which is uninspiring from the outside but spectacular inside due to the stained glass and the light that illuminates them from behind. Free entry, so pass a few minutes wandering round away from the hustle bustle and heat outside.",
          "Worth a stop just for the amazing stain glass windows. Absolutely spectacular. Little cave where can light a candle. Hidden gem in Casablanca",
          "nice cathedral. And magnificent view from the top. I like art deco architecture, same you can see in new medina in Casa.",
          "As indicated above, the stained glass is really the only reason for stopping here. It is indeed beautiful. The rest of the church - meh!",
          "This church has a very special character because of the scenes in these wonderful colored glass windows. We loved it.",
          "A brief stop is sufficient to take in African architecture. The stain glass windows from floor to ceiling are spectacular.",
          "We went to Notre Dame de Lordes as part of an organised tour of Casablanca. I have to admit that the outside of the building does blend in rather well with drabness of the area but once inside it is an amazing church. The stain glass windows are magnificent with the sun",
          "Modern church, not really a touristic place, e few locals around, I didn't find this to be a benchmark of Casablanca. Long walk from the centre too. Not worth the effort in my opinion. Morocco has many better places to offer.",
          "Very interesting architectural fusion: art d\u00e9co + neo gothic + mauresque. There are some art nouveau inspired houses just opposite.",
          "Stepping inside this catholic church is reminiscent of a small Notre Dame, with its stained glass windows and hushed atmosphere. There is a small grotto outside the front door which is definitely worth a visit.",
          "Sometimes there are art exhibitions in here, but usually it just sits empty and often unlocked. The architecture of the outside is what is really worth looking at. Navigate the vagrants and gas huffers to take in the impressive walls and windows.",
          "If you arrive at the entrance of this hideous concrete monster and ask yourself \"Why bother?\", tuck away your doubts and go in to treat yourself to some rather stunning stained glass. It is a real, quiet oasis in the noise and chaos of Casablanca.",

          "We stopped in this catholic cathedral in Casablanca and were amazed by the stained glass windows. Catholics are a minority in Casablanca having only 800,000 followers. The Jews have one million in Casablanca while the muslims are nearly four million in this large city. There",
          "The Stain glass windows are worth the visit alone. A duplicate of the lourdes grotto in France, as this was used by French Catholics to remind them.",

          "My goodness this is the ugliest structure and ugliest building material church that I've ever seen. Sure the stained glass is good, but the rest is so so ugly it can't even be saved by the glass windows. Barely worth visiting at all.",
          "it is very fascinating from inside and worths being seen next to it there are a lot of cafes and restaurants and it is 5 minutes walk from the shopping center Alpha 55",
          "Not too much to see in what is a quite modern concrete design. The stain glass windows are the main feature but there is no architectural significance. The ' grotto' outside is a bit of a tourist add on.",
          "Come here when there is no mass and experience the empty yet spiritual feeling in the church. The lightings are sublime. They have also African type masses with African songs which are very lively.",
          "Worth a stop in. Worth a longer bit for silence and contemplation. Stained glass was stunning, Architecture fabulous. Not your western style old church in that columns are modern and towering.",
          "It's very unique and a bit scary with its very high ceiling one can feel like a midget. The place is beautiful totaly worth a visit. The locals don't know the names of the churches tho, you will find difficulty if yoi depended on the locals for directions. Not impossible but",
          "I was there when they had a choral practise - great accustics, small grotto, school and scouts. Though a fair distance to walk to it is a good place for some solitude",
          "A curious little church in a moslem country. But brilliant stained glass inside. And a statue of the virgin outside in a small niche. Worth a visit",
          "Stopped here as an unscheduled part of guided tour. The church looks incredibly dull from the outside but the inside has incredible stained glass which form the sides of the church. It's free so definitely worth a visit especially as contrast to a mosque.",
          "The stained glass windows are made with the dalle de verre glass method which is very thick glass which is hand faceted around the edges with concrete between the small pieces. The thickness of the glass and the facets make it very vibrant. I'm not a fan of stained glass that",

          "The pictures of the outside show you how the place is on the outside. On the inside the stained glass is a must see. The stain glass is worth the time to visit the site.",
          "I recommended that you should go and see for yourself. When you go into the Cathedral Church, you will see the beautiful, colourful glass shining through into the church. I couldn't help myself but I took my time to walk around inside the church as I have never seen before. I",
          "The church is at the corner of a busy intersection and easy to miss as the building does not resemble the traditional church. The stained glass is worth the trip as it is very unusual and beautiful. A quiet retreat from the busy streets and hoking car horns.",
          "This place is amazing. The stain glass windows is worth visiting alone. If your in Casablanca stop by this gorgeous site.",
          "Modern building , completed in 1956, with superb range of contemporary stained glass windows. The windows are unusual as they are made from dalle de verre glass, that is faceted glass rather than the traditional flat painted glass.",
          "we visited on a lovely afternoon and we were both a bit disappointed really. It was fairly peaceful and a nice rest from the relentless buzz of Casa, but still a bit plain. We had come from the Hassan mosque though o I suppose it had a lot to live up to. It was a little",
          "From the outside it really looks very ordinary. From the inside it is a different story. Unfortunatley for us the congregation was there recieving a sermon. We sat at the back and whites the stained glass",
          "A trip to Casablanca would not be complete without stopping to see this beautiful church. Located in the heart of Casablanca, this Roman Catholic Church services some of the 20,000 Roman Catholics that live in Morocco. This was one our stops on our day trip through the city.",

          "Unlike any other church we've been in, this one had amazing stained glass windows running down both sides of the church. The afternoon light coming in through these walls of glass was lovely. The church is a cool sea of calm in the bustling city. The unexpected grotto just",
          "This is a very modern church with contemporary stained glass windows running the entire length of both side walls of this church. The work was amazing. These were very different than any stained glass we have seen before in churches.",

          "Worth a stop and it is free! The stained glass panels were placed along the entire length of the church.",

          "This is a pretty church. The most notable feature of the church are the walls that are stained glass. It is definatly worth the trip if you are in Casablanca for a day.",

          "There is really nothing to dislike with this church, it is the interior that is eye catching. The church is rectangular in plan and with both of the long ground floor walls built from stained glass and with the sunlight in Morrocco, it is a superb attraction. Be aware that it is",

        "wiki": "Casablanca (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621\u200e, romanized: ad-d\u0101r al-bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02be; Berber languages: \u2d30\u2d4f\u2d3c\u2d30, romanized: anfa) is the largest city of Morocco. Located in the central-western part of Morocco bordering the Atlantic Ocean, it is the largest city in the Maghreb region and the eighth-largest in the Arab world. Casablanca is Morocco's chief port and one of the largest financial centers in Africa. According to the 2019 population estimate, the city has a population of about 3.71 million in the urban area and over 4.27 million in the Greater Casablanca. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center of Morocco, although the national political capital is Rabat.\nThe leading Moroccan companies and many international corporations doing business in the country have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca holds its recorded position as the primary industrial zone of the nation. The Port of Casablanca is one of the largest artificial ports in the world, and the second largest port of North Africa, after Tanger-Med 40 km (25 mi) east of Tangier. Casablanca also hosts the primary naval base for the Royal Moroccan Navy.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe original name of Casablanca was Anfa (Neo-Tifinagh: \u2d30\u2d4f\u2d3c\u2d30), in Berber language, by at least the seventh century BC. After the Portuguese took control of the city in the 15th century AD, they rebuilt it, changing the name to Casa Branca ([kaz\u0250'b\u027e\u0250\u0303k\u0250]), meaning 'white house' in Portuguese. The present name, which is the Spanish version (pronounced [ka\u0320sa\u0320\u02c8\u03b2\u031ela\u0320\u014bka\u0320]), came when the Kingdom of Portugal came under Spanish control through the Iberian Union. During the French protectorate in Morocco, the name remained Casablanca (pronounced [kazabl\u0251\u0303ka]). In 1755 an earthquake destroyed most of the town. It was rebuilt by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah who changed the name into the local Arabic Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101' (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), although occasionally \"Casablanca\" is written in Arabic (\u0643\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0627, K\u0101z\u0101bl\u0101nk\u0101). The city is still nicknamed Casa by many locals and outsiders to the city. In many other cities with a different dialect, it is called Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101, instead.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by Berbers by at least the seventh century BC. It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans. In his book Description of Africa, Leo Africanus refers to ancient Casablanca as \"Anfa\", a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of Barghawata in 744 AD. He believed Anfa was the most \"prosperous city on the Atlantic Coast because of its fertile land.\" Barghawata rose as an independent state around this time, and continued until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1068. Following the defeat of the Barghawata in the 12th century, Arab tribes of Hilal and Sulaym descent settled in the region, mixing with the local Berbers, which led to widespread Arabization. During the 14th century, under the Merinids, Anfa rose in importance as a port. The last of the Merinids were ousted by a popular revolt in 1465.\n\n\n=== Portuguese conquest and Spanish influence ===\n\nIn the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers, leading to it being targeted by the Portuguese, who bombarded the town which led to its destruction in 1468. The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a military fortress in 1515. The town that grew up around it was called Casa Branca, meaning \"white house\" in Portuguese.\nBetween 1580 and 1640, the Crown of Portugal was integrated to the Crown of Spain, so Casablanca and all other areas occupied by the Portuguese were under Spanish control, though maintaining an autonomous Portuguese administration. As Portugal broke ties with Spain in 1640, Casablanca came under fully Portuguese control once again. The Europeans eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 following an earthquake which destroyed most of the town.The town was finally reconstructed by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah (1756\u20131790), the grandson of Moulay Ismail and an ally of George Washington, with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called ad-D\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02bc (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), the Arabic translation of the Portuguese Casa Branca.\n\n\n=== Colonial struggle ===\nIn the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in Britain and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing gunpowder tea, used in Morocco's national drink, mint tea). By the 1860s, around 5,000 residents were there, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s. Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of French colonialists in 1906. By 1921, this rose to 110,000, largely through the development of shanty towns.\n\n\n=== French rule and influence ===\n\nThe Treaty of Algeciras of 1906 formalized French preeminence in Morocco and included three measures that directly impacted Casablanca: that French officers would control operations at the customs office and seize revenue as collateral for loans given by France, that the French holding company La Compagnie Marocaine would develop the port of Casablanca, and that a French-and-Spanish-trained police force would be assembled to patrol the port.To build the port's breakwater, narrow-gauge track was laid in June 1907 for a small Decauville locomotive to connect the port to a quarry in Roches Noires, passing through the sacred Sidi Belyout graveyard. In resistance to this and the measures of the 1906 Treaty of Algeciras, tribesmen of the Chaouia attacked the locomotive, killing 9 Compagnie Marocaine laborers\u20143 French, 3 Italians, and 3 Spanish.In response, the French bombarded the city with multiple gunboats and landed troops inside the town, causing severe damage and 15,000 dead and wounded. In the immediate aftermath of the bombardment and the deployment of French troops, the European homes and the Mellah, or Jewish quarter, were sacked, and the latter was also set ablaze.The bombardment and military invasion of the city effectively began the French military conquest of Morocco, although French control of Casablanca was not formalized until the French Protectorat was established by the Treaty of Fes March 1912.\nGeneral Hubert Lyautey assigned the planning of the new colonial port city to Henri Prost. As he did in other Moroccan cities, Prost designed a European ville nouvelle outside the walls of the medina. In Casablanca, he also designed a new \"ville indig\u00e8ne\" to house Moroccans arriving from other cities.Europeans formed almost half the population of Casablanca.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAfter Philippe P\u00e9tain of France signed the armistice with the Nazis, he ordered French troops in France's colonial empire to defend French territory against any aggressors\u2014Allied or otherwise\u2014applying a policy of \"asymmetrical neutrality\" in favor of the Germans. French colonists in Morocco generally supported P\u00e9tain, while politically conscious Moroccans tended to favor de Gaulle and the Allies.Operation Torch, which started on 8 November 1942, was the British-American invasion of French North Africa during the North African campaign of World War II. The Western Task Force, composed of American units led by Major General George S. Patton and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, carried out the invasions of Mehdia, Fedhala, and Asfi. American forces captured Casablanca from Vichy control when France surrendered November 11, 1942, but the Naval Battle of Casablanca continued until American forces sank German submarine U-173 on November 16.Casablanca was the site of the Nouasseur Air Base, a large American air base used as the staging area for all American aircraft for the European Theater of Operations during World War II. The air field has since become Mohammed V International Airport.\n\n\n==== Anfa Conference ====\n\nCasablanca hosted the Anfa Conference (also called the Casablanca Conference) in January 1943. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed the progress of the war. Also in attendance were the Free France generals Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud, though they played minor roles and didn't participate in the military planning.\nIt was at this conference that the Allies adopted the doctrine of \"unconditional surrender,\" meaning that the Axis powers would be fought until their defeat. Roosevelt also met privately with Sultan Muhammad V and expressed his support for Moroccan independence after the war. This became a turning point, as Moroccan nationalists were emboldened to openly seek complete independence.\n\n\n=== Toward independence ===\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting.\nApril 7, 1947, a massacre of working class Moroccans, carried out by Senegalese Tirailleurs in the service of the French colonial army, was instigated just as Sultan Muhammed V was due to make a speech in Tangier appealing for independence.Riots in Casablanca took place from December 7\u20138, 1952, in response to the assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist Farhat Hached by La Main Rouge\u2014the clandestine militant wing of French intelligence. Then, on 25 December 1953 (Christmas Day), Muhammad Zarqtuni orchestrated a bombing of Casablanca's Central Market in response to the forced exile of Sultan Muhammad V and the royal family on August 20 (Eid al-Adha) of that year.\n\n\n=== Since independence ===\nMorocco gained independence from France in 1956.\n\n\n==== Casablanca Group ====\nJanuary 4\u20137, 1961, the city hosted an ensemble of progressive African leaders during the Casablanca Conference of 1961. Among those received by King Muhammad V were Gamal Abd An-Nasser, Kwame Nkrumah, Modibo Ke\u00efta, and Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, Ferhat Abbas.\n\n\n==== Jewish emigration ====\nCasablanca was a major departure point for Jews leaving Morocco through Operation Yachin, an operation conducted by Mossad to secretly migrate Moroccan Jews to Israel between November 1961 and spring 1964.\n\n\n==== 1965 riots ====\nThe 1965 student protests organized by the National Union of Popular Forces-affiliated National Union of Moroccan Students, which spread to cities around the country and devolved into riots, started on March 22, 1965 in front of Lyc\u00e9e Mohammed V in Casablanca. The protests started as a peaceful march to demand the right to public higher education for Morocco, but expanded to include concerns of laborers, the unemployed, and other marginalized segments of society, and devolved into vandalism and rioting. The riots were violently repressed by security forces with tanks and armored vehicles; Moroccan authorities reported a dozen deaths while the UNFP reported more than 1,000.King Hassan II blamed the events on teachers and parents, and declared in a speech to the nation on March 30, 1965: \"There is no greater danger to the State than a so-called intellectual. It would have been better if you were all illiterate.\u201d\n\n\n==== 1981 riots ====\nOn June 6, 1981, the Casablanca Bread Riots took place. Hassan II appointed the French-trained lawyer Driss Basri, who would later become a symbol of the Years of Lead, with quelling the protests. The government stated that 66 people were killed and 100 were injured, while opposition leaders put the number of dead at 637, saying that many of these were killed by police and army gunfire.\n\n\n==== Mudawana ====\nIn March 2000, more than 60 women's groups organized demonstrations in Casablanca proposing reforms to the legal status of women in the country. About 40,000 women attended, calling for a ban on polygamy and the introduction of divorce law (divorce being a purely religious procedure at that time). Although the counter-demonstration attracted half a million participants, the movement for change started in 2000 was influential on King Mohammed VI, and he enacted a new mudawana, or family law, in early 2004, meeting some of the demands of women's rights activists.On 16 May 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a multiple suicide bomb attack carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to al-Qaeda. Twelve suicide bombers struck five locations in the city.Another series of suicide bombings struck the city in early 2007. These events illustrated some of the persistent challenges the city faces in addressing poverty and integrating disadvantaged neighborhoods and populations. One initiative to improve conditions in the city's disadvantaged neighborhoods was the creation of the Sidi Moumen Cultural Center.As calls for reform spread through the Arab world in 2011, Moroccans joined in, but concessions by the ruler led to acceptance. However, in December, thousands of people demonstrated in several parts of the city, especially the city center near la Fontaine, desiring more significant political reforms.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCasablanca is located on the Atlantic coast of the Chaouia Plains which have historically been the breadbasket of Morocco. Apart from the Atlantic coast, the Bouskoura forest is the only natural attraction in the city. The forest was planted in the 20th century and consists mostly of eucalyptus, palm, and pine trees. It is located halfway to the city's international airport. \nThe only watercourse in Casablanca is oued Bouskoura, a small seasonal creek that until 1912 reached the Atlantic Ocean near the actual port. Most of oued Bouskoura's bed has been covered due to urbanization and only the part south of El Jadida road can now be seen. The closest permanent river to Casablanca is Oum Rabia, 70 km (43.50 mi) to the south-east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCasablanca has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). The cool Canary Current off the Atlantic coast moderates temperature variation, which results in a climate remarkably similar to that of coastal Los Angeles, with similar temperature ranges. The city has an annual average of 72 days with significant precipitation, which amounts to 412 mm (16.2 in) per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) and \u22122.7 \u00b0C (27.1 \u00b0F), respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is 178 mm (7.0 in) on 30 November 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Grand Casablanca region is considered the locomotive of the development of the Moroccan economy. It attracts 32% of the country's production units and 56% of industrial labor. The region uses 30% of the national electricity production. With MAD 93 billion, the region contributes to 44% of the industrial production of the kingdom. About 33% of national industrial exports, MAD 27 billion, comes from the Grand Casablanca; 30% of the Moroccan banking network is concentrated in Casablanca.One of the most important Casablancan exports is phosphate. Other industries include fishing, fish canning, sawmills, furniture production, building materials, glass, textiles, electronics, leather work, processed food, spirits, soft drinks, and cigarettes.The Casablanca and Mohammedia seaports activity represent 50% of the international commercial flows of Morocco. Almost the entire Casablanca waterfront is under development, mainly the construction of huge entertainment centres between the port and Hassan II Mosque, the Anfa Resort project near the business, entertainment and living centre of Megarama, the shopping and entertainment complex of Morocco Mall, as well as a complete renovation of the coastal walkway. The Sindbad park is planned to be totally renewed with rides, games and entertainment services.Royal Air Maroc has its head office at the Casablanca-Anfa Airport. In 2004, it announced that it was moving its head office from Casablanca to a location in Province of Nouaceur, close to Mohammed V International Airport. The agreement to build the head office in Nouaceur was signed in 2009.The biggest CBD of Casablanca and Maghreb is in the North of the town in Sidi Maarouf near the mosque of Hassan II and the biggest project of skycrapers of Maghreb and Africa Casablanca Marina.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nCasablanca is a commune, part of the region of Casablanca-Settat. The commune is divided into eight districts or prefectures, which are themselves divided into 16 subdivisions or arrondissements and one municipality. The districts and their subdivisions are:\nA\u00efn Chock (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642) \u2013 A\u00efn Chock (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642)\nA\u00efn Seba\u00e2 - Hay Mohammadi (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a) \u2013 A\u00efn Seba\u00e2 (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639), Hay Mohammadi (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a), Roches Noires (\u0631\u0648\u0634 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631).\nAnfa (\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627) \u2013 Anfa (\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627), Ma\u00e2rif (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0641), Sidi Belyout (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0637).\nBen M'Sick (\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643) \u2013 Ben M'Sick (\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643), Sbata (\u0633\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647).\nSidi Bernoussi (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0635\u064a) \u2013 Sidi Bernoussi (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0635\u064a), Sidi Moumen (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0645\u0646).\nAl Fida - Mers Sultan (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u2013 \u0645\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646) \u2013 Al Fida (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621); Mechouar (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0648\u0631) (municipality), Mers Sultan (\u0645\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646).\nHay Hassani (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a) \u2013 Hay Hassani (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a).\nMoulay Rachid (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f) \u2013 Moulay Rachid (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f), Sidi Othmane (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646).\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nThe list of neighborhoods is indicative and not complete:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe commune of Casablanca recorded a population of 3,359,818 in the 2014 Moroccan census. About 98% live in urban areas. Around 25% of them are under 15 and 9% are over 60 years old. The population of the city is about 11% of the total population of Morocco. Grand Casablanca is also the largest urban area in the Maghreb. 99.9% of the population of Morocco are Arab and Berber Muslims.\nDuring the French protectorate in Morocco, European Christians formed almost half the population of Casablanca. Since independence in 1956, the European population has decreased substantially.The city also is still home for a small community of Moroccan Christians, as well as a small group of foreign resident Roman Catholics.\n\n\n=== Judaism in Casablanca ===\nJews have a long history in Casablanca. A Sephardic Jewish community was in Anfa up to the destruction of the city by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750, the Rabbi Elijah Synagogue was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.Approximately 28,000 Moroccan Jews immigrated to the State of Israel between 1948 and 1951, many through Casablanca. Casablanca then became a departure point in Operation Yachin, the covert Mossad-organized migration operation from 1961\u20131964. In 2018 only 2,500 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca, while according to the World Jewish Congress only 1,000 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca.Today, the Jewish cemetery of Casablanca is one of the major cemeteries of the city, and many synagogues remain in service, but the city's Jewish community has dwindled. The Moroccan Jewish Museum is a museum established in the city in 1997.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nPublic: University of Hassan II Casablanca\nPrivate:\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Mundiapolis\nUniversit\u00e9 Internationale de Casablanca\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nInternational schools:\n\nBelgium: \u00c9cole Belge de Casablanca\nFrench:\nColl\u00e8ge Anatole France\nLyc\u00e9e Lyautey\nGroupe Scolaire Louis Massignon\nLyc\u00e9e La R\u00e9sidence\nLyc\u00e9e Ma\u00efmonide (FR)\nLyc\u00e9e L\u00e9on l'Africain\n\u00c9cole Normale H\u00e9bra\u00efque\n\u00c9cole Al Jabr\nItalian: Scuola \"Enrico Mattei\"\nSpanish: Instituto Espa\u00f1ol Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez\nAmerican:\nCasablanca American School\nAmerican Academy Casablanca\nGeorge Washington Academy\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nMost of the city's places of worship are Muslim mosques. Some of the city's synagogues, such as Ettedgui Synagogue, also remain. There are also Christian churches; some remain in use \u2014 particularly by the West African migrant community \u2014 while many of the churches built during the colonial period have been repurposed, such as Church of the Sacred Heart.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Association football ===\n\nCasablanca is home to two popular football clubs: Wydad Casablanca and Raja Casablanca\u2014which are rivals. Raja's symbol is an eagle and Wydad's symbol is a star and crescent which means a symbol of Islam. These two popular clubs have produced some of Morocco's best players, such as: Salaheddine Bassir, Abdelmajid Dolmy, Baddou Zaki, Aziz Bouderbala, and Noureddine Naybet. Other football teams on top of these two major teams based in the city of Casablanca include Rachad Bernoussi, TAS de Casablanca, Majd Al Madina, and Racing Casablanca.\n\n\n=== Tennis ===\nCasablanca hosts The Grand Prix Hassan II, a professional men's tennis tournament of the ATP tour. It first began in 1986, and is played on clay courts type at Complexe Al Amal.\nNotable winners of the Hassan II Grand-Prix are Thomas Muster in 1990, Hicham Arazi in 1997, Younes El Aynaoui in 2002, and Stanislas Wawrinka in 2010.\n\n\n=== Hosting ===\nCasablanca staged the 1961 Pan Arab Games, the 1983 Mediterranean Games, and games during the 1988 Africa Cup of Nations. Morocco was scheduled to host the 2015 African Nations Cup, but decided to decline due to Ebola fears. Morocco was expelled and the tournament was held in Equatorial Guinea.\n\n\n==== Venues ====\nStade Larbi Zaouli\nStade Mohamed V\nStade Sidi Bernoussi\nComplexe Al Amal de CasablancaThe Grand Stade de Casablanca is the proposed title of the planned football stadium to be built in the city. Once completed in 2014, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of Raja Casablanca, Wydad Casablanca, and the Morocco national football team. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 93,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the Stade Mohamed V. The initial idea of the stadium was for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to South Africa. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2025. The idea of the stadium was also for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to Canada, Mexico and United States. It is now hoping for the 2030 FIFA World Cup which Morocco is co-bidding with either African neighbors Tunisia and Algeria or two European nations Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nal-Haja al-Hamdawiya, one of the most iconic figures in aita music, was born in Casablanca. Nass El Ghiwane, led by Laarbi Batma, came out of Hay Mohammadi in Casablanca. Abdelhadi Belkhayat and Abdelwahab Doukkali are musicians specializing in traditional Moroccan Arabic popular music. Zina Daoudia, Abdelaziz Stati, Abdellah Daoudi, and Said Senhaji are notable Moroccan chaabi musicians.\nAbdelakabir Faradjallah founded Attarazat Addahabia, a Moroccan funk band, in 1968.

Hanane el-Fadili and Hassan El Fad are popular comedians from Casablanca. Gad Elmaleh is another comedian from Casablanca, though he has made his career abroad.\n\n\n=== Art ===\nThe \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts of Casablanca was founded in 1919 by a French Orientalist painter named \u00c9douard Brindeau de Jarny, who started his career teaching drawing at Lyc\u00e9e Lyautey. The Casablanca School\u2014a Modernist art movement and collective including artists such as Farid Belkahia, Mohamed Melihi, and Mohammed Chab\u00e2a\u2014developed out of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts of Casablanca in the late 1960s.The Academy of Traditional Arts, part of the Hassan II Mosque complex, was founded October 31, 2012.L'Uzine is a community-based art and culture space in Casablanca.Rebel Spirit published The Casablanca Guide (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0648\u064a, Le Guide Casablancais) a comic book about life in Casablanca.Sbagha Bagha is a street art festival during which murals are created on the sides of apartment buildings.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\nPostcard companies such as L\u00e9on & L\u00e9vy were active in Casablanca. Gabriel Veyre also worked and eventually died in Casablanca. \nMarcelin Flandrin (1889-1957), a French military photographer, settled in Casablanca and recorded much of the early colonial period in Morocco with his photography. With his staged nude postcard photos taken in Casablanca's colonial brothel quarter, Flandrin was also responsible for disseminating the orientalist image of Moroccan women as sexual objects.Casablanca has a thriving street photography scene. Yoriyas is prominent among photographers capturing the economic capital's street scenes, and has attracted international attention.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Casablanca had many movie theaters, such as Cinema Rialto, Cinema Lynx and Cinema Vox\u2014the largest in Africa at the time it was built.The 1942 American film Casablanca is supposedly set in Casablanca and has had a lasting impact on the city's image, though it was filmed entirely in California and doesn't feature a single Moroccan character with a speaking role. Salut Casa! was a propaganda film brandishing France's purported colonial triumph in its mission civilizatrice in the city.Love in Casablanca (1991), starring Abdelkarim Derqaoui and Muna Fettou, is one of the first Moroccan films to deal with Morocco's complex realities and depict life in Casablanca with verisimilitude. Nour-Eddine Lakhmari's Casanegra (2008) depicts the harsh realities of Casablanca's working classes. The films Ali Zaoua (2000), Horses of God (2012), and Ghazzia (2017) of Nabil Ayouch\u2014a French director of Moroccan heritage\u2014deal with street crime, terrorism, and social issues in Casablanca, respectively. The events in Meryem Benm'Barek-Alo\u00efsi's 2018 film Sofia revolve around an illegitimate pregnancy in Casablanca. Hicham Lasri and Said Naciri also from Casablanca.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nCasablanca's architecture and urban development are historically significant. The city is home to many notable buildings in a variety of styles, including traditional Moroccan architecture, various colonial architectural styles, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Neo-Mauresque, Streamline Moderne, Modernism, Brutalism, and more. During the French Protectorate, the French government described Casablanca as a \"laboratory of urbanism.\"The work of the Groupe des Architectes Modernes Marocains (GAMMA) on public housing projects\u2014such as Carri\u00e8res Centrales in Hay Mohammadi\u2014in a style described as vernacular modernism influenced modernist architecture around the world.Casam\u00e9moire and MAMMA. are two organizations dedicated to the preservation and appreciation of the city's architectural heritage.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rapid Transit ===\n\nThe Casablanca Tramway is the rapid transit tram system in Casablanca. As of 2019, the network consists of two lines covering 47.5 km (30 mi), with 71 stops; further lines (\u06373 and \u06374) are under construction.Since the 1970s, Casablanca had planned to build a metro system to offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality. However, the city council voted to abandon the metro project in 2014 due to high costs, and decided to continue expanding the already operating tram system instead.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nCasablanca's main airport is Mohammed V International Airport, Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve Marrakech, Rabat, Agadir, Oujda, Tangier, Al Hoceima, and Laayoune, as well as other cities.\nCasablanca is well-served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. New York City, Montreal, Paris, Washington D.C., London and Dubai are important primary destinations.\nThe older, smaller Casablanca-Anfa Airport to the west of the city, served certain destinations including Damascus, and Tunis, and was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It has been closed and destroyed to build the \"Casablanca Finance City\", the new heart of the city of Casablanca. Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport is located in the nearby community of Tit Mellil.\n\n\n=== Coach buses ===\nCompagnie de Transports au Maroc (CTM) offers private intercity coach buses on various lines run servicing most notable Moroccan towns, as well as a number of European cities. These run from the CTM Bus Station on Leo Africanus Street near the Central Market in downtown Casablanca. Supratours, an affiliate of ONCF, also offers coach bus service at a slightly lower cost, departing from a station on Wilad Zian Street. There is another bus station farther down on the same street called the Wilad Zian Bus Station; this station is the country's largest bus station, serving over 800 buses daily, catering more to Morocco's lower income population.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nRegistered taxis in Casablanca are coloured red and known as petit taxis (small taxis), or coloured white and known as grands taxis (big taxis). As is standard Moroccan practice, petits taxis, typically small-four door Dacia Logan, Peugeot 207, or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. Grands taxis, generally older Mercedes-Benz sedans, provide shared mini-bus like service within the city on predefined routes, or shared intercity service. Grands taxis may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.\n\n\n=== Trains ===\nCasablanca is served by three main railway stations run by the national rail service, the ONCF.\n\nCasa-Voyageurs is the main intercity station, from which trains run south to Marrakech or El Jadida and north to Mohammedia and Rabat, and then on either to Tangier or Meknes, Fes, Taza and Oujda/Nador. It also serves as the southern terminus of the Al-Boraq high speed line from Tangier. A dedicated airport shuttle service to Mohammed V International Airport also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.\n\nCasa-Port serves primarily commuter trains such as the Train Navette Rapide (TNR or Aouita) operating on the Casablanca \u2013 Kenitra rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark Casablanca Twin Center. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction, the station is still operational. From 2013, it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the city's new tram network.\nCasa-Oasis was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early 21st century, and officially reopened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern intercity train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to intercity standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nAlthough Mohammed V International Airport receives most international flights into Morocco, international tourism in Casablanca is not as developed as it is in cities like Marrakesh. Casablanca, however, attracts fewer tourists than those of cities such as Fes and Marrakech. \nThe Hassan II Mosque, which is the second largest mosque in Africa and the seventh largest in the world, is the city's main tourist attraction. Visitors also come to see the city's rich architectural heritage.Popular sites for national tourism include shopping centers such as Morocco Mall, Anfa Place, the Marina Shopping Center, and the Tachfine Center. Additional sites include the Corniche and the beach of Ain Diab, and parks such as the Arab League Park or the Sindibad theme park.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAmal Ayouch (born 1966) \u2013 stage and film actress\nSalaheddine Bassir \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nLaarbi Batma \u2013 Moroccan musician and artist, founding member of Nas El Ghiwan\nLarbi Benbarek \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMiriem Bensalah-Chaqroun \u2013 Moroccan businesswoman\nJean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes \u2013 French footballer\nFrida Boccara \u2013 French singer, Winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 1969\nMerieme Chadid \u2013 Moroccan astronomer\nSoufiane Choubani \u2013 Founder of the Moroccan National Debate Team\nJean-Charles de Castelbajac \u2013 French fashion designer\nDizzy DROS \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nGad Elmaleh \u2013 French/Canadian comedian\nLa Fouine \u2013 Moroccan-French rapper\nEl Haqed \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nSerge Haroche \u2013 French physicist who was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physics\nShatha Hassoun \u2013 Moroccan/Iraqi singer\nLydia Hatuel-Czuckermann \u2013 Israeli Olympic fencer\nHicham Mesbahi \u2013 Moroccan boxer\nFrench Montana \u2013 American rapper\nNawal El Moutawakel \u2013 Olympic champion\nNoureddine Naybet \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMostafa Nissaboury \u2013 Moroccan poet\nHakim Noury \u2013 Moroccan film director\nMaurice Ohana \u2013 French composer\nJean Reno \u2013 French Hollywood actor\nDaniel Sivan \u2013 professor\nAlain Souchon \u2013 French songwriter\nFrank Stephenson \u2013 award-winning automobile designer\nHassan Saada \u2013 Moroccan boxer arrested for alleged rape before Olympic match\nSidney Taurel \u2013 naturalized American CEO of Eli Lilly and Company from 1998 to 2008\nRichard Virenque \u2013 French cyclist\nMuhammad Zarqtuni \u2013 Moroccan nationalist and resistance leader\nAbdallah Zrika \u2013 Moroccan poet\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe 1942 film Casablanca (starring Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart) is supposed to have been set in Casablanca, although it was filmed entirely in Los Angeles and doesn't feature a single Arab or North African character with a speaking role. The film depicts Casablanca as the scene of power struggle between various foreign powers, which had much more to do with the Tangier of the time. The film has achieved worldwide popularity since its release. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, it won three, including Best Picture.\nA Night in Casablanca (1946) was the 12th Marx Brothers' movie. The film stars Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, and Harpo Marx. It was directed by Archie Mayo and written by Joseph Fields and Roland Kibbee. The film contains the song \"Who's Sorry Now?\", with music by Ted Snyder and lyrics by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. It is sung in French by Lisette Verea playing the part of Beatrice Rheiner, and then later sung in English. Liszt's \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\" is played twice, once by Chico on piano as an introduction to the \"Beer Barrel Polka\", and again by Harpo on the harp.\nThe city is featured in The Mysterious Caravan (1975), volume 54 in the original Hardy Boys series.\nCasablanca is the setting for several chapters in Doubleshot, a 2000 James Bond novel by Raymond Benson. In the novel, one of the characters mentions that the 1942 film was shot in Hollywood and not on location.\nCasablanca is one of the key locations in the 2006 video game Dreamfall, as it is where the primary protagonist of the game, Zo\u00eb Castillo, lives. Although the city is imagined in the year 2219, much of the present-day architecture is used for inspiration.\nCasablanca is the setting for the first act of the 2016 World War II romantic thriller film Allied starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nCasablanca is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nRabat Zoo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site of Casablanca\nOfficial Casablanca Tourism Website (in French)\nCasablanca photo gallery (buildings and other landmarks with a history dating back to the French Protectorate)\nOpen Air Museum of 20th century architecture\n Geographic data related to Casablanca at OpenStreetMap",

The complex serves or has served as a courthouse, residence of the pasha (governor), parliamentary reception hall, and jail. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn January 1930, the pasha of Casablanca at the time At-Tayyib Al-Moqri, the second son of the Moroccan grand vizier Muhammad al-Muqri, decided to build a civil courthouse in the Habous. It was designed by the French architect Auguste Cadet (fr), who was heavily involved in the planning of Casablanca and particularly of its Habous neighborhood.\nThe construction of the courthouse was carried out during World War II, when French authorities usurped most modern building materials in their colonies, such as steel and cement, for the war effort. As a result, even though the courthouse was built in the mid-twentieth century, it was built with traditional methods, brick by brick. The complex is characterized by traditional Mauro-Andalusi architectural features: zeleej, stucco work, carved cedar wood, and green-tiled roofs.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Casablanca is a restaurant, bar and caf\u00e9 located in the city of Casablanca, Morocco.\nOpened March 1, 2004, the place was designed to recreate the bar made famous by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the movie classic Casablanca.\nSet in an old courtyard-style mansion built against the walls of the Old Medina of Casablanca, the restaurant \u2013 piano bar is filled with architectural and decorative details reminiscent of the film:  curved arches, a sculpted bar, balconies, balustrades as well as beaded and stencilled brass lighting and plants that cast luminous shadows on white walls. There is an authentic 1930s Pleyel piano and As Time Goes By is a common request to the in-house pianist.\nOwned by The Usual Suspects company, this Casablanca landmark is usually described as the real Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9, finally bringing the legendary \u201cGin Joint\u201d of cinema fame to life in today's Casablanca.\n\n\n== Architecture and d\u00e9cor ==\nRick\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Casablanca was developed by Kathy Kriger (1946\u20132018), a former American diplomat in Morocco.  The restaurant is housed in a traditional Moroccan grand mansion with a central courtyard or a Riad, built in 1930.  The land placement allows for three facades: a distinctive streetfront entrance with heavy wooden doors that depict that of the film; a port-oriented fa\u00e7ade that looks to the Atlantic; and a narrow dead-end access which was the former main entrance but is now the service entrance.\nBecause of the age of the structure and proximity to the sea, the mansion was totally restored and renovated.  American architect/designer Bill Willis conceived the decorative and architectural details which enhanced the existing arches and balustrades to evoke the film \u201cCasablanca.\u201d   Intricate antique brass floor and table lamps with metal shades strung with beads give off dramatic lighting effects, and on each table rests a specially designed brass lamp with beaded shade designed by Bill Willis.  Carved and inlaid wooden screens, tables and chairs from Syria add decorative touches reminiscent of the furniture in the film.  In addition to the faithful rendering of the decoration in Casablanca, Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9 today is full of tile and wood work representing Morocco\u2019s craft industry.  Fireplaces are of carved marble or painted tadelakt with intricate zellige tile patterns accenting the fireplaces and the risers of the central stairway.  Tadelakt in muted colors cover walls throughout the restaurant, and the floors are set in hand made terra cotta tile.\n\n\n== Food ==\nFood selections at Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9 takes advantage of Morocco\u2019s abundance in seafood. The menu offers a wide selection of fish from the traditional Sole Meuniere to John Dory crusted with black pepper, white wine and thyme.  Steaks, foie gras, goat cheese salad with fresh figs and an American Crab Louis are among the dinner selections. Rick\u2019s Cheesecake and brownies figure on the dessert menu, along with more exotic presentations highlighting local fresh fruit.  At lunch popular favorites  such as Chili Con Carne and American Hamburgers are available along with \u201cthe catch of the day\u201d and a Moroccan tagine.  The rooftop terrace barbecue, \u201cThe Pergola\u201d offers a range of items from mixed grill to roasted game hen and swordfish steak.\n\n\n== Music ==\nIssam Chabaa plays piano nightly Tuesday through Sunday, a repertoire of standards reminiscent of the 1940s and 1950s, including classic French, Spanish and Brazilian songs along with American favorites such as Summertime, The Lady is a Tramp, Blue Moon and the inevitable As Time Goes By (several times a night).  Sunday night is programmed for a Jam session where musicians passing through town, and local amateurs join Issam for jazz improvisation.  Between sets and at lunch a soundtrack of compiled standards and big band sounds provides background music.\n\n\n== Reservations ==\nReservations are recommended for dinner.  The restaurant is open for lunch from 12:00 noon until 3 pm; for dinner from 6:30 pm until 1 am.  Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9 is open 7 days a week including the month of Ramadan and holidays.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe New York Times.

          "So as I walked down the Corniche towards this infamous light house. Made my way along the dusty track I managed to gain entry the light keeper charged approx 100MAD for the privilege. To be honest hats off to the guy that probably goes up and down that light house for every",

Located in the central-western part of Morocco bordering the Atlantic Ocean, it is the largest city in the Maghreb region and the eighth-largest in the Arab world. Casablanca is Morocco's chief port and one of the largest financial centers in Africa. According to the 2019 population estimate, the city has a population of about 3.71 million in the urban area and over 4.27 million in the Greater Casablanca. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center of Morocco, although the national political capital is Rabat.\nThe leading Moroccan companies and many international corporations doing business in the country have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca holds its recorded position as the primary industrial zone of the nation. The Port of Casablanca is one of the largest artificial ports in the world, and the second largest port of North Africa, after Tanger-Med 40 km (25 mi) east of Tangier. Casablanca also hosts the primary naval base for the Royal Moroccan Navy.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe original name of Casablanca was Anfa (Neo-Tifinagh: \u2d30\u2d4f\u2d3c\u2d30), in Berber language, by at least the seventh century BC. After the Portuguese took control of the city in the 15th century AD, they rebuilt it, changing the name to Casa Branca ([kaz\u0250'b\u027e\u0250\u0303k\u0250]), meaning 'white house' in Portuguese. The present name, which is the Spanish version (pronounced [ka\u0320sa\u0320\u02c8\u03b2\u031ela\u0320\u014bka\u0320]), came when the Kingdom of Portugal came under Spanish control through the Iberian Union. During the French protectorate in Morocco, the name remained Casablanca (pronounced [kazabl\u0251\u0303ka]). In 1755 an earthquake destroyed most of the town. It was rebuilt by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah who changed the name into the local Arabic Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101' (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), although occasionally \"Casablanca\" is written in Arabic (\u0643\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0627, K\u0101z\u0101bl\u0101nk\u0101). The city is still nicknamed Casa by many locals and outsiders to the city. In many other cities with a different dialect, it is called Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101, instead.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by Berbers by at least the seventh century BC. It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans. In his book Description of Africa, Leo Africanus refers to ancient Casablanca as \"Anfa\", a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of Barghawata in 744 AD. He believed Anfa was the most \"prosperous city on the Atlantic Coast because of its fertile land.\" Barghawata rose as an independent state around this time, and continued until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1068. Following the defeat of the Barghawata in the 12th century, Arab tribes of Hilal and Sulaym descent settled in the region, mixing with the local Berbers, which led to widespread Arabization. During the 14th century, under the Merinids, Anfa rose in importance as a port. The last of the Merinids were ousted by a popular revolt in 1465.\n\n\n=== Portuguese conquest and Spanish influence ===\n\nIn the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers, leading to it being targeted by the Portuguese, who bombarded the town which led to its destruction in 1468. The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a military fortress in 1515. The town that grew up around it was called Casa Branca, meaning \"white house\" in Portuguese.\nBetween 1580 and 1640, the Crown of Portugal was integrated to the Crown of Spain, so Casablanca and all other areas occupied by the Portuguese were under Spanish control, though maintaining an autonomous Portuguese administration. As Portugal broke ties with Spain in 1640, Casablanca came under fully Portuguese control once again. The Europeans eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 following an earthquake which destroyed most of the town.The town was finally reconstructed by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah (1756\u20131790), the grandson of Moulay Ismail and an ally of George Washington, with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called ad-D\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02bc (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), the Arabic translation of the Portuguese Casa Branca.\n\n\n=== Colonial struggle ===\nIn the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in Britain and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing gunpowder tea, used in Morocco's national drink, mint tea). By the 1860s, around 5,000 residents were there, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s. Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of French colonialists in 1906. By 1921, this rose to 110,000, largely through the development of shanty towns.\n\n\n=== French rule and influence ===\n\nThe Treaty of Algeciras of 1906 formalized French preeminence in Morocco and included three measures that directly impacted Casablanca: that French officers would control operations at the customs office and seize revenue as collateral for loans given by France, that the French holding company La Compagnie Marocaine would develop the port of Casablanca, and that a French-and-Spanish-trained police force would be assembled to patrol the port.To build the port's breakwater, narrow-gauge track was laid in June 1907 for a small Decauville locomotive to connect the port to a quarry in Roches Noires, passing through the sacred Sidi Belyout graveyard. In resistance to this and the measures of the 1906 Treaty of Algeciras, tribesmen of the Chaouia attacked the locomotive, killing 9 Compagnie Marocaine laborers\u20143 French, 3 Italians, and 3 Spanish.In response, the French bombarded the city with multiple gunboats and landed troops inside the town, causing severe damage and 15,000 dead and wounded. In the immediate aftermath of the bombardment and the deployment of French troops, the European homes and the Mellah, or Jewish quarter, were sacked, and the latter was also set ablaze.The bombardment and military invasion of the city effectively began the French military conquest of Morocco, although French control of Casablanca was not formalized until the French Protectorat was established by the Treaty of Fes March 1912.\nGeneral Hubert Lyautey assigned the planning of the new colonial port city to Henri Prost. As he did in other Moroccan cities, Prost designed a European ville nouvelle outside the walls of the medina. In Casablanca, he also designed a new \"ville indig\u00e8ne\" to house Moroccans arriving from other cities.Europeans formed almost half the population of Casablanca.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAfter Philippe P\u00e9tain of France signed the armistice with the Nazis, he ordered French troops in France's colonial empire to defend French territory against any aggressors\u2014Allied or otherwise\u2014applying a policy of \"asymmetrical neutrality\" in favor of the Germans. French colonists in Morocco generally supported P\u00e9tain, while politically conscious Moroccans tended to favor de Gaulle and the Allies.Operation Torch, which started on 8 November 1942, was the British-American invasion of French North Africa during the North African campaign of World War II. The Western Task Force, composed of American units led by Major General George S. Patton and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, carried out the invasions of Mehdia, Fedhala, and Asfi. American forces captured Casablanca from Vichy control when France surrendered November 11, 1942, but the Naval Battle of Casablanca continued until American forces sank German submarine U-173 on November 16.Casablanca was the site of the Nouasseur Air Base, a large American air base used as the staging area for all American aircraft for the European Theater of Operations during World War II. The air field has since become Mohammed V International Airport.\n\n\n==== Anfa Conference ====\n\nCasablanca hosted the Anfa Conference (also called the Casablanca Conference) in January 1943. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed the progress of the war. Also in attendance were the Free France generals Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud, though they played minor roles and didn't participate in the military planning.\nIt was at this conference that the Allies adopted the doctrine of \"unconditional surrender,\" meaning that the Axis powers would be fought until their defeat. Roosevelt also met privately with Sultan Muhammad V and expressed his support for Moroccan independence after the war. This became a turning point, as Moroccan nationalists were emboldened to openly seek complete independence.\n\n\n=== Toward independence ===\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting.\nApril 7, 1947, a massacre of working class Moroccans, carried out by Senegalese Tirailleurs in the service of the French colonial army, was instigated just as Sultan Muhammed V was due to make a speech in Tangier appealing for independence.Riots in Casablanca took place from December 7\u20138, 1952, in response to the assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist Farhat Hached by La Main Rouge\u2014the clandestine militant wing of French intelligence. Then, on 25 December 1953 (Christmas Day), Muhammad Zarqtuni orchestrated a bombing of Casablanca's Central Market in response to the forced exile of Sultan Muhammad V and the royal family on August 20 (Eid al-Adha) of that year.\n\n\n=== Since independence ===\nMorocco gained independence from France in 1956.\n\n\n==== Casablanca Group ====\nJanuary 4\u20137, 1961, the city hosted an ensemble of progressive African leaders during the Casablanca Conference of 1961. Among those received by King Muhammad V were Gamal Abd An-Nasser, Kwame Nkrumah, Modibo Ke\u00efta, and Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, Ferhat Abbas.\n\n\n==== Jewish emigration ====\nCasablanca was a major departure point for Jews leaving Morocco through Operation Yachin, an operation conducted by Mossad to secretly migrate Moroccan Jews to Israel between November 1961 and spring 1964.\n\n\n==== 1965 riots ====\nThe 1965 student protests organized by the National Union of Popular Forces-affiliated National Union of Moroccan Students, which spread to cities around the country and devolved into riots, started on March 22, 1965 in front of Lyc\u00e9e Mohammed V in Casablanca. The protests started as a peaceful march to demand the right to public higher education for Morocco, but expanded to include concerns of laborers, the unemployed, and other marginalized segments of society, and devolved into vandalism and rioting. The riots were violently repressed by security forces with tanks and armored vehicles; Moroccan authorities reported a dozen deaths while the UNFP reported more than 1,000.King Hassan II blamed the events on teachers and parents, and declared in a speech to the nation on March 30, 1965: \"There is no greater danger to the State than a so-called intellectual. It would have been better if you were all illiterate.\u201d\n\n\n==== 1981 riots ====\nOn June 6, 1981, the Casablanca Bread Riots took place. Hassan II appointed the French-trained lawyer Driss Basri, who would later become a symbol of the Years of Lead, with quelling the protests. The government stated that 66 people were killed and 100 were injured, while opposition leaders put the number of dead at 637, saying that many of these were killed by police and army gunfire.\n\n\n==== Mudawana ====\nIn March 2000, more than 60 women's groups organized demonstrations in Casablanca proposing reforms to the legal status of women in the country. About 40,000 women attended, calling for a ban on polygamy and the introduction of divorce law (divorce being a purely religious procedure at that time). Although the counter-demonstration attracted half a million participants, the movement for change started in 2000 was influential on King Mohammed VI, and he enacted a new mudawana, or family law, in early 2004, meeting some of the demands of women's rights activists.On 16 May 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a multiple suicide bomb attack carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to al-Qaeda. Twelve suicide bombers struck five locations in the city.Another series of suicide bombings struck the city in early 2007. These events illustrated some of the persistent challenges the city faces in addressing poverty and integrating disadvantaged neighborhoods and populations. One initiative to improve conditions in the city's disadvantaged neighborhoods was the creation of the Sidi Moumen Cultural Center.As calls for reform spread through the Arab world in 2011, Moroccans joined in, but concessions by the ruler led to acceptance. However, in December, thousands of people demonstrated in several parts of the city, especially the city center near la Fontaine, desiring more significant political reforms.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCasablanca is located on the Atlantic coast of the Chaouia Plains which have historically been the breadbasket of Morocco. Apart from the Atlantic coast, the Bouskoura forest is the only natural attraction in the city. The forest was planted in the 20th century and consists mostly of eucalyptus, palm, and pine trees. It is located halfway to the city's international airport. \nThe only watercourse in Casablanca is oued Bouskoura, a small seasonal creek that until 1912 reached the Atlantic Ocean near the actual port. Most of oued Bouskoura's bed has been covered due to urbanization and only the part south of El Jadida road can now be seen. The closest permanent river to Casablanca is Oum Rabia, 70 km (43.50 mi) to the south-east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCasablanca has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). The cool Canary Current off the Atlantic coast moderates temperature variation, which results in a climate remarkably similar to that of coastal Los Angeles, with similar temperature ranges. The city has an annual average of 72 days with significant precipitation, which amounts to 412 mm (16.2 in) per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) and \u22122.7 \u00b0C (27.1 \u00b0F), respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is 178 mm (7.0 in) on 30 November 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Grand Casablanca region is considered the locomotive of the development of the Moroccan economy. It attracts 32% of the country's production units and 56% of industrial labor. The region uses 30% of the national electricity production. With MAD 93 billion, the region contributes to 44% of the industrial production of the kingdom. About 33% of national industrial exports, MAD 27 billion, comes from the Grand Casablanca; 30% of the Moroccan banking network is concentrated in Casablanca.One of the most important Casablancan exports is phosphate. Other industries include fishing, fish canning, sawmills, furniture production, building materials, glass, textiles, electronics, leather work, processed food, spirits, soft drinks, and cigarettes.The Casablanca and Mohammedia seaports activity represent 50% of the international commercial flows of Morocco. Almost the entire Casablanca waterfront is under development, mainly the construction of huge entertainment centres between the port and Hassan II Mosque, the Anfa Resort project near the business, entertainment and living centre of Megarama, the shopping and entertainment complex of Morocco Mall, as well as a complete renovation of the coastal walkway. The Sindbad park is planned to be totally renewed with rides, games and entertainment services.Royal Air Maroc has its head office at the Casablanca-Anfa Airport. In 2004, it announced that it was moving its head office from Casablanca to a location in Province of Nouaceur, close to Mohammed V International Airport.

About 98% live in urban areas. Around 25% of them are under 15 and 9% are over 60 years old. The population of the city is about 11% of the total population of Morocco. Grand Casablanca is also the largest urban area in the Maghreb. 99.9% of the population of Morocco are Arab and Berber Muslims.\nDuring the French protectorate in Morocco, European Christians formed almost half the population of Casablanca. Since independence in 1956, the European population has decreased substantially.The city also is still home for a small community of Moroccan Christians, as well as a small group of foreign resident Roman Catholics.\n\n\n=== Judaism in Casablanca ===\nJews have a long history in Casablanca. A Sephardic Jewish community was in Anfa up to the destruction of the city by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750, the Rabbi Elijah Synagogue was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.Approximately 28,000 Moroccan Jews immigrated to the State of Israel between 1948 and 1951, many through Casablanca. Casablanca then became a departure point in Operation Yachin, the covert Mossad-organized migration operation from 1961\u20131964. In 2018 only 2,500 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca, while according to the World Jewish Congress only 1,000 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca.Today, the Jewish cemetery of Casablanca is one of the major cemeteries of the city, and many synagogues remain in service, but the city's Jewish community has dwindled. The Moroccan Jewish Museum is a museum established in the city in 1997.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nPublic: University of Hassan II Casablanca\nPrivate:\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Mundiapolis\nUniversit\u00e9 Internationale de Casablanca\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nInternational schools:\n\nBelgium: \u00c9cole Belge de Casablanca\nFrench:\nColl\u00e8ge Anatole France\nLyc\u00e9e Lyautey\nGroupe Scolaire Louis Massignon\nLyc\u00e9e La R\u00e9sidence\nLyc\u00e9e Ma\u00efmonide (FR)\nLyc\u00e9e L\u00e9on l'Africain\n\u00c9cole Normale H\u00e9bra\u00efque\n\u00c9cole Al Jabr\nItalian: Scuola \"Enrico Mattei\"\nSpanish: Instituto Espa\u00f1ol Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez\nAmerican:\nCasablanca American School\nAmerican Academy Casablanca\nGeorge Washington Academy\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nMost of the city's places of worship are Muslim mosques.

Raja's symbol is an eagle and Wydad's symbol is a star and crescent which means a symbol of Islam.

Morocco was scheduled to host the 2015 African Nations Cup, but decided to decline due to Ebola fears. Morocco was expelled and the tournament was held in Equatorial Guinea.\n\n\n==== Venues ====\nStade Larbi Zaouli\nStade Mohamed V\nStade Sidi Bernoussi\nComplexe Al Amal de CasablancaThe Grand Stade de Casablanca is the proposed title of the planned football stadium to be built in the city. Once completed in 2014, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of Raja Casablanca, Wydad Casablanca, and the Morocco national football team. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 93,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the Stade Mohamed V. The initial idea of the stadium was for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to South Africa. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2025. The idea of the stadium was also for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to Canada, Mexico and United States. It is now hoping for the 2030 FIFA World Cup which Morocco is co-bidding with either African neighbors Tunisia and Algeria or two European nations Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nal-Haja al-Hamdawiya, one of the most iconic figures in aita music, was born in Casablanca.

The Casablanca School\u2014a Modernist art movement and collective including artists such as Farid Belkahia, Mohamed Melihi, and Mohammed Chab\u00e2a\u2014developed out of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts of Casablanca in the late 1960s.The Academy of Traditional Arts, part of the Hassan II Mosque complex, was founded October 31, 2012.L'Uzine is a community-based art and culture space in Casablanca.Rebel Spirit published The Casablanca Guide (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0648\u064a, Le Guide Casablancais) a comic book about life in Casablanca.Sbagha Bagha is a street art festival during which murals are created on the sides of apartment buildings.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\nPostcard companies such as L\u00e9on & L\u00e9vy were active in Casablanca. Gabriel Veyre also worked and eventually died in Casablanca. \nMarcelin Flandrin (1889-1957), a French military photographer, settled in Casablanca and recorded much of the early colonial period in Morocco with his photography. With his staged nude postcard photos taken in Casablanca's colonial brothel quarter, Flandrin was also responsible for disseminating the orientalist image of Moroccan women as sexual objects.Casablanca has a thriving street photography scene. Yoriyas is prominent among photographers capturing the economic capital's street scenes, and has attracted international attention.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Casablanca had many movie theaters, such as Cinema Rialto, Cinema Lynx and Cinema Vox\u2014the largest in Africa at the time it was built.The 1942 American film Casablanca is supposedly set in Casablanca and has had a lasting impact on the city's image, though it was filmed entirely in California and doesn't feature a single Moroccan character with a speaking role. Salut Casa! was a propaganda film brandishing France's purported colonial triumph in its mission civilizatrice in the city.Love in Casablanca (1991), starring Abdelkarim Derqaoui and Muna Fettou, is one of the first Moroccan films to deal with Morocco's complex realities and depict life in Casablanca with verisimilitude. Nour-Eddine Lakhmari's Casanegra (2008) depicts the harsh realities of Casablanca's working classes. The films Ali Zaoua (2000), Horses of God (2012), and Ghazzia (2017) of Nabil Ayouch\u2014a French director of Moroccan heritage\u2014deal with street crime, terrorism, and social issues in Casablanca, respectively. The events in Meryem Benm'Barek-Alo\u00efsi's 2018 film Sofia revolve around an illegitimate pregnancy in Casablanca. Hicham Lasri and Said Naciri also from Casablanca.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nCasablanca's architecture and urban development are historically significant. The city is home to many notable buildings in a variety of styles, including traditional Moroccan architecture, various colonial architectural styles, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Neo-Mauresque, Streamline Moderne, Modernism, Brutalism, and more. During the French Protectorate, the French government described Casablanca as a \"laboratory of urbanism.\"The work of the Groupe des Architectes Modernes Marocains (GAMMA) on public housing projects\u2014such as Carri\u00e8res Centrales in Hay Mohammadi\u2014in a style described as vernacular modernism influenced modernist architecture around the world.Casam\u00e9moire and MAMMA. are two organizations dedicated to the preservation and appreciation of the city's architectural heritage.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rapid Transit ===\n\nThe Casablanca Tramway is the rapid transit tram system in Casablanca. As of 2019, the network consists of two lines covering 47.5 km (30 mi), with 71 stops; further lines (\u06373 and \u06374) are under construction.Since the 1970s, Casablanca had planned to build a metro system to offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality. However, the city council voted to abandon the metro project in 2014 due to high costs, and decided to continue expanding the already operating tram system instead.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nCasablanca's main airport is Mohammed V International Airport, Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve Marrakech, Rabat, Agadir, Oujda, Tangier, Al Hoceima, and Laayoune, as well as other cities.\nCasablanca is well-served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. New York City, Montreal, Paris, Washington D.C., London and Dubai are important primary destinations.\nThe older, smaller Casablanca-Anfa Airport to the west of the city, served certain destinations including Damascus, and Tunis, and was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It has been closed and destroyed to build the \"Casablanca Finance City\", the new heart of the city of Casablanca. Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport is located in the nearby community of Tit Mellil.\n\n\n=== Coach buses ===\nCompagnie de Transports au Maroc (CTM) offers private intercity coach buses on various lines run servicing most notable Moroccan towns, as well as a number of European cities. These run from the CTM Bus Station on Leo Africanus Street near the Central Market in downtown Casablanca. Supratours, an affiliate of ONCF, also offers coach bus service at a slightly lower cost, departing from a station on Wilad Zian Street. There is another bus station farther down on the same street called the Wilad Zian Bus Station; this station is the country's largest bus station, serving over 800 buses daily, catering more to Morocco's lower income population.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nRegistered taxis in Casablanca are coloured red and known as petit taxis (small taxis), or coloured white and known as grands taxis (big taxis). As is standard Moroccan practice, petits taxis, typically small-four door Dacia Logan, Peugeot 207, or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. Grands taxis, generally older Mercedes-Benz sedans, provide shared mini-bus like service within the city on predefined routes, or shared intercity service. Grands taxis may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.\n\n\n=== Trains ===\nCasablanca is served by three main railway stations run by the national rail service, the ONCF.\n\nCasa-Voyageurs is the main intercity station, from which trains run south to Marrakech or El Jadida and north to Mohammedia and Rabat, and then on either to Tangier or Meknes, Fes, Taza and Oujda/Nador. It also serves as the southern terminus of the Al-Boraq high speed line from Tangier. A dedicated airport shuttle service to Mohammed V International Airport also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.\n\nCasa-Port serves primarily commuter trains such as the Train Navette Rapide (TNR or Aouita) operating on the Casablanca \u2013 Kenitra rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark Casablanca Twin Center. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction, the station is still operational. From 2013, it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the city's new tram network.\nCasa-Oasis was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early 21st century, and officially reopened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern intercity train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to intercity standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nAlthough Mohammed V International Airport receives most international flights into Morocco, international tourism in Casablanca is not as developed as it is in cities like Marrakesh. Casablanca, however, attracts fewer tourists than those of cities such as Fes and Marrakech. \nThe Hassan II Mosque, which is the second largest mosque in Africa and the seventh largest in the world, is the city's main tourist attraction. Visitors also come to see the city's rich architectural heritage.Popular sites for national tourism include shopping centers such as Morocco Mall, Anfa Place, the Marina Shopping Center, and the Tachfine Center. Additional sites include the Corniche and the beach of Ain Diab, and parks such as the Arab League Park or the Sindibad theme park.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAmal Ayouch (born 1966) \u2013 stage and film actress\nSalaheddine Bassir \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nLaarbi Batma \u2013 Moroccan musician and artist, founding member of Nas El Ghiwan\nLarbi Benbarek \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMiriem Bensalah-Chaqroun \u2013 Moroccan businesswoman\nJean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes \u2013 French footballer\nFrida Boccara \u2013 French singer, Winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 1969\nMerieme Chadid \u2013 Moroccan astronomer\nSoufiane Choubani \u2013 Founder of the Moroccan National Debate Team\nJean-Charles de Castelbajac \u2013 French fashion designer\nDizzy DROS \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nGad Elmaleh \u2013 French/Canadian comedian\nLa Fouine \u2013 Moroccan-French rapper\nEl Haqed \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nSerge Haroche \u2013 French physicist who was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physics\nShatha Hassoun \u2013 Moroccan/Iraqi singer\nLydia Hatuel-Czuckermann \u2013 Israeli Olympic fencer\nHicham Mesbahi \u2013 Moroccan boxer\nFrench Montana \u2013 American rapper\nNawal El Moutawakel \u2013 Olympic champion\nNoureddine Naybet \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMostafa Nissaboury \u2013 Moroccan poet\nHakim Noury \u2013 Moroccan film director\nMaurice Ohana \u2013 French composer\nJean Reno \u2013 French Hollywood actor\nDaniel Sivan \u2013 professor\nAlain Souchon \u2013 French songwriter\nFrank Stephenson \u2013 award-winning automobile designer\nHassan Saada \u2013 Moroccan boxer arrested for alleged rape before Olympic match\nSidney Taurel \u2013 naturalized American CEO of Eli Lilly and Company from 1998 to 2008\nRichard Virenque \u2013 French cyclist\nMuhammad Zarqtuni \u2013 Moroccan nationalist and resistance leader\nAbdallah Zrika \u2013 Moroccan poet\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe 1942 film Casablanca (starring Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart) is supposed to have been set in Casablanca, although it was filmed entirely in Los Angeles and doesn't feature a single Arab or North African character with a speaking role. The film depicts Casablanca as the scene of power struggle between various foreign powers, which had much more to do with the Tangier of the time. The film has achieved worldwide popularity since its release. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, it won three, including Best Picture.\nA Night in Casablanca (1946) was the 12th Marx Brothers' movie. The film stars Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, and Harpo Marx. It was directed by Archie Mayo and written by Joseph Fields and Roland Kibbee. The film contains the song \"Who's Sorry Now?\", with music by Ted Snyder and lyrics by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. It is sung in French by Lisette Verea playing the part of Beatrice Rheiner, and then later sung in English. Liszt's \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\" is played twice, once by Chico on piano as an introduction to the \"Beer Barrel Polka\", and again by Harpo on the harp.\nThe city is featured in The Mysterious Caravan (1975), volume 54 in the original Hardy Boys series.\nCasablanca is the setting for several chapters in Doubleshot, a 2000 James Bond novel by Raymond Benson. In the novel, one of the characters mentions that the 1942 film was shot in Hollywood and not on location.\nCasablanca is one of the key locations in the 2006 video game Dreamfall, as it is where the primary protagonist of the game, Zo\u00eb Castillo, lives. Although the city is imagined in the year 2219, much of the present-day architecture is used for inspiration.\nCasablanca is the setting for the first act of the 2016 World War II romantic thriller film Allied starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nCasablanca is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nRabat Zoo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site of Casablanca\nOfficial Casablanca Tourism Website (in French)\nCasablanca photo gallery (buildings and other landmarks with a history dating back to the French Protectorate)\nOpen Air Museum of 20th century architecture\n Geographic data related to Casablanca at OpenStreetMap",

          "If you're looking for a change from the medinas and souls of Morocco, this mall will fit the bill. Spacious, clean and quiet with a good selection of shops for many budgets, from cheap fast fashion chains like H&M to upscale brands like Gucci. Sadly, what once was a giant",
          "We insisted while our local friends warned us that they are not aware it works... And they were right! I was naive to trust the website ofnthe mall where no hint was goven that it may not work. Reading it with also a lots of videos, you are sure it is great. But it is false",
          "One of best malls in North Africa I think it's built by Dubai company so expect bling ! And it delivers. Food court and cinema on sight , most spectacular aquarium outside of Dubai. All level of shops from Zara to Louis Vuitton. Be prepared to queue for taxis on exit",
          "If you've been in Europe, Dubai.. Nothing new... Picked up a few things for the kids as it's sale season",
          "It's a great space to refresh ur mind and Keep ur mind away from stress.. I have been there to do shopping with my family, they have a good quality of dress with normal price and I founded what I want exactly without boredom :) also I like outside space of mall with a lot of",

          "There's a lot to do in this mall! The have a massive fish tank which is definitely a sight to see. The mall is also filled with tons of European and American brands as well as local Moroccan shops. There's also a very cute restaurant to grab coffee or desserts like ice cream,",
          "It is just like any other malls you'll see in the gulf states such as Abu Dhabi, Dubai or Doha. The only difference that it has a huge aquarium in the centre.",
          "You could find all my favorite brands: berska, Stradivarius, oysho, pull&bear, Zara, mango... so this place was heaven for me. I recommend! Good food court in the 3th floor.",
          "A very nice and stylish mall, but the shops are high class and a rip off. The fish tank is beautiful and there is a few things to do, the funfair wasn't great. However the ice rink was really fun even if you don't know how to skate. All in all a good mall but doesn't reflect",
          "This is a very nice modern mall with mostly western clothing, accessories, shoes, etc. It looks just like a North American mall but expensive but you are not there to buy western clothing.. The food court has different type of food including McDonald's. There is a grocery store",
          "Morocco mall is a nice place that combines both shops and restaurants. You can do some shopping. Also there is a small nice aquarium there.",
          "Very good mall. Not crowded. Very good shops and very good prices. Be carefully with taxi when you leave the mall, many will not turn on taximeter. Ask them to do so. Or ask them to drop you again.",
          "Bit of a disappointment as many top brands were in the process of setting up thier shops but still we managed to pick up quite a lot at fairly reasonable prices. I am sure once all the big brands set up shop in Morocco Mall it would be a worth while place to visit",
          "We had a great time. Not to crowded, and all kind of stores. We had lunch and an icecream in between. Nice staff. Also an adventurezone for the kids.",
          "This is your average western style mall with brand name shops and many restaurant choices. Two attractions make it unique, the aquarium at its center, which is one of the grandest I've seen in the Middle East and also the very modern IMAX theatre which is the only theatre in",
          "Having walked the length of the Corniche this was a great place to stop for a break. Large assortment of eating houses, with views over the Atlantic. Big names and small name retailers and of course The Fish Tank. Thanks to the girls in the ice cream parlour, and to the Samsung",
          "We followed the long queues into the carpark of the Mall by the sea. Parking is very reasonable and the location by the sea is excellent. As we entered the Mall , I was struck by the ceiling to floor Aquarium which features fish of every kind - from the small tropical fishes",
          "I went here with my wife and 2 young kids in April 2016. At first glance it's just another mall with all the major brands and Starbucks. But inside, there is a cool aquarium in the middle of the department store and at the very end there is a kids amusement park with rides and",
          "This is my second visit to Morocco and I knew for sure where to go shopping....this is the biggest mall in Casablanca. If shopping is on your list, Morocco Mall is the place you might get all that you want.",
          "Good for btands shopping, also they have a section for traditional shopping but I didn't check it. The cafes outside the mall have a good view on the ocean.",
          "Very good but very little air conditioning in the supermarket. Some cafe's are cooled but at KFC and others very good hard working young people suffer next to hot kitchens without ac relief.",
          "The mall is uniquely designed with lots of luxury shopping. It's also located on the shoreline with a beautiful view of the sea.",
          "It was said to be one of the biggest mall in the region maybe it was. They have boutique, restaurants, coffee shops ofcourse starbucks haha one of my favorites they actually have two and others stores. And also a cinema just outside the mall which was the Morocco IMAX.",
          "I visited the mall with couple of friends, we bought some cloths and gifts, the prices are average, the mall has restaurants and cafes inside, also there is big fish glass pool inside where you can enjoy the sight of different kinds of colored fish, the mall also has a cinema.",
          "Being the largest shopping mall in Africa this mall has most of the top fashion brands plenty of entertainment for the kids and the food shopping can be done all in one great place, in addition it has a huge aquarium similar to the Dubai mall and lots of caf\u00e9s for a nice break.",
          "Nice classy mall.Could be anywhere. If at night you need a taxi to go to your hotel beware... Take small notes so you do not need change as they dont do that.. Deal about the price first... Demand the meter, without you will suffer. Its the next thing to plain robbery. A woman",
          "Big shopping mall you can find from luxury fashion to cheap fashion . There are many restuarants and a big aquarium , ice skitting . I would definitly recomende it.",
          "A very modern mall (and apparently the largest in Africa) featuring predominantly Spanish fashion brands (eg Zara, MassimoDuti etc). Starbucks is there if you need your coffee fix. Overall, a place to cool down and take time out...",
          "This is an amazing mall. Definitely visit this mall, even if you don't want to shop. Huge IMAX theatre, ice skating rink, AdventureLand Maroc, an aquarium, beautiful water fountains & display. Best part of my stay in Casablanca.",
          "To be honest didn't expect this in Casablanca. Really nice shopping center with lots of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton. A nice aquarium in the middle with an elevator right through the aquarium. Lots of restaurants on the third floor.",
          "It is a shopping center with international standards- you can find basically any brand and any type if food at the food court. Too many people during the weekends - avoid it. Here is wifi signal, but it never connects. There is plenty of parking spaces.",
          "shop shop shop until you drop! very modern building, lots of shops and restaurants, not busy when I was there. iMax cinema next to it",
          "Well who would have thought there is a Dubai /Beverley hills style mall by the Casablanca seaside. Seriously Dior, Louis Vuitton et all complete with red carpets and red ropes..... Colour me impressed... Well until I saw the prices, luxury shopping at its most expensive ...",

          "This is my second visit to morocco mall, it is set with the atlantic as the back drop, very nice mall, the largest in afrika, it is not cheap here, I think it is geared towards the tourist and the more affluent locals, the average person cannot shop here, but it is worth a visit.",
          "Great day out in Casablanca. I saw the picutres previously of the fish tank here, this was my primary reason to venture out.. and I was not disapointed! It is excellent! Very nice shopping centre, lot's of choice, prices are reasonable for the branded type and at least you",
          "Normal mall with lots of shops & brands. For me it was very normal & it was not attracted at all... It is accessible easily, the food court is available, all brands, kids playing and the mall is not big. Try to avoid the Taxi man standing outside the mall, they will not use",
          "This mall is big with a lot of brand name shops. There is a huge selection to choose from. However, I did find it a bit claustrophobic as I ventured in the middle of it. My first impression felt as if I were in a Las Vegas Hotel rather than a mall. The goods are way too",
          "Amazing mall with every shop you could dream of. Souq definitely recommended on top floor. Layout was confusing and went in circles! Toilets hidden away on left from imax entrance.",
          "Morocoo Mall is such a huge mall, its shaped like a fish so as you walk down the aisle it gets smaller. It has so many brands and a huge aquarium to look at and even go inside it! I love that the seating areas have a beautiful view of a garden that leads to the beach. Great way",
          "Morocco Mall is a blessing for Casablanca with almost all the known brands present there. A nice place for shopping and movie lovers. It is well spread out and offers nice view seeing the ocean for people visiting restaurants and cafes. Please plan for atleast half a day as its",
          "It's an ordinary not so large mall , you could see malls like it or larger at your country & almost at any country , it's expensive & in my opinion not worth visiting , but it is clean & you could eat a snack at fast food shops there.",
          "Hadn't it been for the huge aquarium in the central hall of the mall and the two groups of guards and metal detectors we had to go through to get into the mall, I wouldn't be able to distinguish the Morocco Mall from other shopping centres I've been to. But if you experience an",
          "It's a nice shopping mall with a good variation of shops, restaurants and a big aquarium tank in the middle. The only problem is that it's far away from downtown and considering the traffic jam, it's not recommended a visit unless midday onward.",
          "Just a mall. In a nice area on the beach. Expensive! There are some nice cafes with a lovely outdoor area. No bookshop, which was what I was looking for.",
          "Very nice standard western mall. Don't understand what all the hype is about; every major city has one. The aquarium is fun and the outdoors is really nice to walk around.",
          "It's a nicely decorated shopping mall, there is an iMax cinema and a big fish tank which is full of exotic fishes. There are plenty of restaurants and main chains available. Around the mall is also a beautiful beach (Ain Diab) and memorial.",

          "This Nice place was realy enjoable and interesting for visiting or for spanding some time with m'y family. We didnt think that we will find this geant building. We take a nice coffe there and we take some pictures with m'y family to remember this nice building, thanks a lot.",
          "Great place i love it. I wish i can go back to see more places Morocco is wonderful country, but u need extra time to get to see more things.",
          "What we liked the best was the food court. Mall is located next to ocean. Modern and has aquarium. I am not a big shopper so it is hard to get enthused. Probably a great place for Moroccan families.",
          "I don't thing is worth to spend half day in this mall. Actually depends on where you coming from. But you can find nice sea view next to the mall.",
          "I have been there several time. The mall is big enough and you there is a lot of stores. Prices are little high so bring all you savings :)",
          "Morocco mall is always a quick option for a weekend outing with the kids. The amusement park, candy shop, toy shop and movie theatre always give them the satisfaction they want. There's also a decent selection of shops: Zara, H&M, Aldo, MAC and Banana Republic are my personal",
          "Ranging from the relatively cheap stores to the most expensive luxury goods stores, this mall should have something for just about anyone. There is also a large food court on the upper level which has the usual juice and snack bars, ice cream, fast food... Good place to relax",
          "A mall like any mall in Europe. Clothes, food, Zara, Galleries Lafayette, HM,... plenty of snacks bars, ice cream, pizzas, kebab. Etc... Unles you are bored or want to enjoy a Imax movie (like me...) it is not a great spot, apecia\u00f1ly with the chaos to park around it.",
          "We liked only Marjan Supermarket and FNAC. We bought so many aromatic and fruit yoghurts . Really reasonable prices for food/snacks from Marjan. FNAC is the known for books/CDs and electronics but price is the same. Upper floor is the elegant clients. Most known brands have",
          "Everytime I come to Morocco we always check the mall out. Their is an aquarium, a theme park, a grocery store and of course the normal stores you would expect to see in a mall. Great place to go!",
          "Whenever I go to Casablanca I have to visit this place because it's without doubts the best Mall in Morocco. and in fact it's the fifth in the world too. What makes it really special is that it has everything u can think of, from restaurants to Adventure Land, going through the",
          "HUGE mall with various boutiques. Luxurious ones of course, but value for your money. A great food court with a variety of food choices.",
          "What marvelous architecture. Hard to remember you are in a mall and not on a cruise ship (the design idea I am sure). Take the elevator ride through the aquarium, definitely worth the cost and time. Just wish I would have had more time to explore the shops. Also, never",
          "One of the cirst malls to open in Morocco. About 70000 square meters. There are a lot of shoos to choose from most French and spanish. There is a whole floor of luxury shops: Vuiton, Dior, Baccarat, Ralph Lauren and many more. There is also a food coirt, with a geeqt vqriety of",

          "Beautiful mall with the usual suspects/chain stores and restaurants. The nice thing is the set prices which if you like to haggle you may disdain. There are alot of attractions to keep the kids busy and you can watch the sunset over west africa from the foodcourt or from outside",

          "visited the mall recently. it was actually a nice mall but when it came to the food court it was a very different story. we ate at the Italian food stall called Luigi's. the food was not so good and the cashier (kinder chubby and curvy girl) was a thief. the bill came to 80",
          "Big airy mall, huge fish tank inside.. All high street brands and upstairs the upscale designer brands. Also upstairs many food stalls with a lot of variety.",
          "I had a long layover in Casablanca so I thought Id visit. I had read that it's the 2nd biggest mall in Africa after the one in Egypt, with 350 shops. I don't think it has anything close to 350 shops. It's ok but not impressive. In terms of food also, not impressive. Bathrooms",
          "This mall is not big by size but it is by what it has and what inside it and near by it, It has unique acquarium you can smi-swim in side it.",
          "Im from southeast asia where malls are the only places to go to. This place lives up to our standards except for the kids play area which was not really taken care of. We kind of felt ripped of here and it was too hot.",
          "The mall has a wide choice of international luxury and mid-range brands, the sales are insanely interesting in casa and worth spending a day in there.",
          "It is a okay place for people from Europe and other countries because there are great brands available but for Moroccans it is great. So this isn't something special you should go to",
          "Designed by an international architect Morocco Mall is the largest mall in Morocco and the best one. Shopping? Cinema? Eating ? Footing? Are you a shop goer? Well Morocco Mall is your best destination. Don't miss it if you go to Casablanca !! And try the aquarium elevator, it is",
          "My daughter wanted to go and see it. It is a nice upscale mall with many luxury brands, Cartier etc. I worked in retail so no thrill for me but my daughter loved it. I don't know if there is anything in Cairo like it. It is much like any mall of its type in most places in the",
          "The mall is okay, nothing new to shopping malls most of us have seen. It's very far from the city center, you can go by a small taxi or tramway. Ask the front desk for directions. Idk if it's worth visiting or no but for shopping lovers moroc mall is your place",
          "I understand that this place is something incredible for locals, but thereis nothing new for those who live in countries with plenty of shopping center. It's true that it's one of the exclusives places where you can find luxury brands in North Africa, but for those like me that",

          "Went looking for some shoes and found a good pair at Aldo (Call it Spring). The sales assistant didn't have the size I needed so went downstairs to another concession to see if they had any - they did. Very satisfied with the good service. The aquarium is definitely worth a look",
          "Sure, it's not that cheap to go do some shopping in Morocco Mall, you better know, but it's such an outstanding experience. I was personally impressed by this impressive architectural view... TROP TOP !",
          "That's what they said, the biggest mall in North Africa. From high end street such as LV, Prada to common fashion lines, you can find it here under one roof. The restaurant at the top floor, Tagine, serves tasteful Morrocon food with a nice view of Atlantic Ocean.",
          "I love old Casablanca and wandering the streets. Sometimes, you need air conditioning and maybe some clothes or shopping. I don't like shopping for clothes, but if you need clothes, here is the place to go. Plenty of parking and you go past some embassies along the way.",
          "After visiting souks and medinas throughout Morocco it was good to get back to 'normal.' This is a very nice mall but obviously caters to Western and European clientele that are more accustomed to this type of 'experience' since the place was practically empty on the day we",
          "Because I had loads of time to kill I took a taxi from Hassan II Mosque (the driver had an accident and I needed to transfer to another). This way you get to see the entire length of the Corniche and the house of the rich. The mall is a classic western style shopping centre",
          "We had a wander around. It is a stunning new building, spacious and clean with some lovely features. It has a good range on named stores, but a lot you'd find in England. Everything is full price so we headed to the medina for our shopping. There is a good arcade there and a big",

          "This is a mall. Malls outside the USA seem to be the it place to be and are always extremely huge. Definitely worth a visit if your in Casablanca . The courtyard is very beautiful. The singing and dancing fountain with the Atlantic Ocean as the backdrop is very beautiful.",
          "Well...it is a mall. So let's not confuse this with the senses overwhelming experience of being in a souk. But for a mall....this is a really, really nice mall. Quality stores, with prices fairly reasonable for a large city. By USA standards this would be an exceptionally",
          "We went there not for shopping but just to hangout, easy to access prime location, safe. Several shops but didn't find anything really interesting to buy or of good value. Several restaurants there type food court so you will find the franchise restaurant. They have a cinema",
          "Nice mall, very modern, good facilities but if you are a visitor from Europe or the US do your shopping back home - you get more choice. However if you want splash out, plenty to buy and do. Excellent food court, loads of variety, Pizza places, Lebanese even KFC. Seating areas",
          "Many known brands, along with several local are hosted in one of the nicest malls. The christmas look was beautifull, even more considering this is a muslim country. Kudos. Great views from the food court terrace as well, packed with more than 20 foody options.",
          "A lot of shops and brands represented, Galeries Lafayettes here too and a food court at the 2nd floor. The huge aquarium in the center of the mall and the water fountains outside are nice",

          "The mall is huge and meticulously clean. Amazing fish tank/aquarium. High end retail. (The H&M is more expensive as well.) Although not personally a huge fan, includes one of I think 3 Starbucks in Morocco. Large food court area with many types of food. Beautiful chandeliers",
          "Very modern shopping centre located on the coastline. Great place to wander through and eat lunch overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Get there by taxi.",
          "I was during the work days, it was pretty empty. The seaside view is nice but is the same as any other big mall in Europe. I ate at a restaurant,I don't remember its name but it was the only one which had morocco traditional dishes and the food was very good.",
          "We took advantage of our hotels free shuttle to \"Casablanca\", you get dropped off here. After taking a private taxi tour of Casablanca, we had time tio kill here. Shops are mostly high end designer goods. One nice authentic Moroccan eatery called Tagine? Food was good. We had",

          "The girl at kfc \"didn't\" have change for 200 dirhams, barley gave me any soda, stole 1 dirham from me and said if I didn't like it I could leave and cancel my order. If you look or sound like you're American becarful in this mall, prices seem I be higher all of a sudden when",
          "I did not like or dislike Morocco Mall quite as much as other people do, but I do agree with the fact that it's a bit of a letdown, especially when taking into account the hype around it. I'm sure Moroccan are proud of their mall and they should be. However, after having heard",
          "This is an outstanding place with absolutely everything you need. This mall is a masterpiece with various shops and multiple known brands. I have enjoyed it a lot with my wife. The food is perfect there and the shops are very well organized. I would surely love to visit this",
          "It was about time we had a mall in Casablanca. I like the fact that there are many choices of shops and restaurants .I love the musical fountain. I wish they had original version movies all days in the theater not only once a week. I like how they change the look of the mall",
          "I ended up at the mall several times because a friend lived nearby. It is a nice mall but nothing more. I would say that tourists should skip or spend a short time there and get out and see things that are unique to Casablanca.",

          "Big and beautiful mall, very clean and well cared for. As you cant tell just from it's exterior, it's a mall on the high-end side. It's a beautiful piece of architecture and its interior design is amazing, especially the Arab influenced decorations. It carries so many brands",
          "Just a mall. Like any other ordinary mall in any other part of the world. There's an I Max theater next to it, which is great. Also, you can buy a ticket ($3) to go inside of the aquarium and have a guide explain to you its background and existing species for 5 minutes. (Ask",

          "We were looking forward to wandering through the Old Medina, but it turned out to be a disappointment. Lots of cheap souvenir stalls + stalls and shops selling shoes, clothes, and regular household items. The narrow streets wound around into the neighborhoods, which were not",
          "Although not as large as some Medinas we enjoyed it because during the day it didn\u2019t seem as busy or confusing as Fez or Marrakech. Actually got a chance to talk to shop owners.",
          "Nothing to do with Marrakesh or Rabat Medinas. Very dirty area only with locals and \"lost\" tourists like us. Skip it for sure",
          "It is like a whole different world when you get inside the medina. A variety of shops to look at and so much more. It was also very busy when I was there. As a safety precaution I put my money in my front pocket but everything was ok.",
          "The medina is flat and large with many dead-end passage ways and multitudes of streets to get lost in. You can view the modern developments from the streets that highlight the old and new cities architecture. Ricks Cafe Casablanca sits on the edge of the medina looking at the",
          "Nice old buildings spoiled by herds of useless (made in China) junk sold by local moroccans. No prices attached to stock so shop owners try to overcharge. Avoid buying but keep looking.",
          "busy and noise, full of local and quite narrow. i dont know that has how many local market here but seem non-stop and take along quite many street. and then, we turn and turn, finally, don't know where we are. haha... that also has some old building which is western feeling. ok",
          "Visit to see and shop . Reasonably priced but bargaining is a must . Superb shawls . Quaint streets . The hidden shops have better stuff .",
          "Must visit if Casablanca is your only stop in Morocco. However, you can find better and more authentic feeling Mefinas and souks at least in Essaouira and Marrakesh.",
          "We were here just for less an hour to see what's inside this medina. As usually they have lots of shops and selling almost the same things. I found out that the price are a bit cheaper compare to other place i have been to. Anyway, if you have more time, it is recommend to visit",
          "You'll want to visit so many stalls and bring back souvenirs from this vibrant Medina that if busting with Moroccain life. It is much easier to manoeuvre though this Medina than the Fes Medina. Although both are wonderful, we could find our way through the many tight and",
          "the old medina bazaar has very nice shops but prices are far more expensive than the old bazaar in Rabat for the same items.",
          "I went there as a relatively adventurous visitor. It is perfectly safe, and indeed very cheap. But, you can easily get lost in the maze of alleys... and you can easily get out of the \"traditional post-cardy\" souk and find yourself in a smelly, dirty, loud street market. What",
          "After Fes and Marrakech it was a bit routine. Same stuff. Not busy so we were hassled alot. It did allow us to get last minute trinkets at the end of our trip.",
          "I think..nothing interesting there ... very crowded... and food not clean... Better if I spend time..in another place..",
          "Enjoy when you go to old medina casablanca. Do not hesitate to try everything, as the merchants are quite friendly. The spices are a world to explore, fabric, bazaar, food and much more. If you have a good eye you can catch some gems, otherwise hire a young English speaker guide",
          "We visited the Old Medina mid morning and it was a hub of chaotic activity with carts, cars, wagons, motorcycles and locals crowding the narrow lane ways. It was a sensory experience that overwhelmed us at times and very easy to get lost in the narrow unmarked lanes.",
          "Very famous among locals also, travellers visit to check range of items. Leather goods, handicrafts, Argan oil products like Lotion, Oil, shampoo, soap etc, are mainly popular here. Food junctions are also popular at nearby area. Worth to visit.",
          "Narrow, but dirty streets with motorbikes crossing through... Didn't feel safe at all. Decided to leave after 20 minutes.",
          "I felt uncomfortable... Don\u2019t go there alone as a woman. Not many tourists and really dirty. Avoid this place by night.",
          "A maze of little passageways, many small shops selling souvenirs, clothes, spices, etc. Bargin for what you want. Nearly everyone speaks good French. English is less popular.",
          "For a day out i took the train from Marrakech to Casablanca takes about 2.5hrs and go first class,it may be more expensive but you get a better seat and its booked, about 30e return.Arriving in Casablanca station make your way outside and take the tram,get your ticket from the",
          "We went with Amine and had a gentle strawl through the marcet. With my hair covert we atraccted less sellers.",
          "A very interesting walk from Rick's Cafe to the UN Square. We meandered generally south from Rick's Cafe where we ate lunch (interesting but not authentic) toward the Clock Tower near the UN Square. The road's are narrow and not straight and it is easy to get lost or turned",
          "This is quite an interesting place to wander around and interact with the locals. It is really a local area with not too much for tourists.",
          "Not really old but boring with a few cafes only. Nothing to see but Mosques, port view occluded. Souk far from interesting.",
          "It may be different during peak season but we found it surprisingly pleasant to walk through because you don\u2019t get constantly bothered by the shopkeepers (like in Marrakech). Nice to see that most shops are aimed at the locals.",
          "We really would have much preferred visiting the New Medina - that said, the Old Medina looked like many locals and less tourists. It was a questionable bazaar. I don\u2019t think we saw much that we would have bought, although we did get a small souvenir to at least mark the",
          "It\u2019s crowded, noisy, littered and a visual cacophony. There are souks of every type and apparently, quality. It is an exciting experience, for a while. Then get the heck out of Dodge",
          "There are many other more interesting Medina's in Morocco. The old medina in Casablanca is crowed, interesting in a way, but many aggressive shop keepers, not clean and confusing, which can be fun. There is a new Medina near the Royal Palace with better quality goods and foods.",
          "More relaxed souk in this area, and you would think that all souks are the same but they are not. I felt this one was more relaxed and somewhat different than Marrakesh and Fez. Enjoyable.",
          "The \u2018old\u2019 M\u00e9dina looks more like a Chinese flea market than an authentic souk. There are almost no local products or something authentic to be bought. There are way better souks and bazaars in other cities.",
          "A must do for every traveller but you must have a guide to take you through and explain the hundreds of alleyways. Exciting, vibrant and very colourful",
          "We love touring old markets like this as you can find nearly anything here. The market is a rabbit warren of alleyways, some very well travelled, others not so much. Some lead out of the market so pay attention to your surroundings as you walk through. Some have general",
          "Not real interesting. Alot of small shops in tiny alley ways selling international brands. Not a lot of local products.",
          "I visited Old Medina for souvenirs while in Casablanca. Overall, the vendors were nice and I was able to find some good deals, however it is a MUST that you negotiate. They will try to charge you 3x what they are willing to accept if you are a tourist. There were a few",
          "If you are visiting Morocco and you are already in Casablanca...you need to spend , at least, some hours visting Medina ! And you'll understand a lot of historical things concerning its people !You'll admire , for yourself, the evolution of everything compared to the present!",
          "Be ready to have a blast bargaining for everything! Ceramics, tea sets, scarves, silver, carpets, fabrics - it\u2019s all here. Tasty snacks are everywhere and the crazy windy aisles of stalls will have you in shopping heaven for hours. It\u2019s right out of a movie - don\u2019t miss it!",
          "If this is your first it would be great, being relatively clean, clear and commercial. Nothing here but a Moroccan theme for old hands, though still a must \u201cwalk through\u201d.",
          "Title says it all. It\u2019s crowded and dirty and you have to be careful not to be run over. People are rude and pushy and kept touching my hair (it\u2019s white blonde) so recommend wearing a hat. Enjoyed the souks in Marrakech much more.",
          "The area is dirty and the map is horrible to follow Close attention needed Not really a tourist destination",
          "I stayed in a hotel in the Old Medina in Casablanca and all I can say is: what is there not to love? The best and the most obvious part of it is that if you want to see the Old Medina, you can stay right in the middle of the Old Medina. Besides, I had a view over the port from",
          "our first exposure to a Medina - open streets, but seemed like no matter how far in you went it was the same tourist junk - still there were great sights and smells",
          "This \u2018market\u2019 is not worth visiting unless you want cheap fake clothing. We thought we would be going to a market where we could eat some lovely local food. The smell of piss as soon as you walked in hit us in the face. It\u2019s so dirty this market. They have people riding up and",
          "There are every kind of vendor here, clothes, jewelry, argon oil, and souvenirs. It can be quite confusing even with google maps on your iPhone, but people are helpful, just ask for sortie (exit) if you can\u2019t find your way out. I bought a beautiful tea set and because",
          "We went walking to old MEDINA market in Casablanca early September. This was our first trip to this large city. The market sells anything and everything. We enjoyed buying some local cookies from the bakery. There is a lot of antique for sale and things you have never seen",
          "I've lived in the Fes medina ( big love) and currently live in the Kasbah in Tangier and I visit Casablanca often for meetings. I made a point on my first visit to Casablanca to visit the originial city and its a must if you like to get lost, meet people and just. Connect to",
          "This is the first time visiting this market place and the overall experience was average! I tr qwas interesting walking through the differ streets within the market. Many of the stalls sold many of tr he same things! Some vendors were pushy! However, if you like haggling on",
          "We had a great time here, looking at all the different wares that merchants were selling and we were delighted by the different personalities of the salesmen. Completely different to the markets of Marrakech.",
          "Having previously visited the Medinas in Fes, Marrakech and Essaouira, I found the old Medina (Ancienne Medina) in Casablanca welcoming and easy to navigate. I bought a few last minute ceramic souvenirs and believe I got a good deal! After trying to find souvenirs elsewhere in",
          "The place is full of people from the local and beside of it is the old big market where you can find all Moroccan made and gifts.",
          "Wandered around old medina, on way to Hasan mosque. Lovely to wander around. We weren't quite sure if we were in the right area, later we found the bigger market off United Nations Place, but this area was very scenic, around Rue de Tanger.",
          "This place is extremely easy to get lost within the streets. We were dropped off and we walked in taking left and rights. It wasn\u2019t anything like most of the markets I\u2019ve been to around the world. It was mostly men sitting around selling clothes and shoes. After a couple of left",
          "You should visit it actully there is no reson to visit casablanca without visiting old city or centerville",
          "Average market as you would expect. Nice to walk around. We bought a nice magnet really cheap. There are plenty of things to see. And some guys dressed up in bright colors who offer to take a photo with you for a fee. All in all, we didn\u2019t find the hawkers particularly",
          "nice to experience, but too many cars and morobikes wurming themselves throught the pedestrians all the time. not al relaxed walk, but a lively place where factory stuff are sold as handmade. Be ready to bargain.: A table cloth starting at 2.900 was in the end offered for 400,",
          "Whilst rhere is a huge selection of goods to but here - the hassle factor makes it more of a viewing than a buying experience. Just go for a look as if you show the slightest interest in any product - this opportunity will be seized by the vendor ! Plenty of couterfeit / fake",
          "wonderful to see such old buildings still standing and being used daily,The markets were amazing ,full of fresh produce",
          "We rolled in to town late afternoon on Sunday and found the M\u00e9dina very calm. Some vendors were packing up and with only Marrakech to compare, this was not nearly as crazy. A good time to go for a slower pace, less congestion and a relaxed time.",
          "I may have gotten a decent deal on a couple of items. The vendors are very pushy here. One vendor chased me after I made my final offer which he turned down. I quietly and politely walked out of his shop only to hear him yelling a few minutes later and following me. He was only",
          "Very good market open both day and night til about 10pm. Bargains to be had here and it is a huge market covering many types of products and food.",
          "Not the biggest medina by a long way but still a good variety of merchandise. Safe to visit. Plenty of taxis available.",
          "I visited the old medina of casa. It\u2019s not a special place. But it isn\u2019t bad . You can buy some souvenirs (bags,tshirts,...) There is a tram station beside medina .",
          "Really not much to see here, many cities have better medinas. Very interesting history, but thats about it for this place. Its just too touristie for my taste.",
          "Very nice and authentic Arabian market without a lot of annoying people always trying to sell you something.",
          "Lots of tourist stuff but they weren't pushy. We walked through the market into the small streets beyond which was interesting. Ended up down at the wharf.",
          "Traditional place with a lot of local products, you can walk between the food market and then \"everything market\" It is very interesting and safe place. The people are very friendly and the push you for buy ,but not to much",
          "The place has changed from a few years ago. It was better before. There will be lots of people asking what are you looking for and then guide you around. They will expect payment after and they want bills not coins. Say no and be firm. They prey on your kindness. It\u2019s easy to",
          "I had gone here on the last day of my total trip around Morocco, if you had a chance to visit the amazing Medinas in the other cities, then you have seen everything at it's best. If however, you are not visiting the other big cities, don't miss.",
          "I had come from Marrakech so was only disappointed in the Casablanca Medina. If this is your only opportunity to visit a Medina, take it. Otherwise, there are others which are more interesting, Fez is brilliant.",
          "The old Medina in Cas is interesting but not as fascinating as the other cities. You can buy pretty much anything from argan oil to old knives and swords! As this was our first stop on the Moroccan tour I only wanted to look and not purchase. They are aggressive but soon you",
          "Old Medina was OK but somewhat bland compared to Fez, Marrakech, Tangier's and even Rabat. Try habous insted.",
          "If you are in Casablanca, it is worth a quick walk thru. Do not expect to find any artisans nor much Moroccan products. Seek out La Sqala for lunch and get out ...",
          "So many things to see and buy. Yes, you will get the occasional seller trying to capture your attention, but most times, a polite 'no' suffices. Can't blame them!!! They're just doing their job.",
          "A visit to the old Medina takes you back in time on your way towards the Hassan 11 mosque. Most of the vendors are friendly and helpful if needed, with only a few using more aggressive selling. A must visit if you want to time travel without a time machine",
          "A busy and hectic place. Many stall sellers offering anything you can imagine.The most interesting corner hosts a number of olive traders who also sell extra virgin oil produced on site.",
          "The old Medina is nice. Compared to the rest of Morocco the Casablanca Medina is average. Fez and Marrakech for me were the best Medina's.",
          "The biggest, craziest and most famous are elsewhere. But if you've just come into the country (as we had) and want to dip your toe in the medina experience, it a good spot for it.",
          "Easily accessible from UN Square and huge. Typical but filthy in places with rotting rubbish, and rubbish just strewn around - but this is Casablanca and unlike many other Moroccan cities. The residents and local government doesn't seem to care",
          "It was interesting to do window shopping. Be careful with your cellular phone. As we entered, a couple of youngster came close to check out your phone.",
          "Mainly for locals, not tourists! More spacious and less cramped than many others with fewer tourista outlets. Not too large and limited options for getting lost. Very local.",
          "This is a maze of charming streets with shops selling absolutely everything, quite narrow so you must dodge donkeys or fully loaded carts by jumping out of the way into one of the shops.",
          "my first day in casablanca , and it was so nice hanging out trough the old medina and it was raining , i really like it",
          "Just abt a short 15 minute walk from the Hassan Mosque, passing Rick\u2019s Cafe, Le Sqala is the old Medina. Cleaner and less congested but nothing beats the other medinas in Fes, Marrakech etc. However, I must say the feeling of being in this side of town amidst the more modern",
          "I went on a Sunday and many stalls were closed. Those that were open were selling crappy goods from China (socks, phone cables, underwear). There were very few stalls offering any souvenirs and they were also mass-produced garbage (also from China).",
          "The old Medina was a great experience in Casablanca. It is smaller than the Medina of Fes but nice. It is a must see",
          "Founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, Casablanca\u2019s Old Medina (in Moroccan communities, the original walled city with narrow alley-like streets; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0629) is a rabbit warren of streets so narrow cars are not allowed, and even drivers of motorbikes",
          "This are is a little daunting a lot of little alleys and do feel that safe and told not to enter after dark",
          "I went here on our first day in Morocco. It's quite an experience - unlike anything I've seen before. It's a good place to experience Morocco and see the culture. If you're going to Morocco, don't miss the Medina.",
          "Just walk there after a suppler brunch at the Sqala (better to book in advance). Get lost, look at the streets, the old houses, the fresh tags on the walls... the bee-traps in the streets... just enjoy the atmosphere.",
          "This outdoor market is huge, dense and you could easily get lost in it. It was closed on Sunday but I was strolling and exploring the area on Monday by the hotel (Novotel) and didn\u2019t realize one of the entrances was just a block away. I went in through one of the gates and was",
          "shops are everywhere\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 a wide variety of goods to choose from.. haggling is free and fun. bought a pair of shoes and a dozen of moroccan refrigerator magnets for a very low price..",
          "We enjoyed our visit , nice bazar , pleasant walk, not much harassment, sellers are kind and pleasant",
          "Ive been to many markets and this particular one is housed in one area all together. You can find all sorts of things there thats really\" Moroccan \" from spices,home goods to clothing and accessories. There's some small bakeries & eateries. Its a souk so goods are sold at market",
          "By entering here you are entering a shopper paradise and if you can bargain , the deals are awesome. Loved to walk about the souk and one can find deals from fake Gucci to authentic rugs and even gold and silver jewelry. Food, tajines, dates and orange juice are the cheapest",
          "This shopping experience can be a little overwhelming. Great things to see and buy. Prices are fair and reasonable. Good for bargaining. Some of the vendors can be very pushy. Very busy place with motorcycles riding thru the narrow walkways which and busy with people walking.",
          "This place is very croudy and popular The access there is by foot You can find many artisanal things you can buy",
          "Much like most medinas, perhaps not quite as pushy as the medina in Marrakech. The usual touts pretending to remember you from the hotel and letting you know that there's a Berber exhibit for one day only. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Always fun to",
          "It was a poor market in a poor city. The stalls reflected were not exciting and although it is not large we had to ask for directions to get out.",
          "My advice would be don't worry about going here it's what it says on the town plan, old medina. You will get approached frequently and asked to look in my shop, all part of middle Eastern and North African culture. But the old medina is dirty and we saw few tourists. Try the.",
          "As a Chinese myself, I laughed hard when I saw handcrafts and souvenirs there are actually made in China... Don't waste time there, Fes and Marrakesh have much better medinas.",
          "If you are spending a few days in Casablanca you could go to the Old Medina. It is not nearly as impressive as in Marrakech and unfortunately you have to beware of pickpocketing...So stay vigilant and do not create any opportunities",
          "Both from outside and inside, this is just another medina. Compared to the other more interesting medinas of Morocco, you can safely skip this.",
          "I have been to serveral Medina\u2019s ow on my tour of Morocco this was the only Medina I felt uncomfortable in. The men pushed really hard to get you to purchase and would not let up, they followed you through the Medina. We were polite in asking them to leave but they would not",
          "Since we were staying at a close by hotel, we thought we would visit this Medina. After all, this is Casablanca, and \"it must have an impressive Medina.\" BUT NOT SO! Compared to Fes and Marrakech Medinas, it is small time (teeny time). There are many shops and food stalls, but",
          "After visiting the old Medina in Tangier, Rabat, Fez, Marrakech, Essaouria, the Casablanca Medina just cannot stand up to the other ones in terms of size, cleanliness, and shopping. It was a short walk from our hotel but we left after 10 minutes.",
          "We visited the Old Medina of Casablanca but I was disappointed. It was more like an old flea market. Our guide didn't even want to take us there because it is dirty. For anyone with mobility issues, this is a difficult place because of steps and different levels of pavement.",
          "The Medina has a different atmosphere depending what time of day you go but the locals are friendly and not pushy. They do offer themselves as guides but a polite \"La Shoukran\" is generally enough. The real Medina is hidden up backstreets and it's very easy to find yourself",
          "This is a must visit. But beware of doing all your shopping here. You want to save some shopping for Fes and Marrakech. They have equally good if not better Medinas. Haggle the price. 50% reduction is a good deal. 20-30% is a reasonable deal. Shopkeepers are friendly so joke",
          "There are many cities with much more colorful Medina. But this place is still good, if you do not have the opportunity to see another. Narrow trading mazes and many hawkers . Be alert with pockets and valuables.",
          "Getting Lost in this laberynth is special, the front side is a bit full of tourists but Just walk through and they soon dissapears it's basically a fish and veg market and the street fish food stalls at the back are delicious, argan oil products cost less here than anywhere eles",
          "I went here with my Nephew and a friend of his. This made the trip more enjoyable as they spoke the language keeping the various hucksters away. Find the olive market and get a selection, they make for great snacks before dinner for the rest of the stay in town.",
          "It's a little spooky at night but all the shops will have closed so you will not be bombarded by salesmen hawking wares. You will experience the Medina as a living and breathing residential organism. Kind of like a desert Ksar or Kasbah. At the far western end is Rick's Cafe",
          "This is a sanitized version of the huge Fes medina. It is rather small and more organized and lacks the charm of the other medinas in Morocco which is chaotic! It is also less crowded. The saving grace is that the popular cookie store Bennis is located nearby.",
          "First off ~Do not stop at the vendors at the entrance & go in the morning when it opens. Follow the women with the shopping bags! It\u2019s about a block in before you see the REAL market. It was a wonderful experience seeing the market. Be prepared for trash hanging meat and",
          "Fortunately for me my Hotel was near the Medina .I spent a couple of mornings ( you must arrive before noon to see the produce stalls at their capacity )wandering through the alleyways of mazes .The people that live and work in the Medina sometimes do not like your presence",
          "And they call it a small market. It\u2019s almost a whole village that we could stay in and not come out. Everything from traditional to the latest fashion, snacks to meals, spices, fresh fish, fruits and vegetables. You can even get your nails and hair done, phone repaired, ...",
          "The old medina is very similar to other medinas in Fez and Marrakesh but smaller. It is more authetic than souk in Marrakesh. People are friendly and there is not as much pressure on the tourists to shop.",
          "During our trip to Morocco, we visited the medinas in four cities: Tangier, Fez, Marrakech, and Casablanca. Without a doubt, the medina in Casablanca is the one you can miss. It's smaller, more touristy than the others and not nearly as historic.",
          "The medina is the oldest part of Casablanca, surrounded by remnants of a wall, gates and fortifications. People live, worship, eat, drink and shop here, so it is a teeming city within a city. Narrow streets are more like alleyways, twisting and turning, some with dead ends, so",
          "the medina in casablanca is more expensive and a harder place to negotiate than other medias in morocco however still an interesting place to visit",
          "Well,no. The architecture is great, no doubt about it. But the stalls are smelly, and dirty. Not great. Go there anyway, because it is one of the more interesting sights. Just don't expect too much.",
          "It all depends what you\u2019re looking for - enter from the clock tower and you see all the tourist-type traders, every sort of copied product, clothing, shoes, etc.. Keep on walking through the market and you get to the real market used by locals, much more interesting. Bread,",
          "Great place to browse, people watch and score deals. The food section outside and around the back was particularly interesting. No one in that section to hassle or offer to tour through the Medina. Food is fresh - fruit, vegetables, many varieties of potatoes with soil clinging",
          "I guess it is one of the coolest part that I have visited in Casablanca! Many merchants try to sell anything from everywhere. I\u2019d love it too much! The people are polite and in part too clever to stay just in there. I recommend to take with you few bucks, and buy most of the",
          "The old Medina in Casablanca is a deadset must do when visiting! I'm talking spices that pleasure your nose to the point of almost orgasm, more knockoff tracksuits than you poke a stick at, small argan oil shop salesmen that could sell ice to Eskimo, small intertwined streets",
          "If you are like me, I like to see the \u2018main\u2019 attractions. However, as others have said, if you are going to Rabat, Tangier, Fez, Marrakech or even Essaouira, the shopping there is much better. We walked from the Hassan II Mosque and entered in the back way. It\u2019s vegetables,",
          "Last Friday afternoon, I decided to saunter along to check out the Old Medina of Casablanca, freshly coming off from three consecutive days exploring its cousin, the Medina in Marrakech on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of the same week. I was advised by our travel agent to be",
          "The old Medina has great leather items and souvenirs. Watch out for your cell phone because there are pick pockets. Bargaining is easy if you are a local expat but tourists need to stand strong to dealers sending their men to follow you to sell you items. I haves learned to say",
          "Its an amazing place for people who like endless shopping. This section of the city lies within the old city walls, with remnants of 18th century fortifications still visible. The narrow lanes twist and turn in all directions, passing a myriad of small shops and stalls selling a",
          "Very busy, a good selection for gifts or personal shopping, they can spot you from a mile, so the price doubles, whatever the price they quote, you have to half and then work your way up, but try not to go to much higher. You will get hustled by agents for argan oil shops, which",
          "It is not an old Medina, the whole Casablanca is quite recent. Nothing to do with the Medina of Fez, Meknes or Marrakech. It is a commercial site for cheap shopping.",
          "We spent much of our first afternoon in Casablanca strolling around the Old Medina, on our way to and from the Hassan II Mosque. This section of the city lies within the old city walls, with remnants of 18th century fortifications still visible. The narrow lanes twist and turn",
          "another spellbinding trip to the iconic town. so much sound and energy. the beautiful sun and exploring the old medina. such great shops and traders",
          "The Old Medina was a nice place to shop for authentic Moroccan crafts. We spent an entire day shopping and we got some really good buys",
          "This medina was nice in terms of experiencing the atmosphere of what a bazaar is or was in the 'olden' times. Regarding the quality of the products - you need to have a good eye to spot the real genuine stuff. Also be prepared to haggle. Never accept the first price. Overall",
          "In spite of being terrified by all of the commentary on the web, simple safety precautions apply and are successful.. we were lucky to explore relatively early ( 10am) one morning which meant fewer crowds, and less hassle from guides, false guides, and hawkers.. compare to the",
          "The old M\u00e9dina was extremely small and not comparable to the size of the Fez and Marrakech souks. If you\u2019re going to be traveling to those cities, just wait and you\u2019ll have a better shopping experience.",
          "This old medina is relatively small compared to Fes and Marrakech but still gives an introduction to the vendors and wares of this country.",
          "you want to walk peaceful and look at all goods, but as all over in <marokko sales guys and other \"Business-oriented guys\" do not let you in peace.... never ending story - so basically we just left !",
          "Marrakech has the most amazing Medina so this was a slight disappointment. If you are only in Casablanca I would go, if you are heading south, I would safe Medina in Marrakech for the restaurants, the winding streets and the shopping. Put on you bargain hat as prices are",
          "The Medina has been alley ways. Some shops are of modern clothes/footwear. Others service the Medina and those that live there. It is not an area i felt comfortable taking photographs as a westerner. The majority of people were polite and accommodating. Some of the food choices",
          "I guess when you travel a decent amount, markets can seem to blend into being similar. Though a busy market, we are at the start of our Moroccan holiday, so we weren\u2019t interested in purchasing anything and used the market more of a curiosity knowing we have Marrakesh & Fez to",
          "Come here to experience authenticity and how the people of Morocco live in this old city. So many shops and stands. It's like a whole different world and cultural experience !",
          "Do not waste your time, there is nothing to see. Better to go to fez or Marrakech (if you can get busy)!",
          "The medina is where one should stay in casablanca to get the real atmosphere of the city.It is where the locals eat, shop and live. Coffeeshops, markets and hammams bustle with activity and this why its genuine and interesting",
          "Wander the small closed streets, handicrafts, local dress, Fes (tarboosh), a Sea of colour and spices.",
          "In the old part of Casablanca, with lots of interesting things to see. It's good to walk along those old streets.",
          "Great walk through the streets of the old medina. Some comfy shoes will be helpfull. The local market was a good stop",
          "We have been told the ones in Fes and Marrakech are much better but as a first it was very pleasant walking around the narrow alleys - when we were approached with requests for helping us find places we politely told them we weren't interested and they just left us alone - not",
          "The Old Medina in Casablanca is much smaller than Marrakech's or Fes ones, and has very few stores that may cater to tourists. None of the old doors survive and most are just a hole on the city walls. Many streets are devoid of stores and anything worth seeing for that matter.",
          "Medina in Arabic means town or city. The Old Medina is the older part of Casablanca now incorporated inside the greater metropolise. The market of the old Medina is an interesting area to visit. Numerous small shops, some very old mosques a d houses made the area attractive.",

          "very disappointed its a melting pot of Chinese stuff with plastic rubbish nothing pleasing to the eye. Unfortunate you have Habbous too expensive and than you have this too cheap nothing great actually it should be recreated all of it its right in the center of Casa its uch a",
          "Great place to shop but watch out for fakes. It is very old (centuries), and they sell everything. Be sure to haggle. In this part of the world, haggling is an art. The Old Medina is on Avenue des Far, easily accessed by walking.",

          "Located in the historic heart of the city, the old medina is a must, between myriads of colors, scents, and typically Moroccan shops !",
          "Enjoyed going thru all the stalls (Souks) in old medina. It was our first shopping stop in Morocco, so got a good introduction to the culture. Of course, I bought a pair of babouche slippers - very fancy and will probably never wear! It was a fun and interesting couple of",
          "Like all medinas, this is a bustling and busy part of town with plenty to see and do. The stalls are the usual - bags, souvenirs, clothes, spices as well as food, meat and chicken stalls for the locals. There is plenty of noise and energy in this place! There is obviously some",
          "Not as good as many Medinas in other cities not only in Morocco but also Algeria and Tunisia. It is a bit too modern and often the so called \"berber\" craft, are made in China.",
          "The medina is technically the word for city not a market. It is beautiful to see the old walls and buildings. It is full of shops with crap that I would hit buy. I would see it for a few minutes and leave",
          "Ok place for traditional shopping and other stuff, not a branded place to do shopping , but a lot talked about place",
          "my last visit to casablanca it was in 2007, this year we went to Morocco and we visited casablanca and old medina really is a very big change since 2007,",
          "Very very old! I don\u2019t really recommend it, alot of the same shops everywhere and they try to catch you to buy any thing Be careful and watch your wallet",
          "But don't let this put you off. It's easy to lose yourself here too. Also worth a visit at night to see it illuminated.",
          "The market is easily accessible and walkable from most hotels in the city centre.There are affordable clothes,shoes and even Moroccan gifts for friends and families. There are even henna designers for those interested and affordable eateries in and around the medina",
          "There are actually some quite nice, quality products being sold on the narrow little streets. I enjoyed it more as it is not huge like many others, its a reasonable size. It is particularly good with gold and jewellery but well out of my price range!",
          "Traditional Tangine in Casablanca is absolutely delicious. It is an ancient meal that was seasoned to perfection. The chicken tangine had onions, carrots and potatoes eaten with fresh baked bread. Also try the fried fish platter that is so fresh and crispy. It was the best",
          "Old Medina has two parts, one for the local people and another for the tourist. It looks like the market for the local people is quite reasonable, full of local dresses, groceries, fresh vegetables, fruits, fish, meat etc. The market for the tourists is little disappointing. I",
          "Streets are winding and narrow lined with variety of goods for sale. Wear sturdy shoes streets are uneven. Interesting to see locals conducting their daily activities. We did not purchase anything.",
          "Well you wil find nicer medinas around Morocco but if you are only visiting Casablanca its worth to see buzz and fuzz",
          "This Medina was busier than what I\u2019m used to in Rabat, but it\u2019s still nice to wander around and see the community of this Medina. If you want food, stop early because once you head towards the Hassan II mosque, there are less options, especially during Ramadan.",
          "An ok place to get souvenirs, if you have to. Lacks ambience but has a few unique items as well as the typical t-shirts and counterfeit designer stuff.",
          "Worth a visit if you are in town but not a must do, there are other Medinas that are better and offer a better experience",
          "The shopping in old M\u00e9dina was great. They have various selection of items for gifts, beautiful jewelry and much more. Always bargain as it\u2019s very normal bargaining.",
          "Morocco is a country of Kasbahs, Medinas, and Souks. Fez, Marrakech, and Essaouira all have different, and better examples....especially for shopping. If starting your trip in Casablanca better to wait till Fez (famous for pottery & leather)...a truly authentic-ancient Moroccan",
          "The taxi driver told us not to go inside.we went anyway. There is so much variaty of everything but when they see you're a tourist all the price go up and almost don't negotiate. Everything is very expensive comparing to some price I pay in Europe",
          "What a wonderful m\u00e9lange of sights, sounds, smells and tactile impressions! Stalls of everything, interesting architecture, great authentic food and engaging people-watching. Go!",
          "I felt inside Burroughs' book \"Lunch Naked\". All the alleys of the Medina connected me to the pages of the classic book, I felt like an Interzona being, wandering through those narrow streets full of history. Thanks to Omar Bakrin, the Best Interzona guy and the Best tour guide",
          "Not a memorable experience but pleased to have been there to experience the atmosphere and daily hustle and bustle. Crowded and noisy and found same of the stall holders more aggressive than others we have encountered on our Morocco adventure. Watch out for the snake charmers",
          "Quite boring for a medina, can\u2019t be compared to the one in Marrakesh. The shops looks pretty organized, more like a really old shopping center than a street market. The goods being sold are more China products, than authentic Moroccan goods. It is very small and nothing much to",

          "above the entrance were two stork nests. That was pretty amazing. They seemed totally unperturbed by all the activities below. The Medina has something for everybody and is an incredibly colorful and lively place to be. While some will take US dollars you are better off with",
          "When Visiting Medina make sure to have money, because you will find a lot of things to buy .. starting with Souvenirs to clothes, paintings, and many other things. You can also try the shrimps the small local restaurants sell, it tastes good.. it's near the train station Casa",
          "I enjoyed shopping in this market and haggling the prices down. As expected starting prices are for rich tourists, but spend some time on the price negotiations and you can get your goods to a decent level. Be wary of any offers to guide you through the market or negotiate on",
          "Very dirty and crowded and not worth the effort. The majority of the goods for sale appear to be fakes and are overpriced! Make sure you shop in Marrakech or Fes before you come to Casablanca.",
          "The souk in the Medina is really good. Not as big as the one in Marrakech but still big enough to get a bit disoriented Discovered some of the specialist areas like the Fish Souk and Olive souk where the locals go to buy their groceries Found some lovely cafes where we could",
          "Much people, small streets, easy to get lost but a beautiful market. Ask for a better price wherever you are to not get tricked :)",
          "On the last day of our visit to Morocco and needed another suitcase. What better place to go than the historical Medina. Most interesting although offering similar goods to other Medinas we had visited in other towns. Found a good suitcase and as it is in Morocco spent more time",
          "Friday is prayer day so most places are closed until around 3pm. We found the area full of fakes, tat and very dirty",
          "We stopped by the Old Medina of Casablanca in April 2018, it is very touristy and should be viewed as a quick tour only, unless $20 \"Rolex\" watches and \"made in India\" crafts are your sort of thing. Instead, do a quick tour of the Medina, then take in the \"where the locals shop\"",
          "Old medina was probably the 2nd most interesting part of Casablanca (after the mosque). The people selling in the markets were not pushy, which was nice. We met some lovely locals at one of the little street food vendors and ended up sitting and chatting with him for an hour or",
          "A great introduction to the Medina's of Morocco. Less inspiring than Fez but a lovely place to poke about and find treasures worth bargaining for. A most enjoyable afternoon with pleasant vendors, good tea and delectable treats :)",
          "The Old Medina in Casablanca is interesting, but not as colourful and lively as souks in other cities in Morocco such as Fes and Marrakesh. Still, if you're in Casablanca, this is a place you should go.",
          "Casablanca has been of world notice for a rather short time. It is an Atlantic port, but there are a few above and below on the coast. It is nice but I suspect that without the Bogart film (shot in LA) that not many tourists would visit this working city. Indeed it is great to",
          "In comparison to other Old Medinas, this might be a small one ... we enjoyed getting lost in the maze of passages; wandering into residential sections then bursting out into the bustle of commerce. So many try to 'adopt' you and take you under-wing, for a price OR for",
          "Casablanca was the first city we went to, but its medina was not colorful and interesting as it is in other Moroccan cities like Fes, Chefchaouen or Marrakech. Unless you realize you need to buy a cheap piece of clothing for your Morroco travels, I wouldn't bother to spend time",
          "We arrived at the south end of the Medina around noon on a Wed and it was packed with locals - people buying fruits and vegetables, craftsmen doing repairs, people bringing bread products to local ovens to be baked and lots of children playing in alleyways as it was their",
          "Wanted to buy some Argan oils/cr\u00e8mes for my mother and my hotel was close by so I went there and got lost (in a good way) hehe...nice to see what the locals are doing, but not plenty of things, you will find clothes, food, perfumes, argan oils and herbs, fruits and vegetables",
          "We started a tour of Morocco in Casablanca and this was the first Medina we saw. Not as interesting or as nice as those in Marrakech, Rabat, or Fez, but worth a quick visit, especially if you are only in Casablanca.",
          "Well worth a trip over to see the old ryads and streets. Some great photo opportunities around this area.",
          "Unlike the Medinas in Marrakesh or Fez, this one has outlived it's use as an authenic market for locals. This isn't surprising when you see the high rises and other modern development that surround it in this large city. If Casablanca is your only stop in Morocco (as on a",
          "This is a real medina for the locals despite all the tourists who frequent it\u2014 so in addition to the date carts, orange carts, spice stalls, and fish mongers (all interesting), there are plenty of t-shirt stalls, basic housewares, and sneaker/shoe places. Even w young",
          "Highlight was olive displays. We bought some great olives stuffed with carrots and pickel. Very good. Shopping was a good selection of just about everything you will later see during your travels in Morocco.",

          "Inside the old walls of Casablanca. Hundreds of vendors selling anything and everything. Be sure to bargain with the seller.",
          "I guess it all depends on what you compare it with, but for example the Marrakech medina is wonderful compared to this one in Casablanca. A lot of fake brand stuff and almost the same stuff in loads and loads of sinilar shops.",
          "The old Medina is the old open air market with stalls and booths where you can get everything from touristy souvenirs to leather goods, rugs, and local foods like olives. Certainly worth stopping for a few hours. Don't forget to haggle and barter for the best prices.",
          "This is a place where locals shop. Not much in souvenirs. It is fun just wandering around and getting lost. Think we went by a few places 2 or 3 times. If you stop the vendor is on you right away. If you keep walking the tend to leave you alone. Would not be comfortable",
          "The Old Medina is a maze of narrow streets lined with tiny shops. On the wider thoroughfares there are workshops where carpenters and other tradesmen work but beware of the traffic.",
          "Step back in time into the traditional way of the Moroccan life. Expect a little \u2018in your face\u2019 selling tactics, but that\u2019s life here when you visit. We greatly enjoyed.",
          "A wonderful way to get lost in the middle of Casablanca which is by no comparison to the rest of Casablanca. Enjoy the leather, spices, silver, brass, carpets etc etc of what the Souk has to offer.",
          "While we were looking forward to visiting the Medina area we were disappointed at the amount of dirt and rubbish on the streets in the outer area. The small shops were well stocked but to be honest we didn't even go into any of them because of the hassle from the shop owners as",
          "Not as exotic and colorful as the medinas in Fas or Marrakech, but will give you a feel for the fresh foods and the crafts available in this amazing country.",
          "This is not a traditional market - it is full of tat and fake knock offs - but we understand that this is not a tourist market and they are appealing to the local people who want to buy these things. Just wasn't what we wanted. Very busy and bustling place. Be careful of bags",
          "This was our last M\u00e9dina before we left and it was actually one of the best in quality and price. If this is your last stop, I know you hate to wait till the last minute but just be aware and rest assured that throughout your trip if you did. To get everything you want, you\u2019ll",

          "We came to the medina in search for a suitcase because of a travel mishap on our way over to Morocco. We wandered around several places and saw many things for sale, as well as many locals going about their day. We ended up purchasing a great suitcase with excellent wheels for a",
          "If you don\u2019t mind the hustle and bustle of the old city it\u2019s a fun place to be. They have a wide range of shops from knock off clothes, leather, or food. We were walking around at 9 and things were starting to close since they\u2019re still in the winter hours. We were able to talk",
          "Having now visited Casablanca and Rabat, we can confirm that the Casablanca Medina is on one hand probably very authentic, but also very rundown and filled with shops that pack fake brand clothing and leather goods. Liked the atmosphere of the Rabat Medina much more and heard",

          "Casablanca isn't a city where you should spend much time ... we could feel the regression of the women emancipation.... very sad! I even bought a veil as I was looked at in a very bad way!!! Not at all what Morroco was like 10 years ago!",
          "If you\u2019ve been to Marrakech or the other surrounding city markets you might find yourself underwhelmed. This M\u00e9dina has a lot more western stuff in it. It sells mainly clothing, purses, shoes (a lot of knock offs of big brands) but its interesting and definitely different from",

          "If your time in Casablanca is limited do not plan to spend more than 30 minutes in the Medina. It is not as authentic as one would expect. For the real Moroccan souk experience I recommend Quartier Alhobous.",
          "Small but fascinating wander around older parts of Casablanca. Many colourful stalls with a focus on leather in many of them. Be prepared though to tell several people that you don\u2019t want a personal tour or \u2018rollex\u2019.",
          "You can go in from Marrakesh door and you will find a lot of popular shops for all Moroccan products with a reasonable prices. You can also Find some old restaurants there.",
          "Quick stop for souvenirs & snacks. Sellers are often aggressive at times but nothing overwhelming. Some delicious spots for snacks. Definitely worth spending some time here if you can land a cheap taxi ride.",
          "A Very nice and authentic old town and bazaar in Casablanca. Leather market is genuine, cheap and great, Argan oil is of very low quality and very expensive. You need to have high negotiation and bargaining skills in order to buy from",
          "We walked in to the Medina and instantly we were in in love with the hustle and bustle of this very colourful place. The narrow winding roads led us to many different shops selling all sorts of goods and we saw lots of beautiful old buildings and very interesting people.",
          "Although we stuck out like a sore thumb, we walked through between 4:30 and 5:30pm and everyone was collecting for dinner,, playing soccer in the alleys, getting their hair cut and buying food at very small stalls. The doorways are fascinating and the people watching well worth",
          "Wandering around this area with our guide was a real treat, this really felt like the old Casablanca. You can really see some unique products here , marvellous gifts to take home could be bought here. There are little places to eat the local food if you are that way inclined. We",
          "The old medina gives you a sense of what the city may have been like historically, but it's not terribly tourist friendly at the present in my opinion. The streets are extremely littered, dusty, and smelly. There are many local shops for auto repair, furniture repair, grocers,",
          "Lots of little shops selling everything you can possibly think of. Great to walk around. Be aware of your belongings. Be careful not to get lost, there are some dodgy areas just turn back if you feel like it's getting too quiet.",
          "Mr. Said in stall 89 has a good variety of scarves, speaks English very well, and is fun to do business with.",
          "So we strolled through the market area, a bit dirty and unexpected. You need the local currency. It\u2019s a good experience, but not sure what I would want to buy there. The fruit looked good, but. We felt pretty safe.",
          "We visited Medina on our way from Hassan II mosque to Art Deco district. It was pleasant to go through the stalls and observe the people. Worth walking through!",
          "This is where you find shop after shop selling all you want as a tourist, be aware about pick pockets. Aim to pay 25 % of the asking price.",
          "It may not be as good as the Old Medina of Marakesh but it provide a similar environment of old traditional buildings and shops selling souvenirs, clothings, leather goods and food",
          "Horrible place. We did not feel safe there. It is run down. Compared to the one in Tangiers which is very nice this is rubbish",
          "I loved that the Old Medina was walking distance from our hotel. It was fun to walk through here and see some of the handicrafts of the Moroccan people. It wasn\u2019t like I read in my guide books. It was hassle free and very nice to just wander.",
          "The beauty of Casablanca city is in the old Medina streets , architectural buildings ,shops , Mosques ,libraries , food and king's palace.",
          "There are so many things to do an see in the Old Medina area, of Casablanca. Home to everything from historic and monumental buildings to the newest in food and contemporary art, the Medina here continues to grow and define itself as a colorful hub of vibrant shops and intricate",
          "Not enough local products compared to other Medinas. They mainly stock imported modern clothes and goods. Don't spend too much time",
          "After visiting Fez and Marrakech it is hard for other souks and markets to compete, but I actually really liked the fresh food section of the medina, as it was busy with activity, even busier than stretches of markets we have seen in Fez! Great vibe and ambience with many",
          "Talk to your hotel or other insider before you go to find out where the best places to shop are. We managed to find shops with well priced wooden jewelry boxes. Some bought prints for framing. Of course, much of the Old Medina is stuff that you might find at any flee market.",
          "Located in the heart of casablanca city..... very old monument when the Jews and Muslim living together before 50years There is new shop opened recently is good place to discover new culture and mix people",
          "We took a walking tour of Old Medina thinking it would be better than the previous tour of New Medina we took earlier. We v=were very wrong. The streets and walkways were dirty and continually pursued by beggars. If we even gave a quick look at something in a booth in the",
          "Didn't like it as there is nothing special about it .so dirty and smelly outside .I don't mind being in an old place but not in a place full of dust . Dirt .smells and also nothing special to buy .. I wouldn't go again if it was my choice.",
          "It's smaller than most medinas but has that special atmosphere sheltering the traditional way of life from the bustle of the modern city.",
          "We entered near where it says, following windy streets past many stands loaded with spices, dates, eggs, live chickens. We had planned to cut through to end up near Rick's Cafe, but after wending around thinking we were headed that way we suddenly came across the boulevard,",
          "This is a good place to spend time enjoying the locals way of shopping and eating.A place you can bargain.",
          "We strolled through the streets at night, it was small compared to most of the other Medina\u2019s we had explored in Morocco. It was busy and there was lots to buy, but it had a different new world feel to it. Probably because Casablanca is much more westernized. It was enjoyable",
          "I am a fan of the leather slippers with lowheels - not totally flat; just take your time, you will find plenty here; also nice Western style ladies shoes, caftans, bags. I've bought music recordings in other years, cute little silver-plated (not real silver) teapots. Just",
          "Walked through the old town after visiting the large mosque. A lot street vendors am trying to sell you everything form eggs, show, cloths etc. It nice but you need to be carful with pick pocket teens or kids.",
          "My 1st city in Morocco and was all about absorbing the vibrant in colors, the nose tickling smell in the air and the hustle bustle of people scurrying about. One will soon find out there's a Medina in all main cities and you are welcome to spot the difference!",
          "We had a small part of the day here, looking around. The tagine cooking restaurants smelt & looked amazing as we went past. There was a lot to look at, take a shopping list with you as they have so much there. We even got a hair cut, brilliant job too. The place was a bit dirty,",
          "Most items now are made in China and or imitations of well known brands, it is somewhat dirty, but the spices looked and smell wonderful",
          "If you have read any of my reviews they always say, go to every Medina. Exciting and you can find anything you want. Knockoff Athletic wear that actually holds up, knock off watches. All for prices that would rival any other marketplace in the world.",
          "Very busy, crowded, impossible to navigate and everyone keeps trying to sell you stuff if you make an eye contact. Honestly, it not worth your time, unless you are in dire need for some carrots",
          "The old medina was quite underwhelming when you consider the other places in Morocco. Unless you are not going to those places then sure, wander here. Really not impressive after going to Marrakech or Fez or even Essaouira. having wandered markets all over the world, this is one",
          "We walked around the old medina a few times on our trip and loved it. So many streets and alleys to explore. People were nice and there were lots of shops we liked. Great energy and safe.",
          "The souk is a good place to come to experience some local culture, but all you'll find on sale are cheap knock off shoes, clothes and electronics. Plus you'll be hassled by hawkers quite aggressively. The further you move inside the medina, the more you'll find locals selling",
          "I got lost for hours in the old Medina market and loved it. There are tons of people doing their shopping. The first part is touristy, but then it becomes a real market. I watched them make bread, fillet fish, smelled the herbs and spices and learned a lot. At first I was",
          "I went to Central Market and really disliked it, this was a fun place with a lot of things to offer.",
          "Much better than Marrakesh- no one putting anything on your hands or in your arms then demanding money off you! You just look and if something takes your fancy you can haggle. Camel & band came through as we were there & just like UK the bucket shakers afterwards, ha ha! Also",
          "While it is not to be compared with the medina of Fes or Marrakech, the old medina in Casablanca is great for a bit of shopping and wondering around in narrow streets. The old medina has undergone a major renovation program and many of its old monuments have been reopened. A",
          "Souvenir shopping for friends and family, great variety, friendly and helpful shop owners. Need to bargain to get best prices.",
          "We decided to do little shopping after a nice lunch at the Rick's Cafe'. There are hundreds of mini vendors at this place. It's like grand bazaar. Be careful with your valuables it is so crowded thus you can't separate from the good and bad. There are most like some locals who",
          "Old shops and markets but not to much interesting if they see you a foreign they tell you triple price I advise you to go with the prices to 1/3 hahaha and you will see",
          "This was the first of many medinas I visited while in Morocco. While it lived up to the general reputation of aggressive shop owners wanting to negotiate every price, and a dizzying array of items for sale, I felt uncomfortable and decided to leave before venturing too deeply",
          "Doesn't have the architecture or alleyways of proper medinas Nothing special The stuff on sale is very limited too Not worth bothering with Seems safe",
          "They call at you, they beckon you over, they push things under your nose, they insist that you need them to ferret your way through the medina.... and you know what? They are all probably right! It's crazy, it's zany, it's not what you are most likely used to, so just relax,",
          "A must see and an experience you should do with a guide. Be prepared to negotiate prices for a minimum of 10 min and more oer stop. There are 600,000 people that live inside this oldest medina in the world. I could not stop taking pictures, it was so amazing. You will get lost",
          "We went to Fes and Marakech before coming to old medina Casablanca. Even the market is not as big as previous 2,we found that the asking price also not as high for exact the same products.",
          "We were cautioned by our hotel staff not to buy anything at the Medina because 50% of it is made in China. Walking past the shopping areas into the living areas exposed a lot more of the ancient side. We found at least one lovely courtyard (the IYH is located here) and walked",
          "Went there for a walk with a friend. Not a good place to go. People are in your face all the time trying to sell you something. It\u2019s really smelly and crowded. Would not recommend this place",
          "Beautiful and authentic Morrocan experience. Lots of good food. Rather go to restaurants than buy street food because it is very expensive. Restaurants have beautiful rooftop terraces. Lots of pastry shops and lots of delicious cream shops.",
          "Selling everything in the bazaar old medina from textile, household and survenior, no proper direction or signigh possible to get loss in the middle of bazar.",
          "After visiting many medinas across Morocco, this was the least impressive. In addition we were hassled and followed by stall owners trying to provided every service possible.",
          "Basically Casablanca is a hole, I wouldn't bother going there unless you have to. I'm not usually too precious about dirty places, sometimes they can be colourful and charming. This is not. The medina has bits that are ok, but just ok... nothing special... and there are parts",
          "You have to walk through to get the true old medina experience. There is so much to buy but be ready for everyone to ask you to come into their shop. Its worth it just to walk through but be careful because there is a good chance you will get lost in the maze of it all.",
          "Casablanca Medina was our first Medina in Morocco. We enjoyed it a lot, the wall is huge and very long. It is an other world for us north american people. I recommand it to anybody that goes to Casa Blanca.",
          "Should not be missed ! A lot of shops , good prices , and the vendors don't bother you too much ! Quite a few lovely bars also to enjoy a cup of oriental tea ...",
          "We stayed across the street and found the visit incredible. Interesting ......There are modern sellers and some of the vendors had old and unusual items to sell.",
          "While we only visited a small area of the medina, we did see many goods, including fresh meats and many varieties of fresh fish. Any household needs can easily be found in a medina, including spices, furnishings, mattresses, clothing, and much, much more. It is well organized",
          "I read that the shops in Medina here is more expensive than in Fes or Rabat. So I didn't shop. Only stop to buy ice cream. It was soooo cheap and yummy",
          "Get ready to bargain or be ripped off. Nothing is priced. But if you like that, like I do, then go for it. You gotta be tough but not crazy tough. These guys are there to make money. So if it's friendly bantering, you'll do great. My hardest bargaining was pretty tough and",
          "Maybe we missed what we were supposed to see, but we just saw the market selling just about anything. Lots of street food was being fried or grilled. The streets are very dirty.",
          "We were 5 business associates using google maps to find ricks cafe and detour through old medina , 22:00 at night.....what an experience just walking through the streets.... Definitely worth going , not necessary to shop, but to experience ....and I would do it alone as a lady",
          "Unlike the old medinas of Fes, Meknes, Tangier or Marrakech, the old medina of Casablanca is small, unsafe and much less interesting. Foreign visitors aren\u2019t encouraged to go beyond the high surrounding wall and the clock tower at the United Nations square, known as \u201cBab",
          "Decent food in pretentious setting and very uncomfortable seating Sea views not particularly inspiring and if no use at night The sort of place where the local wannabes like showing off Not for me but ok for an expensive business lunch if you want to show off",
          "I have alreday been in other Medina's and this one is the most caotic and dirty of all !! It also did not have any kind of interesting local artifacts !!",
          "Small medina compared to Marrakesh and Fez. All the usual wares. Not many historical features. Not too much harassment for tourists - goof for a wander if your passing through.",
          "Do not loose time in this medina. There is nicer medinas in fes, essaouira and marrakech. But, we went on the sunday market day and the action was something to see. If it is your first medina and market be aware that you could be shocked by the live butchering of animals.",
          "Lots of small paths and very easy to get lost so take a compass. However, there was nothing for us to purchase. There was a great spice stall somewhere in the middle.",
          "I walked in the market and was instantly greeted by one of the vendors. Don't get me wrong; he was so gregarious. But he followed me around trying to sell me this and that and I just wanted to look around and get an idea. Then he took me to an herbal store (which was the 1st of",
          "Great to see the locals living their day to day lives. Incredibly easy to get lost (I did) but that's half the fun!",
          "It's a good stroll for 45 mins - most impressive are the jewellery shops which have some unique stuff and everyone likes fresh orange juice",
          "I am not an expert, but in this Medina you will not feel an atmosphere like in Medinas in Marrakech, Fez or Rabat. It is still nice to experience but this one seems much more modern then the others.",
          "It is under restoration. There are lot of things to discover: Souks, Old fast foods, old Cafes. the streets are a signature of North-Africa old Medinas. A must visit for tourists.",
          "From the train station, we took a taxi to the see the biggest mosque in Morocco. There we some tourists as well. The place is nice. I love the architecture of the structure. It was also massive. There is no near restaurants so better bring bottled water. The place is come",
          "As this is a local medina they don't get many tourists in most of it so the prices are not extortionate and they are very good people but still you should try and haggle ad they can still give you a better price. On the outside wall of the medina which is facing the hassan ii",
          "Arabic Medinas used to be delightful, packed with handmade goods, craftsmen, and interesting corners. Last time I visited, this one was packed with fake clothes and Chinese goods.",
          "It was a unique experience to see walk inside the Medina of Casablanca. A total sensory experience - it is not for the fainthearted - but it provides a great cultural experience.",
          "Interesting place to visit but after a while tiring everyone wants you to see the Aryan oil and spices. Also realised they charge three times the amount as soon as they know you are a tourist. Interesting place to visit.",
          "I needed to exchange some money and I had the best rate ever.. It is a heritage and traditional area, if you're into the history of Casablanca, you should pay a visit to the Old Medina. It is a mixture of Old and New contemporary Casablanca.. I hope my feedback helps a little..",
          "Like the rest of Casablanca, most of the Medina is simply a mess ... trash strewn streets, dilapidated buildings, and vendors selling merchandise likely not even made in Morocco. Walk through ... find Cafe Sqala or Rick's Cafe ... and enjoy the oasis provided. Both are good",
          "My wife and I were there in late April. It was our first taste of medina. We felt generally safe in there, but as always you should watch your belongings. You may be approached by someone who wants to show you /sell you stuffs, just be firm and politely say \"No thank you\" and",
          "The medina located in the centre of city and is very busy with traffic and people. Not much to see but can take some photo of the medina outlook.",
          "Great place with so much history and fun things to buy. However, I had a guy latch on to me immediately and he ruined sales for many vendors. Couldn't shake him and then he wanted to take me up a dark staircase to see his shop. I left. Go in a group and be stern. Bargain.",
          "A must see but watch your belongings! Get ready to haggle for scarves, cedar wood boxes, copy bags and tagines.",
          "The old Medina seems to be a timeless place. Fortunately for us we had a local person who took us on a guided tour of the Medina. There are all sorts of shops and stalls in the Old Medina, from butchers with meat and animal parts that I wouldn't eat to spices and traditional",
          "Spend a good hour or two getting lost here, you'll get a good feel for the local life. We didn't see many tourists, a lot of local cafes and street vendors. The night scene is lively and active.",
          "This \"medina\" offers nothing for tourists plus we didn't feel safe at all. I was so disappointed. There\"s nothing to see",
          "A view of the old town in the present is a must when you come to casablanca. The architecture is imposing and built on the old premises that the town is encircled by walls. Similar to the medieval castles and fortresses of 16th century Europe, this architecture is a must see.",
          "In the heart of Casablanca city center, the Marche Central de Casablanca is the city\u2019s main market, located along the busy shopping street of Muhammad V Boulevard. Crammed with locals, the daily market is fascinating place for tourists to get a taste of local culture, as well as",
          "But fun and functioning. America's food issues are archaic when you consider what market based grocery shopping is like here. Fresh foods, amazing clothes, Moroccan goods. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. A great exercise too as it spans quite the distance. A must see!",
          "Easy marked to walk around and explore, just follow the wall to leave. Aggressiv sellers but if you are experience to this its just cool visiting. Everything to plastic junk to lovely handcrafted things to buy. In the square and streets outside medina after sunset is just",
          "After visiting the Medina in Fez and Marrakesh is find Casablanca too small. Been Casablanca the economic capital of Morocco your expectations are very high and I find the city to be a little be overrated",
          "This is a cruise ship tourist trap, go ONLY if you can't take a taxi to the Habbous. Habbous is more authentic, a great variety in a small area, friendlier,and more bargaining goes on. (In bargaining, offer 1/3 of the price while smiling and settle for 1/2 their asking price)",
          "Good place to get traditional things , very interesting place to buy leather jackets . Safe , and located in the center",
          "Guys all they do in the old medina is hassle you. If you ask for the cost of something they will start off with 150MAD, then if you say no they will half that to 125 and then so on, you get the drift. If you're a hussler then this is the place for you.",
          "the old medina is the spirit of old casablanca a must see in casablanca , try visiting in an non vacation days",
          "I wanted to visit a medina and didn't get a chance while I was in Marrakech. If you have a chance go to that one instead of this because it is significantly more exciting (I got to drive through Marrakech Kasbah but couldn't walk or shop). I enjoyed the experience but I knew",
          "Walking in old Medina is almost a trip in time...you will enjoy the traditional everything you have to be careful with your belongings and avoid street foods...",
          "We have been there during a national religious holiday, majority of places were closed , but it is interesting to visit such an exotic place.",
          "Our guide stopped with the car in front of this place and we got off and took some photos. We didn't spend much time there.",
          "Visited this median which has the usual crowded market ambience. Was a bit concerned walking into the tiny by-lanes as the hotel staff cautioned me to hold on to my belongings when visiting here, which put me on alert. In the open areas large number of women were offering",
          "For those who have been to an old city (medina) before, stay away from this disgusting, stinky place. Narrow alleys crowded with street vendors selling everything from used shoes to candies. Garbage is spread all around, producing a smell that makes you want to puke. To its",
          "Its old and crowd bazar of Casablanca,there is nothing to buy there but good for visit and feel old Casablanca.",
          "I've been to plenty of outdoor markets and medinas, and this one didn't seem to be kept up. It felt grimy and I didn't stay long. It wasn't very crowded, which may have been because of Ramadan.",
          "Having been to many souqs in Casa, Marrakech and Fes, this one with this limited stores and pushy vendors is one of my least favourite. Unfortunately, it's also the closest to my apartment. There are a few entrances (doors/\"babs\") to the old medina and it covers it good sized",
          "It was good experience to visit an old part of city with traditional shops, you should haggle when you want to buy somthing and its great.",
          "Although it may sound or seem like a traditional market, it is a great experience. If you want to buy something\u2026be ready to use your bargaining skills. Lots of trinkets amd souvenirs. Would be hard pressed to find anything unique. But\u2026a nice way to spend an afternoon\u2026watch the",
          "Average goods , expensive prices and nothing exclusive to buy . Better to shop in fes or Marrakch if looking for buying directly from artisans .",
          "Old Median is a fun place to visit. However be prepared for crowded situations. Advise do not bring a large hand bag with you keep your personal items very close to you.",
          "We actually visited twice as there was not much else in Casablanca that we found interesting. Narrow aisles and lots of people. We enjoyed the food areas much more than the other items for sale. We managed to buy this great Rolex watch for my wife for $10 (ha!ha! yes we know",
          "I'm into haggling and finding bargains. I also love finding hidden jewels. This place has it. I got a lot of things while in the Medina. Had fun with the vendors, laughing and telling jokes.",
          "Its not a very great place to check it out. I was really disappointed with it and didnt had nothing really to see.",
          "This was the first market we saw in Morocco (definitely not the last). Loved every minute of the sights and sounds - felt fairly safe. A load of fun and some real gems to be found.",
          "After visiting the Medinas of Fez and Marrakesh, I wanted to make a few last purchases at the Medina in Casablanca. Be extremely careful crossing any and all streets getting to the Medina. The traffic is CRAZY! Suggestion - watch the local and cross the street when they start to",
          "With low expectations I visited this place and was hapily surprised. The bazar is really lively and you will see alot of things you never see in Europe. If you are in to negotiating prices you found rhe right place. Plan on paying maximum half of the price they start on and you",
          "Be patient. Get past the initial entrance where you will have men approach you who want to steer you to their favorite rugs, or silver, or whatever it might be. Go deeper in and you will experience the true old medina, not the tourist section. Where locals buy their fruits",
          "From all the medinas in Morocco that i have visited on this tour Casablanca is not my favorite. Quite dirty but safe to walk through the masses and to find everything your heart desires for the most amazing prices.",
          "Fun for a wander through the lanes you will get mildly harassed but more by beggars than shopkeepers mostly full of Chinese imports!",
          "This Medina is not as spectacular as the one in Fes. But if you want to get the feel of a medina and the lifestyle of the people then you should visit it. Bargain a lot when shopping.",
          "The Old Medina of Casablanca is a dirty and stinky place. I had a walk through it in the evening and another one next day during the noon. So, I gave it two chances in the hope that in the first part of the day maybe the things will be different, but it didn't happen. I",
          "Wonderful to walk around the Medina, lots of shops that sell moroccan souvenirs , you should remember to bargain as much as possible and also be careful with your belongings when you are walking in the crowded medina",
          "It is okay but not really exciting compared to Fez. If you wonder into the local streets you really see more local life but it is really not well kept.",
          "This place being an old memorial sells mostly products of suspected origin Hardly any local art and craft. Just OK to spend some time if have surplus at hand",
          "Many stores of cheap goods of suspect origin. The famous tower with clock dominates above the wall. As it is in the city center, it has to be visited",
          "The old medina is great for a wander, if you are trying to get your step count up it's the place to visit. We found some gifts there, the cedar wood boxes and spices are good. Lots of alleys to wander and the stall holders aren't too bad in terms of pestering you. Like",
          "Most shops here were selling what seemed to be mainly made in China and not locally made goods. Further into the Medina the food stalls were quite impressive with the amount and quality of fresh produce but there are far nicer Medinas and Souks in Marrakesh, Fes or Rabat.",
          "I liked to see the old Medina because it shows exactly how the local people leave and behave ... a lot of local typical shops with souvenirs and also fruit, nuts ... so typical and fascinating to see ... many kids playing in the streets with what they pretend is a ball ....",
          "It is nice to walk through old Medina and take a few shots of narrow streets with drying clothes covering space between the buildings like spider net with dry caught insects. Medina is smaller than in Rabat or Marrakesh, not so annoying and noisy.",
          "A Medina for the Locals - with stalls selling everyday articles such as spices, fresh fish, meat etc. An assault on all the senses.",
          "Interesting place to visit. Very odoriforous and crowded. Seemed to be mostly food choices to purchase. While it was something to experience, I wouldn't return if I were to ever return to Casablanca (which is very unlikely).",
          "I loved the Medina, when you enter the doors, you feel transported to a different time. I bought some really lovely and sometimes inexpensive things and gifts that have lasted for almost three years now. I want into a \"restaurant\" up some stairs and ate a plate of fried seafood,",
          "In my opinion there are better things to do in morocco. However if you have a leisure day in morocco, then this is a good place to stroll for a while.",
          "The energy, the venders and the smells are what make this Old Medina so special. You can walk for hours without anyone bothering you. You can find all kind of merchandise here and of course you can bargain. You must try the cactus pears when they are in season which my husband",
          "Make sure you make time to explore the town. I only had 3 hours to spare and nipped away and wow! What a colourful scene! Perfect place to buy a Moroccan Tea Set and some local olives.",
          "We entered the medina and saw some lovely pieces of art, jewelry and souvenirs. Bargaining is everything! We walked through different streets and met the vendors. They have some beautiful pieces of art and woodwork. You can walk around for hours though it isn't as big as",
          "Old Medina is old place and its good for visit for one times. everything is old and you will back to history",
          "A lot of activity Best time to go is in the evening, actually he city wakes up around sun down Ok restaurants around the whole place and good place for shopping, if you want cleaner more high end traditional gismfta cloths then I would recommend go to the mall by Two Towers near",
          "I feel the time like in 1500-1600 years the market atmosphere,shops products are very interesting naturel for me.l found very Good souvenirs especially leathers.I took picture of Morocco doors...",
          "Medina was across the road from our hotel which was awesome. It's a big Medina with everything u want . It has lots of jewellery, clothes , leather shops and has a lot of imitations which I don't like but u might . It's good to have a look for urself it has all the traditional",
          "We had a good tour of the old medina. It gave us a strong flavor of the city and all it has to offer. Some vendors were pushy but that was to be expected. We felt safe yet maintained awareness of our surroundings.",
          "Did not expect the medina of Casablanca to be so nice. Probably because the dynamics between merchants and potential customers in Marrakesh and Fez worked out so bad, my expectations were rather low. However here in Casa you find really very nice and helpful people in the middle",
          "We didn't like it as we are not shopping fans and, here, the items sold seemed very poor quality. Replica bags were widely displayed. We can't say if they were nice, we weren't interested and we didn't watched them accurately. It's not a charming market as in Marrakech. Casa",
          "I visited several medinas in Morocco and liked this one the least. There weren't that many traditional Moroccan crafts or artwork for sale. Mostly, there is a lot of fake handbags, etc. Beware if you walk through this medina - the alleys are narrow and there is a lot of raw",
          "We walked through the Medina and picked up some bargains. The traders were all good humoured and not pushy, haggling was a pleasant experience, not an ordeal unlike some places we have visited. Lots of counterfeit goods of course, but still sufficient shops selling local goods",
          "Walking around the Medina is a fun experience. There are plenty of unique little shops. Sometimes you need to go into a shop and see what else they have. At the street level it can look as if they all have the same thing. Don't be afraid to barter on price, and look around",
          "I was disappointed in this as I expected to see more traditional Moroccan wares for sale. There were a lot of what looked like fake hand bags, watches and clothing. We were nagged quite a lot to spend as we walked through. Worth a visit for the experience but don't",
          "As this was our last stop, perhaps it was that I have just run out of steam. If you have an opportunity to shop at the Fez Medina then seize the opportunity to do so! I would use the Casablanca Medina as the last call to spend any last money you don't want to reconvert to US$",
          "Second day in Casablanca we went to the Medina. While we found it interesting, it does not compare to other medinas we have visited. It is fairly small and doesn't have same variety of attractions as other medinas such as Fes, Tangier and Marakech. If you are going to other",
          "Items were inferior plus the hassles of beggers everywhere. It rates a 1 and Marrakesh rates a 10 for goods, excitement and environment. SKIP it",
          "didn't really enjoy it here, too many touts selling tatt. also trying to give away sim cards & over-priced coffee shops.",
          "We visit different markets all over the world and Old Medina is a great place to meet wonderful people. It was nice to speak French and we enjoyed the conversations we had with the sellers/traders. Great experience!",
          "Nice shopping souqe, you will find a lots of good value and quality merchandise in a good price. bargain politely, you will be amazed by the generosity of the shops owners.",
          "It was the first time we visited a Medina and we really recomend everybody to visit such a lovely place.",
          "Much like all the market places throughout the country. On the port, decent shopping. I would recommend.",
          "I had a long wait in Casablanca, then I decided to visit the Old Medina. I just love it. So full of history and culture. I intend to go back.",
          "Don't even bother going to this. The stuff they are selling is basically plastic shoes and little trinkets. It's dirty and maze-like. Just go to the new medina. Or better yet, skip Casablanca all together.",
          "If you want to get a better feel of true Casablanca, don't miss this site. It was well worth the time and we are so glad we visited.",
          "It's old town part of Casablanca, but mostly a flea market type of shopping experience. It's full of clothing shops with few local specialty stores her and there. The shop owners usually aren't that aggressive pursuing customers but do eagerly greet you in the tongue based on",
          "people kept walking over to us, trying to make us buy there stuff, watched some other tourist get scammed too wish I never went",
          "One of the main markets to get lots of Moroccan goodies e.g. Art, clothes, souvenirs etc. Remember to always haggle so if you're quoted 100DHS for an article the real price is probably about 60/70DHS. Once you're given a price just ask the seller \"what is your final price?\" And",
          "The medina in Casablanca is interesting, but iopen to motorcycles and scooters, so it feels a little unsafe. If you are only visiting Casablanca, swing through. If you are headed to Fes ot Marrakech, save the medina visti for those cities. Both are better.",
          "After visiting the Medina in Marrakech we were disappointed in the Casablanca Medina. The shops were typically selling typical commercial merchandise as opposed to locally crafted items. It was still a place to study the culture somewhat and experience the market place.",
          "The Old Medina of Casa is not as exotic or large as the once in Imperial Cities. It has grown espacially in the last century and has not been renovated since. very dirty and might not be safe in some deep areas, especially at night. recommended for a first visitor of Morocco who",
          "What a fabulous experience of walking through this old area. We were definitely looked at as foreigners, which is fine. There was food, spices, clothing, and various other bits.",
          "You don't need to buy anything here coz you may be able to find more and better ones in the Medina at Marrakech. But this place is a tiny and traditional area where you can see the real life of Morocco people. Do remember to have a walk and try to get through all the old&narrow",

          "First visit to Africa to experience Casablanca Medina. Great central location. Stall holders not pushy but scammers are around. We met one outside the Medina who didn't want to leave us alone There is a great collection of leathers, wood, jewellery and fruits you are spoilt for",
          "There are pretty few places in Casa worth going to ... so make sure you go here as it is really good. It is nice and central, so easy to get to from the stations and by tram. I came here on a quiet day in 2016 (May perhaps... I forget) and there were few people about. Despite",
          "You can\u00b4t leave Casablanca without checking the old medina. It\u00b4s a beautiful spot, you can find beautiful Moroccan art, good price!",
          "It's an old Moroccan Medina. Selling the same stuff that every other medina in Morocco sells. I didn't get pestered so much but one guy managed to mislead me. I knew better but he was convincing. lol. It was harmless just a waste of time.",
          "In the early 20th century , Casablanca only consisted of the old Medina, the people were a few thousand. Of the four gates of the old city today have survived the two the Bab Marrakech and Bab Tzentint on the west side. Along the walls daily organized a market with jewelers,",

          "A must see for travellers, less imposing than the medina in Tangiers and not so many hawkers but the right amount of traditional goods to be bartered for. If you are a gentleman and want a shave/haircut there are lots of very good barbers here with excellent attention to detail",

          "Worth a wander around but needn't spend too long here. Low end market stalls and not very big. Heard that it is not safe at night. Best part of this Medina is Rick's Cafe on the outer side.",
          "Moroccans appreciate good bargaining. This medina is not as big as Fez or Marrakesh but substantial enough to buy almost anything. Remember to stay firm on your price and you'll have a pleasant experience. Also remember to have small denominations as larger notes attract",
          "You really can see how it's a typical life in the Medina specially the commercial part and have this advice always ask price before cause can be a bit to much. And also fight for the price don't just accept the prices. U can go to the fish market choose your fish and they take",
          "This is a very interesting structure and the people most fascinating. If you are planning on shopping go far away. this is a haven for Chinese cheap and knock-offs. Shop elsewhere and just enjoy the atmosphere.",

          "This is probably one of the best places to shop in Casablanca - the prices are inexpensive compared to other cities like Marrakesh, and it's an easy place to go before or after a flight. definitely did most of my shopping in this bazaar! Just be aware that this is smaller than",
          "It is a shame that chinese plastic rubbish has infiltrated these once lovely Medinas. T shirts and clothing from China proliferates the stalls and adds a sadness to the traditional fare that once lined the streets. No longer do we see the pedlars making things with their bare",
          "It kinda looked like a trap, people come to ask where you're going to help and then they follow you. So weird. They actually expect you to pay them at the end. Plus all the fake luxury goods in dedicated shops, not even hidden, that shouldn't exist no more in countries trying to",
          "It is just good to see and pass, I mean it doesn't have any special attraction only the experience of being in that environment looking at the people's daily life, local vendors, old buildings and to touch the poverty.",
          "We visited the Medina a few times. This is a nice place to shop and the vendors don't hassle you very much at all. I bought many things here and received some good deals. I had inquired with my host as to where to shop for gold at a good price, and he suggested here. There",
          "dirty doesn't begin to tell you...most, but not all, of the goods looked liked they have been sitting there for 20 years. I saw a little emaciated kitten lying dead, in the middle of the walkway,only feet from where a few children were playing! Didn't really get to see that",
          "We caught the shuttle bus from the port to the main square. As soon as we got of the bus we were hassled but then we found our own way into the Souk. We went into one shop where they sold Argon oil. We were then invited to have some tea whilst we looked a some carpets. Very",
          "I had previously read reveiwes that Casablanva Medina is not very interesting and I confirm it. There are alleyways filled with small shops alll selling cheap Chinese stuff. The only reason to wander in the Medina is to get a sence of the original life in Casablanca and if",

          "I visited the Medina twice, and bought some wooden souvenirs and also some 18k gold jewelry. Merchants were less aggressive than I expected. There is a huge variety of items from which to choose! They also sell luggage if you buy more than you thought you would.",
          "We walked from our hotel to medina and the famous mosque. It was clean, nobody bothering us, just honking for the tourists...hehehe!",
          "We had a good time. It was a nice walk through the medina of Casablanca. I loved the small streets and old doors that we saw while walking.",
          "Medinas in Morocco are a must see for travellers. Do not miss your opportunity to visit this one. We really liked it.",
          "Looking for a market, this was quite the one. Big, a lot of clothes, glasses, watches etc. But once getting through the facade of the tourist stuff, you pass the pushy sales and touristy things to the daily market life of these people. Chicken, sheep butchers in the street,",
          "Initially we walked through the area early on a Saturday morning - not much activity - however on our return a couple of hours later the Medina had come alive. Starting off slowly the stream of enthusiastic buyers built up to a crescendo. All i wanted to do was take photos -",
          "Wow the old medina is Casablanca in its best and worst days. High end to extreme poverty. A huge shopping bazzar, oppressed people, and traditional Islamic values. A good portrait of Moroccan culture after the ravages of European influence, and separation of wealth. You can",
          "I prefer the medina in Marrakech or Fez over this one in Casablanca. The stores in all of them are quite typical but this medina just does not seem to be as attractive and also smaller. I went there because my hotel was nearby otherwise I do not think it is worth to make a",
          "Old Medina of Casablanca fill of a lot of hotels and the old market for clothes, laser, fruits, vegetables, and many other things, and there are some bazaars around, and there are many restaurants and coffee shops, and nice in the night.",
          "If you going to other cities in Morocco then do not go to this medina. It was dirty and no were as pleasant as the one we visited in radat, asileah, or Chefchaouen . In the later town I mentioned the general area was clean and the merchant helpful not pushy.",
          "This place was very dirty, much too much aggressive behavior from some of the vendors. The items for sale were not appealing. I would check it out for the experience only.",
          "A large marketplace with stores and stalls selling everything in cramped places and buzzing with locals. But messy, smelly and dirty. If you're Ok with that, you'll enjoy it. Interesting for the culture seekers.",
          "No visit to Casablanca is worth it without a trip to the Medina. I love the hustle and bustle and the haggling for goods. Vendors are friendly and there are always nice bags and clothing items on sale. Ice been many times and just can't stay away.",
          "A opportunity to get to see the old part of casablanca ..it's back end alleyways which lead into markets,they hold a few gems and will require sharp bartering skills as the marketeers will leave you empty of pocket ...but in essence a good experience for the adventurer in you",
          "Nice place, old but very nice, it's great to see places that are historical and different looking. I and my family absolutely loved it. A must see place.",
          "I set off a little early at first (9am) and the place was just beginning to come alive. Passed back through at 2pm and what a change. A hustling, bustling vibrant but a little shabby place. I felt completely safe.",
          "If one is interested in strolling around in old streets, this place to be visited. It is also good for shopping.",
          "This place was so busy people and stalls everywhere. Some sellers were a little annoying e.g followed us around after a sale we didn't want, but overall it was a great experience.",
          "It's quite a small souk but pleasant. A good preparation for the souk in Marrakech where one really needs to be assertive in haggling for goods. The medina feels friendly.",
          "Unless you do not have a chance to go to Fes or Marrakech, do not bother with the Medina in Casablanca. It has not been maintained and is old and dirty.",
          "The setting and the architecture is truly unique. I believe that this is the second largest mosque in the World and most of it is built into the sea.",
          "Prices are High. You better start with half for negotiations. Alot of men and women clothing shops. Check on quality. A number of souvenirs shops as well.",
          "The otantic side of Casablanca. I loved here. You should bargain before your shopping. It is a little bir dirty but it makes it also otantic.",
          "This is a real tourists trap, however a positive trap with lots of oriental things to buy. The bargain is a must and prices can be lowered sometimes by 50%. The market has also plenty of Chinese fakes of all the big brands.",
          "It needs a clean up for sure,for a first world person to go a place that smell's,is dirty,freshly slaughtered sheep are being butchered right there and then.Give the impression you have been there before if its your first time or you'll pay a fortune for cheap imports and won't",

          "It's nice to see u can have an idea about the old Casablanca about the old houses , shops and those small streets .. keep away from doggy streets .. good place for shopping .. would be nice to have someone from the city to be with u friend or guide"

Located in the central-western part of Morocco bordering the Atlantic Ocean, it is the largest city in the Maghreb region and the eighth-largest in the Arab world. Casablanca is Morocco's chief port and one of the largest financial centers in Africa. According to the 2019 population estimate, the city has a population of about 3.71 million in the urban area and over 4.27 million in the Greater Casablanca. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center of Morocco, although the national political capital is Rabat.\nThe leading Moroccan companies and many international corporations doing business in the country have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca holds its recorded position as the primary industrial zone of the nation. The Port of Casablanca is one of the largest artificial ports in the world, and the second largest port of North Africa, after Tanger-Med 40 km (25 mi) east of Tangier. Casablanca also hosts the primary naval base for the Royal Moroccan Navy.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe original name of Casablanca was Anfa (Neo-Tifinagh: \u2d30\u2d4f\u2d3c\u2d30), in Berber language, by at least the seventh century BC. After the Portuguese took control of the city in the 15th century AD, they rebuilt it, changing the name to Casa Branca ([kaz\u0250'b\u027e\u0250\u0303k\u0250]), meaning 'white house' in Portuguese. The present name, which is the Spanish version (pronounced [ka\u0320sa\u0320\u02c8\u03b2\u031ela\u0320\u014bka\u0320]), came when the Kingdom of Portugal came under Spanish control through the Iberian Union. During the French protectorate in Morocco, the name remained Casablanca (pronounced [kazabl\u0251\u0303ka]). In 1755 an earthquake destroyed most of the town. It was rebuilt by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah who changed the name into the local Arabic Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101' (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), although occasionally \"Casablanca\" is written in Arabic (\u0643\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0627, K\u0101z\u0101bl\u0101nk\u0101). The city is still nicknamed Casa by many locals and outsiders to the city. In many other cities with a different dialect, it is called Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101, instead.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by Berbers by at least the seventh century BC. It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans. In his book Description of Africa, Leo Africanus refers to ancient Casablanca as \"Anfa\", a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of Barghawata in 744 AD. He believed Anfa was the most \"prosperous city on the Atlantic Coast because of its fertile land.\" Barghawata rose as an independent state around this time, and continued until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1068. Following the defeat of the Barghawata in the 12th century, Arab tribes of Hilal and Sulaym descent settled in the region, mixing with the local Berbers, which led to widespread Arabization. During the 14th century, under the Merinids, Anfa rose in importance as a port. The last of the Merinids were ousted by a popular revolt in 1465.\n\n\n=== Portuguese conquest and Spanish influence ===\n\nIn the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers, leading to it being targeted by the Portuguese, who bombarded the town which led to its destruction in 1468. The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a military fortress in 1515. The town that grew up around it was called Casa Branca, meaning \"white house\" in Portuguese.\nBetween 1580 and 1640, the Crown of Portugal was integrated to the Crown of Spain, so Casablanca and all other areas occupied by the Portuguese were under Spanish control, though maintaining an autonomous Portuguese administration. As Portugal broke ties with Spain in 1640, Casablanca came under fully Portuguese control once again. The Europeans eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 following an earthquake which destroyed most of the town.The town was finally reconstructed by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah (1756\u20131790), the grandson of Moulay Ismail and an ally of George Washington, with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called ad-D\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02bc (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), the Arabic translation of the Portuguese Casa Branca.\n\n\n=== Colonial struggle ===\nIn the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in Britain and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing gunpowder tea, used in Morocco's national drink, mint tea). By the 1860s, around 5,000 residents were there, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s. Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of French colonialists in 1906. By 1921, this rose to 110,000, largely through the development of shanty towns.\n\n\n=== French rule and influence ===\n\nThe Treaty of Algeciras of 1906 formalized French preeminence in Morocco and included three measures that directly impacted Casablanca: that French officers would control operations at the customs office and seize revenue as collateral for loans given by France, that the French holding company La Compagnie Marocaine would develop the port of Casablanca, and that a French-and-Spanish-trained police force would be assembled to patrol the port.To build the port's breakwater, narrow-gauge track was laid in June 1907 for a small Decauville locomotive to connect the port to a quarry in Roches Noires, passing through the sacred Sidi Belyout graveyard. In resistance to this and the measures of the 1906 Treaty of Algeciras, tribesmen of the Chaouia attacked the locomotive, killing 9 Compagnie Marocaine laborers\u20143 French, 3 Italians, and 3 Spanish.In response, the French bombarded the city with multiple gunboats and landed troops inside the town, causing severe damage and 15,000 dead and wounded. In the immediate aftermath of the bombardment and the deployment of French troops, the European homes and the Mellah, or Jewish quarter, were sacked, and the latter was also set ablaze.The bombardment and military invasion of the city effectively began the French military conquest of Morocco, although French control of Casablanca was not formalized until the French Protectorat was established by the Treaty of Fes March 1912.\nGeneral Hubert Lyautey assigned the planning of the new colonial port city to Henri Prost. As he did in other Moroccan cities, Prost designed a European ville nouvelle outside the walls of the medina. In Casablanca, he also designed a new \"ville indig\u00e8ne\" to house Moroccans arriving from other cities.Europeans formed almost half the population of Casablanca.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAfter Philippe P\u00e9tain of France signed the armistice with the Nazis, he ordered French troops in France's colonial empire to defend French territory against any aggressors\u2014Allied or otherwise\u2014applying a policy of \"asymmetrical neutrality\" in favor of the Germans. French colonists in Morocco generally supported P\u00e9tain, while politically conscious Moroccans tended to favor de Gaulle and the Allies.Operation Torch, which started on 8 November 1942, was the British-American invasion of French North Africa during the North African campaign of World War II. The Western Task Force, composed of American units led by Major General George S. Patton and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, carried out the invasions of Mehdia, Fedhala, and Asfi. American forces captured Casablanca from Vichy control when France surrendered November 11, 1942, but the Naval Battle of Casablanca continued until American forces sank German submarine U-173 on November 16.Casablanca was the site of the Nouasseur Air Base, a large American air base used as the staging area for all American aircraft for the European Theater of Operations during World War II. The air field has since become Mohammed V International Airport.\n\n\n==== Anfa Conference ====\n\nCasablanca hosted the Anfa Conference (also called the Casablanca Conference) in January 1943. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed the progress of the war. Also in attendance were the Free France generals Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud, though they played minor roles and didn't participate in the military planning.\nIt was at this conference that the Allies adopted the doctrine of \"unconditional surrender,\" meaning that the Axis powers would be fought until their defeat. Roosevelt also met privately with Sultan Muhammad V and expressed his support for Moroccan independence after the war. This became a turning point, as Moroccan nationalists were emboldened to openly seek complete independence.\n\n\n=== Toward independence ===\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting.\nApril 7, 1947, a massacre of working class Moroccans, carried out by Senegalese Tirailleurs in the service of the French colonial army, was instigated just as Sultan Muhammed V was due to make a speech in Tangier appealing for independence.Riots in Casablanca took place from December 7\u20138, 1952, in response to the assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist Farhat Hached by La Main Rouge\u2014the clandestine militant wing of French intelligence. Then, on 25 December 1953 (Christmas Day), Muhammad Zarqtuni orchestrated a bombing of Casablanca's Central Market in response to the forced exile of Sultan Muhammad V and the royal family on August 20 (Eid al-Adha) of that year.\n\n\n=== Since independence ===\nMorocco gained independence from France in 1956.\n\n\n==== Casablanca Group ====\nJanuary 4\u20137, 1961, the city hosted an ensemble of progressive African leaders during the Casablanca Conference of 1961. Among those received by King Muhammad V were Gamal Abd An-Nasser, Kwame Nkrumah, Modibo Ke\u00efta, and Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, Ferhat Abbas.\n\n\n==== Jewish emigration ====\nCasablanca was a major departure point for Jews leaving Morocco through Operation Yachin, an operation conducted by Mossad to secretly migrate Moroccan Jews to Israel between November 1961 and spring 1964.\n\n\n==== 1965 riots ====\nThe 1965 student protests organized by the National Union of Popular Forces-affiliated National Union of Moroccan Students, which spread to cities around the country and devolved into riots, started on March 22, 1965 in front of Lyc\u00e9e Mohammed V in Casablanca. The protests started as a peaceful march to demand the right to public higher education for Morocco, but expanded to include concerns of laborers, the unemployed, and other marginalized segments of society, and devolved into vandalism and rioting. The riots were violently repressed by security forces with tanks and armored vehicles; Moroccan authorities reported a dozen deaths while the UNFP reported more than 1,000.King Hassan II blamed the events on teachers and parents, and declared in a speech to the nation on March 30, 1965: \"There is no greater danger to the State than a so-called intellectual. It would have been better if you were all illiterate.\u201d\n\n\n==== 1981 riots ====\nOn June 6, 1981, the Casablanca Bread Riots took place. Hassan II appointed the French-trained lawyer Driss Basri, who would later become a symbol of the Years of Lead, with quelling the protests. The government stated that 66 people were killed and 100 were injured, while opposition leaders put the number of dead at 637, saying that many of these were killed by police and army gunfire.\n\n\n==== Mudawana ====\nIn March 2000, more than 60 women's groups organized demonstrations in Casablanca proposing reforms to the legal status of women in the country. About 40,000 women attended, calling for a ban on polygamy and the introduction of divorce law (divorce being a purely religious procedure at that time). Although the counter-demonstration attracted half a million participants, the movement for change started in 2000 was influential on King Mohammed VI, and he enacted a new mudawana, or family law, in early 2004, meeting some of the demands of women's rights activists.On 16 May 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a multiple suicide bomb attack carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to al-Qaeda. Twelve suicide bombers struck five locations in the city.Another series of suicide bombings struck the city in early 2007. These events illustrated some of the persistent challenges the city faces in addressing poverty and integrating disadvantaged neighborhoods and populations. One initiative to improve conditions in the city's disadvantaged neighborhoods was the creation of the Sidi Moumen Cultural Center.As calls for reform spread through the Arab world in 2011, Moroccans joined in, but concessions by the ruler led to acceptance. However, in December, thousands of people demonstrated in several parts of the city, especially the city center near la Fontaine, desiring more significant political reforms.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCasablanca is located on the Atlantic coast of the Chaouia Plains which have historically been the breadbasket of Morocco. Apart from the Atlantic coast, the Bouskoura forest is the only natural attraction in the city. The forest was planted in the 20th century and consists mostly of eucalyptus, palm, and pine trees. It is located halfway to the city's international airport. \nThe only watercourse in Casablanca is oued Bouskoura, a small seasonal creek that until 1912 reached the Atlantic Ocean near the actual port. Most of oued Bouskoura's bed has been covered due to urbanization and only the part south of El Jadida road can now be seen. The closest permanent river to Casablanca is Oum Rabia, 70 km (43.50 mi) to the south-east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCasablanca has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). The cool Canary Current off the Atlantic coast moderates temperature variation, which results in a climate remarkably similar to that of coastal Los Angeles, with similar temperature ranges. The city has an annual average of 72 days with significant precipitation, which amounts to 412 mm (16.2 in) per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) and \u22122.7 \u00b0C (27.1 \u00b0F), respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is 178 mm (7.0 in) on 30 November 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Grand Casablanca region is considered the locomotive of the development of the Moroccan economy. It attracts 32% of the country's production units and 56% of industrial labor. The region uses 30% of the national electricity production. With MAD 93 billion, the region contributes to 44% of the industrial production of the kingdom. About 33% of national industrial exports, MAD 27 billion, comes from the Grand Casablanca; 30% of the Moroccan banking network is concentrated in Casablanca.One of the most important Casablancan exports is phosphate. Other industries include fishing, fish canning, sawmills, furniture production, building materials, glass, textiles, electronics, leather work, processed food, spirits, soft drinks, and cigarettes.The Casablanca and Mohammedia seaports activity represent 50% of the international commercial flows of Morocco. Almost the entire Casablanca waterfront is under development, mainly the construction of huge entertainment centres between the port and Hassan II Mosque, the Anfa Resort project near the business, entertainment and living centre of Megarama, the shopping and entertainment complex of Morocco Mall, as well as a complete renovation of the coastal walkway. The Sindbad park is planned to be totally renewed with rides, games and entertainment services.Royal Air Maroc has its head office at the Casablanca-Anfa Airport. In 2004, it announced that it was moving its head office from Casablanca to a location in Province of Nouaceur, close to Mohammed V International Airport. The agreement to build the head office in Nouaceur was signed in 2009.The biggest CBD of Casablanca and Maghreb is in the North of the town in Sidi Maarouf near the mosque of Hassan II and the biggest project of skycrapers of Maghreb and Africa Casablanca Marina.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nCasablanca is a commune, part of the region of Casablanca-Settat. The commune is divided into eight districts or prefectures, which are themselves divided into 16 subdivisions or arrondissements and one municipality. The districts and their subdivisions are:\nA\u00efn Chock (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642) \u2013 A\u00efn Chock (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642)\nA\u00efn Seba\u00e2 - Hay Mohammadi (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a) \u2013 A\u00efn Seba\u00e2 (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639), Hay Mohammadi (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a), Roches Noires (\u0631\u0648\u0634 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631).\nAnfa (\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627) \u2013 Anfa (\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627), Ma\u00e2rif (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0641), Sidi Belyout (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0637).\nBen M'Sick (\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643) \u2013 Ben M'Sick (\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643), Sbata (\u0633\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647).\nSidi Bernoussi (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0635\u064a) \u2013 Sidi Bernoussi (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0635\u064a), Sidi Moumen (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0645\u0646).\nAl Fida - Mers Sultan (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u2013 \u0645\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646) \u2013 Al Fida (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621); Mechouar (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0648\u0631) (municipality), Mers Sultan (\u0645\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646).\nHay Hassani (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a) \u2013 Hay Hassani (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a).\nMoulay Rachid (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f) \u2013 Moulay Rachid (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f), Sidi Othmane (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646).\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nThe list of neighborhoods is indicative and not complete:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe commune of Casablanca recorded a population of 3,359,818 in the 2014 Moroccan census. About 98% live in urban areas. Around 25% of them are under 15 and 9% are over 60 years old. The population of the city is about 11% of the total population of Morocco. Grand Casablanca is also the largest urban area in the Maghreb. 99.9% of the population of Morocco are Arab and Berber Muslims.\nDuring the French protectorate in Morocco, European Christians formed almost half the population of Casablanca. Since independence in 1956, the European population has decreased substantially.The city also is still home for a small community of Moroccan Christians, as well as a small group of foreign resident Roman Catholics.\n\n\n=== Judaism in Casablanca ===\nJews have a long history in Casablanca. A Sephardic Jewish community was in Anfa up to the destruction of the city by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750, the Rabbi Elijah Synagogue was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.Approximately 28,000 Moroccan Jews immigrated to the State of Israel between 1948 and 1951, many through Casablanca. Casablanca then became a departure point in Operation Yachin, the covert Mossad-organized migration operation from 1961\u20131964. In 2018 only 2,500 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca, while according to the World Jewish Congress only 1,000 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca.Today, the Jewish cemetery of Casablanca is one of the major cemeteries of the city, and many synagogues remain in service, but the city's Jewish community has dwindled. The Moroccan Jewish Museum is a museum established in the city in 1997.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nPublic: University of Hassan II Casablanca\nPrivate:\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Mundiapolis\nUniversit\u00e9 Internationale de Casablanca\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nInternational schools:\n\nBelgium: \u00c9cole Belge de Casablanca\nFrench:\nColl\u00e8ge Anatole France\nLyc\u00e9e Lyautey\nGroupe Scolaire Louis Massignon\nLyc\u00e9e La R\u00e9sidence\nLyc\u00e9e Ma\u00efmonide (FR)\nLyc\u00e9e L\u00e9on l'Africain\n\u00c9cole Normale H\u00e9bra\u00efque\n\u00c9cole Al Jabr\nItalian: Scuola \"Enrico Mattei\"\nSpanish: Instituto Espa\u00f1ol Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez\nAmerican:\nCasablanca American School\nAmerican Academy Casablanca\nGeorge Washington Academy\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nMost of the city's places of worship are Muslim mosques.

Raja's symbol is an eagle and Wydad's symbol is a star and crescent which means a symbol of Islam. These two popular clubs have produced some of Morocco's best players, such as: Salaheddine Bassir, Abdelmajid Dolmy, Baddou Zaki, Aziz Bouderbala, and Noureddine Naybet. Other football teams on top of these two major teams based in the city of Casablanca include Rachad Bernoussi, TAS de Casablanca, Majd Al Madina, and Racing Casablanca.\n\n\n=== Tennis ===\nCasablanca hosts The Grand Prix Hassan II, a professional men's tennis tournament of the ATP tour.

Morocco was scheduled to host the 2015 African Nations Cup, but decided to decline due to Ebola fears. Morocco was expelled and the tournament was held in Equatorial Guinea.\n\n\n==== Venues ====\nStade Larbi Zaouli\nStade Mohamed V\nStade Sidi Bernoussi\nComplexe Al Amal de CasablancaThe Grand Stade de Casablanca is the proposed title of the planned football stadium to be built in the city. Once completed in 2014, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of Raja Casablanca, Wydad Casablanca, and the Morocco national football team. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 93,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the Stade Mohamed V. The initial idea of the stadium was for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to South Africa. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2025. The idea of the stadium was also for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to Canada, Mexico and United States. It is now hoping for the 2030 FIFA World Cup which Morocco is co-bidding with either African neighbors Tunisia and Algeria or two European nations Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nal-Haja al-Hamdawiya, one of the most iconic figures in aita music, was born in Casablanca.

During the French Protectorate, the French government described Casablanca as a \"laboratory of urbanism.\"The work of the Groupe des Architectes Modernes Marocains (GAMMA) on public housing projects\u2014such as Carri\u00e8res Centrales in Hay Mohammadi\u2014in a style described as vernacular modernism influenced modernist architecture around the world.Casam\u00e9moire and MAMMA. are two organizations dedicated to the preservation and appreciation of the city's architectural heritage.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rapid Transit ===\n\nThe Casablanca Tramway is the rapid transit tram system in Casablanca. As of 2019, the network consists of two lines covering 47.5 km (30 mi), with 71 stops; further lines (\u06373 and \u06374) are under construction.Since the 1970s, Casablanca had planned to build a metro system to offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality. However, the city council voted to abandon the metro project in 2014 due to high costs, and decided to continue expanding the already operating tram system instead.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nCasablanca's main airport is Mohammed V International Airport, Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve Marrakech, Rabat, Agadir, Oujda, Tangier, Al Hoceima, and Laayoune, as well as other cities.\nCasablanca is well-served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. New York City, Montreal, Paris, Washington D.C., London and Dubai are important primary destinations.\nThe older, smaller Casablanca-Anfa Airport to the west of the city, served certain destinations including Damascus, and Tunis, and was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It has been closed and destroyed to build the \"Casablanca Finance City\", the new heart of the city of Casablanca. Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport is located in the nearby community of Tit Mellil.\n\n\n=== Coach buses ===\nCompagnie de Transports au Maroc (CTM) offers private intercity coach buses on various lines run servicing most notable Moroccan towns, as well as a number of European cities. These run from the CTM Bus Station on Leo Africanus Street near the Central Market in downtown Casablanca. Supratours, an affiliate of ONCF, also offers coach bus service at a slightly lower cost, departing from a station on Wilad Zian Street. There is another bus station farther down on the same street called the Wilad Zian Bus Station; this station is the country's largest bus station, serving over 800 buses daily, catering more to Morocco's lower income population.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nRegistered taxis in Casablanca are coloured red and known as petit taxis (small taxis), or coloured white and known as grands taxis (big taxis). As is standard Moroccan practice, petits taxis, typically small-four door Dacia Logan, Peugeot 207, or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. Grands taxis, generally older Mercedes-Benz sedans, provide shared mini-bus like service within the city on predefined routes, or shared intercity service. Grands taxis may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.\n\n\n=== Trains ===\nCasablanca is served by three main railway stations run by the national rail service, the ONCF.\n\nCasa-Voyageurs is the main intercity station, from which trains run south to Marrakech or El Jadida and north to Mohammedia and Rabat, and then on either to Tangier or Meknes, Fes, Taza and Oujda/Nador. It also serves as the southern terminus of the Al-Boraq high speed line from Tangier. A dedicated airport shuttle service to Mohammed V International Airport also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.\n\nCasa-Port serves primarily commuter trains such as the Train Navette Rapide (TNR or Aouita) operating on the Casablanca \u2013 Kenitra rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark Casablanca Twin Center. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction, the station is still operational. From 2013, it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the city's new tram network.\nCasa-Oasis was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early 21st century, and officially reopened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern intercity train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to intercity standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nAlthough Mohammed V International Airport receives most international flights into Morocco, international tourism in Casablanca is not as developed as it is in cities like Marrakesh. Casablanca, however, attracts fewer tourists than those of cities such as Fes and Marrakech. \nThe Hassan II Mosque, which is the second largest mosque in Africa and the seventh largest in the world, is the city's main tourist attraction. Visitors also come to see the city's rich architectural heritage.Popular sites for national tourism include shopping centers such as Morocco Mall, Anfa Place, the Marina Shopping Center, and the Tachfine Center. Additional sites include the Corniche and the beach of Ain Diab, and parks such as the Arab League Park or the Sindibad theme park.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAmal Ayouch (born 1966) \u2013 stage and film actress\nSalaheddine Bassir \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nLaarbi Batma \u2013 Moroccan musician and artist, founding member of Nas El Ghiwan\nLarbi Benbarek \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMiriem Bensalah-Chaqroun \u2013 Moroccan businesswoman\nJean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes \u2013 French footballer\nFrida Boccara \u2013 French singer, Winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 1969\nMerieme Chadid \u2013 Moroccan astronomer\nSoufiane Choubani \u2013 Founder of the Moroccan National Debate Team\nJean-Charles de Castelbajac \u2013 French fashion designer\nDizzy DROS \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nGad Elmaleh \u2013 French/Canadian comedian\nLa Fouine \u2013 Moroccan-French rapper\nEl Haqed \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nSerge Haroche \u2013 French physicist who was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physics\nShatha Hassoun \u2013 Moroccan/Iraqi singer\nLydia Hatuel-Czuckermann \u2013 Israeli Olympic fencer\nHicham Mesbahi \u2013 Moroccan boxer\nFrench Montana \u2013 American rapper\nNawal El Moutawakel \u2013 Olympic champion\nNoureddine Naybet \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMostafa Nissaboury \u2013 Moroccan poet\nHakim Noury \u2013 Moroccan film director\nMaurice Ohana \u2013 French composer\nJean Reno \u2013 French Hollywood actor\nDaniel Sivan \u2013 professor\nAlain Souchon \u2013 French songwriter\nFrank Stephenson \u2013 award-winning automobile designer\nHassan Saada \u2013 Moroccan boxer arrested for alleged rape before Olympic match\nSidney Taurel \u2013 naturalized American CEO of Eli Lilly and Company from 1998 to 2008\nRichard Virenque \u2013 French cyclist\nMuhammad Zarqtuni \u2013 Moroccan nationalist and resistance leader\nAbdallah Zrika \u2013 Moroccan poet\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe 1942 film Casablanca (starring Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart) is supposed to have been set in Casablanca, although it was filmed entirely in Los Angeles and doesn't feature a single Arab or North African character with a speaking role. The film depicts Casablanca as the scene of power struggle between various foreign powers, which had much more to do with the Tangier of the time. The film has achieved worldwide popularity since its release. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, it won three, including Best Picture.\nA Night in Casablanca (1946) was the 12th Marx Brothers' movie. The film stars Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, and Harpo Marx. It was directed by Archie Mayo and written by Joseph Fields and Roland Kibbee. The film contains the song \"Who's Sorry Now?\", with music by Ted Snyder and lyrics by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. It is sung in French by Lisette Verea playing the part of Beatrice Rheiner, and then later sung in English. Liszt's \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\" is played twice, once by Chico on piano as an introduction to the \"Beer Barrel Polka\", and again by Harpo on the harp.\nThe city is featured in The Mysterious Caravan (1975), volume 54 in the original Hardy Boys series.\nCasablanca is the setting for several chapters in Doubleshot, a 2000 James Bond novel by Raymond Benson. In the novel, one of the characters mentions that the 1942 film was shot in Hollywood and not on location.\nCasablanca is one of the key locations in the 2006 video game Dreamfall, as it is where the primary protagonist of the game, Zo\u00eb Castillo, lives. Although the city is imagined in the year 2219, much of the present-day architecture is used for inspiration.\nCasablanca is the setting for the first act of the 2016 World War II romantic thriller film Allied starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nCasablanca is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nRabat Zoo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site of Casablanca\nOfficial Casablanca Tourism Website (in French)\nCasablanca photo gallery (buildings and other landmarks with a history dating back to the French Protectorate)\nOpen Air Museum of 20th century architecture\n Geographic data related to Casablanca at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "Casablanca (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621\u200e, romanized: ad-d\u0101r al-bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02be; Berber languages: \u2d30\u2d4f\u2d3c\u2d30, romanized: anfa) is the largest city of Morocco. Located in the central-western part of Morocco bordering the Atlantic Ocean, it is the largest city in the Maghreb region and the eighth-largest in the Arab world. Casablanca is Morocco's chief port and one of the largest financial centers in Africa. According to the 2019 population estimate, the city has a population of about 3.71 million in the urban area and over 4.27 million in the Greater Casablanca. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center of Morocco, although the national political capital is Rabat.\nThe leading Moroccan companies and many international corporations doing business in the country have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca holds its recorded position as the primary industrial zone of the nation. The Port of Casablanca is one of the largest artificial ports in the world, and the second largest port of North Africa, after Tanger-Med 40 km (25 mi) east of Tangier. Casablanca also hosts the primary naval base for the Royal Moroccan Navy.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe original name of Casablanca was Anfa (Neo-Tifinagh: \u2d30\u2d4f\u2d3c\u2d30), in Berber language, by at least the seventh century BC. After the Portuguese took control of the city in the 15th century AD, they rebuilt it, changing the name to Casa Branca ([kaz\u0250'b\u027e\u0250\u0303k\u0250]), meaning 'white house' in Portuguese. The present name, which is the Spanish version (pronounced [ka\u0320sa\u0320\u02c8\u03b2\u031ela\u0320\u014bka\u0320]), came when the Kingdom of Portugal came under Spanish control through the Iberian Union. During the French protectorate in Morocco, the name remained Casablanca (pronounced [kazabl\u0251\u0303ka]). In 1755 an earthquake destroyed most of the town. It was rebuilt by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah who changed the name into the local Arabic Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101' (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), although occasionally \"Casablanca\" is written in Arabic (\u0643\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0627, K\u0101z\u0101bl\u0101nk\u0101). The city is still nicknamed Casa by many locals and outsiders to the city. In many other cities with a different dialect, it is called Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101, instead.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by Berbers by at least the seventh century BC. It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans. In his book Description of Africa, Leo Africanus refers to ancient Casablanca as \"Anfa\", a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of Barghawata in 744 AD. He believed Anfa was the most \"prosperous city on the Atlantic Coast because of its fertile land.\" Barghawata rose as an independent state around this time, and continued until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1068. Following the defeat of the Barghawata in the 12th century, Arab tribes of Hilal and Sulaym descent settled in the region, mixing with the local Berbers, which led to widespread Arabization. During the 14th century, under the Merinids, Anfa rose in importance as a port. The last of the Merinids were ousted by a popular revolt in 1465.\n\n\n=== Portuguese conquest and Spanish influence ===\n\nIn the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers, leading to it being targeted by the Portuguese, who bombarded the town which led to its destruction in 1468. The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a military fortress in 1515. The town that grew up around it was called Casa Branca, meaning \"white house\" in Portuguese.\nBetween 1580 and 1640, the Crown of Portugal was integrated to the Crown of Spain, so Casablanca and all other areas occupied by the Portuguese were under Spanish control, though maintaining an autonomous Portuguese administration. As Portugal broke ties with Spain in 1640, Casablanca came under fully Portuguese control once again. The Europeans eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 following an earthquake which destroyed most of the town.The town was finally reconstructed by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah (1756\u20131790), the grandson of Moulay Ismail and an ally of George Washington, with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called ad-D\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02bc (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), the Arabic translation of the Portuguese Casa Branca.\n\n\n=== Colonial struggle ===\nIn the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in Britain and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing gunpowder tea, used in Morocco's national drink, mint tea). By the 1860s, around 5,000 residents were there, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s. Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of French colonialists in 1906. By 1921, this rose to 110,000, largely through the development of shanty towns.\n\n\n=== French rule and influence ===\n\nThe Treaty of Algeciras of 1906 formalized French preeminence in Morocco and included three measures that directly impacted Casablanca: that French officers would control operations at the customs office and seize revenue as collateral for loans given by France, that the French holding company La Compagnie Marocaine would develop the port of Casablanca, and that a French-and-Spanish-trained police force would be assembled to patrol the port.To build the port's breakwater, narrow-gauge track was laid in June 1907 for a small Decauville locomotive to connect the port to a quarry in Roches Noires, passing through the sacred Sidi Belyout graveyard. In resistance to this and the measures of the 1906 Treaty of Algeciras, tribesmen of the Chaouia attacked the locomotive, killing 9 Compagnie Marocaine laborers\u20143 French, 3 Italians, and 3 Spanish.In response, the French bombarded the city with multiple gunboats and landed troops inside the town, causing severe damage and 15,000 dead and wounded. In the immediate aftermath of the bombardment and the deployment of French troops, the European homes and the Mellah, or Jewish quarter, were sacked, and the latter was also set ablaze.The bombardment and military invasion of the city effectively began the French military conquest of Morocco, although French control of Casablanca was not formalized until the French Protectorat was established by the Treaty of Fes March 1912.\nGeneral Hubert Lyautey assigned the planning of the new colonial port city to Henri Prost. As he did in other Moroccan cities, Prost designed a European ville nouvelle outside the walls of the medina. In Casablanca, he also designed a new \"ville indig\u00e8ne\" to house Moroccans arriving from other cities.Europeans formed almost half the population of Casablanca.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAfter Philippe P\u00e9tain of France signed the armistice with the Nazis, he ordered French troops in France's colonial empire to defend French territory against any aggressors\u2014Allied or otherwise\u2014applying a policy of \"asymmetrical neutrality\" in favor of the Germans. French colonists in Morocco generally supported P\u00e9tain, while politically conscious Moroccans tended to favor de Gaulle and the Allies.Operation Torch, which started on 8 November 1942, was the British-American invasion of French North Africa during the North African campaign of World War II. The Western Task Force, composed of American units led by Major General George S. Patton and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, carried out the invasions of Mehdia, Fedhala, and Asfi. American forces captured Casablanca from Vichy control when France surrendered November 11, 1942, but the Naval Battle of Casablanca continued until American forces sank German submarine U-173 on November 16.Casablanca was the site of the Nouasseur Air Base, a large American air base used as the staging area for all American aircraft for the European Theater of Operations during World War II. The air field has since become Mohammed V International Airport.\n\n\n==== Anfa Conference ====\n\nCasablanca hosted the Anfa Conference (also called the Casablanca Conference) in January 1943. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed the progress of the war. Also in attendance were the Free France generals Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud, though they played minor roles and didn't participate in the military planning.\nIt was at this conference that the Allies adopted the doctrine of \"unconditional surrender,\" meaning that the Axis powers would be fought until their defeat. Roosevelt also met privately with Sultan Muhammad V and expressed his support for Moroccan independence after the war. This became a turning point, as Moroccan nationalists were emboldened to openly seek complete independence.\n\n\n=== Toward independence ===\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting.\nApril 7, 1947, a massacre of working class Moroccans, carried out by Senegalese Tirailleurs in the service of the French colonial army, was instigated just as Sultan Muhammed V was due to make a speech in Tangier appealing for independence.Riots in Casablanca took place from December 7\u20138, 1952, in response to the assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist Farhat Hached by La Main Rouge\u2014the clandestine militant wing of French intelligence. Then, on 25 December 1953 (Christmas Day), Muhammad Zarqtuni orchestrated a bombing of Casablanca's Central Market in response to the forced exile of Sultan Muhammad V and the royal family on August 20 (Eid al-Adha) of that year.\n\n\n=== Since independence ===\nMorocco gained independence from France in 1956.\n\n\n==== Casablanca Group ====\nJanuary 4\u20137, 1961, the city hosted an ensemble of progressive African leaders during the Casablanca Conference of 1961. Among those received by King Muhammad V were Gamal Abd An-Nasser, Kwame Nkrumah, Modibo Ke\u00efta, and Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, Ferhat Abbas.\n\n\n==== Jewish emigration ====\nCasablanca was a major departure point for Jews leaving Morocco through Operation Yachin, an operation conducted by Mossad to secretly migrate Moroccan Jews to Israel between November 1961 and spring 1964.\n\n\n==== 1965 riots ====\nThe 1965 student protests organized by the National Union of Popular Forces-affiliated National Union of Moroccan Students, which spread to cities around the country and devolved into riots, started on March 22, 1965 in front of Lyc\u00e9e Mohammed V in Casablanca. The protests started as a peaceful march to demand the right to public higher education for Morocco, but expanded to include concerns of laborers, the unemployed, and other marginalized segments of society, and devolved into vandalism and rioting. The riots were violently repressed by security forces with tanks and armored vehicles; Moroccan authorities reported a dozen deaths while the UNFP reported more than 1,000.King Hassan II blamed the events on teachers and parents, and declared in a speech to the nation on March 30, 1965: \"There is no greater danger to the State than a so-called intellectual. It would have been better if you were all illiterate.\u201d\n\n\n==== 1981 riots ====\nOn June 6, 1981, the Casablanca Bread Riots took place. Hassan II appointed the French-trained lawyer Driss Basri, who would later become a symbol of the Years of Lead, with quelling the protests. The government stated that 66 people were killed and 100 were injured, while opposition leaders put the number of dead at 637, saying that many of these were killed by police and army gunfire.\n\n\n==== Mudawana ====\nIn March 2000, more than 60 women's groups organized demonstrations in Casablanca proposing reforms to the legal status of women in the country. About 40,000 women attended, calling for a ban on polygamy and the introduction of divorce law (divorce being a purely religious procedure at that time). Although the counter-demonstration attracted half a million participants, the movement for change started in 2000 was influential on King Mohammed VI, and he enacted a new mudawana, or family law, in early 2004, meeting some of the demands of women's rights activists.On 16 May 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a multiple suicide bomb attack carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to al-Qaeda. Twelve suicide bombers struck five locations in the city.Another series of suicide bombings struck the city in early 2007. These events illustrated some of the persistent challenges the city faces in addressing poverty and integrating disadvantaged neighborhoods and populations. One initiative to improve conditions in the city's disadvantaged neighborhoods was the creation of the Sidi Moumen Cultural Center.As calls for reform spread through the Arab world in 2011, Moroccans joined in, but concessions by the ruler led to acceptance. However, in December, thousands of people demonstrated in several parts of the city, especially the city center near la Fontaine, desiring more significant political reforms.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCasablanca is located on the Atlantic coast of the Chaouia Plains which have historically been the breadbasket of Morocco. Apart from the Atlantic coast, the Bouskoura forest is the only natural attraction in the city. The forest was planted in the 20th century and consists mostly of eucalyptus, palm, and pine trees. It is located halfway to the city's international airport. \nThe only watercourse in Casablanca is oued Bouskoura, a small seasonal creek that until 1912 reached the Atlantic Ocean near the actual port. Most of oued Bouskoura's bed has been covered due to urbanization and only the part south of El Jadida road can now be seen. The closest permanent river to Casablanca is Oum Rabia, 70 km (43.50 mi) to the south-east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCasablanca has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). The cool Canary Current off the Atlantic coast moderates temperature variation, which results in a climate remarkably similar to that of coastal Los Angeles, with similar temperature ranges. The city has an annual average of 72 days with significant precipitation, which amounts to 412 mm (16.2 in) per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) and \u22122.7 \u00b0C (27.1 \u00b0F), respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is 178 mm (7.0 in) on 30 November 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Grand Casablanca region is considered the locomotive of the development of the Moroccan economy. It attracts 32% of the country's production units and 56% of industrial labor. The region uses 30% of the national electricity production. With MAD 93 billion, the region contributes to 44% of the industrial production of the kingdom. About 33% of national industrial exports, MAD 27 billion, comes from the Grand Casablanca; 30% of the Moroccan banking network is concentrated in Casablanca.One of the most important Casablancan exports is phosphate. Other industries include fishing, fish canning, sawmills, furniture production, building materials, glass, textiles, electronics, leather work, processed food, spirits, soft drinks, and cigarettes.The Casablanca and Mohammedia seaports activity represent 50% of the international commercial flows of Morocco. Almost the entire Casablanca waterfront is under development, mainly the construction of huge entertainment centres between the port and Hassan II Mosque, the Anfa Resort project near the business, entertainment and living centre of Megarama, the shopping and entertainment complex of Morocco Mall, as well as a complete renovation of the coastal walkway. The Sindbad park is planned to be totally renewed with rides, games and entertainment services.Royal Air Maroc has its head office at the Casablanca-Anfa Airport. In 2004, it announced that it was moving its head office from Casablanca to a location in Province of Nouaceur, close to Mohammed V International Airport. The agreement to build the head office in Nouaceur was signed in 2009.The biggest CBD of Casablanca and Maghreb is in the North of the town in Sidi Maarouf near the mosque of Hassan II and the biggest project of skycrapers of Maghreb and Africa Casablanca Marina.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nCasablanca is a commune, part of the region of Casablanca-Settat. The commune is divided into eight districts or prefectures, which are themselves divided into 16 subdivisions or arrondissements and one municipality. The districts and their subdivisions are:\nA\u00efn Chock (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642) \u2013 A\u00efn Chock (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642)\nA\u00efn Seba\u00e2 - Hay Mohammadi (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a) \u2013 A\u00efn Seba\u00e2 (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639), Hay Mohammadi (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a), Roches Noires (\u0631\u0648\u0634 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631).\nAnfa (\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627) \u2013 Anfa (\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627), Ma\u00e2rif (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0641), Sidi Belyout (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0637).\nBen M'Sick (\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643) \u2013 Ben M'Sick (\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643), Sbata (\u0633\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647).\nSidi Bernoussi (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0635\u064a) \u2013 Sidi Bernoussi (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0635\u064a), Sidi Moumen (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0645\u0646).\nAl Fida - Mers Sultan (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u2013 \u0645\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646) \u2013 Al Fida (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621); Mechouar (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0648\u0631) (municipality), Mers Sultan (\u0645\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646).\nHay Hassani (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a) \u2013 Hay Hassani (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a).\nMoulay Rachid (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f) \u2013 Moulay Rachid (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f), Sidi Othmane (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646).\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nThe list of neighborhoods is indicative and not complete:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe commune of Casablanca recorded a population of 3,359,818 in the 2014 Moroccan census. About 98% live in urban areas. Around 25% of them are under 15 and 9% are over 60 years old. The population of the city is about 11% of the total population of Morocco. Grand Casablanca is also the largest urban area in the Maghreb. 99.9% of the population of Morocco are Arab and Berber Muslims.\nDuring the French protectorate in Morocco, European Christians formed almost half the population of Casablanca. Since independence in 1956, the European population has decreased substantially.The city also is still home for a small community of Moroccan Christians, as well as a small group of foreign resident Roman Catholics.\n\n\n=== Judaism in Casablanca ===\nJews have a long history in Casablanca. A Sephardic Jewish community was in Anfa up to the destruction of the city by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750, the Rabbi Elijah Synagogue was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.Approximately 28,000 Moroccan Jews immigrated to the State of Israel between 1948 and 1951, many through Casablanca. Casablanca then became a departure point in Operation Yachin, the covert Mossad-organized migration operation from 1961\u20131964. In 2018 only 2,500 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca, while according to the World Jewish Congress only 1,000 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca.Today, the Jewish cemetery of Casablanca is one of the major cemeteries of the city, and many synagogues remain in service, but the city's Jewish community has dwindled. The Moroccan Jewish Museum is a museum established in the city in 1997.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nPublic: University of Hassan II Casablanca\nPrivate:\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Mundiapolis\nUniversit\u00e9 Internationale de Casablanca\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nInternational schools:\n\nBelgium: \u00c9cole Belge de Casablanca\nFrench:\nColl\u00e8ge Anatole France\nLyc\u00e9e Lyautey\nGroupe Scolaire Louis Massignon\nLyc\u00e9e La R\u00e9sidence\nLyc\u00e9e Ma\u00efmonide (FR)\nLyc\u00e9e L\u00e9on l'Africain\n\u00c9cole Normale H\u00e9bra\u00efque\n\u00c9cole Al Jabr\nItalian: Scuola \"Enrico Mattei\"\nSpanish: Instituto Espa\u00f1ol Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez\nAmerican:\nCasablanca American School\nAmerican Academy Casablanca\nGeorge Washington Academy\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nMost of the city's places of worship are Muslim mosques. Some of the city's synagogues, such as Ettedgui Synagogue, also remain. There are also Christian churches; some remain in use \u2014 particularly by the West African migrant community \u2014 while many of the churches built during the colonial period have been repurposed, such as Church of the Sacred Heart.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Association football ===\n\nCasablanca is home to two popular football clubs: Wydad Casablanca and Raja Casablanca\u2014which are rivals. Raja's symbol is an eagle and Wydad's symbol is a star and crescent which means a symbol of Islam. These two popular clubs have produced some of Morocco's best players, such as: Salaheddine Bassir, Abdelmajid Dolmy, Baddou Zaki, Aziz Bouderbala, and Noureddine Naybet. Other football teams on top of these two major teams based in the city of Casablanca include Rachad Bernoussi, TAS de Casablanca, Majd Al Madina, and Racing Casablanca.\n\n\n=== Tennis ===\nCasablanca hosts The Grand Prix Hassan II, a professional men's tennis tournament of the ATP tour. It first began in 1986, and is played on clay courts type at Complexe Al Amal.\nNotable winners of the Hassan II Grand-Prix are Thomas Muster in 1990, Hicham Arazi in 1997, Younes El Aynaoui in 2002, and Stanislas Wawrinka in 2010.\n\n\n=== Hosting ===\nCasablanca staged the 1961 Pan Arab Games, the 1983 Mediterranean Games, and games during the 1988 Africa Cup of Nations. Morocco was scheduled to host the 2015 African Nations Cup, but decided to decline due to Ebola fears. Morocco was expelled and the tournament was held in Equatorial Guinea.\n\n\n==== Venues ====\nStade Larbi Zaouli\nStade Mohamed V\nStade Sidi Bernoussi\nComplexe Al Amal de CasablancaThe Grand Stade de Casablanca is the proposed title of the planned football stadium to be built in the city. Once completed in 2014, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of Raja Casablanca, Wydad Casablanca, and the Morocco national football team. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 93,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the Stade Mohamed V. The initial idea of the stadium was for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to South Africa. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2025. The idea of the stadium was also for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to Canada, Mexico and United States. It is now hoping for the 2030 FIFA World Cup which Morocco is co-bidding with either African neighbors Tunisia and Algeria or two European nations Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nal-Haja al-Hamdawiya, one of the most iconic figures in aita music, was born in Casablanca. Nass El Ghiwane, led by Laarbi Batma, came out of Hay Mohammadi in Casablanca. Abdelhadi Belkhayat and Abdelwahab Doukkali are musicians specializing in traditional Moroccan Arabic popular music.

The Casablanca School\u2014a Modernist art movement and collective including artists such as Farid Belkahia, Mohamed Melihi, and Mohammed Chab\u00e2a\u2014developed out of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts of Casablanca in the late 1960s.The Academy of Traditional Arts, part of the Hassan II Mosque complex, was founded October 31, 2012.L'Uzine is a community-based art and culture space in Casablanca.Rebel Spirit published The Casablanca Guide (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0648\u064a, Le Guide Casablancais) a comic book about life in Casablanca.Sbagha Bagha is a street art festival during which murals are created on the sides of apartment buildings.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\nPostcard companies such as L\u00e9on & L\u00e9vy were active in Casablanca.

With his staged nude postcard photos taken in Casablanca's colonial brothel quarter, Flandrin was also responsible for disseminating the orientalist image of Moroccan women as sexual objects.Casablanca has a thriving street photography scene. Yoriyas is prominent among photographers capturing the economic capital's street scenes, and has attracted international attention.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Casablanca had many movie theaters, such as Cinema Rialto, Cinema Lynx and Cinema Vox\u2014the largest in Africa at the time it was built.The 1942 American film Casablanca is supposedly set in Casablanca and has had a lasting impact on the city's image, though it was filmed entirely in California and doesn't feature a single Moroccan character with a speaking role. Salut Casa! was a propaganda film brandishing France's purported colonial triumph in its mission civilizatrice in the city.Love in Casablanca (1991), starring Abdelkarim Derqaoui and Muna Fettou, is one of the first Moroccan films to deal with Morocco's complex realities and depict life in Casablanca with verisimilitude.

The films Ali Zaoua (2000), Horses of God (2012), and Ghazzia (2017) of Nabil Ayouch\u2014a French director of Moroccan heritage\u2014deal with street crime, terrorism, and social issues in Casablanca, respectively. The events in Meryem Benm'Barek-Alo\u00efsi's 2018 film Sofia revolve around an illegitimate pregnancy in Casablanca. Hicham Lasri and Said Naciri also from Casablanca.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nCasablanca's architecture and urban development are historically significant. The city is home to many notable buildings in a variety of styles, including traditional Moroccan architecture, various colonial architectural styles, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Neo-Mauresque, Streamline Moderne, Modernism, Brutalism, and more. During the French Protectorate, the French government described Casablanca as a \"laboratory of urbanism.\"The work of the Groupe des Architectes Modernes Marocains (GAMMA) on public housing projects\u2014such as Carri\u00e8res Centrales in Hay Mohammadi\u2014in a style described as vernacular modernism influenced modernist architecture around the world.Casam\u00e9moire and MAMMA. are two organizations dedicated to the preservation and appreciation of the city's architectural heritage.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rapid Transit ===\n\nThe Casablanca Tramway is the rapid transit tram system in Casablanca. As of 2019, the network consists of two lines covering 47.5 km (30 mi), with 71 stops; further lines (\u06373 and \u06374) are under construction.Since the 1970s, Casablanca had planned to build a metro system to offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality. However, the city council voted to abandon the metro project in 2014 due to high costs, and decided to continue expanding the already operating tram system instead.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nCasablanca's main airport is Mohammed V International Airport, Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve Marrakech, Rabat, Agadir, Oujda, Tangier, Al Hoceima, and Laayoune, as well as other cities.\nCasablanca is well-served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. New York City, Montreal, Paris, Washington D.C., London and Dubai are important primary destinations.\nThe older, smaller Casablanca-Anfa Airport to the west of the city, served certain destinations including Damascus, and Tunis, and was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It has been closed and destroyed to build the \"Casablanca Finance City\", the new heart of the city of Casablanca. Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport is located in the nearby community of Tit Mellil.\n\n\n=== Coach buses ===\nCompagnie de Transports au Maroc (CTM) offers private intercity coach buses on various lines run servicing most notable Moroccan towns, as well as a number of European cities. These run from the CTM Bus Station on Leo Africanus Street near the Central Market in downtown Casablanca. Supratours, an affiliate of ONCF, also offers coach bus service at a slightly lower cost, departing from a station on Wilad Zian Street. There is another bus station farther down on the same street called the Wilad Zian Bus Station; this station is the country's largest bus station, serving over 800 buses daily, catering more to Morocco's lower income population.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nRegistered taxis in Casablanca are coloured red and known as petit taxis (small taxis), or coloured white and known as grands taxis (big taxis). As is standard Moroccan practice, petits taxis, typically small-four door Dacia Logan, Peugeot 207, or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. Grands taxis, generally older Mercedes-Benz sedans, provide shared mini-bus like service within the city on predefined routes, or shared intercity service. Grands taxis may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.\n\n\n=== Trains ===\nCasablanca is served by three main railway stations run by the national rail service, the ONCF.\n\nCasa-Voyageurs is the main intercity station, from which trains run south to Marrakech or El Jadida and north to Mohammedia and Rabat, and then on either to Tangier or Meknes, Fes, Taza and Oujda/Nador. It also serves as the southern terminus of the Al-Boraq high speed line from Tangier. A dedicated airport shuttle service to Mohammed V International Airport also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.\n\nCasa-Port serves primarily commuter trains such as the Train Navette Rapide (TNR or Aouita) operating on the Casablanca \u2013 Kenitra rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark Casablanca Twin Center. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction, the station is still operational. From 2013, it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the city's new tram network.\nCasa-Oasis was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early 21st century, and officially reopened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern intercity train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to intercity standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nAlthough Mohammed V International Airport receives most international flights into Morocco, international tourism in Casablanca is not as developed as it is in cities like Marrakesh. Casablanca, however, attracts fewer tourists than those of cities such as Fes and Marrakech. \nThe Hassan II Mosque, which is the second largest mosque in Africa and the seventh largest in the world, is the city's main tourist attraction. Visitors also come to see the city's rich architectural heritage.Popular sites for national tourism include shopping centers such as Morocco Mall, Anfa Place, the Marina Shopping Center, and the Tachfine Center. Additional sites include the Corniche and the beach of Ain Diab, and parks such as the Arab League Park or the Sindibad theme park.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAmal Ayouch (born 1966) \u2013 stage and film actress\nSalaheddine Bassir \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nLaarbi Batma \u2013 Moroccan musician and artist, founding member of Nas El Ghiwan\nLarbi Benbarek \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMiriem Bensalah-Chaqroun \u2013 Moroccan businesswoman\nJean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes \u2013 French footballer\nFrida Boccara \u2013 French singer, Winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 1969\nMerieme Chadid \u2013 Moroccan astronomer\nSoufiane Choubani \u2013 Founder of the Moroccan National Debate Team\nJean-Charles de Castelbajac \u2013 French fashion designer\nDizzy DROS \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nGad Elmaleh \u2013 French/Canadian comedian\nLa Fouine \u2013 Moroccan-French rapper\nEl Haqed \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nSerge Haroche \u2013 French physicist who was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physics\nShatha Hassoun \u2013 Moroccan/Iraqi singer\nLydia Hatuel-Czuckermann \u2013 Israeli Olympic fencer\nHicham Mesbahi \u2013 Moroccan boxer\nFrench Montana \u2013 American rapper\nNawal El Moutawakel \u2013 Olympic champion\nNoureddine Naybet \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMostafa Nissaboury \u2013 Moroccan poet\nHakim Noury \u2013 Moroccan film director\nMaurice Ohana \u2013 French composer\nJean Reno \u2013 French Hollywood actor\nDaniel Sivan \u2013 professor\nAlain Souchon \u2013 French songwriter\nFrank Stephenson \u2013 award-winning automobile designer\nHassan Saada \u2013 Moroccan boxer arrested for alleged rape before Olympic match\nSidney Taurel \u2013 naturalized American CEO of Eli Lilly and Company from 1998 to 2008\nRichard Virenque \u2013 French cyclist\nMuhammad Zarqtuni \u2013 Moroccan nationalist and resistance leader\nAbdallah Zrika \u2013 Moroccan poet\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe 1942 film Casablanca (starring Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart) is supposed to have been set in Casablanca, although it was filmed entirely in Los Angeles and doesn't feature a single Arab or North African character with a speaking role. The film depicts Casablanca as the scene of power struggle between various foreign powers, which had much more to do with the Tangier of the time. The film has achieved worldwide popularity since its release. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, it won three, including Best Picture.\nA Night in Casablanca (1946) was the 12th Marx Brothers' movie. The film stars Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, and Harpo Marx. It was directed by Archie Mayo and written by Joseph Fields and Roland Kibbee. The film contains the song \"Who's Sorry Now?\", with music by Ted Snyder and lyrics by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. It is sung in French by Lisette Verea playing the part of Beatrice Rheiner, and then later sung in English. Liszt's \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\" is played twice, once by Chico on piano as an introduction to the \"Beer Barrel Polka\", and again by Harpo on the harp.\nThe city is featured in The Mysterious Caravan (1975), volume 54 in the original Hardy Boys series.\nCasablanca is the setting for several chapters in Doubleshot, a 2000 James Bond novel by Raymond Benson. In the novel, one of the characters mentions that the 1942 film was shot in Hollywood and not on location.\nCasablanca is one of the key locations in the 2006 video game Dreamfall, as it is where the primary protagonist of the game, Zo\u00eb Castillo, lives. Although the city is imagined in the year 2219, much of the present-day architecture is used for inspiration.\nCasablanca is the setting for the first act of the 2016 World War II romantic thriller film Allied starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nCasablanca is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nRabat Zoo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site of Casablanca\nOfficial Casablanca Tourism Website (in French)\nCasablanca photo gallery (buildings and other landmarks with a history dating back to the French Protectorate)\nOpen Air Museum of 20th century architecture\n Geographic data related to Casablanca at OpenStreetMap",

          "This is an overall well built station. It covers basic food and clothes shops. Nothing great. Service is okay. Trains only go to local small cities like kinitra etc. It will not take you to other cities like fez,marakesh etc. Outside the station you will meet taxi drivers",

        "wiki": "Casablanca (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621\u200e, romanized: ad-d\u0101r al-bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02be; Berber languages: \u2d30\u2d4f\u2d3c\u2d30, romanized: anfa) is the largest city of Morocco. Located in the central-western part of Morocco bordering the Atlantic Ocean, it is the largest city in the Maghreb region and the eighth-largest in the Arab world. Casablanca is Morocco's chief port and one of the largest financial centers in Africa. According to the 2019 population estimate, the city has a population of about 3.71 million in the urban area and over 4.27 million in the Greater Casablanca. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center of Morocco, although the national political capital is Rabat.\nThe leading Moroccan companies and many international corporations doing business in the country have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca holds its recorded position as the primary industrial zone of the nation. The Port of Casablanca is one of the largest artificial ports in the world, and the second largest port of North Africa, after Tanger-Med 40 km (25 mi) east of Tangier. Casablanca also hosts the primary naval base for the Royal Moroccan Navy.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe original name of Casablanca was Anfa (Neo-Tifinagh: \u2d30\u2d4f\u2d3c\u2d30), in Berber language, by at least the seventh century BC. After the Portuguese took control of the city in the 15th century AD, they rebuilt it, changing the name to Casa Branca ([kaz\u0250'b\u027e\u0250\u0303k\u0250]), meaning 'white house' in Portuguese. The present name, which is the Spanish version (pronounced [ka\u0320sa\u0320\u02c8\u03b2\u031ela\u0320\u014bka\u0320]), came when the Kingdom of Portugal came under Spanish control through the Iberian Union. During the French protectorate in Morocco, the name remained Casablanca (pronounced [kazabl\u0251\u0303ka]). In 1755 an earthquake destroyed most of the town. It was rebuilt by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah who changed the name into the local Arabic Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101' (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), although occasionally \"Casablanca\" is written in Arabic (\u0643\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0627, K\u0101z\u0101bl\u0101nk\u0101). The city is still nicknamed Casa by many locals and outsiders to the city. In many other cities with a different dialect, it is called Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101, instead.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by Berbers by at least the seventh century BC. It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans. In his book Description of Africa, Leo Africanus refers to ancient Casablanca as \"Anfa\", a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of Barghawata in 744 AD. He believed Anfa was the most \"prosperous city on the Atlantic Coast because of its fertile land.\" Barghawata rose as an independent state around this time, and continued until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1068. Following the defeat of the Barghawata in the 12th century, Arab tribes of Hilal and Sulaym descent settled in the region, mixing with the local Berbers, which led to widespread Arabization. During the 14th century, under the Merinids, Anfa rose in importance as a port. The last of the Merinids were ousted by a popular revolt in 1465.\n\n\n=== Portuguese conquest and Spanish influence ===\n\nIn the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers, leading to it being targeted by the Portuguese, who bombarded the town which led to its destruction in 1468. The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a military fortress in 1515. The town that grew up around it was called Casa Branca, meaning \"white house\" in Portuguese.\nBetween 1580 and 1640, the Crown of Portugal was integrated to the Crown of Spain, so Casablanca and all other areas occupied by the Portuguese were under Spanish control, though maintaining an autonomous Portuguese administration. As Portugal broke ties with Spain in 1640, Casablanca came under fully Portuguese control once again. The Europeans eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 following an earthquake which destroyed most of the town.The town was finally reconstructed by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah (1756\u20131790), the grandson of Moulay Ismail and an ally of George Washington, with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called ad-D\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02bc (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), the Arabic translation of the Portuguese Casa Branca.\n\n\n=== Colonial struggle ===\nIn the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in Britain and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing gunpowder tea, used in Morocco's national drink, mint tea). By the 1860s, around 5,000 residents were there, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s. Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of French colonialists in 1906. By 1921, this rose to 110,000, largely through the development of shanty towns.\n\n\n=== French rule and influence ===\n\nThe Treaty of Algeciras of 1906 formalized French preeminence in Morocco and included three measures that directly impacted Casablanca: that French officers would control operations at the customs office and seize revenue as collateral for loans given by France, that the French holding company La Compagnie Marocaine would develop the port of Casablanca, and that a French-and-Spanish-trained police force would be assembled to patrol the port.To build the port's breakwater, narrow-gauge track was laid in June 1907 for a small Decauville locomotive to connect the port to a quarry in Roches Noires, passing through the sacred Sidi Belyout graveyard. In resistance to this and the measures of the 1906 Treaty of Algeciras, tribesmen of the Chaouia attacked the locomotive, killing 9 Compagnie Marocaine laborers\u20143 French, 3 Italians, and 3 Spanish.In response, the French bombarded the city with multiple gunboats and landed troops inside the town, causing severe damage and 15,000 dead and wounded. In the immediate aftermath of the bombardment and the deployment of French troops, the European homes and the Mellah, or Jewish quarter, were sacked, and the latter was also set ablaze.The bombardment and military invasion of the city effectively began the French military conquest of Morocco, although French control of Casablanca was not formalized until the French Protectorat was established by the Treaty of Fes March 1912.\nGeneral Hubert Lyautey assigned the planning of the new colonial port city to Henri Prost. As he did in other Moroccan cities, Prost designed a European ville nouvelle outside the walls of the medina. In Casablanca, he also designed a new \"ville indig\u00e8ne\" to house Moroccans arriving from other cities.Europeans formed almost half the population of Casablanca.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAfter Philippe P\u00e9tain of France signed the armistice with the Nazis, he ordered French troops in France's colonial empire to defend French territory against any aggressors\u2014Allied or otherwise\u2014applying a policy of \"asymmetrical neutrality\" in favor of the Germans. French colonists in Morocco generally supported P\u00e9tain, while politically conscious Moroccans tended to favor de Gaulle and the Allies.Operation Torch, which started on 8 November 1942, was the British-American invasion of French North Africa during the North African campaign of World War II. The Western Task Force, composed of American units led by Major General George S. Patton and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, carried out the invasions of Mehdia, Fedhala, and Asfi. American forces captured Casablanca from Vichy control when France surrendered November 11, 1942, but the Naval Battle of Casablanca continued until American forces sank German submarine U-173 on November 16.Casablanca was the site of the Nouasseur Air Base, a large American air base used as the staging area for all American aircraft for the European Theater of Operations during World War II. The air field has since become Mohammed V International Airport.\n\n\n==== Anfa Conference ====\n\nCasablanca hosted the Anfa Conference (also called the Casablanca Conference) in January 1943. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed the progress of the war. Also in attendance were the Free France generals Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud, though they played minor roles and didn't participate in the military planning.\nIt was at this conference that the Allies adopted the doctrine of \"unconditional surrender,\" meaning that the Axis powers would be fought until their defeat. Roosevelt also met privately with Sultan Muhammad V and expressed his support for Moroccan independence after the war. This became a turning point, as Moroccan nationalists were emboldened to openly seek complete independence.\n\n\n=== Toward independence ===\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting.\nApril 7, 1947, a massacre of working class Moroccans, carried out by Senegalese Tirailleurs in the service of the French colonial army, was instigated just as Sultan Muhammed V was due to make a speech in Tangier appealing for independence.Riots in Casablanca took place from December 7\u20138, 1952, in response to the assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist Farhat Hached by La Main Rouge\u2014the clandestine militant wing of French intelligence. Then, on 25 December 1953 (Christmas Day), Muhammad Zarqtuni orchestrated a bombing of Casablanca's Central Market in response to the forced exile of Sultan Muhammad V and the royal family on August 20 (Eid al-Adha) of that year.\n\n\n=== Since independence ===\nMorocco gained independence from France in 1956.\n\n\n==== Casablanca Group ====\nJanuary 4\u20137, 1961, the city hosted an ensemble of progressive African leaders during the Casablanca Conference of 1961. Among those received by King Muhammad V were Gamal Abd An-Nasser, Kwame Nkrumah, Modibo Ke\u00efta, and Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, Ferhat Abbas.\n\n\n==== Jewish emigration ====\nCasablanca was a major departure point for Jews leaving Morocco through Operation Yachin, an operation conducted by Mossad to secretly migrate Moroccan Jews to Israel between November 1961 and spring 1964.\n\n\n==== 1965 riots ====\nThe 1965 student protests organized by the National Union of Popular Forces-affiliated National Union of Moroccan Students, which spread to cities around the country and devolved into riots, started on March 22, 1965 in front of Lyc\u00e9e Mohammed V in Casablanca. The protests started as a peaceful march to demand the right to public higher education for Morocco, but expanded to include concerns of laborers, the unemployed, and other marginalized segments of society, and devolved into vandalism and rioting. The riots were violently repressed by security forces with tanks and armored vehicles; Moroccan authorities reported a dozen deaths while the UNFP reported more than 1,000.King Hassan II blamed the events on teachers and parents, and declared in a speech to the nation on March 30, 1965: \"There is no greater danger to the State than a so-called intellectual. It would have been better if you were all illiterate.\u201d\n\n\n==== 1981 riots ====\nOn June 6, 1981, the Casablanca Bread Riots took place. Hassan II appointed the French-trained lawyer Driss Basri, who would later become a symbol of the Years of Lead, with quelling the protests. The government stated that 66 people were killed and 100 were injured, while opposition leaders put the number of dead at 637, saying that many of these were killed by police and army gunfire.\n\n\n==== Mudawana ====\nIn March 2000, more than 60 women's groups organized demonstrations in Casablanca proposing reforms to the legal status of women in the country. About 40,000 women attended, calling for a ban on polygamy and the introduction of divorce law (divorce being a purely religious procedure at that time). Although the counter-demonstration attracted half a million participants, the movement for change started in 2000 was influential on King Mohammed VI, and he enacted a new mudawana, or family law, in early 2004, meeting some of the demands of women's rights activists.On 16 May 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a multiple suicide bomb attack carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to al-Qaeda. Twelve suicide bombers struck five locations in the city.Another series of suicide bombings struck the city in early 2007. These events illustrated some of the persistent challenges the city faces in addressing poverty and integrating disadvantaged neighborhoods and populations. One initiative to improve conditions in the city's disadvantaged neighborhoods was the creation of the Sidi Moumen Cultural Center.As calls for reform spread through the Arab world in 2011, Moroccans joined in, but concessions by the ruler led to acceptance. However, in December, thousands of people demonstrated in several parts of the city, especially the city center near la Fontaine, desiring more significant political reforms.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCasablanca is located on the Atlantic coast of the Chaouia Plains which have historically been the breadbasket of Morocco. Apart from the Atlantic coast, the Bouskoura forest is the only natural attraction in the city. The forest was planted in the 20th century and consists mostly of eucalyptus, palm, and pine trees. It is located halfway to the city's international airport. \nThe only watercourse in Casablanca is oued Bouskoura, a small seasonal creek that until 1912 reached the Atlantic Ocean near the actual port. Most of oued Bouskoura's bed has been covered due to urbanization and only the part south of El Jadida road can now be seen. The closest permanent river to Casablanca is Oum Rabia, 70 km (43.50 mi) to the south-east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCasablanca has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). The cool Canary Current off the Atlantic coast moderates temperature variation, which results in a climate remarkably similar to that of coastal Los Angeles, with similar temperature ranges. The city has an annual average of 72 days with significant precipitation, which amounts to 412 mm (16.2 in) per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) and \u22122.7 \u00b0C (27.1 \u00b0F), respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is 178 mm (7.0 in) on 30 November 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Grand Casablanca region is considered the locomotive of the development of the Moroccan economy. It attracts 32% of the country's production units and 56% of industrial labor. The region uses 30% of the national electricity production. With MAD 93 billion, the region contributes to 44% of the industrial production of the kingdom. About 33% of national industrial exports, MAD 27 billion, comes from the Grand Casablanca; 30% of the Moroccan banking network is concentrated in Casablanca.One of the most important Casablancan exports is phosphate. Other industries include fishing, fish canning, sawmills, furniture production, building materials, glass, textiles, electronics, leather work, processed food, spirits, soft drinks, and cigarettes.The Casablanca and Mohammedia seaports activity represent 50% of the international commercial flows of Morocco. Almost the entire Casablanca waterfront is under development, mainly the construction of huge entertainment centres between the port and Hassan II Mosque, the Anfa Resort project near the business, entertainment and living centre of Megarama, the shopping and entertainment complex of Morocco Mall, as well as a complete renovation of the coastal walkway. The Sindbad park is planned to be totally renewed with rides, games and entertainment services.Royal Air Maroc has its head office at the Casablanca-Anfa Airport. In 2004, it announced that it was moving its head office from Casablanca to a location in Province of Nouaceur, close to Mohammed V International Airport. The agreement to build the head office in Nouaceur was signed in 2009.The biggest CBD of Casablanca and Maghreb is in the North of the town in Sidi Maarouf near the mosque of Hassan II and the biggest project of skycrapers of Maghreb and Africa Casablanca Marina.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nCasablanca is a commune, part of the region of Casablanca-Settat. The commune is divided into eight districts or prefectures, which are themselves divided into 16 subdivisions or arrondissements and one municipality. The districts and their subdivisions are:\nA\u00efn Chock (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642) \u2013 A\u00efn Chock (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642)\nA\u00efn Seba\u00e2 - Hay Mohammadi (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a) \u2013 A\u00efn Seba\u00e2 (\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639), Hay Mohammadi (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a), Roches Noires (\u0631\u0648\u0634 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631).\nAnfa (\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627) \u2013 Anfa (\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627), Ma\u00e2rif (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0641), Sidi Belyout (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0637).\nBen M'Sick (\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643) \u2013 Ben M'Sick (\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643), Sbata (\u0633\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647).\nSidi Bernoussi (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0635\u064a) \u2013 Sidi Bernoussi (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0635\u064a), Sidi Moumen (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0645\u0646).\nAl Fida - Mers Sultan (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u2013 \u0645\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646) \u2013 Al Fida (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621); Mechouar (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0648\u0631) (municipality), Mers Sultan (\u0645\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646).\nHay Hassani (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a) \u2013 Hay Hassani (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a).\nMoulay Rachid (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f) \u2013 Moulay Rachid (\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f), Sidi Othmane (\u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646).\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nThe list of neighborhoods is indicative and not complete:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe commune of Casablanca recorded a population of 3,359,818 in the 2014 Moroccan census. About 98% live in urban areas. Around 25% of them are under 15 and 9% are over 60 years old. The population of the city is about 11% of the total population of Morocco. Grand Casablanca is also the largest urban area in the Maghreb. 99.9% of the population of Morocco are Arab and Berber Muslims.\nDuring the French protectorate in Morocco, European Christians formed almost half the population of Casablanca. Since independence in 1956, the European population has decreased substantially.The city also is still home for a small community of Moroccan Christians, as well as a small group of foreign resident Roman Catholics.\n\n\n=== Judaism in Casablanca ===\nJews have a long history in Casablanca. A Sephardic Jewish community was in Anfa up to the destruction of the city by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750, the Rabbi Elijah Synagogue was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.Approximately 28,000 Moroccan Jews immigrated to the State of Israel between 1948 and 1951, many through Casablanca. Casablanca then became a departure point in Operation Yachin, the covert Mossad-organized migration operation from 1961\u20131964. In 2018 only 2,500 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca, while according to the World Jewish Congress only 1,000 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca.Today, the Jewish cemetery of Casablanca is one of the major cemeteries of the city, and many synagogues remain in service, but the city's Jewish community has dwindled. The Moroccan Jewish Museum is a museum established in the city in 1997.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nPublic: University of Hassan II Casablanca\nPrivate:\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Mundiapolis\nUniversit\u00e9 Internationale de Casablanca\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nInternational schools:\n\nBelgium: \u00c9cole Belge de Casablanca\nFrench:\nColl\u00e8ge Anatole France\nLyc\u00e9e Lyautey\nGroupe Scolaire Louis Massignon\nLyc\u00e9e La R\u00e9sidence\nLyc\u00e9e Ma\u00efmonide (FR)\nLyc\u00e9e L\u00e9on l'Africain\n\u00c9cole Normale H\u00e9bra\u00efque\n\u00c9cole Al Jabr\nItalian: Scuola \"Enrico Mattei\"\nSpanish: Instituto Espa\u00f1ol Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez\nAmerican:\nCasablanca American School\nAmerican Academy Casablanca\nGeorge Washington Academy\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nMost of the city's places of worship are Muslim mosques. Some of the city's synagogues, such as Ettedgui Synagogue, also remain. There are also Christian churches; some remain in use \u2014 particularly by the West African migrant community \u2014 while many of the churches built during the colonial period have been repurposed, such as Church of the Sacred Heart.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Association football ===\n\nCasablanca is home to two popular football clubs: Wydad Casablanca and Raja Casablanca\u2014which are rivals. Raja's symbol is an eagle and Wydad's symbol is a star and crescent which means a symbol of Islam. These two popular clubs have produced some of Morocco's best players, such as: Salaheddine Bassir, Abdelmajid Dolmy, Baddou Zaki, Aziz Bouderbala, and Noureddine Naybet.

The stadium was designed with a capacity of 93,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the Stade Mohamed V. The initial idea of the stadium was for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to South Africa. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2025. The idea of the stadium was also for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to Canada, Mexico and United States. It is now hoping for the 2030 FIFA World Cup which Morocco is co-bidding with either African neighbors Tunisia and Algeria or two European nations Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nal-Haja al-Hamdawiya, one of the most iconic figures in aita music, was born in Casablanca.

The Casablanca School\u2014a Modernist art movement and collective including artists such as Farid Belkahia, Mohamed Melihi, and Mohammed Chab\u00e2a\u2014developed out of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts of Casablanca in the late 1960s.The Academy of Traditional Arts, part of the Hassan II Mosque complex, was founded October 31, 2012.L'Uzine is a community-based art and culture space in Casablanca.Rebel Spirit published The Casablanca Guide (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0648\u064a, Le Guide Casablancais) a comic book about life in Casablanca.Sbagha Bagha is a street art festival during which murals are created on the sides of apartment buildings.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\nPostcard companies such as L\u00e9on & L\u00e9vy were active in Casablanca. Gabriel Veyre also worked and eventually died in Casablanca. \nMarcelin Flandrin (1889-1957), a French military photographer, settled in Casablanca and recorded much of the early colonial period in Morocco with his photography. With his staged nude postcard photos taken in Casablanca's colonial brothel quarter, Flandrin was also responsible for disseminating the orientalist image of Moroccan women as sexual objects.Casablanca has a thriving street photography scene. Yoriyas is prominent among photographers capturing the economic capital's street scenes, and has attracted international attention.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Casablanca had many movie theaters, such as Cinema Rialto, Cinema Lynx and Cinema Vox\u2014the largest in Africa at the time it was built.The 1942 American film Casablanca is supposedly set in Casablanca and has had a lasting impact on the city's image, though it was filmed entirely in California and doesn't feature a single Moroccan character with a speaking role. Salut Casa! was a propaganda film brandishing France's purported colonial triumph in its mission civilizatrice in the city.Love in Casablanca (1991), starring Abdelkarim Derqaoui and Muna Fettou, is one of the first Moroccan films to deal with Morocco's complex realities and depict life in Casablanca with verisimilitude. Nour-Eddine Lakhmari's Casanegra (2008) depicts the harsh realities of Casablanca's working classes. The films Ali Zaoua (2000), Horses of God (2012), and Ghazzia (2017) of Nabil Ayouch\u2014a French director of Moroccan heritage\u2014deal with street crime, terrorism, and social issues in Casablanca, respectively. The events in Meryem Benm'Barek-Alo\u00efsi's 2018 film Sofia revolve around an illegitimate pregnancy in Casablanca. Hicham Lasri and Said Naciri also from Casablanca.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nCasablanca's architecture and urban development are historically significant. The city is home to many notable buildings in a variety of styles, including traditional Moroccan architecture, various colonial architectural styles, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Neo-Mauresque, Streamline Moderne, Modernism, Brutalism, and more. During the French Protectorate, the French government described Casablanca as a \"laboratory of urbanism.\"The work of the Groupe des Architectes Modernes Marocains (GAMMA) on public housing projects\u2014such as Carri\u00e8res Centrales in Hay Mohammadi\u2014in a style described as vernacular modernism influenced modernist architecture around the world.Casam\u00e9moire and MAMMA. are two organizations dedicated to the preservation and appreciation of the city's architectural heritage.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rapid Transit ===\n\nThe Casablanca Tramway is the rapid transit tram system in Casablanca. As of 2019, the network consists of two lines covering 47.5 km (30 mi), with 71 stops; further lines (\u06373 and \u06374) are under construction.Since the 1970s, Casablanca had planned to build a metro system to offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality. However, the city council voted to abandon the metro project in 2014 due to high costs, and decided to continue expanding the already operating tram system instead.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nCasablanca's main airport is Mohammed V International Airport, Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve Marrakech, Rabat, Agadir, Oujda, Tangier, Al Hoceima, and Laayoune, as well as other cities.\nCasablanca is well-served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. New York City, Montreal, Paris, Washington D.C., London and Dubai are important primary destinations.\nThe older, smaller Casablanca-Anfa Airport to the west of the city, served certain destinations including Damascus, and Tunis, and was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It has been closed and destroyed to build the \"Casablanca Finance City\", the new heart of the city of Casablanca. Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport is located in the nearby community of Tit Mellil.\n\n\n=== Coach buses ===\nCompagnie de Transports au Maroc (CTM) offers private intercity coach buses on various lines run servicing most notable Moroccan towns, as well as a number of European cities. These run from the CTM Bus Station on Leo Africanus Street near the Central Market in downtown Casablanca. Supratours, an affiliate of ONCF, also offers coach bus service at a slightly lower cost, departing from a station on Wilad Zian Street. There is another bus station farther down on the same street called the Wilad Zian Bus Station; this station is the country's largest bus station, serving over 800 buses daily, catering more to Morocco's lower income population.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nRegistered taxis in Casablanca are coloured red and known as petit taxis (small taxis), or coloured white and known as grands taxis (big taxis). As is standard Moroccan practice, petits taxis, typically small-four door Dacia Logan, Peugeot 207, or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. Grands taxis, generally older Mercedes-Benz sedans, provide shared mini-bus like service within the city on predefined routes, or shared intercity service. Grands taxis may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.\n\n\n=== Trains ===\nCasablanca is served by three main railway stations run by the national rail service, the ONCF.\n\nCasa-Voyageurs is the main intercity station, from which trains run south to Marrakech or El Jadida and north to Mohammedia and Rabat, and then on either to Tangier or Meknes, Fes, Taza and Oujda/Nador. It also serves as the southern terminus of the Al-Boraq high speed line from Tangier. A dedicated airport shuttle service to Mohammed V International Airport also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.\n\nCasa-Port serves primarily commuter trains such as the Train Navette Rapide (TNR or Aouita) operating on the Casablanca \u2013 Kenitra rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark Casablanca Twin Center. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction, the station is still operational. From 2013, it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the city's new tram network.\nCasa-Oasis was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early 21st century, and officially reopened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern intercity train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to intercity standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nAlthough Mohammed V International Airport receives most international flights into Morocco, international tourism in Casablanca is not as developed as it is in cities like Marrakesh. Casablanca, however, attracts fewer tourists than those of cities such as Fes and Marrakech. \nThe Hassan II Mosque, which is the second largest mosque in Africa and the seventh largest in the world, is the city's main tourist attraction. Visitors also come to see the city's rich architectural heritage.Popular sites for national tourism include shopping centers such as Morocco Mall, Anfa Place, the Marina Shopping Center, and the Tachfine Center. Additional sites include the Corniche and the beach of Ain Diab, and parks such as the Arab League Park or the Sindibad theme park.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAmal Ayouch (born 1966) \u2013 stage and film actress\nSalaheddine Bassir \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nLaarbi Batma \u2013 Moroccan musician and artist, founding member of Nas El Ghiwan\nLarbi Benbarek \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMiriem Bensalah-Chaqroun \u2013 Moroccan businesswoman\nJean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes \u2013 French footballer\nFrida Boccara \u2013 French singer, Winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 1969\nMerieme Chadid \u2013 Moroccan astronomer\nSoufiane Choubani \u2013 Founder of the Moroccan National Debate Team\nJean-Charles de Castelbajac \u2013 French fashion designer\nDizzy DROS \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nGad Elmaleh \u2013 French/Canadian comedian\nLa Fouine \u2013 Moroccan-French rapper\nEl Haqed \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nSerge Haroche \u2013 French physicist who was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physics\nShatha Hassoun \u2013 Moroccan/Iraqi singer\nLydia Hatuel-Czuckermann \u2013 Israeli Olympic fencer\nHicham Mesbahi \u2013 Moroccan boxer\nFrench Montana \u2013 American rapper\nNawal El Moutawakel \u2013 Olympic champion\nNoureddine Naybet \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMostafa Nissaboury \u2013 Moroccan poet\nHakim Noury \u2013 Moroccan film director\nMaurice Ohana \u2013 French composer\nJean Reno \u2013 French Hollywood actor\nDaniel Sivan \u2013 professor\nAlain Souchon \u2013 French songwriter\nFrank Stephenson \u2013 award-winning automobile designer\nHassan Saada \u2013 Moroccan boxer arrested for alleged rape before Olympic match\nSidney Taurel \u2013 naturalized American CEO of Eli Lilly and Company from 1998 to 2008\nRichard Virenque \u2013 French cyclist\nMuhammad Zarqtuni \u2013 Moroccan nationalist and resistance leader\nAbdallah Zrika \u2013 Moroccan poet\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe 1942 film Casablanca (starring Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart) is supposed to have been set in Casablanca, although it was filmed entirely in Los Angeles and doesn't feature a single Arab or North African character with a speaking role. The film depicts Casablanca as the scene of power struggle between various foreign powers, which had much more to do with the Tangier of the time. The film has achieved worldwide popularity since its release. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, it won three, including Best Picture.\nA Night in Casablanca (1946) was the 12th Marx Brothers' movie. The film stars Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, and Harpo Marx. It was directed by Archie Mayo and written by Joseph Fields and Roland Kibbee. The film contains the song \"Who's Sorry Now?\", with music by Ted Snyder and lyrics by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. It is sung in French by Lisette Verea playing the part of Beatrice Rheiner, and then later sung in English. Liszt's \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\" is played twice, once by Chico on piano as an introduction to the \"Beer Barrel Polka\", and again by Harpo on the harp.\nThe city is featured in The Mysterious Caravan (1975), volume 54 in the original Hardy Boys series.\nCasablanca is the setting for several chapters in Doubleshot, a 2000 James Bond novel by Raymond Benson. In the novel, one of the characters mentions that the 1942 film was shot in Hollywood and not on location.\nCasablanca is one of the key locations in the 2006 video game Dreamfall, as it is where the primary protagonist of the game, Zo\u00eb Castillo, lives. Although the city is imagined in the year 2219, much of the present-day architecture is used for inspiration.\nCasablanca is the setting for the first act of the 2016 World War II romantic thriller film Allied starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nCasablanca is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nRabat Zoo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site of Casablanca\nOfficial Casablanca Tourism Website (in French)\nCasablanca photo gallery (buildings and other landmarks with a history dating back to the French Protectorate)\nOpen Air Museum of 20th century architecture\n Geographic data related to Casablanca at OpenStreetMap",

Located in the central-western part of Morocco bordering the Atlantic Ocean, it is the largest city in the Maghreb region and the eighth-largest in the Arab world. Casablanca is Morocco's chief port and one of the largest financial centers in Africa. According to the 2019 population estimate, the city has a population of about 3.71 million in the urban area and over 4.27 million in the Greater Casablanca. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center of Morocco, although the national political capital is Rabat.\nThe leading Moroccan companies and many international corporations doing business in the country have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca holds its recorded position as the primary industrial zone of the nation. The Port of Casablanca is one of the largest artificial ports in the world, and the second largest port of North Africa, after Tanger-Med 40 km (25 mi) east of Tangier. Casablanca also hosts the primary naval base for the Royal Moroccan Navy.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe original name of Casablanca was Anfa (Neo-Tifinagh: \u2d30\u2d4f\u2d3c\u2d30), in Berber language, by at least the seventh century BC. After the Portuguese took control of the city in the 15th century AD, they rebuilt it, changing the name to Casa Branca ([kaz\u0250'b\u027e\u0250\u0303k\u0250]), meaning 'white house' in Portuguese. The present name, which is the Spanish version (pronounced [ka\u0320sa\u0320\u02c8\u03b2\u031ela\u0320\u014bka\u0320]), came when the Kingdom of Portugal came under Spanish control through the Iberian Union. During the French protectorate in Morocco, the name remained Casablanca (pronounced [kazabl\u0251\u0303ka]). In 1755 an earthquake destroyed most of the town. It was rebuilt by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah who changed the name into the local Arabic Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101' (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), although occasionally \"Casablanca\" is written in Arabic (\u0643\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0627, K\u0101z\u0101bl\u0101nk\u0101). The city is still nicknamed Casa by many locals and outsiders to the city. In many other cities with a different dialect, it is called Ad-d\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101, instead.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by Berbers by at least the seventh century BC. It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans. In his book Description of Africa, Leo Africanus refers to ancient Casablanca as \"Anfa\", a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of Barghawata in 744 AD. He believed Anfa was the most \"prosperous city on the Atlantic Coast because of its fertile land.\" Barghawata rose as an independent state around this time, and continued until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1068. Following the defeat of the Barghawata in the 12th century, Arab tribes of Hilal and Sulaym descent settled in the region, mixing with the local Berbers, which led to widespread Arabization. During the 14th century, under the Merinids, Anfa rose in importance as a port. The last of the Merinids were ousted by a popular revolt in 1465.\n\n\n=== Portuguese conquest and Spanish influence ===\n\nIn the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers, leading to it being targeted by the Portuguese, who bombarded the town which led to its destruction in 1468. The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a military fortress in 1515. The town that grew up around it was called Casa Branca, meaning \"white house\" in Portuguese.\nBetween 1580 and 1640, the Crown of Portugal was integrated to the Crown of Spain, so Casablanca and all other areas occupied by the Portuguese were under Spanish control, though maintaining an autonomous Portuguese administration. As Portugal broke ties with Spain in 1640, Casablanca came under fully Portuguese control once again. The Europeans eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 following an earthquake which destroyed most of the town.The town was finally reconstructed by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah (1756\u20131790), the grandson of Moulay Ismail and an ally of George Washington, with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called ad-D\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02bc (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), the Arabic translation of the Portuguese Casa Branca.\n\n\n=== Colonial struggle ===\nIn the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in Britain and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing gunpowder tea, used in Morocco's national drink, mint tea). By the 1860s, around 5,000 residents were there, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s. Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of French colonialists in 1906. By 1921, this rose to 110,000, largely through the development of shanty towns.\n\n\n=== French rule and influence ===\n\nThe Treaty of Algeciras of 1906 formalized French preeminence in Morocco and included three measures that directly impacted Casablanca: that French officers would control operations at the customs office and seize revenue as collateral for loans given by France, that the French holding company La Compagnie Marocaine would develop the port of Casablanca, and that a French-and-Spanish-trained police force would be assembled to patrol the port.To build the port's breakwater, narrow-gauge track was laid in June 1907 for a small Decauville locomotive to connect the port to a quarry in Roches Noires, passing through the sacred Sidi Belyout graveyard. In resistance to this and the measures of the 1906 Treaty of Algeciras, tribesmen of the Chaouia attacked the locomotive, killing 9 Compagnie Marocaine laborers\u20143 French, 3 Italians, and 3 Spanish.In response, the French bombarded the city with multiple gunboats and landed troops inside the town, causing severe damage and 15,000 dead and wounded. In the immediate aftermath of the bombardment and the deployment of French troops, the European homes and the Mellah, or Jewish quarter, were sacked, and the latter was also set ablaze.The bombardment and military invasion of the city effectively began the French military conquest of Morocco, although French control of Casablanca was not formalized until the French Protectorat was established by the Treaty of Fes March 1912.\nGeneral Hubert Lyautey assigned the planning of the new colonial port city to Henri Prost. As he did in other Moroccan cities, Prost designed a European ville nouvelle outside the walls of the medina. In Casablanca, he also designed a new \"ville indig\u00e8ne\" to house Moroccans arriving from other cities.Europeans formed almost half the population of Casablanca.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAfter Philippe P\u00e9tain of France signed the armistice with the Nazis, he ordered French troops in France's colonial empire to defend French territory against any aggressors\u2014Allied or otherwise\u2014applying a policy of \"asymmetrical neutrality\" in favor of the Germans. French colonists in Morocco generally supported P\u00e9tain, while politically conscious Moroccans tended to favor de Gaulle and the Allies.Operation Torch, which started on 8 November 1942, was the British-American invasion of French North Africa during the North African campaign of World War II. The Western Task Force, composed of American units led by Major General George S. Patton and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, carried out the invasions of Mehdia, Fedhala, and Asfi. American forces captured Casablanca from Vichy control when France surrendered November 11, 1942, but the Naval Battle of Casablanca continued until American forces sank German submarine U-173 on November 16.Casablanca was the site of the Nouasseur Air Base, a large American air base used as the staging area for all American aircraft for the European Theater of Operations during World War II. The air field has since become Mohammed V International Airport.\n\n\n==== Anfa Conference ====\n\nCasablanca hosted the Anfa Conference (also called the Casablanca Conference) in January 1943. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed the progress of the war. Also in attendance were the Free France generals Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud, though they played minor roles and didn't participate in the military planning.\nIt was at this conference that the Allies adopted the doctrine of \"unconditional surrender,\" meaning that the Axis powers would be fought until their defeat. Roosevelt also met privately with Sultan Muhammad V and expressed his support for Moroccan independence after the war. This became a turning point, as Moroccan nationalists were emboldened to openly seek complete independence.\n\n\n=== Toward independence ===\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting.\nApril 7, 1947, a massacre of working class Moroccans, carried out by Senegalese Tirailleurs in the service of the French colonial army, was instigated just as Sultan Muhammed V was due to make a speech in Tangier appealing for independence.Riots in Casablanca took place from December 7\u20138, 1952, in response to the assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist Farhat Hached by La Main Rouge\u2014the clandestine militant wing of French intelligence. Then, on 25 December 1953 (Christmas Day), Muhammad Zarqtuni orchestrated a bombing of Casablanca's Central Market in response to the forced exile of Sultan Muhammad V and the royal family on August 20 (Eid al-Adha) of that year.\n\n\n=== Since independence ===\nMorocco gained independence from France in 1956.\n\n\n==== Casablanca Group ====\nJanuary 4\u20137, 1961, the city hosted an ensemble of progressive African leaders during the Casablanca Conference of 1961. Among those received by King Muhammad V were Gamal Abd An-Nasser, Kwame Nkrumah, Modibo Ke\u00efta, and Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, Ferhat Abbas.\n\n\n==== Jewish emigration ====\nCasablanca was a major departure point for Jews leaving Morocco through Operation Yachin, an operation conducted by Mossad to secretly migrate Moroccan Jews to Israel between November 1961 and spring 1964.\n\n\n==== 1965 riots ====\nThe 1965 student protests organized by the National Union of Popular Forces-affiliated National Union of Moroccan Students, which spread to cities around the country and devolved into riots, started on March 22, 1965 in front of Lyc\u00e9e Mohammed V in Casablanca. The protests started as a peaceful march to demand the right to public higher education for Morocco, but expanded to include concerns of laborers, the unemployed, and other marginalized segments of society, and devolved into vandalism and rioting. The riots were violently repressed by security forces with tanks and armored vehicles; Moroccan authorities reported a dozen deaths while the UNFP reported more than 1,000.King Hassan II blamed the events on teachers and parents, and declared in a speech to the nation on March 30, 1965: \"There is no greater danger to the State than a so-called intellectual. It would have been better if you were all illiterate.\u201d\n\n\n==== 1981 riots ====\nOn June 6, 1981, the Casablanca Bread Riots took place. Hassan II appointed the French-trained lawyer Driss Basri, who would later become a symbol of the Years of Lead, with quelling the protests. The government stated that 66 people were killed and 100 were injured, while opposition leaders put the number of dead at 637, saying that many of these were killed by police and army gunfire.\n\n\n==== Mudawana ====\nIn March 2000, more than 60 women's groups organized demonstrations in Casablanca proposing reforms to the legal status of women in the country. About 40,000 women attended, calling for a ban on polygamy and the introduction of divorce law (divorce being a purely religious procedure at that time). Although the counter-demonstration attracted half a million participants, the movement for change started in 2000 was influential on King Mohammed VI, and he enacted a new mudawana, or family law, in early 2004, meeting some of the demands of women's rights activists.On 16 May 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a multiple suicide bomb attack carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to al-Qaeda. Twelve suicide bombers struck five locations in the city.Another series of suicide bombings struck the city in early 2007. These events illustrated some of the persistent challenges the city faces in addressing poverty and integrating disadvantaged neighborhoods and populations. One initiative to improve conditions in the city's disadvantaged neighborhoods was the creation of the Sidi Moumen Cultural Center.As calls for reform spread through the Arab world in 2011, Moroccans joined in, but concessions by the ruler led to acceptance. However, in December, thousands of people demonstrated in several parts of the city, especially the city center near la Fontaine, desiring more significant political reforms.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCasablanca is located on the Atlantic coast of the Chaouia Plains which have historically been the breadbasket of Morocco. Apart from the Atlantic coast, the Bouskoura forest is the only natural attraction in the city. The forest was planted in the 20th century and consists mostly of eucalyptus, palm, and pine trees. It is located halfway to the city's international airport. \nThe only watercourse in Casablanca is oued Bouskoura, a small seasonal creek that until 1912 reached the Atlantic Ocean near the actual port. Most of oued Bouskoura's bed has been covered due to urbanization and only the part south of El Jadida road can now be seen. The closest permanent river to Casablanca is Oum Rabia, 70 km (43.50 mi) to the south-east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCasablanca has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). The cool Canary Current off the Atlantic coast moderates temperature variation, which results in a climate remarkably similar to that of coastal Los Angeles, with similar temperature ranges. The city has an annual average of 72 days with significant precipitation, which amounts to 412 mm (16.2 in) per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) and \u22122.7 \u00b0C (27.1 \u00b0F), respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is 178 mm (7.0 in) on 30 November 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Grand Casablanca region is considered the locomotive of the development of the Moroccan economy. It attracts 32% of the country's production units and 56% of industrial labor. The region uses 30% of the national electricity production. With MAD 93 billion, the region contributes to 44% of the industrial production of the kingdom. About 33% of national industrial exports, MAD 27 billion, comes from the Grand Casablanca; 30% of the Moroccan banking network is concentrated in Casablanca.One of the most important Casablancan exports is phosphate.

A Sephardic Jewish community was in Anfa up to the destruction of the city by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750, the Rabbi Elijah Synagogue was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.Approximately 28,000 Moroccan Jews immigrated to the State of Israel between 1948 and 1951, many through Casablanca. Casablanca then became a departure point in Operation Yachin, the covert Mossad-organized migration operation from 1961\u20131964. In 2018 only 2,500 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca, while according to the World Jewish Congress only 1,000 Moroccan Jews left in Casablanca.Today, the Jewish cemetery of Casablanca is one of the major cemeteries of the city, and many synagogues remain in service, but the city's Jewish community has dwindled. The Moroccan Jewish Museum is a museum established in the city in 1997.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nPublic: University of Hassan II Casablanca\nPrivate:\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Mundiapolis\nUniversit\u00e9 Internationale de Casablanca\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nInternational schools:\n\nBelgium: \u00c9cole Belge de Casablanca\nFrench:\nColl\u00e8ge Anatole France\nLyc\u00e9e Lyautey\nGroupe Scolaire Louis Massignon\nLyc\u00e9e La R\u00e9sidence\nLyc\u00e9e Ma\u00efmonide (FR)\nLyc\u00e9e L\u00e9on l'Africain\n\u00c9cole Normale H\u00e9bra\u00efque\n\u00c9cole Al Jabr\nItalian: Scuola \"Enrico Mattei\"\nSpanish: Instituto Espa\u00f1ol Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez\nAmerican:\nCasablanca American School\nAmerican Academy Casablanca\nGeorge Washington Academy\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nMost of the city's places of worship are Muslim mosques.

Once completed in 2014, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of Raja Casablanca, Wydad Casablanca, and the Morocco national football team. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 93,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the Stade Mohamed V. The initial idea of the stadium was for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to South Africa. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2025. The idea of the stadium was also for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to Canada, Mexico and United States. It is now hoping for the 2030 FIFA World Cup which Morocco is co-bidding with either African neighbors Tunisia and Algeria or two European nations Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nal-Haja al-Hamdawiya, one of the most iconic figures in aita music, was born in Casablanca.

The Casablanca School\u2014a Modernist art movement and collective including artists such as Farid Belkahia, Mohamed Melihi, and Mohammed Chab\u00e2a\u2014developed out of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts of Casablanca in the late 1960s.The Academy of Traditional Arts, part of the Hassan II Mosque complex, was founded October 31, 2012.L'Uzine is a community-based art and culture space in Casablanca.Rebel Spirit published The Casablanca Guide (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0648\u064a, Le Guide Casablancais) a comic book about life in Casablanca.Sbagha Bagha is a street art festival during which murals are created on the sides of apartment buildings.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\nPostcard companies such as L\u00e9on & L\u00e9vy were active in Casablanca. Gabriel Veyre also worked and eventually died in Casablanca. \nMarcelin Flandrin (1889-1957), a French military photographer, settled in Casablanca and recorded much of the early colonial period in Morocco with his photography. With his staged nude postcard photos taken in Casablanca's colonial brothel quarter, Flandrin was also responsible for disseminating the orientalist image of Moroccan women as sexual objects.Casablanca has a thriving street photography scene. Yoriyas is prominent among photographers capturing the economic capital's street scenes, and has attracted international attention.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Casablanca had many movie theaters, such as Cinema Rialto, Cinema Lynx and Cinema Vox\u2014the largest in Africa at the time it was built.The 1942 American film Casablanca is supposedly set in Casablanca and has had a lasting impact on the city's image, though it was filmed entirely in California and doesn't feature a single Moroccan character with a speaking role. Salut Casa! was a propaganda film brandishing France's purported colonial triumph in its mission civilizatrice in the city.Love in Casablanca (1991), starring Abdelkarim Derqaoui and Muna Fettou, is one of the first Moroccan films to deal with Morocco's complex realities and depict life in Casablanca with verisimilitude. Nour-Eddine Lakhmari's Casanegra (2008) depicts the harsh realities of Casablanca's working classes. The films Ali Zaoua (2000), Horses of God (2012), and Ghazzia (2017) of Nabil Ayouch\u2014a French director of Moroccan heritage\u2014deal with street crime, terrorism, and social issues in Casablanca, respectively.

Hicham Lasri and Said Naciri also from Casablanca.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nCasablanca's architecture and urban development are historically significant. The city is home to many notable buildings in a variety of styles, including traditional Moroccan architecture, various colonial architectural styles, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Neo-Mauresque, Streamline Moderne, Modernism, Brutalism, and more. During the French Protectorate, the French government described Casablanca as a \"laboratory of urbanism.\"The work of the Groupe des Architectes Modernes Marocains (GAMMA) on public housing projects\u2014such as Carri\u00e8res Centrales in Hay Mohammadi\u2014in a style described as vernacular modernism influenced modernist architecture around the world.Casam\u00e9moire and MAMMA. are two organizations dedicated to the preservation and appreciation of the city's architectural heritage.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rapid Transit ===\n\nThe Casablanca Tramway is the rapid transit tram system in Casablanca. As of 2019, the network consists of two lines covering 47.5 km (30 mi), with 71 stops; further lines (\u06373 and \u06374) are under construction.Since the 1970s, Casablanca had planned to build a metro system to offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality. However, the city council voted to abandon the metro project in 2014 due to high costs, and decided to continue expanding the already operating tram system instead.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nCasablanca's main airport is Mohammed V International Airport, Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve Marrakech, Rabat, Agadir, Oujda, Tangier, Al Hoceima, and Laayoune, as well as other cities.\nCasablanca is well-served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. New York City, Montreal, Paris, Washington D.C., London and Dubai are important primary destinations.\nThe older, smaller Casablanca-Anfa Airport to the west of the city, served certain destinations including Damascus, and Tunis, and was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It has been closed and destroyed to build the \"Casablanca Finance City\", the new heart of the city of Casablanca. Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport is located in the nearby community of Tit Mellil.\n\n\n=== Coach buses ===\nCompagnie de Transports au Maroc (CTM) offers private intercity coach buses on various lines run servicing most notable Moroccan towns, as well as a number of European cities. These run from the CTM Bus Station on Leo Africanus Street near the Central Market in downtown Casablanca. Supratours, an affiliate of ONCF, also offers coach bus service at a slightly lower cost, departing from a station on Wilad Zian Street. There is another bus station farther down on the same street called the Wilad Zian Bus Station; this station is the country's largest bus station, serving over 800 buses daily, catering more to Morocco's lower income population.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nRegistered taxis in Casablanca are coloured red and known as petit taxis (small taxis), or coloured white and known as grands taxis (big taxis). As is standard Moroccan practice, petits taxis, typically small-four door Dacia Logan, Peugeot 207, or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. Grands taxis, generally older Mercedes-Benz sedans, provide shared mini-bus like service within the city on predefined routes, or shared intercity service. Grands taxis may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.\n\n\n=== Trains ===\nCasablanca is served by three main railway stations run by the national rail service, the ONCF.\n\nCasa-Voyageurs is the main intercity station, from which trains run south to Marrakech or El Jadida and north to Mohammedia and Rabat, and then on either to Tangier or Meknes, Fes, Taza and Oujda/Nador. It also serves as the southern terminus of the Al-Boraq high speed line from Tangier. A dedicated airport shuttle service to Mohammed V International Airport also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.\n\nCasa-Port serves primarily commuter trains such as the Train Navette Rapide (TNR or Aouita) operating on the Casablanca \u2013 Kenitra rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark Casablanca Twin Center. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction, the station is still operational. From 2013, it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the city's new tram network.\nCasa-Oasis was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early 21st century, and officially reopened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern intercity train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to intercity standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nAlthough Mohammed V International Airport receives most international flights into Morocco, international tourism in Casablanca is not as developed as it is in cities like Marrakesh. Casablanca, however, attracts fewer tourists than those of cities such as Fes and Marrakech. \nThe Hassan II Mosque, which is the second largest mosque in Africa and the seventh largest in the world, is the city's main tourist attraction. Visitors also come to see the city's rich architectural heritage.Popular sites for national tourism include shopping centers such as Morocco Mall, Anfa Place, the Marina Shopping Center, and the Tachfine Center. Additional sites include the Corniche and the beach of Ain Diab, and parks such as the Arab League Park or the Sindibad theme park.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAmal Ayouch (born 1966) \u2013 stage and film actress\nSalaheddine Bassir \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nLaarbi Batma \u2013 Moroccan musician and artist, founding member of Nas El Ghiwan\nLarbi Benbarek \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMiriem Bensalah-Chaqroun \u2013 Moroccan businesswoman\nJean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes \u2013 French footballer\nFrida Boccara \u2013 French singer, Winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 1969\nMerieme Chadid \u2013 Moroccan astronomer\nSoufiane Choubani \u2013 Founder of the Moroccan National Debate Team\nJean-Charles de Castelbajac \u2013 French fashion designer\nDizzy DROS \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nGad Elmaleh \u2013 French/Canadian comedian\nLa Fouine \u2013 Moroccan-French rapper\nEl Haqed \u2013 Moroccan rapper\nSerge Haroche \u2013 French physicist who was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physics\nShatha Hassoun \u2013 Moroccan/Iraqi singer\nLydia Hatuel-Czuckermann \u2013 Israeli Olympic fencer\nHicham Mesbahi \u2013 Moroccan boxer\nFrench Montana \u2013 American rapper\nNawal El Moutawakel \u2013 Olympic champion\nNoureddine Naybet \u2013 Moroccan footballer\nMostafa Nissaboury \u2013 Moroccan poet\nHakim Noury \u2013 Moroccan film director\nMaurice Ohana \u2013 French composer\nJean Reno \u2013 French Hollywood actor\nDaniel Sivan \u2013 professor\nAlain Souchon \u2013 French songwriter\nFrank Stephenson \u2013 award-winning automobile designer\nHassan Saada \u2013 Moroccan boxer arrested for alleged rape before Olympic match\nSidney Taurel \u2013 naturalized American CEO of Eli Lilly and Company from 1998 to 2008\nRichard Virenque \u2013 French cyclist\nMuhammad Zarqtuni \u2013 Moroccan nationalist and resistance leader\nAbdallah Zrika \u2013 Moroccan poet\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe 1942 film Casablanca (starring Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart) is supposed to have been set in Casablanca, although it was filmed entirely in Los Angeles and doesn't feature a single Arab or North African character with a speaking role. The film depicts Casablanca as the scene of power struggle between various foreign powers, which had much more to do with the Tangier of the time. The film has achieved worldwide popularity since its release. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, it won three, including Best Picture.\nA Night in Casablanca (1946) was the 12th Marx Brothers' movie. The film stars Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, and Harpo Marx. It was directed by Archie Mayo and written by Joseph Fields and Roland Kibbee. The film contains the song \"Who's Sorry Now?\", with music by Ted Snyder and lyrics by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. It is sung in French by Lisette Verea playing the part of Beatrice Rheiner, and then later sung in English. Liszt's \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\" is played twice, once by Chico on piano as an introduction to the \"Beer Barrel Polka\", and again by Harpo on the harp.\nThe city is featured in The Mysterious Caravan (1975), volume 54 in the original Hardy Boys series.\nCasablanca is the setting for several chapters in Doubleshot, a 2000 James Bond novel by Raymond Benson. In the novel, one of the characters mentions that the 1942 film was shot in Hollywood and not on location.\nCasablanca is one of the key locations in the 2006 video game Dreamfall, as it is where the primary protagonist of the game, Zo\u00eb Castillo, lives. Although the city is imagined in the year 2219, much of the present-day architecture is used for inspiration.\nCasablanca is the setting for the first act of the 2016 World War II romantic thriller film Allied starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nCasablanca is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nRabat Zoo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site of Casablanca\nOfficial Casablanca Tourism Website (in French)\nCasablanca photo gallery (buildings and other landmarks with a history dating back to the French Protectorate)\nOpen Air Museum of 20th century architecture\n Geographic data related to Casablanca at OpenStreetMap",

It is named after King Mohammed V of Morocco.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn March 6, 1955, the stadium was inaugurated under the name Stade Marcel Cerdan in reference to the French boxer, with a capacity of 30,000. The following year, after the independence of Morocco, it took the name of Stade D'honneur.\nAt the end of the 1970s, in preparation for the 1983 Mediterranean Games which were held in Casablanca, the stadium was closed for a major renovation; with an increase of the seating capacity, installation of the electronic panel, and construction of the gymnasium and covered swimming pool around the stadium, it reopened in 1981 under its current name, Stade Mohammed V.\nToday, the complex has the stadium itself, an indoor gymnasium with a 12,000 capacity, an Olympic-sized swimming pool with a 3,000 capacity, a media centre of 650 m\u00b2, a conference room, a meeting room, a care centre, and an anti-doping centre.\nStade Mohammed V is located right in the centre of the city of Casablanca, the international airport of Casablanca is 25 kilometres from the stadium, and the Casa-Voyageurs rail station is 5 kilometres from the stadium. The stadium has a parking lot with a capacity of 1,000 cars.\nAt the time of the 2006-2007 season, the stadium was closed and reopened in April 2007. It currently has a semi-artificial lawn of a high standard.\n\n\n== International competitions ==\nThe complex hosted the following competitions:\n\n1983 Mediterranean Games\n1988 African Cup of Nations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotos at worldstadiums.com\nPhotos at fussballtempel.net",

        "wiki": "Rabat (, also UK: , US: ; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0637\u200e, romanized: ar-rib\u0101\u1e6d; Berber languages: \u2d30\u2d55\u2d31\u2d30\u2d5f, romanized: a\u1e5b\u1e5bba\u1e6d) is the capital city of Morocco and the country's seventh largest city with an urban population of approximately 580,000 (2014) and a metropolitan population of over 1.2 million.  It is also the capital city of the Rabat-Sal\u00e9-K\u00e9nitra administrative region. Rabat is located on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg, opposite Sal\u00e9, the city's main commuter town.\nRabat was founded in the 12th century by the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min as a military town. The city steadily grew but went into an extended period of decline following the collapse of the Almohads. In the 17th century Rabat became a haven for Barbary pirates. The French established a protectorate over Morocco in 1912 and made Rabat its administrative center. Morocco achieved independence in 1955 and Rabat became its capital.\nRabat, Temara, and Sal\u00e9 form a conurbation of over 1.8 million people. Silt-related problems have diminished Rabat's role as a port; however, Rabat, and Sal\u00e9 still maintain important textile, food processing and construction industries. In addition, tourism and the presence of all foreign embassies in Morocco serve to make Rabat one of the most important cities in the country. The Moroccan capital was ranked at second place by CNN in its \"Top Travel Destinations of 2013\". It is one of four Imperial cities of Morocco, and the medina of Rabat is listed as a World Heritage Site. Rabat is accessible by train through the ONCF system and by plane through the nearby Rabat\u2013Sal\u00e9 Airport.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Rabat comes from \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0650\u0651\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0637 (ar-rib\u0101\u1e6d) meaning the ribat, an Islamic base or fortification. This name is short for \u0631\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064e\u062a\u0652\u062d (rib\u0101\u1e6du l-fat\u1e25) meaning the ribat of conquest or  stronghold of victory\u2014a title the city acquired in 1170, due to its military importance.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 12th to 17th century ===\nRabat has a relatively modern history compared to the nearby ancient city of Sal\u00e9. In 1146, the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min turned Rabat's ribat into a full-scale fortress to use as a launching point for attacks on Iberia.\nYaqub al-Mansur (known as Moulay Yacoub in Morocco), another Almohad Caliph, moved the capital of his empire to Rabat. He built Rabat's city walls, the Kasbah of the Udayas and began construction on what would have been the world's largest mosque. However, Yaqub died and construction stopped. The ruins of the unfinished mosque, along with the Hassan Tower, still stand today.\nYaqub's death initiated a period of decline. The Almohad empire lost control of its possessions in Spain and much of its African territory, eventually leading to its total collapse.  In the 13th century, much of Rabat's economic power shifted to Fez. In 1515 a Moorish explorer, El Wassan, reported that Rabat had declined so much that only 100 inhabited houses remained. An influx of Moriscos, who had been expelled from Spain, in the early 17th century helped boost Rabat's growth.\n\n\n=== Corsair republics ===\nRabat and neighboring Sal\u00e9 united to form the Republic of Bou Regreg in 1627.  The republic was run by Barbary pirates who used the two cities as base ports for launching attacks on shipping. The pirates did not have to contend with any central authority until the Alaouite Dynasty united Morocco in 1666.  The latter attempted to establish control over the pirates, but failed.  European and Muslim authorities continued to attempt to control the pirates over many years, but the Republic of Bou Regreg did not collapse until 1818.  Even after the republic's collapse, pirates continued to use the port of Rabat, which led to the shelling of the city by Austria in 1829 after an Austrian ship had been lost to a pirate attack.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n\n==== French invasion ====\nThe French invasion of Morocco began in the east with General Hubert Lyautey's occupation of Oujda March 1907 and in the west with the Bombardment of Casablanca August 1907. The Treaty of Fes established the protectorate March 1912. Acting as French administrator of Morocco, Lyautey, decided to relocate the country's capital from Fes to Rabat.  Among other factors, rebellious citizens had made Fes an unstable place. Sultan Moulay Youssef followed the decision of the French and moved his residence to Rabat.  In 1913, Lyautey hired Henri Prost who designed the Ville Nouvelle (Rabat's modern quarter) as an administrative sector.  When Morocco achieved independence in 1955, Mohammed V, the then King of Morocco, chose to have the capital remain at Rabat.\n\n\n==== Post World War II ====\nFollowing World War II, the United States established a military presence in Rabat at the former French air base.  By the early 1950s, Rabat Sal\u00e9 Air Base was a U.S. Air Force installation hosting the 17th Air Force and the 5th Air Division, which oversaw forward basing for Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-47 Stratojet aircraft in the country.  With the destabilization of French government in Morocco, and Moroccan independence in 1956, the government of Mohammed V wanted the U.S. Air Force to pull out of the SAC bases in Morocco, insisting on such action after American intervention in Lebanon in 1958. The United States agreed to leave as of December 1959, and was fully out of Morocco by 1963. SAC felt the Moroccan bases were much less critical with the long range capability of the B-52 Stratofortresses that were replacing the B-47s and with the completion of the USAF installations in Spain in 1959.With the USAF withdrawal from Rabat-Sal\u00e9 in the 1960s, the facility became a primary facility for the Royal Moroccan Air Force known as Air Base N\u00ba 1, a status it continues to hold.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Neighbourhoods of Rabat ===\nRabat is an administrative city. It does have many shopping districts and residential neighbourhoods. The geographically spread out neighbourhoods are as follows:\nThe heart of the city consists of three parts: the Medina (old town); the Oudayas and Hassan both located to meet the Bou Regreg; and the Atlantic Ocean.\nTo the west, and along the waterfront, there is a succession of neighbourhoods.\nFirst, around the ramparts, there is the old neighbourhoods, Quartier l'Oc\u00e9an and Quartier les Orangers. Beyond that, a succession of mostly working-class districts: Diour Jamaa, Akkari, Yacoub El Mansour, Massira and Hay el Fath are the main parts of this axis. Hay el Fath, which ends this sequence, evolves into a middle-class neighbourhood.\nTo the east, along the Bouregreg, the Youssoufia region (working and middle class) : Mabella; Taqaddoum; Hay Nahda(mostly middle class); Aviation(middle and upper middle class); and Rommani.\nBetween the two axes, from north to south, there are three main neighbourhoods (middle class to affluent): Agdal (Ward Building; a lively mix of residential and commercial buildings. The residents are predominantly upper middle class); Hay Riad (affluent villas; this neighbourhood has experienced a surge of momentum since the 2000s); and Souissi (residential neighborhood).\nOn the outskirts of Souissi, are a number of less-dense regions mainly comprising large private houses to areas that seem out of the city.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Bouregreg Marina ===\nLocated between the Atlantic and the Bouregreg Valley, this river marina is paved with famous historical sites like the esplanade of the Hassan Tower and the picturesque Chellah necropolis, which has witnessed many Mediterranean civilizations pass by.\nOutfitted with the most modern equipment to host up to 240 boats, the Bouregreg Marina aims to become an essential destination for recreational boaters seeking long stays or just a stopover on their way to West Africa, the Caribbean or the shores of North America.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe prefecture is divided administratively into the following:\n\n\n=== Families of Rabat ===\nCalled Rbatis, these families have lived for more than 400 years with many events in common. From the expulsion of the Moriscos to arrive at the foundation of a culture that combines the Arabic and Andalusian cultures, through the Republic of Bouregreg events than other families coming to live in Rabat recently, have not known.\nSince its founding, Rabat was inhabited by several families from the High Atlas with Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur, who founded the city in 1198, then families from many parts of Morocco have settled. Rabat has around 1240 a few hundred fifty families whose families Chiadmi, Regragui, Loudiyi, etc.\nSince the end of the thirteenth century, the city has had an influx of Moriscos expelled from Granada until 1609, the year of total expulsion of Muslims from Spain by Philip III. These families include: Bargach (Vargas); Guedira (Guadaira); Mouline (Molina); Sebbata (Zapata); and Frej.\nThe said families are considered, until today, as \"Rbati's Families of strain\". They are about four hundred families.\nOther families in the city are considered residents of Rabat because they came at the time when Rabat became the capital of the country, either through rural exodus or to work in public administration based in the city since the establishment of the protectorate.\nThe city is on the territory of Zaer, an Arab tribe of Maqil origin. Leo Africanus in the early 16th century the signals in the region of Khenifra there, she continued on to the north to the Rabat region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nRabat features a Mediterranean climate (Csa) with warm to hot dry summers and mild damp winters. Located along the Atlantic Ocean, Rabat has a mild, temperate climate, shifting from cool in winter to warm days in the summer months. The nights are always cool (or cold in winter, it can reach sub 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) sometimes), with daytime temperatures generally rising about 7\u20138 \u00b0C (13\u201314 \u00b0F). The winter highs typically reach only 17.2 \u00b0C (63.0 \u00b0F) in December\u2013February. Summer daytime highs usually hover around 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F), but may occasionally exceed 30 \u00b0C (86.0 \u00b0F), especially during heat waves. Summer nights are usually pleasant and cool, ranging between 11 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) and 19 \u00b0C (66.2 \u00b0F) and rarely exceeding 20 \u00b0C (68.0 \u00b0F). Rabat belongs to the sub-humid bioclimatic zone with an average annual precipitation of 560 mm (22 in).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe biggest place for theatre is the Theatre Mohammed V in the centre of the town.\nThe city has the Rabat Archaeological Museum and the Mus\u00e9e Mohamed VI d'Art Moderne et Contemporain.\nMany organizations are active in cultural and social issues. Orient-Occident Foundation and ONA Foundation are the biggest of these. An independent art scene is active in the city. L'appartement 22, which is the first independent space for visual arts created by Abdellah Karroum, opened in 2002 and introduced international and local artists. Other independent spaces opened few years after, such as Le Cube, also set up in a private space.\n\n\n=== Mawazine ===\n\nMawazine is a music festival in Rabat welcomed by Mohammed VI King of Morocco, that started in 2001 where music groups, fans and spectators come together in a week-long celebration of culture and music both locally and internationally. Musicians such as Scorpions, Rihanna, Elton John, Stromae and many others have performed at the festival.\nMawazine was host to more than 2,500,000 in 2013. Workshops are available for teaching dances and other arts. The festival is free. However, while most areas are free, there are those that require payment, specifically the smaller stages being the historical site of Chellah, the Mohammed V National Theater, and the Renaissance Cultural Center.\n\n\n=== Places of worship ===\n\n\t\t\nThe places of worship are predominantly Muslim mosques. The last remaining synagogue in Rabat is the Rabbi Shalom Zawi Synagogue. There are also Christian churches and temples, including an Evangelical church and St. Peter's Cathedral, which hosts the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rabat.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe Mohammed V University was founded in 1957.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nPoliticians:\n\nReuven Abergel, Israeli social and political activist\nMarc Perrin de Brichambaut, French judge and diplomat\nDominique de Villepin, former Prime Minister of France\nRichard Dell'Agnola, French politician\nOmar El Bahraoui, former mayor of Rabat\nDavid Levy, Israeli politician\nMaxim Levy, Israeli politician\nBernard Squarcini, French counter-terrorism directorScientists, writers and philosophers:\n\nAbdellah Ta\u00efa, writer\nMehdi Elmanjra, scholar\nRobert Assaraf, historian\nAlain Badiou, French philosopher\nMohammed Suerte Bennani, Moroccan novelist\nMohammed Berrada, Moroccan novelist, literary critic, and translator\nHelene Hagan, Franco-American writer anthropologist\nAbdelfattah Kilito, Moroccan writer\nBahaa Trabelsi, Moroccan novelist\nMohammad Naciri, Regional Director for the Arab States and Asia Pacific for the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women)Artists\n\nSamira Said, Moroccan singer\nSaad Lamjarred, Moroccan singer\nHajib, Moroccan Chaabi singer\nShlomo Bar, Israeli musician\nFabienne \u00c9gal, French announcer and television host\nRoland Giraud, French actor\nMacha M\u00e9ril, French actress and writer\nDaniel Siboni, French photographer\nFrench Montana, American Hip-Hop Artist\nBryce Hudson, American painter and photographerSportsmen \n\nSa\u00efd A\u00eft-Bahi, Moroccan footballer\nBouabid Bouden, Moroccan footballer\nCustodio Dos Reis, French road bicycle racer\nYounes Khattabi, Moroccan rugby league player\nAit Hammi Miloud, Moroccan Olympic boxer\nJean Patrick Lesobre, French Rugby Union player\nYoun\u00e8s Moudrik, Moroccan long jumper\nBrahim Taleb, Moroccan long-distance runner\nYounes El Aynaoui, Moroccan tennis player and pride of the countryRoyal descendants \n\nMohammed VI of Morocco, King of Morocco\nPrince Michel, Count of \u00c9vreux\nPrince Moulay Rachid of Morocco\nPrincess Lalla Aicha of Morocco\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nRabat's main airport is Rabat\u2013Sal\u00e9 Airport.\n\n\n=== Trains ===\n\nRabat is served by two principal railway stations run by the national rail service, the ONCF.\nRabat-Ville is the main inter-city station, from which trains run south to Casablanca, Marrakech and El Jadida, north to Tanger, or east to Meknes, Fes, Taza and Oujda.\nONCF operates the Le Bouregreg urban rail for Rabat-Sal\u00e9 agglomeration.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nThe Rabat-Sal\u00e9 tramway is a tram system which was put into service on May 23, 2011 in the Moroccan cities of Rabat and Sal\u00e9.

It is operated by Veolia Transdev with Alstom Citadis trams.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nAfter some years of neglect as investment was directed at the tramway,  the existing operator, STAREO, was displaced in 2019.  A contract was awarded to Alsa-City Bus, a joint venture between Moroccan company City Bus and Spanish company Alsa s.a, a subsidiary of the UK's National Express Group.   The new operator took over in July 2019 with a commitment to three hundred and fifty new buses. These will comprise 102 Mercedes-Benz and 248 Scania-Higer vehicles.

          "The main gate are more impressive than the rest of the Kasbah... but nevertheless the Kasbah with the small allies and the ocean view is okay.",

          "We visited here as part of our tour of the country. It is a citadel north of the city and very popular with tourists. Our guide took us through all the tiny alleyways and streets that are still lived in today by around 300 people, only half of which are locals, the remainder",
          "Beautiful, quaint place. Colours down the lanes were a beautiful mixture of mostly blue and white. Small small traders along the lanes with colour souvenirs and outfits.Doors and doorways were interesting too. Must have the mint tea and the Morocco to die for cookies. Yum.",
          "beautiful than expectation. small but pretty enough. many blue color and overall in comfortable tune. love it.",
          "The kadbah has a lot of nice little alleys and a great view of the river and ocean. Not too big so you don't get lost but big enough for a stroll around. Especially the garden in the lower half was really nice.",
          "We enjoyed what was our first experience of the fantastic blue and white Morocco buildings. You only need a couple of hours to wander the alleyways and look at the gardens. It is so different to anything we have in Australia and this certainly added to the charm. The views over",
          "Nice views of river and ocean. You can have a coffee on a couple of terraces. A few touts around trying to influence your wandering but nothing serious.",
          "This is a lovely (relatively) small and enclosed neighbourhood with blue and white walled alley ways. It is very very picturesque and reminiscent of a Mediterranean seaside village, we took many many pictures. As with most of Rabat, there is a story to be told and history to be",
          "Small neighborhood with lovely alleyways with blue and white painted walls. Guides waiting at the entrance try to latch on to you but accept a firm no. The Andalusian gardens are small but nice. Lots of stray cats and a few stray dogs too. The kasbah is quite small and there is",
          "I had a tour guide walk me through the whole Kasbah, who was very learned with dates, places, names, etc. I tried to keep up but by the end the names and dates were a blur. It's a beautiful keep, with narrow streets (not sure how or why so many cars!). At the end, the guide",

          "This is a beautiful medina that is clean and interesting. This area is well worth a visit if you're in Rabat.",
          "Lovely tiny streets, stunning view to the sea. Did not have time for the museum. Nice promede from the Mausoleum to Kasbah - have a cup of coffe with the view to the picturesque fisherman boats and nets - places in the old town are less attractive",
          "Enjoyed the stroll through Kasbah Oudaias a lot. Many jewels await around a corner, nice place to linger and take photos.",
          "We arrived at this wonderful place around 5 pm, there were mainly local inhabitants and visitors walking around. No crowd no hustle and bustle at all. The view of the Atlantic was stunning! The colour blue is present everywhere and the small and narrow alleys are so picturesque.",
          "A truly amazing experience, wandering through these narrow, cobbled streets should be everyone travellers bucket list. Simple as that.",
          "The Kasbah des Oudaias is a charming walled place with old houses and narrow cobbled streets. All the houses are painted in white with blue shades. One side is lying on the Atlantic Ocean. There is also a garden called Andalusian Gardens. The garden is full of trees and flowers.",
          "We got an impromptu tour from the security guard! Turned out that inside there's a whole neighborhood that's like a separate little town on its own. Wonderful place for great views up on top. Go check it out!",
          "Have tea in the corner bar, mix with the locals and have the best view from the Kasbah as a defender of Rabat would have !",
          "It's a fun area to explore with the signature blue buildings and winding alleys. Be careful of hawkers though. One lady invited us into her house and we ended up having to pay her.",
          "The Oudaias Kasbah is a neighborhood that is a must see. As you enter through a massive ornate gate, you feel like you are in another world with the stunning blue and white homes and shops. This sight is reminiscent of Chefchaouen in its color scheme.",
          "Dropping by for photo is ok. An intended visit is not worthwhile. The view is not so grand. No special nor unique.",
          "We met a young man who gave us a tour - about an hour. We gave him 150 dirham. Worth every single minute.",
          "A Kasbah neighborhood is a must see and Rabat has a stunning one. You enter through a massive ornate gate and you feel like you are in another planet with the stunning blue and white homes and shops. Also look at the gardens. There are also beautiful views of the Atlantic.",
          "What a beautiful spot in Rabat to spend a few hours wandering about. Safe and friendly and very pretty. Loads of photo opportunities and cats.... did I mention CATS... I really enjoyed the gardens too.",
          "Super charming maze of blue painted streets, cool doors, and decor. This is a residential area and home to artists. Stopping at Cafe Maure for some mint tea before departing is a great way to spend the afternoon. Highly recommended!",
          "Beautiful exhibit of the Rabat, Morocco biennale as well as the historical new site. The kasbah was nicely restored and the gardens are a haven for peace and tranquility. It is now my favorite place in Rabat",
          "This is a lovely cute area with a small museum of photographs and lots of cats in the gardens. Small shops to buy souvenirs and a great cafe that juts out to the sea (go right to the back of this cafe through the little lane where their is a small seating area.) There is a man",

          "Kasbahs can be seen everywhere in Morocco. They are fortresses, or better, fortified settlements. The one in Rabat is a beautifu, well-preserved building and it offers nice views of the city. There is a cafe where you can have nice mint tea and very good cookies. People selling",
          "Went to Kasbah de Oudaias (also known as the Fortress of Ouddayas) for a quick visit whilst passing through Rabat. I would have liked to spend a couple of hours longer there as it was a very interesting and picturesque place. Well worth the visit.",
          "Really enjoyed the Rabat Kasbah - you can have a coffee and local sweets looking over the fortified wall onto the Sale river, while watching people bathing and kids jumping into the water - the interior gardens, walls, and adjoining old town, a mini Chefchaouen, are all",

          "Our tour group stopped here. We walked around the alleyways, viewed the Atlantic Ocean for great photos. Shop owners were friendly and welcoming. Lots of cats around...some look fed, others not so much. Recent excavation to the left as you walk in the main gate.",
          "This was the first Kasbah we visited in Morocco. I noticed a lot of cats but no dogs. Apparently they prefer cats because they clean themselves. Not sure if this is accurate. The blue doors are fun to look at because they\u2019re all so different. A lot of fountains, a wonderful",
          "A must place to visit when in Rabat. Beautiful view of the atlantic ocean. You can experience life of people living there, walking around small streets and buy nice souvenirs. Very pleasant place, streets are clean and full of tourists",
          "Something to see if you have some time spare in Rabat. I would suggest Chellah as the best fortified site to visit, the area is not very big and there is not much to visit. Rabat has a lot more to offer",
          "Just what I expected, little winding cobble streets, tiny tavernas and small shops to buy morrocon pottery and decorative items, beautiful.",
          "The Kasbah does have a lot to see, with not a lot to do. It will certainly take a good hour if you cover every part with a slow amble, but the views are stunning & the winding streets are encapsulating. Somewhere you shouldn\u2019t miss, & also a cat lovers dream!",
          "Beautiful panoramic view of the ocean, a must visit when in Rabat. We really enjoyed the views from above!",
          "For Rabat expiriances this tops the list. You simply can\u2019t go to Rabat without a stop here. And it\u2019s a mere minutes from the market",
          "This is the place to visit if you have no time to visit Chefchaouen. This blue and white village definitely makes it worth to visit! Also the sea view!",
          "A must to stroll through, but start at the entrance at the very top of the hill near the museum entrance. If you walk in here you will be able to stroll through the blue village first with its small craft shops (don\u2019t let over anxious vendors tell you what way to go). You\u2019ll",
          "Beautiful gardens. Beautiful streets of blue walls. If your going to sit down, be sure to be prepared to buy a tea or sweet.",
          "You\u2019ll get a real feel for how some people live in Rabat by visiting the Kasbah, which is the big plus. But this isn\u2019t the cleanest part of Rabat (prepare to dodge cat poop on the cobblestone mazes) and although you\u2019ll see some interesting architecture such as the medieval",
          "I was surprised to find something similar to the Harar Jugol of Ethiopia, It\u2019s surrounded by a centuries-old defensive wall that has several large gates, The city is known for its mazelike alleys and traditional houses decorated outside and inside.",
          "really nice to walk around. We were guided around by one of the young boys offering to do so. It was a god idea as it is quit a labyrinth. Be sure to agree upon a price first as he made a whole scene when I found \u20ac5 enough for a 25 minutes tour. Even in Holland that is a good",
          "Visiting Kasbah des Oudaias was like taking a walk in the past. It's beautiful, old, blue painted buildings and streets tells of rich history and even richer culture. Rabat is full of surprises and hidden gems, and this is one of them. Make sure to keep an eye out for the juice",
          "I was glad to make a stop here, first building in Rabat overseeing the Bou Regreg river and Atlantic ocean. It was nice to take a walk here and see the blue and white walls with its narrows streets.",
          "We didn\u2019t think that this place would be so good but it exceeded our expectations. It\u2019s so picturesque, it feels completely different from the rest of Rabat. The blue and white painted houses give the feel of being in Portugal or Greece. There was a low key vibe that made it",
          "This is the most interesting part of the Medina of Rabat. The streets are narrow and rather maze-like, but it certainly seems genuinely old. The sturdy outer walls are impressive, and form some places you get good views of the harbour, beach and river estuary.",
          "From the grandeur and age of the Casbah, the views of ocean and river, carefully manicured garden, souks, blue and white alley ways, cats, and cafes, the casbah has it all! And it\u2019s free to go in and have a look and get lost in the maze! Take some time to really enjoy it! Wear",
          "Walked around the Kasbah streets, found everyone really friendly, no pressure to buy from shops. Great architecture up to the view across the river entrance and beaches. Well worth the walk.",
          "This was another stunning stop in Rabat. The walk through the blue city (as I call it) was amazing. All the little alleyways had walls painted in blue with more blue gates and doorways. This had a feel of a little sleepy town with kids running on the street. There were a few",
          "A piece of architectural mastery and Moroccan history. This beautifully crafted landmark sits overlooking the ocean and is truly spectacular. A trip to Rabat must include a trip to the kasbah. The little blue-washed streets and houses sit within the walled compound and",

          "The Kasbah des oudayas is a lust visit in Rabat. Not far from the Rabat beach and the Old Medina. Once inside the Kasbah the time stops and the view on the bouregreg river a very zen moment",
          "Up hill and down dale, this old casbah wanders over a hillside and overlooks the sea and river. It's very picturesque and filled with little shops, cafes, vendors, craftspeople as these places are. Be careful as the thoroughfares are narrow and the surface is pretty raw and",

          "The Kasbah is a fortress with impressing walls and interesting streets inside. It includes an Andelusian Garden by a historic palace and on the main street the El-Atika Mosque. As we entered the Kasbah, it was approaching the noon hour on a Friday during Ramadan. A muezzin",
          "It is a very beautiful place but like others place in Morocco they always have a guide that try to charge you for an expensive prices. Do not take a guide here they are nice but they will charge you for 10 euros ten minutes of ride. And they do not speak English just French. The",
          "Liked strolling through and enjoyed all the classic Moroccan design. Sometimes you feel like you are in a movie because your surroundings are so different here from an urban setting. Very picturesque and took some great photos.",
          "This was a medieval fortress built in the 1100s and was quite interesting and very pretty on the inside with the telltale blue walls. Intricate narrow passageways led down to a stunning view of a river that separates Rebat from a small sister city that many of the local workers",
          "A short walk thru the Kasbah brings you to the top with sweeping views of the ocean and Rabat. Make sure to check out the Andalusian Gardens on the way down. There are also a few shops with various wares to shop at along the way (to grab a bottle of water and and a Magnum ice",

          "I went to the Oudayas solo with a guide and found it to be the perfect excursion. The views of the river are splendid, the winding alleys are charming, the Cafe Maure is justifiably famous and the Andalucian gardens are lovely and fragrant. The museum in the old Palace is still",
          "Good to walk around, but not friendly place for stroller of our infant grand daughter.The view of sea is excellent",
          "It's a nice view from up there overlooking Sale and the river. The souk and medina is right next to it and there's the beach just behind. There's little area with blue houses similar to Chefchaouen if you don't get to visit Chefchaouen. It's free to walk around inc the Andalucia",
          "The Kasbah is a nice location for a slow walk along the paths, streets, to appreciate the gardens, views, shops, architecture, and save time to enjoy a tea and pastry with a nice view of the river. It's pretty inside and one of the nicer kasbah's we saw on our 10 day adventure.",

          "This is a typical Medina where families live and work. Not as nice as others in Morocco. Some shops for the tourists. And not much else. A cleanup would be a nice idea.",
          "We stayed at a riad in the casbah so walked through it a lot. It's picturesque and charming with the beautiful Andalusian Gardens attached. Worth the visit.",
          "Very nice to wander around here without any plan. Many streets, doors and windows are very nicely decorated. The Andalusian Gardens are worth a visit aswell.",
          "Vestiges of old Rabat, quite lovely to walk around, a bit too touristy. You can walk there from the old medina / market area.",
          "Great to wander the streets, very beautiful scenes everywhere, felt quite safe and lots of chances to take good photos. The view out over the Atlantic was amazing. Be nice to spend some time here and not be in a rush. There is much to enjoy.",
          "Beautiful gardens and architecture. The vendors are not at all pushy. Overall a wonderful experience.",
          "We were surprised that with so many buildings and laneways how quiet and clean it was. The buildings are really interesting and the ocean views were lovely. We only had an hour or so there but really liked what we saw and would have liked to have spent at least a day or so",

          "Walking through the narrow white and blue streets filled with beautiful doors and the typical Fatima Hand was very enjoyable in itself. The views from the top to the ocean are striking. Parts of the kasbah are preserved and definitely worth visiting. A delightful couple of hours",
          "Originally a fortified fortress built by the Almoravids to fight the Barguatiyeh tribes, the Awadaya became increasingly important in the era of the two, who made it a link to the mouth of the Abu Raqrak Valley and called it Mahdia. After the two others became neglected until",
          "The Kasbah of the Oudaias has a long history and is sympathetically preserved, particularly the kasbah walls, ramparts and fortifications and the andalusian gardens. The main square provides splendid views of the Atlantic Ocean, Sale, the Bouregreg River and Rabat's lighthouse.",

          "I was amazed by the view from the kasbah. Its a historical site overlooking the sea. Must visit site in rabat. Perfect place to take in the view.",
          "I loved the doors . While you walk through the neighborhood you will see white and blue houses. It\u2019s a picturesque neighborhood, you will love take a picture in that area. If you see a street in white, it means it\u2019s a dead end.",
          "We're the highlight of this visit to the Kasbah. It has a nice garden and walk up to the hill through this nice blue and white narrow lanes. On top there is an open view area giving the nice view of Rabat-sale area and the coastline. It is also worth going around using small",
          "The oldest current structure at the site of the Kasbah is a mosque. Dating from the 10th century, it was restored in the 18th century. It was granted World Heritage Status in 2012. Today, the Kasbah remains a popular free tourist attraction within Rabat, offering scenic views",
          "You will probably want to bring a camera to capture images of the very interesting homes in the a residential neighborhood, particularly its distinct blue and white walls. The variation in design, construction and decoration of the house doors offers another possible",

          "There are some steps and uneven pavement to deal with walking around this Kasbah, but worth seeing. Beautiful views.",
          "We walked in this little Medina looked like place. It has a very nice terrace on the top where you can admire the ocean. Very peaceful. Definitely a must seen place in rabat. The coffee is nice where you can sit and drink mint tea and eat Moroccon sweets.",
          "We toured only a small part of the Kasbah and saw very old residences (all painted white and blue), tight lanes, cafes overlooking the river and Sale and a beautiful French garden. We spent only 20 minutes in the Kasbah, though our tour guide told us the rest of the larger area",
          "What a beautiful place .We were staying in a riad close to the Kasbah so went there for a walk on a couple of occasions.It really is a delightful area with its narrow, winding streets. A lot of rebuilding is taking place so it was chaotic in parts but even so is well worth a",

          "Very interestingly located kasbah with commanding views of the Sale harbor and Atlantic Ocean. Entry through the massive gates and thread your way thru the narrow blue highlighted alleyways to the fortress rampart overlook. Very nice views and another slice of Morocco life.",
          "Doesn\u2019t take overly long to go round, we spent less than two hours here but it\u2019s well worth the visit and free!",
          "This is a must-do since you can visit the Medina which parts reminded me of Chefchaouen because of the blue. Nice little shops and spectacular views at the top. We walked up and down and had a coffee at the beach front restaurant. There is a surf school there too. Nice beach",
          "Loved the walk although was not easy and did not take photos because of construction going on February, 2019. There are several coffee shops on the bay if you fancy a drink or a snack",

          "Real fantastic.You need an explorer with you ,to show all tyhe history of this Kabah.We had 1 from 3000 that lives inside this kasbah!!!.i dont remeber his name but without him ,we could learn so much about this incredible kasbah",
          "It was quite enjoyable for wandering around and looking and absorbing the history. The guide was not needed really, but he did give us some tidbits Worth visiting.",
          "This old site where Rabat was first established. The outside walls are picturesque. Not much to see inside. Only a short visit for some photos.",
          "Nice place where you can see how rabat was foundes. Small streets with the traditional houses. You dont need a guideman , despite several will offer you their services.",
          "There is a great little place to sit and look out over the water but beware price was more than I would pay in Canada x2. Everything else about this casbah is lack lustre, probably because we\u2019ve been spoilt recently by Scottish castles. The gardens close by were pretty run",
          "Great place to visit if you are looking to take some incredible photos of Rabat. The maze of white/blue houses, shops and cafe's line the walkways. Grab a trinket, a souvenir, or some mint tea. Not to be missed if you are in Rabat. Almond style pastries are also offered for",
          "One of points of view in Rabat. Liked that place tooooooo much. I had time to visit CHEFCHAOUEN which is well known by blue walls but had a opportunity in Rabat to fill something similar",
          "Beautiful walk path inside an ancient fortress that leads to a spectacular open seas. Arrays of White and blue houses make it beautiful for photo shoot. Walk down the staircase, you will reach a Beautifully decorated ancient garden, another place for photo shoot.",
          "Apparently this Kasbah is similar to the one in Chefchaouen. It's crisp white and blue walls are stunning and the views across to Sale and out to the sea are great, especially on a bright sunny day. Stop for coffee or mint tea on the patio overlooking the ocean.",
          "For the common traveller, it is just a stop to take pictures and drink a tea in the Moorish caf\u00e9 inside the Kasbah. But for those with some knowledge of the city history, all the spots, houses and narrow streets tell the stories of those people who built the astonishing pieces",
          "The white and blue colored houses are just like Chefchaouen. Stunning views of the Atlantic from the top. Spectacular garden in the Kasbah, loved the variety of trees and plants. Local guide was very informative.",
          "Lovely place to visit. Beautiful view of the sea and rocks from the terrace. We enjoyed the caf\u00e9 maure and the home made cakes. The view from the caf\u00e9 is superb. The garden beside is lovely.",
          "This was one of the stops on a day tour of Rabat I did and was amazed. The kasbah was very old, but very well maintained. There is a small town concealed within, accented with a number of ornamental doors. All of the alleys lead to a small plaza where there is a spectacular",

          "Great place to take a short trip into history. The views from the terrace were great, we loved seeing all the old, traditional doors and listening to the history behind the Kasbah. Only one downside, there is no ramps for strollers so it was quite difficult climbing the stairs",
          "This is a fabulous maze of narrow lanes lined with little blue and white houses. When we visited in November it was really peaceful here. When exploring, you will also find a nice terrace overlooking the ocean and there's a caf\u00e9 there too. Bordering the Kasbah, there are the",

          "Kasbah is a very nice place to visit. It is a walk from the old market and shoe market . It has a great terrace overlooking the ocean and beach. A caf\u00e9 as well, and you can get the feel of Chefchaoun and its blue painted walls by walking through its maze like streets. Amazing,",
          "We had a very pleasant guided tour with our guide Youssef who was very informative and had a great sense of humor. We were surprised by the amount of cats roaming the narrow, blue and white colored streets of the Kasbah. We went there before 9:30 am and the Kasbah was just",
          "This Kasbah in Rabat looks brown as big from outside, but once you enter it is filled with amazing colour. From the gorgeous gardens to the blue and white cobbled and winding streets. You get amazing views of the Atlantic Ocean from here too with many friendly cats welcoming",

Unsuspecting, you realize about 10 minutes later you\u2019ve either found the nicest retired guy in the world",

They will lead people around the Kasbah and some will show you some neat places like the gardens, a little tower or",
          "So much history in every building, such diversity with a shared past, it\u2019s almost like time stood still. So many movies must have been made after this place, at this place.",

          "We had little expectations of Rabat and the Kasbah was one of the 4 reasons we were glad to be proven wrong! Such a nice structure- but the highlight was wandering the narrow blue and white streets which are reminiscent of Greece- but with a Moroccan flair. Loved having tea",
          "I doubt we were owing toget robbed, but this was the first place to visit on our Moroccan vacation. Every stereotype that we had about getting lost and robbed was present. We did have troubles getting around. We did not get robbed, but local so-called guides were annoying",
          "The garden at this kasha\u2019s is a little on the wild side, but the terrace where you can buy mint tea and delicious pastries is a lovely perch with a beautiful view across the river. Not much to see here.",

          "I strongly recommend that place for visiting. It is the point where Morocco was founded and you could see it while walking around. In side of the castle there is lovely streets from the old Moroccan times. You can have some of the locals to show you around but it wont be for",

          "Please be aware of locals trying to tell u some things abut easbah is closed or will be closing soon. They lie and will want money in the end. Do not listen, just keep going, there is no guards at the gates, (although it may look like), no tickets needed. We were approached by",
          "Great time wandering around the alleyways. The fort (\"Kasbah\") offers a great panoramic view of the coastline. Watch the surfers from the terrace of the fort.",
          "This is very unique and worth your time and energy. We did a day visit then returned for a dinner that evening.",
          "When entering the Kasbah, you\u2018ll feel like you\u2018re in a time capsule. Everything slows down, goes quiet and you\u2018ll be able to soak up all the impressions - from the beautiful view over the atlantic ocean to the small alleys with the blue-white houses (nope, not Santorini!) and",

          "This place really does have to be seen to be believed. Beautiful kasbah with all walls half-painted in a deep cobalt blue, which is visually delightful. Keep away from the walls though as they are kept coloured by chalk which transfers to clothes and little hands! Gorgeous",
          "The place is historical and cultural to the city. It is hugee. And surrounds alot of places. It was very interesting for us to explore. One visit is enough, but be expected to spend a good few hours there as it is quite a vast area to cover.",
          "You can do it on your own...no need to accept the \u2018voluntary\u2019 assistance of a guide. We did, but the terms were clear and we learned a fair bit on our first afternoon in Morrocco.",
          "Our driver dropped us off outside of the kasbah and told us where he'd be waiting for us. We really had no idea what we were doing, so just started walking. The streets were charming and a lot of people wandering around. A gentleman came out and started speaking to us - after",
          "Wonderful gem hidden away behind high walls, this blue and white section of historical Rabat is a must see. Interesting sights and small streets and alleyways. Please ask people if you can photograph them, this is where they live. Have a look at the huge original gates. Note",
          "Very impressive fortress from the outside with large fortified walls and massive gates. Inside you can wander around the blue painted alleyways to see the houses and then eventually finish in the tranquil and cooling gardens before exiting via another gate. There are also great",

          "From the photographers point of view, this is the place to be in Rabat. Probably the oldest part of old city - 800 years - (except of Chellah of course) you can enter through the main gate upstairs, or through the Andalousian garden. Enormous main gate Bab Oudaia (build 1195)",
          "Situated in oldest part of town. Entrance in kasba is through Almohads gate called Bab Oudaia. On the end of street is Plateforme du Semaphore with nice view to ocean, river Bou Regreg and Sale town on the opposite side of river.",

          "Very nice grounds to stroll around. My favorite part was the residential neighborhood with the blue and white walls. There is a cafe to stop at and try some tea or the Almond based pastries. The tea was 10 per glass and the pastries were 8 each. I would allocate 1 hour here.",
          "On a business trip I found time to go on a quick trip round the Kasbah. I was collared by a guide as I arrived who would not be deterred from accompanying me; but he turned out to be informative and helpful, if expensive. The Kasbah - a walled town within Rabat, with",

          "The Kasbah is totally different from Medinas and Souks. Walking up and down these hilly alleyways, where all the houses are blue and white, you feel like you are in an Aegean village, Bougainvillea included. The Kasbah is quiet and refreshing, with several caf\u00e9s down near the",
          "Great views of the Wadi Bouregreg, the crenellated walls, peaceful Andalusian garden, colourful alleys, architecture to admire and just a great place to wander without any hassle.",
          "There is a very impressive ornate gate leading into this Kasbah (although you can only actually walk through a small side entrance to the right of it). Makes for a great photo with the large stone steps leading up to it. Upon arriving at the gate (particularly if you look like",

          "The Kasbah was originally built for strategic purposes as it dominates he mouth of the Bou Regreg River. You enter though an imposing ornamental gate and then turn down Rue Jama. The buildings are noteworthy for the blue and white colour. Follow the Rue to the end and enjoy the",
          "When you first enter through the large gate, it seems to be like any other kasbah found in Morocco. However, you\u2019ll be greeted by white washed buildings and blue walls. It\u2019s very reminiscent of the Medina of Chefchaouen. Avoid getting a guide as it is relatively small and easily",
          "i had an impression about Rabat before that it's a capital city , and there is no kind of respect of art , But when i visited it it's totally different impression about it , you can find Art everywhere , and there is street performance everywhere , and also many museum painting,",
          "The Kasbah in Rabat is really lovely; make sure you have time to get lost within it. The white washed buildings with blue doors is magical - it's like a scene from a movie. It's a total must! Also, you can relax in the lovely garden within it, and play with super cute kittens :)",
          "The houses are painted white and blue, which represents the sky and sea. This is the first thing you'll notice as soon as you enter the gates. I came about 4 in the afternoon and I was met at threshold by a young man, who informed me that they were closing in an hour. He was a",
          "I only wish we were there on a sunny day. The blue walled city was really a cool thing to see. We learned all about the Barbery pirates that patrolled these waters. A popular place to see but be on the look out for scammers one of the only places in Morocco where I noticed a",
          "I do not consider this place particularly interesting, but it is a must visit if you are visiting Rabat with time available It is an old fortress, with a cluster of houses in the interior. Refuse the guides you offer to guide them, because the site is safe and easy to visit.",
          "I love the views looking out to the ocean and beach. So many local people were there having fun, and boys playing soccer on the beach! Didn't go into the cafe on the blue house alley, although it looks enticing! A local lady from Meknes I met there was very friendly and we",
          "One of the loveliest things to do in Rabat. In here you can feel the andalusian / moorish atmosphere brought by those who were chased by Catholic inquisition in the 15th century. Narrow streets and blue and white houses just on top of Bou-Regreg river delta. Tey settled here to",
          "After walking through the beautiful, intricate Bab or gate from the 12th century into this little village, we didn\u2019t know what to expect. At first it seemed like an alleyway leading nowhere.There are narrow walkways surrounded by buildings painted white and blue with little",

          "This is the best place to visit in Rabat! history, beauty, gardens, all is there to make the visit a memorable one!",
          "The buildings within the Kasbah itself were a pleasure to walk between. We received no hassle, unlike Fes and Marrakesh. As a result we ended up buying some souvenirs as we didn\u2019t feel pressured to buy. Definitely visit the cafe and sample mint tea and freshly baked cakes.",
          "Kasbah is a must if you visit- such a pleasant surprise. Winding blue and white washed streets with a few cafes and shops peppered about. Easy access to the beach and we stopped of at the attached Andalusian gardens for an afternoon rest.",
          "Somehow we were forced on a tour by a self appointed? tour guide. He told us barely more than we already read in our travel guide and rushed us through the kasbah. Not the best of experiences. The place itself is really nice. We do recommend having a look. Just be prepared to",
          "A must see while in Rabat. Beautiful city views and photo opportunities. Nice ocean view and limited shopping. Be ready to politely refuse henna!",

          "The Kasbah is worth seeing and contains a lovely village inside. It's easy to get lost so I recommend using a smartphone map like Map Me for navigating the area. The gardens are lovely and the terraces offer generous views. One thing I would warn against is fake guides. They",
          "This is one of the prettiest places in Rabat, in my opinion! I love the blue city that is hidden behind the walls of the Kasbah and the views you get from the lookout are gorgeous. That being said, beware on the weekends and even during of the guides who will try to take you on",
          "Wow! It was amazing and a must see place in Rabat. It\u2019s like a small tourist village in the city. All houses and streets are white and painted with blue. You can have the best view of Atlantic Ocean from here.",

          "The kasbah covers a modest area but it is a good place to get used to the intricacies of Morocco's historic towns knowing you can't get too lost. There is a good garden, nice places to have mint tea and chances to shop, all very satisfactory and a good way to fill an afternoon.",

          "As noted by other reviewers the Oudaia Kasbah is not as large or impressive as some others in Morocco. Nonetheless, while in Rabat it is a must see. There are barely a handful of streets yet it is still easy to get lost wandering around. The streets are very atmospheric. Many of",
          "It\u2019s lovely! Steeped in history, ok it\u2019s not Chefchaouen but it\u2019s just as charming. Get dropped off at the main gate, walk in, it\u2019s free, don\u2019t let the \u201cguides\u201d lead you in. Take your time pottering about. Lots of charming twists and turns up to the views over the ocean and the",
          "Another Rabat site which for us was nice without being anything particularly notable. As an old town goes, it was fine, but didn't stand out above others. I didn't think there was anything particularly attractive or interesting about it. If I was in Rabat then I would go back,",
          "The Kasbah des Oudaias offers visitors a chance to explore the gardens, streets and alleyways of Rabat\u2019s ancient walled citadel. The lower kasbah has green lovely spaces and shops, including delightful places to enjoy local teas and sweets, The upper kasbah is a maze of alleys",

          "Better than other sights in Rabat, especially for the views and gardens but to be honest still nothing that special. Overall unless you happen to be in Rabat, not worth a detour to travel there.",
          "This is a small medina (old city) but perhaps the prettiest that I saw in our grand tour of Morocco. It is mostly residential so lacks the hustle and bustle that souks (markets) attract and we did not have to fight against the tide of fellow tourists. All the dwellings are",
          "After walking past the houses you will reach the the kasbah walls which over look the sea. The view from here out to the ocean is excellent and you can even see the neighbouring town of Sale. The weather was nice so could have easily spent an hour staring at the view. Easily",
          "Kasabah means fort & this beautiful place from the 12th century felt the the morocco I see in all the books. Beautiful doors, blue painted buildings, history and a view. Another local insisted on being our guide - wouldn't take no for an answer and also insisited on 150 MAD",

          "At the beginning, I didn\u2019t want to go there as I saw some pictures and I thought that it\u2019s like a castle and useless to see. However, I went there and I was so happy to visit that place. The houses there are so nice, so nice to take a lot of photos also. People are nice and",

          "If you\u2019re there the Kasbah is nice to pop into and take in the little flower gardens and maybe relax for a moment or two. A good spot for any young kids to let off some running and exploring steam too.",
          "Interesting gardens,quaint walkways,stunning seascape and Kasbahs stocked with tourist souvenirs. Have some mint tea whilst enjoying the peaceful seascape. Definitely a cultural/ historical oasis in the city. A guide is an absolute necessity. Good photo ops.",

          "This was a nice to visit and I loved the blue colors all over the neighborhood. There are shops, but it's mostly for tourists and I didn't bother. I just enjoyed wandering and catching cool views of the sea and coast. I highly recommend a visit.",
          "A small Medina giving you an idea of life in a Medina. The blue and white colors are lovely. I think the blue dates back to the Jews of Morocco",

          "Within these walls is a living breathing moorish city where people live. There re breathtaking view points at many points from where you can get a great view of Sale, the Atlantic and the beach. Worth a visit. There is a beautiful old fashioned team house with delicious moroccan",

          "We were dropped off by our tour guide at the entrance of this kasbah to take a brief stroll within this compound. It wasn't long before we met a persistant chap that insisted on taking us through the kasbah to view the ocean nearby. It was an interesting stroll as he pointed",
          "This fort is situated on the ocean and has stunning views over a surfing beach, of the lighhouse and of the city. Within the fort is a community of homes that are painted with white and blue paint which gives it a quaint feeling. It also a beautiful garden with an ancient",
          "Approaching the Kasbah, I thought we were actually entering a castle of sorts, but it ended up being so much more. Inside I explored the winding streets filled with pretty blue & white painted buildings, shops, cafes, galleries and gardens. A large terrace offers wonderful views",

          "The Kasbah area is next to the sea with views of the Atlantic. We only wandered about at night but the place was peaceful and felt safe. There are a few cafes and an Art Gallery (closed of course at night)",

          "Walked up to the Kasbah from the train station. Takes about 25mins. Was a bit tricky to find the entrance. Once inside it was a very interesting meander through the narrow streets past homes. The gardens are very peaceful and a place to find some shade. There are lots of cats",

          "It has been 7 years since i weren't in Rabat. It changed a lot, not only in good. I was there with my grandma my mother and my sister, we come from europe but we are from morrocow. When we left the coffee with the amazing view (try it but don't drink in the glasses they don't",
          "Its really neat to walk through this old Kasbah! It is well worth it. Ladies, guard your hands, as the henna tattoo women can be a little aggressive/pushy and will just start putting it on your hands. Also, there are \"tour guides\" who will appear to be helpful and wanting to",
          "This is definitely a nice place to visit. A mini Chefchaouen, the inner city itself is beautiful, so is the Garden, and the view of the river outlet and sea are quite nice. More importantly across the street is the infamous Rabat Madina and it's bazaar, which you must explore to",
          "Visiting the old town in Rabat you feel like travelling back to the old days. Narrow streets, old but refurbished houses. A must to do in Rabat.",
          "amazing place and careful, just stay away from the boys who will offer u a tour, u can walk around by ur self.",
          "The Kasbah of the Udayasis a Kasbah located at the mouth of the Bouregreg river opposite Sal\u00e9. The edifice was built in the 12th century during the reign of the Almohad Caliphate (AD 1121-1269). When the Almohads had captured Rabat and destroyed the Kasbah of the Almoravid",
          "Absolutely fascinating! The local \"tour guides\" are worth more than the 120 dirham which they charge. Uthmaan even invited us into his home to share jumuah lunch with his mom Aicha. Very hospitable and knowledgeable and so humble.",
          "This place is a must see with narrow roads and beautifully painted walls in blue. But be aware that near the entrance, there are men who pretend to be friendly and wanting to show the place for money. They can be pushy and we got tricked into getting one (trusty people we are).",
          "We use the top entry and went straight, some salespeople will say it's closed, but that's just a strategy for you to stop and talk to them, pretend you don't understand and keep moving forward. You'll pass by a mosque, it isn't open for visitation, and in a few minutes you will",
          "Like all 'monuments' or historic buildings in Morocco, if you stand outside, someone will offer a tour for money. Not sure if our guide was an 'official' one, but he did a pretty good job, walking us to some parts we might not have found so easily. We paid 200 MAD or about 20E",
          "There is no doubt of the beauty to be found in the Oudaias. The meandering paths, the wonderful garden, the outdoor tea room. IF you succumb to a \"guide,\" by all means, negotiate the price in advance. (In truth, you should wander on your own. You can't really get \"lost.\"",
          "A beautiful part of Rabat - little Greece in Morocco. Lovely blue and white buildings and great views of the ocean. Pleasant cafes and lots of people watching opportunities.",
          "For this you have to walk through the narrow street to get the view. You see various old styled doors on the way.",
          "This was really my favourite spot in Rabat with its narrow streets and beautifully painted houses, but for me the best thing was the view of the sea, and the architecture of the stairways leading down",
          "The Kasbah is located where the river meets the sea. You can look back at the city, or you can look down on the beach. The day I visited, there was mist along the shore, which made the fort appear a bit mysterious. There are homes on the hill inside the walls of the fortress,",
          "Nice Kasbah, and with a little tip you can also have a guide that explains you about the buildings, people that used to live, the origin of the city, etc. Once you got in, you can walk between the tiny streets and houses painted in white and blue, that stand for peace and ocean,",
          "We enjoyed this visit. The little streets inside the Kasbah with the white and blue paint are very interesting. You need to walk to the very end so you can get out to the open area to overlook parts of Rabat and the ocean. Easy to get to and you do not need to have a tour guide",
          "Our Moroccan Tour started with this kasbah. Our tour guide explained that originally it was both a center of commerce and a fort for protection. We started at the Bab El Kebir (the upper gate) and proceeded walked through the kasbah . Just inside the gate we visited a public",
          "We entered the Kasbah the rough it's newly renovated gate area. Here- like in Chefchaouen the buildings are painted blue and white. Some say it is because the pirate ships were painted blue they used the remaining paint to paint houses, others say it is some remains of religion",
          "Narrow alleyways, blue walls , interesting perspecitves, but the artisan work was lacking both quality and quantity.",
          "Here you will find a clean and peaceful zone which is a nice getaway from the Medina if you happen to be staying there. Some of the alleyways resemble Greece, and there is a nice place for tea and pastry with a view.",
          "The view of the Ocean is wonderful as are the cooling breezes. the small alley's lead you to a beautiful garden. We took many photos of the greenery, walls of the Kasbah, and the locals themselves. Lots of cats and people relaxing.",
          "Perfect spot :) It is a town in a capital, so nice and with amazing views ;) From top you can see both Sale and Rabat",
          "Great to explore around, notice the small streets and blue painted walls. Continue through to have a view of the sea. Continue down to a charming terrace for tea and pastries overlooking the water. Don't fall for the trick to need a 'guide' or that they'll point you in",
          "This kasbah is like a taking a walk on a Greek island which has somehow been transported to Morocco. Rabat is a very stylish city anyway so it's hardly a surprise that their kasbah is unique and classy. The narrow winding streets were spotlessly clean and there was a profusion",
          "Beautiful garden, beautiful sea view, beautiful architecture. I would definitely visit again if I travel to Morocco next time!",
          "The old town is compact, a mix of small shops and residences, with a mosque in the center. It is housed within the walls of the12th century fortification, which was restored during the 17th-18th centuries. I did not expect to see blue-washed walls before arriving in",
          "I was transported to a completely different land when I visited this kasbah. We got a local tour guide who took us around and explained the history. The doors were beautifully designed and decorated. The Sea view was beautiful.",
          "It is definitely a place to be seen in Rabat. A beautiful kasbah in the citadel. When you go up the hill from Chefchaouen-like narrow blue streets, you will have a wonderful view of the ocean. You can buy something from the small bazaar inside the town. It is delightful to sit",
          "do go to this place, very different than europe. You can feel the atmosphere of the place and get strange things to eat.",
          "The old part of the town, where there are about 3000 inhabitants. Stonewalls with tiled stone. All buildings are painted in blue white. Doors and ornaments on buildings are different depending on the religious affiliation of tenants. My disappointment with the arrangement of",
          "I fell for the Kasbah Oudaisas. The old wall, the gates, the intricate plaster work around the gates, the narrow winding alleys, painted half blue. One felt one was back in time. The super clean alleys were impressive. It was early morning so it was not busy at all. If we",
          "We lived in Rabat over 3 years until 2012. Recently er-visited. The Kasbah is much improved and the walking underfoot is much easier and the garden have been improved . Great views over Sale and out to sea from the top.this really is a living monument with people living an",

          "Kasbah des Outdaias we visited on our peregrine tour of Rabat. It is definitely an older part of Rabat. I liked the old clay buildings painted in white and blue colours. I loved the view of the coast. I'm assuming it is similar to Greek Islands. Hints: good footwear, suitable",
          "This is a kasbah where locals still reside. Stroll the narrow passages and see an ancient bakery with a huge oven fueled by hand with wood chips, a musician playing folk tunes on his gimbri, a beautiful garden, and views of the ocean. Relax for a bit with tea, fruit juices, and",
          "They had a beautiful resting area to have mint tea and local pastries facing the ocean. The gardens have exoctic flowers.",
          "Kasbah des Oudaias is a district with old clay buildings painted in white and blue colors like on the Cyclades in Greece. From the top you can see Rabat beach and seaside. Fun place to walk in the narrow streets.",
          "Fascinating history here. And beautiful views of the water. Our visit was marred by a persisitent henna tattoo artist named Sarah who did more than we requested and over charged us. It was a waste of too much money.",
          "Many of the homes have a blue wash, so the effect is picturesque. The inner gardens and artefacts are lovely.",
          "We have lost our phone in the market which was a shock because we have the phone in our hands. Just be more careful when you travel to here but all the rest is very nice",
          "What a nice place to visit and see the winding roads and nice blue-painted walls of the Kasbah. Our guide told us that the front steps of this Kasbah was a scene in one of the Mission Impossible movies where Tom Cruise drove a motorcycle down the steps. Our tour group of 35",
          "This part of the city is very special for its colours and sea view. If you stroll down the hill, you can also have lunch, since inside the kasbah area there are no such facilities. Ignore the locals, they only care for your money. Don't talk at them at all.",
          "This is a place not to miss. Take a walk slowly and stop and cvhat with local people. All is bvright in white and azul, full of light, climbing not very tiring upto the terrace with a view on the corniche and on the river. Along the climb a colourful bazar with a coffee shop",
          "This is one of my favourite spots in Rabat as it provides a unique atmosphere of peacefulness and beautiful sceneries. The gardens are well maintained and the nearby shops are good.",
          "This is a gorgeous place. Narrow blue and white streets that lead to an ocean view. The houses are so quaint with their terraces and clothes drying. Definitely climb all the way to the top. It closes at a certain time but if you pay the person they will let you through. The view",

          "If you visit Rabat, a mix of the contrasts between the ancient and the new, don\u00b4t miss the visit to this Kasbah, really ancient. Don\u00b4t expect, or intend to buy anything here (fonly ew shops, with the traditional tourist souvenirs..), somewhat filthy and smelly, but don\u00b4t miss a",
          "Upon entering we were followed by a local man who led us around the Kasbah. He was well informed and gave a good insight into the fortress but these details could be taken from the internet or guide book without the hefty charge the supposed residents can seek for the privilege!",
          "Set in Morocco\u2019s capital on the mouth of the Bou Regreg river, the Udayas Kasbah (or as it\u2019s also known, Oudayas Kasbah) is one of the country\u2019s most unique sites and in my opinion one of the most beautiful casbah in the country. Originally built in the 12th century and",
          "Some nice art shops, small contained area. Mostly closed on Fridays. Worth a short wander perhaps. Construction work in progress.",
          "Do not forget to check this place when you visit Rabat. A trip to the Oudaiya is a must! Remember to avoid the local tour guides, try to sightseeing on your own :)",
          "The Kasbah is beautiful and full of life and history. The interior garden is a great place to lounge, take tea or read a novel. There is an adjacent cafe overlooking the Oued Bourereg (river) where you can imagine corsair ships being docked. Great for a Sunday walk, a history",
          "Awesome area to check out! I really enjoyed walking around the area. Just beware of very aggressive vendors, especially with henna. They'll \"attack\" with the henna and make you pay for it.",
          "Right in the center og town. Open to the public and under restoration. You must have Moroccan mint tea, while enjoying the scenic sea view.",
          "Full disclosure: we visited this in pouring rain, which may have dampened (literally) our enthusiasm. Nice to view from the outside (walls, cannon), but once you're inside, pretty ho-hum.",
          "Beware of pop-up tour guides that try to take you on tours and expect a tip. You can easily walk and navigate the streets yourself. Very photogenic, but tiny streets are a little stinky (think cat pee/poo) and it's easy to get lost. Worth the trip for the photos alone and the",
          "This place has magnificent and beautiful views. It's great to have a long walk and visit the locals in this kasbah and it's ruins. Beautiful.! Just grab a fresh orange squeeze or pomegranate juice along the way while walking all the way up for a view of the sea. Stupendo.!",
          "Located at the mouth of Rabat's Bou Regreg, the Kasbah des Oudaias is a must-see. Start with a visit to the residential filled with narrow \"streets\" and colorful walls and doors. Once inside the actual Kasbah, the beautifully maintained gardens are a private oasis.",
          "It is undergoing restoration at the moment but it doesn't detract from the visit. The gardens are small but well kept. The cafe is a nice spot with good views and very relaxed... catering for a mix of locals and tourists. Only tea and certain cakes on offer though. I personally",
          "Strategic position guarding the point where the river meets the Atlantic,with fabulous views and vistas out to sea and across to Sale.Lovely Andalusian garden you can spend time in too.Some nice little cafes and scenic pedestrian streets,well worth visiting.Ordinary Moroccans",
          "If you get the opportunity to stop over in Rabat, a trip to the Oudaiya is a must! A beautiful small neighborhood painted in blue, the Oudaiya is the perfect place to get lost exploring. Come at sunset, and be sure to stop over at the small cafe overlooking the river outlet. the",
          "The Kasbah is a small area in the old town of Rabat. The house are painted with blue and white, which is making the charm of the place. Not so fancy as Chefchaouen, you might still find some beautiful spots for those blue streets photos. The area is rather small, so don't get",
          "The gardens are small yet beautiful. There is a small museum. The real attraction lies just past the gardens, having a mint tea with a view of the ocean. The tea is 10 dh, and cookies are priced per piece. Tour buses roll thru here with large groups, but do get let this turn you",
          "Quirky, artisanal, walk. Artists at work in their studios. The view at the end is panoramic as you see the key, the ocean, and the river.",
          "We visited this on a sunny January day expecting something picturesque and were disappointed. It all looked a bit run down and neglected. The views from the square overlooking the sea were nice but nothing special. There are a few shops in the main street, and nice that we were",
          "If you are looking for a place when u can listen to youth singing and playing guitars, if you want to observe the people, play with kittens, and have a nice walk inside the Kasbah and explore the small streets painted in white and blue !",
          "Kasbah small town decoration in blue color. Nice view from the coast walking nearby. Also a town of cats surroundings in place.",
          "We enjoyed roaming the colorful alleyways filled with flowers and artistic doorways. There are many opportunities for pictures and for making small purchases such as the candies and coffees. We spent time in the garden and had an enjoyable hour or so.",
          "Always beautiful, and a lovely view of BouRegreg. Walk down to the cornice after for a nice stroll and a coffee",
          "The old Kasbah of Rabat had on the seaside also the function of fort, situated where the river Oued Bou Regreg meets the sea, it had a very strategic position. Do not hire a guide, the ask too much for too little information and try to lead you to their friends shpos. It is",
          "Avoid the \"tour guides\" or at the very least negotiate the price at the start. I loved the andulucian gardens. The view from the kasbar out to see is also worth seeing.",
          "I found this neighborhood after wandering through the medina, and was charmed by its blue and white scheme, narrow walkways, and ornate doorways. After a bit of walking, it pops out on a lovely ocean view. Worth a quick walk-through if you're nearby, especially near sunset.",
          "The fortifications and the walk along the sea was beautiful. We stayed there, overlooking the view, for quite some time.",
          "Apartments are on the high for room at this Andalusian fortification. Charming winding streets with a great ocean view cafes w/ sweet vendors & friendly kitties!",
          "Rabat is often overlooked by tourists in Morocco but it definitely deserves a visit and Kasbah des Oudaias is probably the most atmospheric place in the old city. The small, white and blue alleys and houses are perfect for a stroll and offer enormous amounts of great",
          "Unlike the medina, this old town is quiet and colourful, Do not expect much merchants but enjoy the walk and end up in the Cafe Maure for a mint tea and some pastries.",
          "The oudayas are an enclosed a little town within a town. You can walk around the narrow cobble-stone paved streets. Beautiful tiny little doors sometimes grace the entrance of houses there. I had the opportunity to enter a couple and they typically all have an interior",
          "Rabat, the capitol of Morocco, is the 7th largest city center hosting almost 600,000 people and adding the surrounding communities--2.1 million. Located on the Atlantic Ocean and by river Bou Regreg, the waves come crashing against the coast and against the light house. Kasbah",
          "A nice place to relax and sit for a while, where you can smell the flowers and oranges in an Andalusian-style exotic garden. Lots of friendly cats. The outside walls are being renovated but it is still open to the public.",
          "From the blue/white painting, the ocean overlooks, the Andalusian garden, and the great cemetery next door.... We only had a short time but we're impressed by what we were able to see. The area was overall smaller than expected and easy to get around. Nothing exceptional but",
          "Beautiful view and very well maintained. Takes about one hour if you take your guide or 30 min to just walk around. They have tea shop which is is but with veery nice view.",
          "A great way to spend a few hours with friends or families, with a museum and a park, a few arts & crafts boutiques, two tea house (slow, slow service). A nice destination to walk to from the Medina itself (10 minutes top), atmospheric but not flashy, authentic but not tacky.",
          "Walking through here you get the feeling that you are really now in Morocco. There is much to see and it all adds up to a pleasant place to visit.",
          "Behind the Medina of Rabat lays the Kasbah des Oudalas. This is the oldest part of Rabat. It gives a good idea how cities started. To understand the strategic location, you can walk down to a pier that protects the entrance of the harbor from the sea.",
          "Small, narrow streets, some painted in deep blue with a nice view of the sea and the cemetery - visit the cemetery as well. However quirt a few unofficial guides were paddling their pretend services. Don't bother; just wonder around on your own pace.",
          "It is a wonderful experience to go back in history and imagine the era when the Oudaias was built. From some vantage points you can get an amazing view of the sea. Or yu can wander through the tiny streets and see the vibrancy of life behind these walls. The garden is a fresh",
          "This little enclave has a great view of the sea. The blue washed walls were interesting, though spoiled by the power line running through them. The fort was under repair while while we were visiting. The gardens were pleasant as well.",
          "Very typical Kasbah, narrow streets, white and blue small buildings make you feel the past, small friendly shops and cafes and a short view of the port will complete the experience.",
          "First stop was at a tiny store selling sfinge Moroccan doughnuts and next to it another one selling r\u2019gaif flat bread (both very tasty). Next we stopped at Gnawa Moroccan troubadour and joined his singing. Arrived through the blue alleys to the beautiful lookout on the river",
          "Walking around the twisty blue alleys, seeing the old buildings and how people live, it was just awesome. I would recommend spending sometime there looking down all the little streets. Watch out for the carts being pulled by donkeys down these little streets. Just a nice",
          "You must visit that place! You can walk to see the nice architecture and the decoration of the houses.",
          "This is the place to go to see what old Rabat would have looked like. I enjoyed getting lost and having to find my way out by asking around. There are a lot of touristy shops - I've travelled so much around the world that I personally didn't find much to buy but even I ended up",
          "We wandered around the casbah on our first morning in Rabat. A man approached us and kept giving us recommendations on where to turn. At the end, he insisted on a tip, and refused anything less than 50 MAD. Watch out for this.",
          "The star is the Andalucian Garden (very popular with the local cat population). The el-Atiqa mosque (the oldest in Rabat) is worthy of a special mention. The walls of the kasbah allow good views across the river to Sale.",
          "There was guy who rushed us away and we could not see the sunset. The place closed just after sunset which at the time of our visit was 18-30. We were there at 17:45 and the guy rushed us away saying that it is Friday and he wants to go home. This was quite rude. He was yelling",
          "Ok, so you have to say you've been to the Kasbah. Some nice photo ops inside. But don't despair if you miss it.",
          "Beautiful Kasbah, nice view of the ocean and the city of Sale. Beware of guides (they will tell you you need a guide to get in, it's not true, or that the kasbah closes in one hour for a holiday, it's not true). Just wandering around those beautiful streets is a good experience.",
          "This castle is a must visit when in Rabat, but be aware of the local-guides who wants to show you arround and expect a fee. We told him that we didn't want a guide, but he told us that we wold get lost if we go by our self. I would recommend to just say: I have been here before,",
          "Great place for a short visit. We were welcomed into the house of a very nice family living in the Kasbah and got a great taste of life in this quite calm part of Morocco. A pleasent change to the chaos of most souks and medina's in Morocco.",
          "Externally it looks good but inside a bit sad although the views from the highest areas give you a sense of direction above the river entrance. Beware of the guys faking a tour...it's easy to find ones own way.",
          "Winding streets of whitewashed houses with mediterranean blue borders are straight out of picture postcards. If you've seen photographs of arabic looking electric blue studded wooden doors, chances are they were taken here. Get lost in the labryinth wending your way to the",
          "We walked into this place, that looks pretty, and were not even past the gate before a guy started to guide us. We said we didn't appreciate this, but he kept going. At some point we said we would continue alone, and then he was pissed - of course. So annoying, and it takes away",
          "Nice place to walk around and visits in general. Nice blue buildings all over the Kasbah, nice views of the river and sea. I just think the cafe is a total rip off. 16MAD for a weird type of coffee is totally overpriced, the pastries are quite expensive as well.",
          "Great views of the beaches of Rabat and cemetery of Rabat. In front of the fortress, before going in, take a look in the direction of the lighthouse, the scenery is incredible. Inside you can find some really nice houses and doors to take some pictures.",
          "I researched online about the kasbah and the andalusian gardens before going and there as no information saying that it got closed at night. I was really looking forward to visiting the garden and seeing the views from the kasbah, it was really disappointing. I suggest going in",
          "The sunsetting here was one of the highlights of our stay in Rabat. The Kasbah is an old building that sits near the ocean and it's incredibly atmospheric and photogenic",
          "Good views of the twin cities of Rabat and Sale and of the Atlantic ocean. Houses are well preserved to reflect the ancient history.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Kasbah. It was rather hard walking on the cobblestones and uneven ground, but definitely worth the effort.",
          "Easily the top attraction of the Moroccan capital, this medieval citadel is so picture-perfect that will surely drain your camera's battery so come prepared. The magnificent main gate will lead you to the panoramic terrace (offering commanding ocean vistas and memorable sunsets)",
          "This Casbah is truly unique! One wants never to stop wondering through its labyrinths and picturesque allies. There are also wild beaches where cliffs allow you to jump into the river. It's hard to describe the feeling that gets you in this place... I just loved it!",
          "Very pleasant walk through the narrow blue streets. All round beautiful place to wonder! There's also a street market right in front. It's a must see if you plan to stop in Rabat.",
          "a nice winding and unwinding of ways in the kasbah, lovely rooftop view of the ocean, and nice garden walk/view before you exit the kasbah..",
          "Kasbah of Oudaya has a \"museum\" to visit (which is in fact an old fighting palace - not a museum), a blue maze of roads where expelled Muslims and Jews settled after leaving Andalucia and last but definitely not least the famous caf\u00e9. The caf\u00e9 offers a breathtaking panoramic",
          "NIce place just to walk around the small white and blue houses and to enjoy the ocean view from the terrace.If you been in Chefchaouen that is small version ;) Good point to take some picture",
          "We enjoyed the old places in Rabat including this.. It will help take a glimpse of what you can see in the other city in Morocco..",
          "Beautiful place just to walk around the small white houses and to enjoy the ocean view from the terrace. Be careful of the fake guides! And enjoy a walk in the Oudaya garden and a tea at Caf\u00e9 Maure, a must!",
          "A place you need to visit in Rabat Have a cup of moroccan Mint tea and enjoy the view on the Bouregreg river and the Ocean",
          "Interesting living city inside a site oozing history, and fantastic views of the river and the ocean from the platform. Pestering 'guides' providing unsolicited guidance, and not willing to leave you alone until offer a tip.",
          "The Blue and White Colour makes it different from other Morocco Medinas. The Cafe Oudaya is the best spot to sit and view the Atlantic after exploring the entire Medina",
          "When you enter at the place there are a lot of \"guides\" trying to talk to you. It's not necessary to hire them. Only say \"merci\" and go. The views from the \"Semaforo\" are amazing. You don't need to pay to go there. There was a guy that control the access (was 6 pm) and gave us",
          "Nice place which reminded me about Greece. I wonder why there were not more coffee shops, it was very hot and we spend some time to find one. More signs would be good, because we walked almost around the place before we found Cafe and water.",
          "There is certainly a charm regarding the place when walking through the narrow winding streets and exploring this community with its unique white and blue walls. Some places offer tea and there are markets and small gardens you can walk through.",
          "Nice place however the gardens are not well maintained. A good view over the estuary of Rabat in the tea corner",
          "It's a touristic place with a real flare of peaceful and interesting architecture. One must stop at the Berber Cafe overlooking the Bouregreg river seeping mint tea and Moroccan sweet pastries.",
          "After a walk through the kasbah spend some time on the sea side and enjoy the view. Good spot for photos. The best time to visit the kasbah is morning. Visit the gallery on main street and the panoramic cafe on the top of the wall.",

        "wiki": "The Chellah or Shalla (Berber languages: Sla or Calla; Arabic: \u0634\u0627\u0644\u0629\u200e), is a medieval fortified Muslim necropolis located in the metro area of Rabat, Morocco, on the south (left) side of the Bou Regreg estuary. The Phoenicians established a trading emporium at the site. This was later the site of an ancient Roman colony in the province of Mauretania Tingitana.\nSal\u0101 was the name given to the city founded by the Muslim conquerors of North Africa, which was mostly abandoned during the Almohad era, then rebuilt by the Marinids in the 13th century. The  ruins of their medieval fortress are still extant.\nThe Berber Almohads used the site as a royal burial ground. The Marinids made the site a holy necropolis, or chellah, and built a complex that included mosque, minaret, and royal tombs. The tall minaret of the now-ruined mosque was built of stone and zellige tilework, and still stands.\nContrary to legend, the corsairs of Sal\u00e9 did not actually operate out of Sal\u00e9 (called \"Old Sal\u00e9\"), but out of the city that would later become known as Rabat, (\"New Sal\u00e9\") on the south (left) bank of the Bou Regreg.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Phoenician Sala ===\nThe Phoenicians founded several trading colonies in what is now Morocco. The settlement along the banks of the Bou Regreg was known as Shalat (Punic: \ud802\udd14\ud802\udd0f\u202c\ud802\udd0b\ud802\udd15, \u0161\u02bflt). It was later controlled from Carthage.\n\n\n=== Roman Sala Colonia ===\nThe Romans later built their own city, Sala Colonia, very near the same site. The Roman town was referred to as \"Sala\" by Ptolemy.\nExcavations show a substantial port city with ruined Roman architectural elements including a decumanus maximus or principal roadway, a forum and a triumphal arch. Sala was a center of Christianity from the 2nd century.\n\nOne of the two main Roman Roads in Mauretania Tingitana reached the Atlantic through Iulia Constantia Zilil (Asilah), Lixus (Larache) and Sala Colonia. Another may have been built towards the south, from Sala to modern Casablanca, then called Anfa. The Romans had two main naval outposts on the Atlantic coast of the province: Sala Colonia, and Lixus. The port of Sala (now disappeared) was used by commercial Roman ships as a way station on their southwestward passages to Anfa and the Insula Purpuraria (Mogador island).Sala remained linked to the Roman Empire even after the withdrawal in the 4th century of the occupying Roman legions to Tingis and Septem in northern Mauretania Tingitana. A Roman military unit remained there until the end of the 5th century. Archaeological objects of Visigothic and Byzantine origin found in the area attest to the persistence of commercial or political contacts between Sala and Roman Europe, up to the establishment of a Byzantine presence in Berber North Africa during the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Muslim Sal\u0101 ===\n\nSala continued to exist as a town of the Christianized Berbers, but was mostly in ruins when the Muslim Arabs arrived in the 7th century. The Byzantine governor of the area, Count Julian of Ceuta, surrendered to Uqba ibn Nafi in 683. Around 1030, the town of Sal\u0101 was founded at the site by the Banu 'Ashara family. With the extinction of the Umayyad dynasty in 1031, the Almoravids assumed control of the Maghreb (present-day Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco) and erected new buildings in Sal\u0101. They rebuilt the Great Mosque of Sal\u0101 on the site of the mosque of the Banu 'Ashara, completing it in 1196.By 1147, the Almoravids had been overthrown by the Berber Almohads, who used the site as a royal burial ground. It was made a sacred necropolis, or chellah, by the Marinids in the 13th century; the Muslim sanctuary complex of mosque, minaret, and royal tombs being built by Abu Yusuf Yaqub, and finished in 1284. His remains were moved to the necropolis after he died at Algeciras in 1286. The tall minaret of the now-ruined mosque was built of stone and zellige tilework, and still stands.  Near the minaret is the tomb of the Maranid ruler, Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman, known as the Black Sultan.\nMany of the remaining structures in Chellah were damaged by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.  The site has been converted to a garden and tourist venue, and today it is included in the metropolitan area of Rabat.\n\n\n== Music Venue ==\nSince 2005, the ruins of Chella host an international \"Festival of Jazz\" each year, called Jazz au Chellah. Additionally, it is currently home to a venue of the annual Mawazine music festival in Rabat, usually showcasing jazz or traditional music, as opposed to more popular contemporary music featured at some of the larger venues.\n\n\n== World Heritage Status ==\nThe site, as part of the metropolitan Rabat, was granted World Heritage Status in 2012.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBerbers\nColonia (Roman)\nExploration of Africa\nMauretania Tingitana\nRoman roads in Morocco\nVolubilis\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nGhaki, Mansour (2015), \"Toponymie et Onomastique Libyques: L'Apport de l'\u00c9criture Punique/N\u00e9opunique\" (PDF), La Lingua nella Vita e la Vita della Lingua: Itinerari e Percorsi degli Studi Berberi, Studi Africanistici: Quaderni di Studi Berberi e Libico-Berberi, No. 4, Naples: Unior, pp. 65\u201371, ISBN 978-88-6719-125-3, ISSN 2283-5636.

          "The Chellah is a medieval fortified Muslim necropolis located in the metro Rabat built on the Bouregreg River. The Phoenicians initially established a trading post here and the Romans. Sal\u0101 was the name given to the city founded by the Muslim conquerors of North Africa, which",
          "We visited these gardens first thing in the morning. The variety of trees, flowers, fruits and the freshness of the air was lovely. The Roman ruins and the Muslim necropolis is very interesting and excavation still continues to this day. Non-Moroccans pay about 70 Moroccan",
          "The capital city of Rabat is beautiful, clean and elegant. Stopping by the Chellah is one of the many scenic spots to visit.",
          "This is a truly lovely place. We visited in August 2019. You can go around on your own or you can get a guide inside who will take you around. Best to decide on the price of the guide beforehand. Best time to visit is early morning.",
          "If you are interested in archeology (and even if you aren't) this is the top attraction in Rabat. The site may be second to Volubilis and may not compare to sites in Turkey, but it is not to be missed. Terrific historical significance!",
          "It is a must when visiting Rabat. Chellah is well structured, with good information boards around the place. Roman ruines are well preserved and the stork nests are an attraction. Bring your telephoto lens!",
          "The fee to enter this old city is nominal for tourists. As you enter the gates, you are greeted by a drummer playing the traditional drum while twirling the tassels on his hat. Walking through the ruins of this old city was peaceful and relaxing. The garden is well kept with",
          "The Chellah is located on the site of an early Phoenician settlement which eventually became a Roman outpost. Eventually it became a Necropolis under Muslim rule. It is an interesting place to wander around and to view the old minaret which was part of a mosque. It is also an",
          "This is what you want to see that is in your thoughts as to what is Morocco. Imagine how it was hundreds of years ago. Lots of pictures opportunities. A must to visit.",
          "A great place to walk in the steps of history interactions with real ancient items and structures that were in classical style",
          "Originally a place for retired Roman soldiers this is an interesting site with great gardens. Stork nests are interesting. Don't need too much time here",
          "Our tour group stopped here and we walked the grounds. Lots of stork nests. Ruins were interesting. Nice gardens and shady areas to rest in. Bathrooms were good.",
          "A Roman city wrapped inside a moorish fortified city - if you are a history buff there is nothing better. There is an option to take a guided tour and some locals that offer; I would not bother and go exploring and climb the ruins. Not to be missed",
          "As we were on a coach tour we didn't have as long as we would have liked to explore but what we did see was very interesting.",
          "A nice stroll through ruins, lovely gardens and wildlife. Many cats, and Storks nesting in towers. The story of the ladies swimming is interesting ......you\u2019ll have to go to find out.",
          "I had though the Kasba was amazing but this place is truly the best place to visit in Rabat. You can\u2019t miss it while you\u2019re in town",
          "Romans in Marocco, apparently they were all over the place. Nice site to visit. one hour seems to be enough. Htere are also some old islamic ruins",
          "Untoughted archaeology site with amazing view of the city. Not very crowded with tours, so it's more enjoyable.",
          "Ideal place for lovers of ruins and antiquity where you can walk and meditate in peace. I would come back very often in the future because I could not visit all the sites.",
          "Interesting site but not anything spectacular. Small area of Roman ruins and Muslim ruins. Warning many steps and a significant hill to climb up to exit the ruins.",
          "Go early so that it is not too hot! I was very impressed to see this! The main tower where the storks were perched was how I was able to guide myself thru this maze of history. It is a lot of walking and a lot of history. From what used to be a small pool to kids class room",
          "Chella is an interesting prospect when in town. Sitting on the outer edge about 20 minutes walk from the main station will bring you to this attraction. It really is worth the effort and will reward those that pay the 70 MAD entry. Chella is a walled Roman town with an old",
          "impressive ancient settlement and Roman ruins. Our guide Aziz gave a very interesting background of the site, made the visit so much more interesting. Also get to observe a lot of storks in the area",

          "We had a guide and he was able to fill us in on the history that was not written on the nearby places. There is an entrance fee but we enjoyed seeing the ruins from the Romans and Carthage\u2019s past.",
          "While traveling in Rabat, we stopped and visited the necropolis at Chellah. It was very interesting to visit these ruins. The entrance / exit gate to this facility was very impressive. We enjoyed seeing the ruins of the mosque and visualized how beautiful it must have been in",
          "This destination is far from the medina (although walkable) but worth the detour. Picture mossy Roman ruins, Muslim antiquities, lush garden paths and a large colony of storks!",
          "Loved it, as it shows the past of rabat and also a great place to visit while you are in rabat. Great tea also",
          "Great as part of a walking tour with historic ruins from the 15th century as well as ruins from an ancient Roman city.",
          "Our first look at ancient necropolis, and our guide, who was very knowledgable shared many facts and stories with us that made it very interesting. I would suggest here, you try to visit with a professional guide who can explain the whole story so you can appreciate everything",
          "Nice place, interesting to see all the ruins and read the explanations. Only 70 dirham for entrance!",
          "The Chella originally were occupied by the Phoenicians many thousands of years ago, and Romans took over 2000 years ago. That site was abandoned in 1154, until the 14th century when a sultan build necropolis on top of the previous Roman ruins with the defensive walls, that are",
          "I was there in early April. White Storks were nesting everywhere there was high ground. The ruins were nice, but the storks made this a must see.",
          "This site is nice and in the process of being further refurbished. It is a fairly long walk up and down to the main site. The ruins in Volubilis are much more extensive and well restored. If you have limited time then skip Chellah. If this review is helpful then please",
          "Apart from the obvious ruins and the great care taken not to improve, the grounds and gardens are stunning, worth going just see them. Very chilled atmosphere came out very relaxed.",
          "This was fascinating. the roman ruins are all over Europe but to see ruins here was unexpected. The Phoenicians founded and later Muslims conquered, but still the blending of the buildings on the site made it fascinating. Plus you have eels in the pool and storks in nests all",
          "The Chellah is a must see with some wonderful Roman ruins and plenty of great places to take photos and it's free",
          "The Chellah is a necropolis and Roman city with surrounding gardens and an old mosque. Near the mosque, there is also a pool where childless women feed eggs to eels in the hope of conceiving. This place is one to read about before you go or watch You Tube videos. I have seen",
          "Nice walk and easy to get around that around. As tourists, there're also many other spots near-by. Not bad to have a look, while don't expect a lot inside.",
          "The place is great. You can feel the power of the past. Don't go if you don't have water or food with you. There is nothing there. P.S. Don't go on foot!!!",
          "There were some ruins here, but overall not much to see. Definitely not worth the 70 dirham cost. The site overall was not interesting. Time was better spent visiting other sites in the city.",
          "This is on the outskirts of the city walls and is very relaxing to walk around. It\u2019s 70 d to get in and they take euro. The ruins are at the bottom of the hill but it\u2019s an easy walk. I found the big colony of stalks interesting.",
          "I went to visit here with couple of Moroccan friends. They paid 10DH, and me as a tourist 70DH. Fair enough! This place is undergoing some repairing from outside, maintaining new access road, making grass areas, but it was made probably also because it was on the way of Pope",
          "This historic place was with ZERO restoration. They could have made it much better with spending some money on restoration of this famous historic site",
          "This is a real must see when visiting Rabat. Especially the medersa and all the storks at their nests are very impressive.",
          "Good to visit but not great interesting and easy to visit and part of old part of city and important",
          "This fascinating park (that you pay to enter) contains the ruins of both an ancient Roman city and a 12th century Arab palace and fort. It is a beautiful place to walk through with shady tree lined paths giving relief from the sun that illuminates the ruins. There are also many",
          "Having checked carefully as best we could in advance of the entrance price for the Chellah most sites online seemed to suggest 10 MAD. We were therefore very surprised to see that there has been a recent and official price hike for non Moroccans to 70MAD. This was not a scam",
          "You can't escape the Romans even in Morocco. This is a lovely blend of garden and Roman and later Muslim ruins. The storks nest among the ruins and the cats wander freely.",
          "We spent an hour visiting the Roman ruins at Challah the first day of our tour of Morocco. Although the ruins are \"in ruins\" and not restored or kept to a high degree, they are worth seeing as is knowing the place that the Romans had historically. The views into the countryside",
          "Challah is one historical places must seen in Rabat for the history lovers only. It is a castel built quite long during Roman\u2019s tiime in 12th century. It was further developed by muzini family. No wonder it was classified by UNESCO as one of the international heritage places in",
          "The walled necropolis that is Chellah is just outside Rabat city limits but it is walkable from town if you don't want an argument with a taxi driver. It's main attractions are Roman ruins, which are crumbling and desperately in need of more preservation/renovation. The",

          "This place is vast and storks are everywhere to see. Loved it! The place (during our visit) was not crowded and we were able to easily explore the ruins. Highly recommended. Especially because of the storks.",
          "Very interesting historical site with so many storks and cats among old Roman ruins. You can view everything within 2 hours.",
          "The ruins are very impressive. There are many attractions from the structure itself to the plant life and at the end the water pond. There are many stork nests and these are big birds who are so graceful. The wall is one of the oldest and they try to restore and preserve more",
          "The long history of the Chellah makes this a very interesting visit to a ruined complex inside a walled fortress. Although this site goes back to the Phonecian, the ruins are an intriguing mixture of ancient Roman and 12th &13th centuary Muslim. A lot of the Roman buildings",
          "All this is free provided you are willing to walk. It is close to the beach and coastline which are also worth visiting.",
          "Beautiful place to walk around, take in the scenery, learn about the history. Can easily do on your own.",
          "There are several Roman ruins with many explanatory signs, beautiful gardens and dozens of large storks and their larger nests. Don\u2019t expect massive buildings - these are crumbled ruins, with post-Roman buildings that are in slightly better repair/renovations. The grounds are",
          "Just a short ( and cheap) taxi ride from the town centre this place is well worth visiting.You can wander round the grounds and get some spectacular, close up photos of the storks nesting there.There is a lot of rebuilding work going on so I think this place is going to get",
          "Very interesting visit to Chellah. While most focus is on the massive walled compound, gardens, and ancient ruins, we narrowed in on the Necropolis site due to our limited time to visit. Very ancient and interesting burial grounds amid the ruins and the stork nests. Nice",
          "Roman ruins on the site of an early Phoenician settlement with a later mosque and mausoleum. Very interesting and well tended. 70 MAD pp in cash entry fee, but worth it. Close to the palace - allow 45 minutes and be prepared for a steep walk to return.",
          "The highlight of my trip to Rabat. 70 dirhams for non-Moroccans to visit. Lots of storks around the grounds are very vocal!",
          "Well worth a visit. There is an entrance fee of \u20ac7 but worth a visit. Very well preserved. Chella dates back to 1286 and absolutely incredible",
          "February 1, 2019 - As part of a 34 person travel group, we visited Chellah in the morning. The Chellah or Shalla, is a medieval fortified Muslim necropolis located in the metro area of Rabat, Morocco, on the south side of the Bou Regreg estuary. Our admission was included in",
          "Once a Phoenician trading emporium and then a Roman colony, it later became the site of a medieval fortified necropolis named Chellah. After paying a small entrance fee, only for non-Moroccans, we entered the site which includes a large garden turned into a park, archaeological",
          "It's hard to say anything about that place is well for motorists and those who can drive a very nice nature and beautiful in the summer, entrance think you have to pay for.... Even if one is the tourist one must be careful at evening times with crowd that increases and many are",
          "This is the most surprising place we visited in all of Morocco. The Roman and Islamic ruins are fascinating but it is the numerous storks in their nests and the clacking of their bills that makes this place magical, Whether these huge birds soar overhead or stand regally on old",
          "Very historical walking about the ruins. The interesting part is that the storks have decided to nest there and the guide told us that a decade ago the storks were down under 100 and now there are 300. Got to see a few young ones too. Guide was $10 which was ok for the visit",
          "Enter the walls to view acres of ancient ruins, many of which still outline the crumbling buildings. Each high position seems to hold a stork nest, adding life and interest to the scene. Some challenges for those with mobility issues, but worth the effort, even if you can't tour",
          "Beautiful gardens lead the way to historical ruins and, incredibly, a muster of storks! Not to be missed. Personally, rank this as the number 1 or number 2 attraction to see in Rabat. The gardens are gorgeous and well-maintained. The ruins have so much history and are also",
          "Not too far from the city. Mildly interesting. Under renovation. Do not spend too much time here if you intend covering Volubilis later.",
          "Located minutes away from Rabat city center. Site overlooks the sea and used to be a phoenicians trade emporium, now old Roman ruins. Average experience 30 minutes visit, free for children, MAD10 Moroccan residents, MAD70 foreigners. Currently under renovation. Reopening",
          "We spent about an hour walking around the area and the old Roman ruins; and we were fascinated by the storks that were overhead more than the ruins----which were nice. To be fair, the ruins are probably fascinating to students of such things, but to ignorant us, they were just",
          "Pricy for non Moroccans and plain boring Spare your self and visit the medina than this forgotten ruins",
          "The Roman ruins here aren't as spectacular as Volubilis, but the site well worth a visit. The Islamic ruins are more spectacular. The mosaics are very fine. A beautiful park-like setting was built around the ruins during the French protectorate period in order to enhance their",
          "Sadly I did not have much time to explore the Chellah site which comprises the substantial remaining walls and gardens. What I did see was fascinating as were the storks and their nests.",
          "Absolutely amazing. The Roman ruins were impressive. We were there in the winter when the storks were nesting on the tops of the ruins. The cats who lived there also were cute. I would highly recommend visiting here.",
          "Visited as part of a day tour in Rabat. The entire tour was great, but this was by far the best surprise for me. Chellah is a beautiful example of an old ruined casbah. The outside appears like an ancient Moroccan fortress with massive entryways. Berber dancers were there to",
          "Should mainly go visit for the outside walls, which are glooming red at sunset. There is a colony of stalks in and out of the compound which is pretty awesome. The ruins are ok, but wouldn\u2019t recommend them in particular.",
          "10 minuits in the Taxi from the centre this Roman Site is worth a visit it's situated Just outside the Town centre brings you into another World It must be seen !",
          "For lovers of gardens and ruins, legends and cats,it's a promenade you can't miss if you visit Rabat",
          "A walled citadel containing Phoenician,Roman,Berber and Arab ruins.A ruined Merinid mosque is especially beautiful.The storks now have it all to themselves!!!",
          "Among the ruins were beautiful gardens and a pool with an eel. Women bring eggs hoping for fertility. There are lots of cats making the area peaceful.",
          "We went to Chellah with our guide Youssef who once again was excellent. We strolled through the Roman ruins, enjoyed the serenity of the gardens and watched the storks nests. We went there early (before 10:00 am) and were able to soak in peacefully the beauty of the place and",
          "This is one to visit- from the roman ruins that date back to 40 bc to the thousand year old Hammam and tombs, this is a place full of beautiful trees, plants, paths, ruins, and so much more. Highly recommend getting the tour guide, it\u2019s not expensive and so worth it. There are",
          "We went in our second day in Rabat because after Mausoleum, Medina amd the becah...it's the next \"must see\" in the city. Honestly for the prices of the city the entrance it's a bit expensive to be Morroco, normal for Europe but not here. Was 7\u20ac that in Spain it's normal but here",
          "Also ruins of early Islamic settlement. Need a guide to really understand all there is to see here. Impressive stork nests. Probably the western most Roman and Islamic settlements in their time,",
          "This is a must see place if you are visiting Rabat as it is positively dripping with history from the Phoenicians to the Romans to the Muslims. There is much to see and you are allowed to explore freely amongst the ruins. The icing on the cake is the size of the stork colony",
          "We really enjoyed exploring these ruins. Of course we visited here the day before we had the wonderful experience of visiting Volubilis so it was a lovely introduction. It was fun to have such incredible access to just roam where you choose and climb among all of the ruins.",
          "The Roman ruins are remarkable and prepare you for a trip to Volubilis. We were fascinated by the storks that also lived there.",
          "Even if a bit outside the city center (not that remote though) it is extremly secure both inside and outside. It is one of the major spots to visit in Rabat if you are on a cultural trip (roman and islamic archeology) Prices of entry are cheap, they offer discounts too, warm",
          "Here you get to see the ruins of a Roman city that was located at this site.There are also ruins from Sultan Aba Said and storks build their large nests on the grounds.",
          "lovely gardens w many plants, trees, flowers be prepared for humidity, as you walk through you come upon the necropolis [ancient ruins] startling-shouldn't be missed",
          "Good for an hour or two walk around the ruins. Descriptions only in Arabic or French, 70MAD to get in now for foreigners.",
          "If you\u2019re interested in the historical significance of the Moroccan country, you cannot miss this location. It\u2019s worth the long walk down loose steps to see the ruins.",
          "Drove to Citadel of Chellah Gardens. Cost us 70 MAD to get in, free for Moroccan citizens. Noted for 100\u2019s of flowers in bloom in the spring. This time of year there were many fruit trees and a few flowering bushes in bloom. Many storks have huge nests throughout the property.",
          "Really beautiful gardens, my 9 yr old was captivated by the plants and tress. Views, ruins pretty amazing too. The storks are great to watch as are the eels. We spent much longer there that we thought we would. Def a highlight of Rabat, and a place I'd never heard of until I",
          "The admission charge of 70MAD did not include any information on the site, so it is best to read something about the location beforehand, if visiting without a guide. The ruins are accompanied by descriptions in Arabic and French. The gardens are very well maintained, with areas",
          "This archaeological gem is obligatory in Rabat. It is well preserved, and there are good views of the sister city across the river.",
          "great way to spend an hour or so wandering round the ruins such history and so well maintained amazing",
          "A very interesting place. An old muslim area, an old Roman area and a very nice garden combin together with great amounts of Storks (and a lot of cats happy to be cuddled) make for a nice centuries spanning experience. getting a guide is highly recommended. As the Roman ruins",
          "Amazing ruins on the outskirts of Rabat. You can see the remains of the Roman town of Sala Colonia and the 13th century mosque and necropolis. Spectacular views and photo opportunities. Lovely, shady gardens to relax in after exploring. And great to be so close to the stork",
          "Admission is a bit too pricey for what you are really getting here. Our driver dropped us off for a tour, but to be honest we really did not even know where we were or what we were seeing for the first bit. The welcome drummer demanded $ from us. Once inside the grounds we were",
          "Expensive entry fee. Guide pushy. All signs in French only. Despite all this the ruins are very interesting and make for good photo opportunities. The high outer wall belies the treasures within. One can walk over some of the ruins - which is not ideal to their preservation.",
          "We had an enjoyable visit to this necropolis and gardens filled with Roman and Chaldean (pre Roman) ruins. Our friend noted that their price had gone up 700% or something and now is 100 Dir to enter. She was very unhappy about this. Tombs of Imans, location of some Folk",
          "Mostly ruins and trees. Also we saw LOTS of storks - and cats. Nothing that really has to be seen but nice to spend an hour or two.",
          "Enter another world as you explore these ruins from the days of Roman occupation. The ruins have been stabilised and the gardens maintained to make the area attractive and interesting to vidit",
          "First settled this place Fenician people, after 40 AD Sala Colonia start development of town. Nice walking through gardens and ruins.",
          "Visited this place as it was highly recommended. The entrance fee of MAB70 was recently increased for tourists but the place is worth the fee. The place is well-preserved and catalogued. The ruins are lovely. The place is clean. And the personnel are courteous and helpful. This",
          "This is a great place to stroll through in some shade. There are open areas around the ruins, but you will still have plenty of shade. There are some stairs and uneven surfaces, but nothing too extreme. I saw a man with a cane navigating it just fine. In the past they have",
          "The Phoenicians established a trading emporium at the site and called it Sala. \"The Romans later built their own city, Sala Colonia, very near the same site. Sala continued to exist as a town of the Christianized Berbers, but was mostly in ruins when the Muslim Arabs arrived in",
          "From the view outside of the walls, the storms and the entrance to the shaded paths, the gardens, the tombs and the Roman ruins this is a superb place to visit. There are not many visitors and there is plenty of time and space to explore. Information panels describe the various",
          "Wish I'd checked out the reviews here before visiting, as the entry fee wasn't the 10 dirham price listed in my guide book but 70 dirhams for non-Moroccans. Paying double or triple what an ordinary Moroccan would pay is probably acceptable, but seven times greater is pretty",
          "The fortress walls surrounds the site, including the abandoned Roman ruins which became a burial ground. Walk to the walls and see the the sturdy main roadway, a triumphal arch, an ornamental fountain, a range of residential, governmental and commercial buildings in various",
          "Be aware that as from today entry for etrangers is 70 dirhams. Of course if you are Moroccan it's still 10. Blatant tourist tax. If it bothers you stay away until they revert to a fair system of tariff.",
          "Chellah is a good place to spend an hour or two. The ruins are interesting, and the whole place is quite pretty. Well worth a visit.",
          "Definitely a must-see in Rabat. The entrance fee is 10 Dirhams, which is reasonable for this attraction. At the entrance, you are greeted by a colossal ancient door. Inside, there are splendid gardens and ruins from the Romans, as well as ruins of an ancient mosque. There are",
          "For someone who is fond of Roman ruins, this was an unexpected treat. In addition the gardens were a delight. Look out for the storks who are now the residents of the former necropolis, like sentinels guarding the lost souls.",
          "It was a good visit, though I wish I read either Arabic or French to be able to understand the signage of the place. Beautiful garden and outlook views! I am a bit thrilled to see the historical ruins and the birds gliding over them.",
          "I've been here twice and I loved the experience. Knowing all the civilizations that have chosen this fort and walking down its historical ramparts make you travel back in time hundreds of years ago... Even if not completly restored, the fort still has proofs of roman presence,",
          "Well preserved, nice garden, good for photos. I would have benifited from a guided tour. Walked here in under an hour from Rabat Station.",
          "An interesting archaeological site and gardens to wander about for an hour or two. The minaret which has been taken over by storks is perhaps the central attraction",
          "Very nice monument with exotic garden and remarkable landscape. Some local people offer you to guide inside the site.",
          "We enjoyed walking around the ruins but weren\u2019t blown away. I\u2019d recommend it if in the area. We spent about 40 mins looking around before moving on. The entrance fee was fair.",
          "Chellah is tge walled fort built by the Roman in a dramatic position looking down on the river. its ruins are just a short walk from the medina of Rabat. It is one of the most visited tourist attraction as it has both roman and muslim influence. Storks nets csn be seen on the",
          "I have to say that the walk to the Cellah from the medina is a constant uphill and we actually found it quite exhausting. This ate into the experience a little as we were tired by the time we arrived. Entry price is 10dh per person. The Chellah contains a beautiful garden and",
          "These ruins were definitely worth viewing, especially if you read about it before you see it. (That is assuming you know nothing about the history of Morocco). Viewing allows one to realize how very old this area is and how the Arabs adapted the site for their own use.",
          "Interesting site, and if you can learn about it before you visit it makes it more interesting. There are ruins from different historical periods, dating back to the Romans. But the main attraction, distraction, is the storks who have taken over the place. Supposedly (as I",
          "There are so many things to see here, ruins of mosque, a garden, lots of storks nests and the chance to see these fabulous birds quite close up, Roman remains and great views over the neighboring landscape. This is a place to linger, I never had time to visit it all.",
          "The Chellah Necropolis is well worth a visit. It is on the edge of the main part of Rabat, easy to access. It is essentially ruins, some in better repair than others. The storks have taken over which adds to the photogenic quality of the site. It is a bit of walk downhill to",
          "I think Chellah is the best historical landmark of Rabat. You can find the remnants of Merinides, Roman and Phoeinikan trade colonies. Also there is an necropolis area established by Merinides.",
          "As I have mentioned in other reviews, I thought that Rabat was nice without being particularly notable. The highlight of our visit was Chellah, which is a great place to wander round, with Roman ruins and nice gardens. I agree with others that the Storks stole the show. We",
          "After several Rabat sights, we went to a Rabat site: the ruins of Chellah. Now, I've seen a good many ruins, so the nesting storks stole the show for me. They were in every coign of vantage, in huge twig and branch nests, tending to their chicks and keeping a wary eye on the",
          "Inside an ancient Moroccan wall, descend hill down well maintained stone steps. Shady and beautiful plantings. At end of garden a huge viewing platform to the Roman ruins below and across the valley and the storks nesting everywhere. I wasn't as wild about the eel pond, but",

          "This site in Rabat is well worth a visit and is of considerable historic interest. Getting there by private bus (or car) was tricky towards the middle of the day because local traffic was in log-jam in a nearby intersection so allow time for this or walk. Leaving was even",
          "Easy to spend an hour or two wondering around the ancient ruins, feeding the hoard of cats, strolling through the gardens or watching the storks who nest on numerous ruin tops and old mosques. Intriguing place full of hundreds of years of history.",
          "This was once a major Roman harbour. Several buildings have been excavated including shops, a warehouse, baths, nymphaeum and artisan's workshops. The site became a major base of piracy in the Middle Ages. A mosque was built but was destroyed during the great Lisbon earthquake.",
          "We taxied out and walked back in to town. Arrived about 10.30a.m. so it was quiet but filling up as we left. We loved the site. Of course the storks added to the visit with their mating clacking ritual.",
          "The Chella is spectacular with beautiful gardens ( filled with clacking storks nesting everywhere) and roman ruins and fortifications from various periods of Moroccan dynasties - Rabat is the modern capital but was edge of Roman Mauretania. It is very peaceful and not touristy.",
          "The first time we visited Rabat, we did not have time to go to Chellah. This time we did and we can recommend it. Really very interesting.",
          "Beautiful spot with ancient history and archeology, very quiet. An ancient Roman ville and an ancient moske and ancient graves in a castle with a big and calm garden. You will see many cats and even more storks.",

          "Go here in the evening, the ruins look nice in the mellow dusk light. Several of the ruins have stork nests, the birds make great photo subjects. Ruins are not labelled very well, but there is just enough to know what you are looking at, with the help of a guide book. One hour",
          "As mentioned by several reviewers, it is worthwhile to tour Chellah with a guide in order to extract the most value out of your visit. It is not a very large area, but there are a number of very interesting ruins of architectural interest. And of course, the multitude of storks",
          "At the Chellah you will find history / architecture from the Phoenicians, Romans, and Medieval Muslims. To cap it all, there are wuite a few storks who have made their nests on the site of the abandoned mosque, so a great place for birdwatching too. A must see location in Rabat",
          "I can\u2019t get over how many different plants are here from what I consider different eco systems. Tropical and succulents and stuff I\u2019ve never seen like the plant border that looked like it had bugs but it was the flower in the middle of the leaf! Lots of stork nests easy to",
          "We walked here from town and there\u2019s a busy road to get over but once you do, it\u2019s outside the city and a really interesting spot where you can see the estuary and what I think is a salt marsh. The site is really calm and pleasant with very little hassle. Take your time to",
          "A beautiful place to visite. There are both excavations here of an old roman city, and a newer ruin of a mausoleum and a mosque. The vegetation is lushious with orange trees, bamboo and large trees. And then there\u2019s the storks. There are so many of them. They nest on the top of",
          "Chellah looks impressive - a real Moorish fort in the heart of Rabat - however this is only the tip of the impressive history that the high walls hide. Inside Chellah is a beautiful garden where exotic birds. There to behold was a bath house, governance chamber and other",
          "We visited in the morning and the light was beautiful. The outside is fully restored so pretty upon approach and a nice garden. Inside the old roman ruins and roman road are compelling, and the 13-14th Century tombs and ruins with some mosaics (and more than 100 storks) are",
          "A city that traces its origins to the Carthaginian and Phoenicians. You can walk around the ruins and imagine what it was like. They have beautiful trees and vegetation\u2019s throughout. A wonderful place to take a lot of pictures. Interestedly enough, there are over 70 stork nests",

          "We arrived at Chellah in the afternoon when the golden sunlight danced on the Roman ruins. Our guide met us inside the ancient walled citadel and gave an interesting commentary as we passed by remains of a holy necropolis and complex including mosque, minaret, and royal tombs.",
          "A very good stay in this Chellah. All kind of plants are growing inside. Very nice view of the Roman and Arabic \u201chouses\u201d. A lot of birds.",
          "We arrived at this place to see the French dugout for Roman treasure but place is the burial ground. There is a little water pool believed to be the wishing Well. Plantation around the place was being well maintained.",
          "A nice place to visit in the afternoon - sunset or morning. Amazing for photos and opportunity to see storks in the upper parts of the walls of the ruins. Beautiful site, and one of the must see places in Rabat.",
          "Highly recommended collection of Roman ruins, enhanced by numerous stork nests and a lot of cats. Well worth visiting.",
          "Small site with Roman and Berber remains in a walled enclosure. Worth a visit for the sense of layered history but not overly well maintained and the remains are of limited visual interest. Focus tends to be on the many storks that nest in the ruins.",

          "We really enjoyed this place because of the history that played out in this space over the centuries. There are wonderful Roman and Moorish ruins to explore and it's helpful to have a guide. It was fun seeing the roosting cranes, as well.",
          "nothing extraordinary but pleasant quiet and lovely nature around. Ticket very cheap. Do not use the guide, it is a waste of money",
          "It was quite a trek to walk from near the Cathedral but we made it! Full of school children when we visited so sadly were not able to enjoy the site as much. There are Roman ruins which didn't really interest us as we have seen more impressive ones elsewhere. The highlight was",
          "You get gardens, you get Islamic ruins, you get Roman ruins, you get the gate, you get the walls, you get a pond with heels that hide in holes and come out when fed, you get hundreds of cats, you get dozens of storks... there is simply so much to see and a ton of photo",
          "This interesting historic site is a bit outside of Rabat\u2019s centre, but worth the walk or taxi ride. First, one walks through a nice garden down to the Roman ruins. There is also the ruins of a mosque. There are at least a dozen of storks nesting. Highly recommended! The downside",
          "This archaeological site you must visit.The Roman Ruins are still here.Take a good guide to elaborate. Worth the visit.",

          "This historic location was worth visiting. We spent about an hour here and could have spent another hour walking the grounds. There are ruins from the time of the Roman occupation that you can walk through and several stork nests at the tops of the buildings. From here you can",
          "We visited this spot for an hour during our drive through Morocco. It is lovely- the area is well taken care of and you can walk around all the ruins. There is quite a mix of religious influences. Guided tours are available (all the signs are in Arabic or French so you may want",

          "This is a pleasant place to walk and relax away from the hustle of the city. The paths are not all accessible for wheelchair users or those with limited mobility. When I visited there were lots of cranes nesting, they are beautiful birds! Worth it to see them in flight. There",
          "The Chellah has a mysterious quality to it that has not been lost to the modernization around it. You can sense the antiquity of the place, even before you see the Roman ruins at the bottom of path. How many peoples have lived and died on that hill side? Then when you add to it",
          "Peaceful walk amongst the Roman and moroccons ruins and necropolis...the information is all in Arabic or French...no English so if you don't have a guide you are kind of clueless... nevertheless I enjoyed walking amongst the ruins...",
          "The ancient ruins of a Roman city are enjoyable to walk through. We visited on a hot day and it was lovely to stroll through the gardens and ruins. We were fortunate to see the stork nests on the ruins. Although we had a guide it is worthwhile reading up on the area before you",
          "The Kasbah Chellah includes Roman ruins c200 BC - 300 AD, as well as early Moroccan, Islamic buildings representing living space, school, and mosque. Story nests high up on many protrusions from this historic site. Our group ended up taking as many pics of storks as they did",

          "We wandered around Chellah for a few hours. There were some great photo opportunities and lovely views across the bay. It's worthwhile if you have a morning or afternoon to spare and unlike much of morocc, there is very little hassle to buy or indulge, from locals.",
          "Because this is such an important historical attraction, reading about its background would make the visit more interesting and more worth it. Several civilizations have governed the country and each one has added to the importance of this city. This place is a feasible walk",
          "We had a lovely morning walk of this stunning backdrop. Here we saw what used to be great elegance and still is. The lands and gardens are consistently tended to and even the schools brought visiting children to the monument during our stay. It's worth a visit.",
          "It was an excellent evening as part of the Jazz festival at Chellah. The evening was nice and the day we visited all the roman ruins etc. I highly recomend a tour guide for this one. The cost is minimal and the story is interesting and you need to hear it.",

          "This is a cool pleasant garden with walking tracks through avenues of green. There is also a Roman ruin here, partly excavated, partly original and partly (minimally) restored. A pleasant diversion for us on a warm day.",
          "The ruins were fascinating. It was amazing to walk amongst such antiquity. The garden is beautiful too.",
          "Was suggested we had a look, wandered there from the medina, not a bad walk if you can handle the heat. Anyway, got there and hardly any tourist. The place is being rescued so the walls are rebuilt. Inside you can see many centuries of occupation in the ruins. Worth a look, but",
          "If you are in Rabat and have any free time, you must visit Chellah. The tour book made this site seem like it was in an utter state of disrepair, but I was impressed all around. Many staff were tending to the flowers and all the giant storks and expansive nests were a special",
          "Chellah was amazing to see. Its like revisiting an old palace / fort . It was amazing to see all the ruins and landscape with a lot of historical history. Tour guides available upon entrance to further give background history of this attraction. Definitely recommended.",
          "As we stayed downtown close to the Rabat Ville train station, we decided we could walk to Chellah. It is about a 20 minute walk. The place has an enjoyable garden, Roman ruins, and Islamic monuments as well. We really liked the place. It would have been great if it has a cafe",
          "A great change of a tourist attraction, from the usual medina and kasbahs of Rabat. Come here to see Roman and Moroccan Muslim ruins in a small space. It's easy to walk around and complete your exploration of the venue within an hour. It's not far from the centre of Rabat,",
          "My family and I visited the Chellah as part of a Casablanca - Rabat day tour. After a short walk into a pleasant garden, you can see the Roman ruins and the storks nesting on top. We appreciated the history of the ruins and Islamic culture so much more because of our guide. We",
          "The fortress of Chellah is a nice tourist spot. There is an entrance fee of 10 Moroccan dirhams. The people are welcoming and friendly. No need for a tour guide because the whole place is quite manageable to roam around. Nothing much to see and you can finish the whole place in",
          "I did not expect to find so many well preserved structures at the Chellah. The ruins are spread out over a large area, with lots of nooks and corners with surprises. Quite manageable although there are some steps and elevated areas, but a good view of both the Roman remains and",
          "The Chellah is a short cab ride outside the downtown of Rabat. Entry is inexpensive and the walk down through the gardens to the ruins takes you back twenty centuries to roman times. Many of the ruins are guarded by storks under whose gaze you constantly walk. The site contains",
          "Wow!!! Surreal and breathtaking! The architecture is stunning! The history fascinating. Not worth hiring a guide. Strolling through the ruins at your own leisurely pace is more rewarding and pleasurable.",
          "Visit Chellah near the Royal Palace and discover one of the rarest Roman ruins in Rabat. The outside walls of Chellah were recently renovated/ repairs to give it even a better look at night. We recommend including it in all tours of Rabat",
          "The Chellah is great for spending an hour, learning about the original trade settlement of the Phoenicians and Romans, and it's later use by Muslim rulers. The ruins are quite well exhibited and accessible, but the storks who nest in droves really steal the show. Very worthwhile",

          "Nature and archeology in the midst of the city - an impressive combination. The chellah is a spiritual oasis and well worth the visit. After entering, follow the main path all the way down the hill. Wander throughout the mosque until you find the abandoned pools and wonderful",

          "I liked this place more than the old town. It's very quiet, which adds to the Charme. I was practically on my own. The ruins are beautiful and the dozens of storks and stork nests add to the atmosphere. Feels almost a little enchanted. Definitely worth the hike out of the city",
          "We were fortunate to have a very knowledgable guide to take us through the Chellah. He explained to us the time line and wove interesting facts together. We thank Aziz for making our visit so informative and interesting. The comment he made about the layout of the gardens -",
          "We visited the Chellah ruins as part of our tour. While the ruins were quite interesting, most stunning were all the storks and their associated nests. About halfway through I switched out my regular camera lens for my long zoom telephoto lens for birds. I recommend the visit",
          "This Historic ruin is undergoing a major restoration and landscape enhancement making it one of the best attractions in town. It is also a nice peaceful getaway as well. If you are fortunate to visit April/May you will encounter more storks than you ever dreamed of nesting here",

          "This is a 14th century Merinid necropolis. It's too bad portions haven't been better preserved, but you can still get a sense for how the place once was. As is typical for this time of year in Morocco, storks were nested everywhere.",
          "This mosque is in garden area but ancient Phoenicians set the tone. The old Sultan's burial place is here. The river passing through separates the city of Rabat to that of Sala. Cranes are present and their best were very visible. An ancient and medieval history that is",

          "This archaeological Roman and Islamic site, is quiet unique for it shows that both cultures lived respectfully next to each other around the year 750 AD. That's why most of the site was still found intact. The site is in the winter occupied with many, many Storks, nesting on all",
          "Once the site of a Roman trading & shipping center, you still see the shop cells. Very well maintained & very tranquil.. except when the storks start acting up, it's quite a chatter, & there are many storks.if you're having fertility issues, don't forget to bring your boiled",
          "This is our second visit of Rabat. The first was very short and we only saw Oudayas. This time, we spent a bit more time looking around and went to Chellah, which is an old fortified castle that includes roman ruins. We first wandered around and really liked the atmosphere of",

          "We visited this site on a saturday morning. Repairs/renovations to the outer walls were in progress. The gardens are lovely and have a wide range of plants. The ruins evoked, for me, images of the bygone peoples occupying the site. We accepted the offer of an unofficial guide.",
          "Historically, the Roman and the Phoenicians used this area geographically as a trading route. Chellah a.k.a. Sala Colonia was once a Roman town that bustled with activity. Muslim conquerors named the area Sala and the name remains. Romans were here first, then the Marinids.",
          "Chella is a beautiful and peaceful place to spend some time while in Rabat. Ruins, gardens, views of the city and cats!",

          "This a particularly good spot to escape the manageable yet abundant pedestrian traffic of the old city. The park is a surprisingly quite setting with an inexpensive entrance fee of 10 MAD per adult. If cats are your thing, there are plenty of them wandering about the ruins.",

          "The best attraction on Rabat Accessible well situated a lot of historical views and attraction to check Fun and awesome",
          "Beware of mosquitto's and if you bring kids, keep them in eyesight. It is a nice activity for the day. It is ideal not to go when it is too hot outside, as there is not much in the way of shade cover when you are inside. You get to see some old ruins, but the nicest part is",
          "Unfortunately the main gate is covered in scaffolding because the main gate is the interesting part. The Roman ruins are nice to wonder around. The Madras's minaret is very photogenic and the several pairs of storks make it a unique place. Ultimately, you can go wrong with a",
          "The fact that it dates to 7th century BC and is still standing makes it worth visiting. There is a lot here to impress and it is worth the time you spend there.",
          "Basically this is a fort with lots of ruins and gardens to explore. There are some great views and you can more or less every bit of the ruins. Admissions was only 10MAD per person and totally worth it. Be warned that there is a rather steep hill you have to go down and back up.",
          "Great place to visit, surprisingly big and well kept. It is pleasant to walk around even on a hot day as most of it is in shade.",
          "Did a tour of Chellah- ancient ruins that had been hidden underground. It is just amazing at the size and condition of this once city. You can walk around and see all the different areas and see some of the hand work that they did on columns and buildings. It was nice to walk",
          "I would definitely recommend visiting the Chellah if you're in Rabat. Unlike in a lot of Europe, you can get up-close and personal with the ruins, and have access to most of the grounds. It was peaceful and breathtaking. There are many signs to educate you on what you're",
          "Amazing place with so much mixed Arab and Roman history. Situated on higher ground overlooking the river estuary to the south of the city, quiet and peaceful. Watch out for the storks !!!",

          "This is a nice place to visit. The gardens are pretty. The old Roman ruins are a site to see. There are storks in nests all over the property. While we visited there were some young storks in the nest.",
          "Rabat is typically not your main destination if you're going to Morocco and no doubt other cities have much more history. Nonetheless if you are in Rabat then its worthwhile to go to the Chellah, and see the remains of the Roman buildings and other architecture.",
          "This is a must see site for anybody visiting Rabat. It has relics of Phoenician, Roman and Islamic occupation of the site. The signage is patchy, so a good guide book is a necessary companion when visiting.",
          "Or you will be just looking at the ruins without knowing a thing about it. Everything/the info boards are in French or Arabic...",
          "These ruins were by far my favorite over the palace and mausoleum. The gardens within are a plus (pretty and well managed) but the physical remnants of enshrined roman statues and columns that have toppled over the years was the cake!",
          "As well as the storks chatting away in their nests on top of crumbling walls etc the Roman and onwards ruins, helped by the 1755 earthquakes that also flattened Lisbon, are reached through the impressive walls and gate and a cooling garden. Signs are in Arabic and French only.",
          "We didn't expect too much from this visit based on our guidebook, thogh were suprised by the energy that has been put in to this place for restoration and maintenance. Furthermore it is a great mixture of buildings from Roman and Medieval/sultan times and also has a great garden",
          "An incredibly interesting site with a lot of amazing roman ruins. A bargain as well! My advice would however be to avoid walking to the site as it is quite far from down town Rabat and you need to walk past some sensitive government buildings, with nervous military guards, to",
          "Before we went there, I researched online for information about the opening hours, and found in several websites and blogs that it opened from 8:30a.m. to 6:30p.m.. We got there at around 5:45p.m. and it was closed. There was no information on site and they seemed to be going",
          "Where to start...the ruins of Chellah, for me, were brilliant. Outside of the city walls, being the old city, it sits in a somewhat isolated area. The ruins are not in a great state, but they're imposing s5nd worth a visit. The gate is a great entry point.",
          "Very evocative site with great vistas toward Sale and an opportunity to see nesting storms up close. Take a taxi (just verify price ahead) as it is quite a hike and easy to get lost despite its looking like a straight shot from the big mosque. Consider lunch and a glass of wine",
          "Want to look at a different perspective of Morocco's history? Come to Chellah! The archeological site is really awesome and other than some rude tourists there is really everything you'd want from such a place. Guides are great and there is just so much to see! You won't regret",
          "I visited Chellah on a Thursday afternoon. There were few other tourists there so it was quite peaceful and relaxing. These ruins cover much more area than I had anticipated so you can do quite a bit of walking to see everything. The admission price is low- only 20 dirhams.",
          "You can runaway from noisy streets and relaxing inside beautiful gardens. Good place to visit and rest",

          "This spot is beautiful in all seasons. You can spend an hour or a few, if you are ready to just relax and entertain yourself with a book, snack or chatting. Very family friendly in terms of open space in general but some guards will whistle if kids climb on rocks or trees; often",
          "This place is so calm and the gardens are just a place you can relax. You will also enjoy the storks flying around",
          "Interesting way to spend a couple of hours. Signage is minimal but not really necessary if one is just enjoying the architecture. Interesting pool with huge eels. Plenty of cats as with everywhere.",
          "Surprisingly uncrowned but fascinating glimpse into the history of the wealth of a port city. There are better preserved sites in other North African and Southern European countries but this is certainly worth a visit if you come to Rabat.",
          "The site has a very rich heritage where it had been colonised by the Phoenicians and then later the Romans and Berbers. With the help of a guide, you understand the significance of this place and what the ruins used to be. The Moorish ramparts look absolutely stunning as the",
          ".It is worth to visit it if you are in Rabat.do'nt doubt that the place is the most interesting places in the city.you will see elegant minaret now topped by stork's nest, Medresa,gravys and beautiful garden .with a guide you will know more about it.(we didn't have a guide).",

          "Interesting looking spot but it lacked information about what we were walking through. Worth a visit.",
          "Aside from the immense history at this site, it is very beautiful and surrounded by the old medina walls. It was a pleasure to walk around the area on a Sunday afternoon. It's very relaxing and has a zen feel about it. It's also inexpensive and easily accessible.",
          "Chellah is one of the places that get few visitors less crowd maybe because it's far from the down town,and it's one of the oldest places in Rabat \"roman ruins\" perfect for old culture lovers :) actually it's invaded by cats",

          "Touring the Roman ruins was neat, but certainly accentuated by the sound of the storks with their funny cry. Lovely little nooks in the shade that are perfect for a picnic!",
          "Escape the hustle and bustle of the city for some peach and quiet wandering through the ruins of Chellah.",
          "It was great to walk through the ruins and feel the sense of history throughout the grounds. A lot of interesting plants make the site beautiful. Storks are abound, nesting high in each of the towers. Very interesting experience.",
          "This is a beautiful garden with a large variety of plants, cats, storks, and it also has the ruins. We spent a morning here and really enjoyed the sights. Bring 5dh for parking if you have car. We didn't have a guide because there weren't any who spoke English, but this was",

          "Wow what to say..... u will walk around a beautiful garden and birds. So calm and exotic we were totally in love with this garden... There are some ruins with all history explication in arab, french and english. The price is really correct.. 10 dirham for one entrance. Don't",
          "The ruins of this ancient fortress will leave you wondering what it must have been like to live within such walls, with columns resembling something you would see in Athens mixed with tropical gardens it is a wondrous sight",
          "Chellah is a very interesting site. Within the Islamic built walls there are Roman, Byzantine and Islamic ruins. I suggest a guide to show you around and explain the history of the site. The Roman ruins are in one central location. The best Byzantine structure is the church",
          "Interesting and quiet place of historic value. The old Roman settlement was abandoned and Chellah basically became a ghost town. What can be seen is mostly built in the 14th century by a Merinid sultan. What struck me is that the design of the mosque built at the time has been",
          "Chellah is quite amazing - a necropolis and ancient site housed within a very picturesque fortress. There is a small very beautiful garden there as well.",

          "I believe the Chellah an old crumbling palace is the most beautiful site to be visited in Rabat. It offers tranquility and beauty. Well thought out Restoration is underway. In addition the walls and the big tress are colonized by thousand of singing birds. Don't miss it.",
          "This old Roman naval town Sala Colonia (later called Chellah) was one of the first major settlements at the banks of the Bou Regreg river. The ruins show how a Roman port grew into a medieval town until it was abandoned in the 12th century. A site to visit for history lovers.",
          "The gardens offer a lovely stroll for those that don't mind a bit of up and down the hills. The Chellah sits majestically on the hills above the BouRegreg River, and inside its walls you can find some amazing artifacts and beautiful gardens. A wonderful place for some great",
          "Nice ruins, gardens, clean, natural brook, many storks all around, beautiful view of city. Everything is written in Arabic and French but you can't get lost. It's really a good place to spend your time in nature and explore little details of ruins.",
          "The Romans came, got squished by an earthquake then the Berber built a mausoleum on top. Excavation of both sites has left an interesting view of the layers of history. And the storks love the nesting sites provided by the ruins!",
          "Quite well preserved Roman remains, guides hovering which we rebuffed. Typical of so many Roman remains although these in quite good state of repair. Stork nests dominate all the high points. They all had chicks when we were there. Cost 10R less than a pound.",
          "It's true that one can walk around the ruins and enjoy the serenity of the gardens, but much will be missed without a tour guide to fill one in on what one is observing. The old Roman city has crumbled but there are enough remains to stimulate the imagination. The wildflowers",

          "I knew nothing about Rabat before this trip with Under Moroccan Sun tour guide, but loved the Chellah ruins. Our guide was great at sharing history (it is best to go with someone who knows the history), and I loved the nesting of the storks amidst the ruins. Such an impressive",
          "My husband and I spent a couple of hours meandering through this ancient archaelogical site this afternoon. Well worth the time. The gardens are beautifully maintained (not a single weed in sight), lush and intensely fragrant. A delight to your senses. Surprised we could wander",

          "Rabat does not have a lot of tourist attractions compared to other cities in Morocco, but if you are there for more than a day and want to go outside the Medina, then Chellah is the place to visit. It is a walled casbah, first constructed by the Romans and later witnessed an",

          "Great place for a walk, and to know more about the history of ancient civilizations who lived there. Very clean place, had several modifications over the years.",
          "Highly recommend this site to anyone who is in Rabat. It is really an amazing complex and there is a lot of history here between the Roman and Arabic portions. The garden is also very beautiful. The price of admission is extremely inexpensive. When we went we had a local",
          "We came here as part of a tour and would have loved to spend more time. There are gardens, and ruins of living quarters and a mosque. But the surprise was the storks! There are 75 nests throughout the grounds, with many pairs on the nests. To watch these birds fly over the ruins",
          "This is such an important sight that you will need a guide to explain what you are looking at. With the provided, I was stunned by the extensive grounds and the historical importance. Well worth spending 2 hours here!",
          "Reminders of the long history of Morocco, although not always easy to decipher if you do not know Arabic or French. The grounds and the views by themselves, however, are worth the trip.",
          "This is really beautiful with a lot of history. There is a lot of walking to get to the good parts and it would be somewhat limited for a wheel chair. If you are a photographer it is perfect as light makes things come to life. I had a guide with me but I think if I were on my",
          "A necropolis build on an ancient Roman settlement... Amazing place that I could spend days exploring. The encounter of morrocan medieval dinasty with Roman ruins. Personally I found Roman ruins were the most impressive sight. Massive stone constructions that still look perfectly",
          "On a sunny but warm winter\u00b4s day we walked here from the town centre which took about 40 minutes. The ruins behind the huge Chellah walls were a wonderful suprise with so much well preserved from its slow change of use over the centuries. An added treat is watching the resident",
          "An extremely awesome place to see especially if your a history fan etc. Ancient Roman ruins that were re-used by other cultures thru the years. The best thing I checked out in Rabat. It was really peaceful too and nice gardens as well",
          "A nice counterpoint to the busy medina. It's very peaceful with a beautiful view of the valley. The garden is very well taken care of.",
          "It's not a interesting place. Inside only plants a lots of destroyed things, we found only three pieces of Roman columns. Price: U$D 1,00",
          "We spent a lovely morning after 10am at the Chellah. I'm all for ancient ruins but when they come with attractive gardens and friendly cats, then it's a bonus. I read some negative reviews about the Chellah, that it was rundown, but I was there a week ago, and it was anything",
          "Easily accessible, stunning setting, lovely gardens, Roman & Moroccan site with views. Close to town",
          "We visited late morning in mid September and were surprised how quiet and tranquil it was here - only a few other people. As well as the archeological site itself other attractions are stocks nesting on top of the ruins and cats on the ground. Bring some coins for the man who",
          "Amazing gardens, well kept with a very big variety of plants, historic site with roman and arabic ruins. A must see, you will not regret",
          "This site is interesting Roman Ruins and historical site, worth a visit in Rabat. Go in the early morning before it gets too hot, if you are visiting in the summer.",
          "It is amazing that something this old still exists, but it is not well maintained, dirty and smelly. It is not located in an area you can walk to, and there is no parking. If you go, take a tour so you can understand what you are seeing.",
          "Chellah is the site of some old Roman and Moroccan ruins. It is a very impressive old fort, with old Mosque, Madrassah, Hammam, Gardens etc. It is definitely worth a couple of hours of your time, and a bargain at 10 dirhams each. Climbing over some of the ruins can be a bit",
          "Only 10DH to get in and worth a visit - helps if you have a guidebook or a guide to read a little bit more about the place but can be easily explored on your own. Little bit out of the way - we walked from the medina - very do-able!",
          "Beautiful ruins! You can definitely feel the past while walking around. You will also learn about this place during your walk since there is enough description of what you are looking at. Also the garden and the view from the Chellah is very beautiful!",
          "The Chellah was really cool. It's a great place full of history. I just wish there had been signs in English as my French is only so-so. It was interesting to be so close to structures that were so incredibly old.",
          "This was an amazing site to visit. The Roman and Moroccan ruins were awesome in the true sense of the word. There aren't too many areas you can't walk so enjoy meandering with the cats.",
          "This is an old Roman city in Rabat. You will see few ruins and bunch of storks. This a place that will require about an hour to visit. Enjoy.",
          "Loved our visit to this exciting location. The storks that nest among the ruins are beautiful and very vocal. The architecture is interesting and a must visit if you love gardens too.",
          "The archeological site in really astonishing, but there is no opportunity to buy a bottle of water, to have a good perception from the mai road because turist busses park just in front of the mail facade, pathways inside often doesn't exist...son it may happen turists walk on",
          "Must see: historical place where archeologists have found phoenician traces, roman sculptures etc. Moroccan government cares mostly about Islamic period of this place and this is a big mistake I believe. This is a true crosssroad of civilisations and a nice park with not so many",
          "This is great - it is a large area of Roman ruins including a necropolis (royal tombs). It's quite impressive and it has a garden with lots of fruit trees and a water feature with eels. I went alone so I was caught off-guard by the guide. In the end the 10 MAD entry turned into",
          "This place looks gorgeous from the outside and the inside. It looks like a huge castle. From the inside there are many things to see and remains.",
          "This is a nice place. Jewish cemetery, Roman ruins, and Koranic school ruins all in one place. Well worth the price of admission, and certainly worth a couple hours to walk around and look at each type of ruins. The Jewish cemetery is on the right as you drive in, and cannot",
          "Beautiful gardens, very quiet place with a lot of history combined in a small area. The storks are a pleasant addition.",
          "I think this is worth a visit if you are at all interested in history. Felt is was the best of the visit to Rabat.",
          "It is not very well maintained or preserved. Its just like they found ruins and they are not putting enough money to restore it.",
          "Very interesting, beautiful panorama. I went when there were almost no tourists so I took a guide by myself. There are signs in French. I understand some French but they are not very rich in details so a guide is useful if you want to know a bit more. The guide I took was also",
          "The Merinid Citadel of Chellah was the site originally abandoned by the Romans in 1150. The Chellah gardens are beautifully landscaped. As you walk down the main pathway you come to a 14th century necropolis which is the site of an earlier Roman town built by the Merenid Sultan",
          "Not much to see. The beach view is nice and a nice place for photos, but I didn't get much history of the place from my guide. the place has make shift cafes and bakeries, but not much to see.",
          "Surprisingly beautiful place... I lived in rabat for several years and never really got to visit, when I finally did I was rather surprised... kept in excellent condition, roman berber and arab history all mixed together through generations",
          "Going in the morning we enjoyed Chellah with very little visitors. Filled with storks standing on their nests we could hear them. The garden is also very beautiful, it is a visit not to miss.",
          "I have so sweet memories over this place! I would love to revisit again! it reflects integrated historical structures",
          "Nice and quiet place, only with cats and storks making you company. Nice place to relax and meditate in the ruins from two time periods - Roman and Medieval one.",
          "The roman ruins gives me shivers (shivers in a good way).. The stones and structures are very old and so glad to have opportunity to still witness some of it standing. I guess there is so much history that we still need to learn and preserving this historical site gives future",
          "I really liked the fact that there was some ruins from the roman times, and other very artistic and full of good energy. the place is really worth a visit and there is a lot to watch and see and feel.",
          "Beautiful gardens in the remains of three civilizations. Chellah is a great place to go for families and singles alike. An amalgam of Roman and Islamic history, Chellah is also a well maintained garden. This is a great place to pack a picnic lunch and relax/wander.",
          "I love the dragon tree and the stork nest. The ruins are nestled with small gardens throughout and has a nice view at the end",
          "Heaven for photographers. But you really need to have a tour guide or someone who knows the place to appreciate this place.",
          "This area is central for many sites. Avoid the offers for a tour unless you agree up front on price. That person is not just three wanting to show you something. The",
          "If you come with a guide you'll appreciate the long history here. Walking though you can see both Roman ruin and more recent (but still 700 year old) Moroccan ruins. Nice stop when passing through Rabat.",
          "This is a site that you can do on your own or negotiate for a tour. Be firm with the guide for an agreeable price upfront. It is beneficial if you know a bit about the history and question the guide to see if he knows some history and able to tell you in English. Otherwise,",
          "My wife and I and two fellow travelers spent over two hours in the Chellah with a local guide as part of a half-day tour of Rabat. I could easily have spent more time there. The ruins of the Roman city, Sala Colonia, are fascinating as are 13th and 14th century A.D. ruins and",
          "Experience lush beautiful gardens, colonies of storks, an eel pond (go all the way down the hill to the right, past the tombs), Roman ruins and an ancient crumbling mosque.",
          "Interesting site, but be wary about the tour guides lurking just beyond the entrance. They will come at you as just a friendly person and take you on a tour. At the end they will announce their price (abt $8 pp). Just be careful and expect it... Also expect to tip the imam who",
          "Visited recently with a family, beautiful place full of history. Would definitely recommend. It's a shame there were no explanations in English so I was left with lots of unanswered questions. Also, bear in mind, there are no shops inside or near by, had to suffer as we finished",
          "The place holds great stories from different ages, people and cultures. Unfortunately there are not enough tour guides iside of the place, you will either take one of the workers ( they dont take a lot of money, we paid the man 30dirahms for 45 mins) or you read about it online",
          "This is an easy Chellah to navigate on your own. There are lots of hills and steps so wear good shoes!",
          "This UNESCO site is absolutely stunning! We were free to wander around the grounds and take in the history. I only wish that there had been some type of brochure or map with some information for us to read while we explored. Be sure to bring lots of water with you and wear",
          "Visited here with young children who enjoyed exploring the interesting site. Walked here from the main rail station. There are no taxis at the site so you have to walk to the main road or ask someone to call a taxi. Also, no shops or even anywhere to get water; can be",
          "Surrounded by walls this place is a visit worth although having visited many roman ruins, this one is not enormous, but in May the guide which helped us around gave us interesting comments about trees and bushes, a lot of storks around... At the end the guide tried to get too",
          "This site is a great, low key destination packed with history. My one piece of advice would be to go with a guide. There is a long, interesting history represented in the ruins, and the more guidance the better the experience. When I went, there was very little in the way of",
          "I spent the whole day at Chella. Such a beautiful part of Rabat. The ruins are just that, there's very little remaining of the Roman structures but later (yet still very old & crumbling) additions still remain. Such beautiful, well maintained gardens which are incredibly",
          "The paths, although somewhat steep, were lined by lovely vegetation and many of the roofs and chimneys were adorned by nesting storks.",
          "This ancient walled city has several excavated areas dating from different eras, some ancient and some medieval. Surprises were the garden below the ruins, an exquisite lush place, and the huge colony of storks nesting on the high points of the ancient city and its surroundings.",
          "These ruins are beautiful and worth the stop. There's good stories here but note that all the signs are in french or Arabic. The gardens at the bottom are like a little oasis.",
          "This area is an old necropolis, but now a quiet parc with lots of trees and plants and especially storks. It is nice to stroll around here after a busy day in Rabat.",
          "For those who've visited Italy, the ruins will seem minor and small -- but it's still worth a visit, as they represent several different periods of the history of the city.",
          "There is more to Chellah than the storks. Storks are all over the places in Rabat anyway. Roman ruins of Sala Colonia can be found there (therms and olive oil extracting system) and built on top of the Roman ruins, the Merinide dynasty build its necropolis. The remains of many",
          "Chellah is interesting as a Roman ruin, as well as burial place of Muslim rulers. The surrounding garden is quite tranquil and scenic. However, stork nest sitings seem to distract from the intended attractions. So unless you find storks truly appealing, or you find even minor",
          "I had not planned to visit Rabat, an extra day in Casablanca, ended up at this interesting site. Really had a nice time at Chellah, the walls, the entrance and the gardens were worth the visit.",
          "Chellah is the jewel of Rabat. The ruins are very interesting but the storks simply take the cake. There are about 75+ nests in the property and they are a photographers dream come true. You cannot \"not\" get a good picture of the storks! Try to get there early in the morning as",
          "History surrounds you, storks nest on the towers, stroll shady gardens. Go in the morning before the crowds for the best experience.",
          "The ruins themselves are a bit of a dud. I enjoyed the walls, the gardens, but especially the storks. They are spectacular! It's amazing to see them clap their bills with their heads upside down!",
          "We very much enjoyed out visit to this historic site which dates back to Roman times and includes the tombs of medieval Moroccan kings. The ruins are not the most impressive we have seen; however, the combination of ruins and gardens makes this a very enjoyable place to wander",

          "We took a coach trip from Casablanca to Rabat on the way we stoped at Chellah to see the gardenst and Roman archeological site. Eathquake in the 1750s damaged the site but worth a visit for the views over the river, One interesting coincidence was that storks are nesting now",
          "The Challah Necropolis should not be missed. There are ruins dating back to the Roman times, which include a Roman bath and temple to Jupiter. The ruins of the mosque are very nice as well. We visited late morning in April and it was not terribly crowded.",
          "Very interesting Roman remains but also ruins of 13th century mosques and madrassa. We went in April and it was not too crowded. There were storks nesting everywhere. Great to see. There are sign boards to tell you what is what but our guide was interesting and informative and",

It has been central in the history of Casablanca.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe area outside the walls of the old medina that is now United Nations Square, used to be the location of the Souq Kbir (\u0633\u0648\u0642 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631), also referred to as le Grand Socco, before French colonization. In 1908, after the French bombardment and invasion of Casablanca, the French commander Charles Martial Joseph Dessigny ordered the construction of a clock tower in the area, which then took the name, Place de l'Horloge, \"Square of the Clock\". The square was then named Place de France, \"Square of France,\" and the surrounding area was developed by a team of French architects and urban planners chosen by the French R\u00e9sident g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Hubert Lyautey and led by Henri Prost.\nThe Magasins Paris-Maroc building (1914), constructed by Hippolyte Delaporte and Auguste Perret, was located at the southern end of Place de France. The Neo-Mauresque Hotel Excelsior, which remains today, was built in 1916.As the European ville nouvelle, or \"new city,\" expended eastward of the square, the square evolved from a marketplace to a contact point between the European city and the Casablanca medina, which French colonists described as the \"ville indig\u00e8ne.\"\n\nThe clock tower was demolished in 1948, and the square became a bus station for a period of time in the midcentury. A clock tower imitating the original's design was constructed a short distance closer to the medina in 1993.\nThe architect Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Zevaco designed the Kora Ardia (\u0643\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u0631\u0636\u064a\u0629), \"Globe,\" in 1975.The Casablanca Tramway transformed the square. Work started in 2009, and the first line was inaugurated December 12, 2012.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe square is reachable by Line 1 of the Tramway, which stops at United Nations Square Station.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCasablanca Clock Tower\nMedina of Casablanca\n\n\n== References ==",

The first enclosures were built to house lions that were previously kept in the royal palace.\nThese lions were thought to be descendants from Barbary lions.\n\n\n== Conservation for the lion ==\nGiven that the Barbary lion is extinct in the wilderness, importance has been given to finding possible Barbary lions or descendants of the Barbary lion in captivity. So far, tests indicate the lions of the zoo are not pure Barbary lions, but descendants of the original Barbary lion. This is partly as members of the Moroccan royal family had kept lions that were captured from the Atlas Mountains.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAddis Ababa Zoo\nDrakenstein Lion Park\nParc Sindibad, Casablanca\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nZoo Rabat, capital of Morocco YouTube\nMoroccan zoo is home to last of Atlas lions (allegedly)\nParc Zoologique National ( Temara - Rabat ) - (2/2) \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a (in Arabic",

          "Really nice zoo. Animals (mostly) kept in good conditions with lots of space. 50 dhiram entry good value. Food about double normal local price but still cheap by European/US standards. 20 dhiram ($2) for a pit of mint tea in the cafe. I spent several hours here just chilling out",
          "This zoo was very interesting to visit. In Canada, many zoos confine animals into tiny spaces, but in this zoo, it seemed as if the animals were treated better and also were given ALOT more space to roam.",
          "Me & my family really enjoyed our trip this zoo. The entry fee is only 50dh each with discounts for family tickets. If you want to feed the giraffes there are set times and an extra charge for this. The zoo itself is very well maintained and the animal enclosures well thought",

          "The main thing you notice here is that all the animals have plenty of space and look well cared for. One of the key visit points for Rabat. Tip: take a pair of binoculars as I did, then you will still see the details of the animals even if they are a little further away.",

          "Located at the far end of Rabat, you can get a petit taxi there, but getting back is harder. It is spacious with three main climate zones. The elephants were not on view when I visited but there were giraffes, hippos, snakes, monkeys and many smaller animals.",

          "The zoo of Rabat is a great place for families and children. The good thing is that animals are in big spaces and not in cages. The zoo is huge with different zones to visit. You can eat there or bring your own food. You can spend the whole day there. I recommend this place",
          "This is an excellent zoo. As good in many ways as zoos in places like Amsterdam and Berlin. And yet... only 110dhs for us to get in as a family... so perhaps a fifth of the price. There is everything you would expect - a wide range of interesting animals, chances to see feeding,",
          "The zoo of Rabat is a great place for families to educate their children about dfferent animals available at the zoo and spend a relaxing time in nature",
          "The zoo here is not huge and not small. I liked the style...natural barriers when possible between animals and guests. It gets busy on the weekend. It's a nice walk but if you have someone in your group with limited mobility, I would recommend reserving a golf cart tour. Don't",
          "Great zoo with a wild diversity of animals, well organized facility, pleasant place for families, kids etc",
          "We have visited the Rabat Zoo with the family. It is definitely worth a visit for those who have kids. The Zoo is rather big with a wide variety of animals. They are kept in tidy and rather big habitats which are well designed to ensure visitors can have a peak a the different",

          "This is an alright zoo. It is beautifully designed with plants and nice paths for visitors to enjoy, but the enclosures themseleves could use enhancements and enlargements. I was not saddened by how the animals were kept. The zoo was very quiet when we went early afternoon on",

          "Spend a day at the zoo with my nephews and nieces and they really liked the place. It's very spacious and well-structured and there are several different species. I believe there are still some empty spaces so I guess the zoo will improve its animal collection in the near",

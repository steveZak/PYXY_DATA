        "wiki": "Stockholm Palace or the Royal Palace (Swedish: Stockholms slott or Kungliga slottet) is the official residence and major royal palace of the Swedish monarch (the actual residence of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia is at Drottningholm Palace). Stockholm Palace is on Stadsholmen, in Gamla stan in the capital, Stockholm. It neighbours the Riksdag building. The offices of the King, the other members of the Swedish Royal Family, and the Royal Court of Sweden are  here. The palace is used for representative purposes by the King whilst performing his duties as the head of state.\nThis royal residence has been in the same location by Norrstr\u00f6m in the northern part of Gamla stan in Stockholm since the middle of the 13th century when the Tre Kronor Castle was built. In modern times the name relates to the building called Kungliga Slottet. The palace was designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and erected on the same place as the medieval Tre Kronor Castle which was destroyed in a fire on 7 May 1697. Due to the costly Great Northern War which started in 1700, construction of the palace was halted in 1709, and not recommenced until 1727\u2014six years after the end of the war. When Tessin the Younger died in 1728, the palace was completed by Carl H\u00e5rleman who also designed a large part of its Rococo interior. The palace was not ready to use until 1754, when King Adolf Frederick and Queen Louisa Ulrika moved in, but some interior work proceeded until the 1770s. No major conversions have been done in the palace since its completion, only some adjustments, new interiors, modernization and redecorating for different regents and their families, coloration of the facades and addition of the palace museums. The palace is surrounded by the Lejonbacken and the Norrbro to the north, the Log\u00e5rden (known as the Shot Yard in English) and Skeppsbron in the east, the Slottsbacken and the Storkyrkan in the south, and the outer courtyard and H\u00f6gvaktsterrassen in the northwest.\nAs of 2009 the interior of the palace consists of 1,430 rooms of which 660 have windows. The palace contains apartments for the Royal families, representation and festivities such as the State Apartments, the Guest Apartments and the Bernadotte Apartments. More features are the Hall of State, the Royal Chapel, the Treasury with the Regalia of Sweden, Livrustkammaren and the Tre Kronor Museum in the remaining cellar vaults from the former castle. The National Library of Sweden was housed in the northeast wing, the Biblioteksflygeln (the Library Wing), until 1878. As of 2014 it houses the Bernadotte Library. The Slottsarkivet is housed in the Chancery Wing. In the palace are the offices of the Royal Court of Sweden, a place of work for approximately 200 employees. The Royal Guards have guarded the palace and the Royal Family since 1523. A comprehensive renovation of the facade began in 2011, to repair weather damaged parts made from sandstone. The repairs are estimated to cost approximately 500 million crowns (about US$77 million) over a period of 22 years.\nThe Royal Palace is owned by the Swedish State through the National Property Board of Sweden which is responsible for running and maintaining the palace, while the St\u00e5th\u00e5llar\u00e4mbetet (the Office of the Governor of the Royal Palaces) manages the royal right of disposition of the palace.\n\n\n== Births ==\nIt was in this palace that the HRH Prince Carl Philip, Duke of V\u00e4rmland was born on 13 May 1979.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first building on this site was a fortress with a core tower built in the 13th century by Birger Jarl to defend Lake M\u00e4laren. The fortress grew to a castle, eventually named Tre Kronor for the core tower's spire top decorated with three crowns.\n\n\n=== Early suggestions ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, King Gustavus Adolphus made plans for a new royal palace. The plans came to naught, but in 1651, his daughter Queen Christina appointed Jean de la Vall\u00e9e to architect for the royal castles, and among his commissions was to make suggestions for how to improve and update the Tre Kronor Castle. Contemporaneous copperplates from 1654 shows de la Vall\u00e9e's idea of a more visible castle on a raised plateau with a connecting bridge over the Norrstr\u00f6m. Queen Christina remodelled and embellished the existing castle extensively, but no new castle was built during her reign.From 1650 to 1660, Jean de la Vall\u00e9e made suggestions for large conversions of the castle, but it was not until 1661, when Nicodemus Tessin the Elder became City Architect and Architect for the Royal castles, that more substantial plans for a new castle were made. In 1661, he presented the first draft for a conversion of the northern row which his son, Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, would later rework and realise in 1692 to 1696.A map of the Stadsholmen from the 1650s, illustrates de la Vall\u00e9es suggestion for the conversion of the old castle. The project also brought about an adjustment of the Slottsbacken, making it partially enclosed by buildings. Of interest are Tessin the Younger's additions in pencil on that map, probably made at the end of the 17th century. There is an early sketch for the northern facade's west wing and the two curved wings enclosing the outer courtyard (both executed). Tessin the Younger also made plans for the city area west of the palace with large stairs in false perspective where the Axel Oxenstierna palace, among other buildings, are and joining the V\u00e4sterl\u00e5nggatan in addition to a wide street to the present Mynttorget, straight though the city block with the present Brantingtorget (not executed). He had envisioned a line of sight from the center of the palace, westwards to the Riddarholmen.\n\n\n=== The northern row 1692\u20131696 ===\n\nThe northern row of the present palace was built in 1692, in just five months as a part of the old Tre Kronor castle. The new row had the same austere Baroque style that still remain, contrasting with the rest of the Renaissance castle.At an early stage of the conversion in the 1690s, a number of elderly Swedish artists such as David Kl\u00f6cker Ehrenstrahl and Johan Sylvius, were still alive and they contributed with artistic work to the completion of the northern row, in particular to the Royal Chapel. Ehrenstrahl made the large religious paintings and Sylvius painted the plafond.A model for the austere Roman baroque style, including a relatively strict regularity and symmetry, was the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, where the architect in charge of the conversion, Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, went to study buildings in 1688.The walls surrounding the storages, stables and workshops of the Tre Kronor castle are now behind the Lejonbacken and in the basement of the northern row. Thus, Lejonbacken conceals the old windowless wall behind it. Older walls can also be found higher up in large parts of the northern row's facade walls. The walls from the former northeast and northwest square corner-towers for example, are thicker in this part of the palace's ground floor, since Tessin re-used the remaining walls and incorporated them in the new palace. About half of the old walls were used in that manner, since the ever frugal Charles XI had only reluctantly agreed to the conversion which started in 1690. Thrift and recycling were guiding principles at the building of the northern row. Hence, the construction proceeded rather quickly and after five months the new row was topped out and roofed. The new walls became higher than the old ones, except for the towers which were completely enclosed in the new walls. The Charles XI's Gallery is one more feature remaining since before the fire, all according to Tessin's plan.\n\nA new Royal Chapel in the northern row was inaugurated at Christmas in 1696, and a new Hall of State was also planned there. The chapel was to replace the old castle chapel that had been erected by John III in the same location by the old storages and stables at the Tre Kronor castle.Building the new chapel with the same proportions as the old one and making it fit within the walls of the old chapel, with a retained high ceiling inside the walls of the former northeast tower (now the northeast corner of the palace), proved difficult for Tessin if he was to be able to adhere to the austere Baroque style where all the windows aught to be the same size, and placed in precise rows despite what rooms were behind them. To achieve this, Tessin added a mezzanine floor with smaller square windows just above the lower row of windows. These smaller windows now encircles the whole building, a remnant of the first castle chapel. After the fire, when Tessin could make more substantial alterations, the Royal Chapel and the Hall of State were placed in the southern row instead, and the furniture and inventories, such as benches, household silver and decorations are to some extent preserved in the present-day Royal Chapel.According to a plan from before the fire, the palace was to be in a square shape without any wings in austere Roman Baroque style, essentially with the rest of the rows looking like the northern row. This suggestion is not preserved, historian Boo von Malmborg suggests that this was probably because Tessin did not dare to present his comprehensive plans to the economical Charles XI.The new building is depicted in five engravings in the Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna printed in 1695 to 1702: picture No. I.19 the new northern facade of the castle including the Lejonbacken and the square courtyard, picture No. I.20 the new chapel's interior, picture No. I.21 the chapel's exterior, picture No. I.27 view of the Hedvig Eleonora Church and picture No. I.32 view from the Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden. Lejonbacken, which was to lead up to the north gate from the east as well as from the west, was never completed before the fire and is only mentioned in the drawings.\n\n\n=== The Palace fire in 1697 ===\nOn 7 May 1697, a great castle fire occurred, prompting the building of the present Stockholm Palace. The fire ruined most of the earlier fortress, the Tre Kronor Castle, except for the sturdy, recently constructed walls of the northern row, most of which are still standing. Unlike the rest of the castle, the walls of the northern row could be repaired.\n\n\n=== The first phase of building the new palace 1697\u20131709 ===\n\nAfter the fire, the Regency Council of King Charles XII under the direction of the Queen dowager Hedvig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp at the Karlberg Palace that a new castle should be built on the walls of the burnt castle. Nicodemus Tessin the Younger was the architect appointed to draw and build the new Stockholm Palace. At the same time that Tessin's plans were approved, he was appointed head of the construction of the palace as part of his new position: \u00d6verintendent \u00f6ver de Kungliga Slotten (Superintendent of the Royal Castles), a kind of castle architect. G\u00f6ran Josu\u00e6 T\u00f6rnquist (later ennobled Adelcrantz) became the Assisting intendent and his deputy, an important position at the construction site, and Hans Conradt Buchegger became general contractor for the palace construction. In 1697, Abraham Winantz Svanssk\u00f6ld, Tessin's half brother, was appointed deputy castle and court architect. Together with Tessin he was active at the palace construction and they were helped by several German journeymen. Important sculptors and craftsmen during the first years of the construction were, among others, Ren\u00e9 Chauveau, Bernard Foucquet the Elder and his son Jacques Foucquet.Tessin presented the first finished plans for the new palace within the year of the fire. First, the remnants of the old castle were razed, practically everything was demolished save for parts of the northern row with its strict Baroque, that were still standing. The demolishing was performed by approximately 300 men from mid May 1697 to mid-spring in 1700, when the remains of the old keep Tre Kronor were re-used as filling for the Lejonbacken. Consequently, most of the material for the new palace was new.\n\nWhen Tessin got the commission to design the new palace, he abandoned parts of his earlier plan about building a square palace and added the lower wings flanking the palace in the east and west.This was made to give the palace a more monumental look and this could be executed since there was now more open land in which to expand the palace such as the western area where King Gustav I's moat and cannon mounds had previously been.\nThe southwest wing had to be made shorter since the Storkyrkan was in the way. This asymmetry, created by the different lengths of the wings, was compensated by adding the two detached, semicircular wings for the Royal guards and the Commanders, west of the main building. These wings encircle the courtyard. Tessin's plans and commissions to artists still characterizes the facades, walls and stone pilasters as well as walls, floors, pillars and pilasters inside the palace, such as in the Hall of State, the Royal Chapel and the stairwells.The building of the palace went on with great intensity during the reign of Charles XII, but the costly campaigns during the Great Northern War were impedimental. Charles XII lost at the Battle of Poltava in 1709, and that year the building of the palace came to a complete halt. At that time, the courtyard had been leveled and the courtyard walls were erected to the height of one floor in the south and east part and half a floor in the west part. The palace remained in that semi-finished state until 1727, when the Riksdag granted funds to continue the work. This was one year before Tessin died.Some embellishments in Tessin's plans were never made. For example, he wanted to place an equestrian statue of King Charles XI in the inner courtyard in the French fashion at that time, but King Charles XII disliked that and rejected the idea since it would \"totally obscure the beautiful prospect\". Neither did Tessin's suggestion to embellish the roof balustrade with sculptures. Tessin's vision for this can be seen on an illustration of the palace made by Jean Eric Rehn about 1770.\n\n\n==== The French artists' colony ====\n\nThe largest group of artists came from France. Between the years 1693 and 1699, sixteen French masons, painters and foundrymen arrived at Stockholm. At Tessin's initiative, the craftsmen had received an invitation through the Swedish diplomatic envoy in Paris, Daniel Cronstr\u00f6m, to come and work for the Swedish king. They were offered yearly wages and accommodations. The sculptor Ren\u00e9 Chauveau started out with a salary of 1,000 riksdaler (approximately equal to US$49,550 in 2014) per year; he was among the highest paid in the group. Some artists had brought their families with them and they formed a French artists' colony. The family members often participated in the construction work. The whole group is referred to as de frans\u00f6ske hantwerkarne (the French craftsmen). Most of them had received their education at the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in Paris and had worked at King Louis XIV's large palace construction at Versailles. Most of the craftsmen were Catholic, and they lived and worked in a very tight-knit community close to the French embassy in Stockholm. They could practice their Catholic faith within the colony, but this was strictly forbidden in the rest of Sweden at that time. When to building of the palace came to a halt in 1709, the colony was dissolved. Some craftsmen, such as Ren\u00e9 Chauveau and his family, returned to France, but most of them remained in Sweden until they died during the first part of the 18th century.\n\n\n=== Tessin's plan for the palace surroundings ===\n\nAlterations of the land-use plan for the area surrounding the Stockholm Palace had been proposed during the beginning of the 1700s, by the superintendent Nicodemus Tessin the Younger. Tessin's plans for the city was finished in 1713, and in those the area surrounding the palace were given a new shape. A new Norrbro with rows of sculptures, a great royal cathedral and new Riddarholm Church resembling the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Facing the Stockholms str\u00f6m in an extension of the Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden, Tessin envisioned a 112 metres (367 ft) long \"victory hall\" with arcades and columns in a doric order, featuring two corner towers and exhibition halls with 50 metres (160 ft) headroom. There would be displayed cannons taken as booty, flags and other trophies of war. At the Helgeandsholmen he planned a horse racing stadium for equestrian games and other forms of entertainments, a bear-garden was also to be built. The ideas were not approved by King Charles XII who wanted the Helgeandsholmen for himself.Ramps were to be built on the Slottsbacken leading up to a narrowing area in front of the Storkyrkan, which was to be redressed in a new baroque facade. The Stortorget was also to be rebuilt and a new city hall and stock exchange was planned. Tessin was convinced that his plans would one day be realized, but building the new palace kept him fully occupied and demanded great financial resources. The time of the Swedish Empire was coming to an end and all the great plans remained unfulfilled.\n\n\n=== The second phase of building the new palace 1727\u20131771 ===\n\nNicodemus Tessin the Younger died in 1728, before the palace was finished. The responsibility for the construction was taken over by Carl H\u00e5rleman, even though Tessin's position as superintendent was formally passed on to his son Carl Gustaf Tessin.H\u00e5rleman formed large parts of the palace's interior in a newer style, more to the taste of that time, the Rococo. At H\u00e5rleman's initiative, the color of the facade was changed from the earlier brick red to light yellow (see Coloration below). When the building was reassumed in 1727, there was anew a need for qualified workers. The second group of French artists and craftsmen arrived in Stockholm in the summer of 1732, as a result of H\u00e5rleman's negotiations in Paris the previous winter. The group consisted of six persons: two Masters, Antoine Bellette and Michel Le Lievre and four journeymen. Other noted sculptors and craftsmen during the second phase of the construction were Charles Guillaume Cousin, Jacques-Philippe Bouchardon, Pierre Hubert L'Archev\u00eaque, Johan Tobias Sergel and Adrien Masreliez. Giovanni Battista Tiepolo turned down Tessin's offer of a commission.Carl H\u00e5rleman died in 1753, and his work was continued by Carl Johan Cronstedt and Carl Gustaf Tessin who finished the palace together. Some parts of the palace where the Royal family would live, the northern row and what is presently the State Apartments, were also completed that year. The Stockholm Palace was ready to be used in 1754. The Royal Family who had lived in the Wrangel Palace on Riddarholmen since the fire in the old castle, moved to their new residence on the First Advent that same year. Instead of living in the State Apartment, the Royal Family choose to stay in the part now known as the Bernadotte Apartments. The work on the interior continued even after the Royal Family had settled in. Priority was given to the interior rather than the completion of the Slottsbacken and Lejonbacken.Lejonbacken and the Chancery Wing were finished by architect Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, who also was put in charge for the work on the interior after H\u00e5rleman's death. 1771 is considered the year when the palace was officially declared finished. The wall of the eastern quay was completed that year, but during a number of years many of the statues and sculptures in the facade's niches were still lacking, such as the eight statues on the southern facade depicting noted Swedish men and the Enleveringsgruppen (the Abduction group) on the same facade.\n\n\n=== Development after the 1770s ===\n\nAfter the completion of the new palace, no major conversions has been made to the complex save for a number of adaptions, new interiors, modernizations and redecorations for different regents and their families. Museums have also been added to the palace.Artists like Jean Eric Rehn and Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander were important to the palace's grand interior during the end of the 18th and 19th century, when pilasters, columns, wall decorations, etc. were added. Among those sculptors, painters and craftsmen who also contributed during the later renovations were Louis Masreliez (interior work in Classicism and Neoclassicism), Jean Baptiste Masreliez (interior work), Axel Magnus Fahlcrantz (the Log\u00e5rden Wall and the wrought iron fence at Log\u00e5rden), Johan Niclas Bystr\u00f6m (sculptures), Sven Scholander (restorations), Johan Axel Wetterlund (facade sculptures of noted men and four allegorical groups on the Log\u00e5rden Wall), Julius Kronberg (ceiling paintings) and Kaspar Schr\u00f6der (facade sculptures; lion masks at the courtyard facade).A larger change in the facade was made during the reign of King Charles XIV John resulting in H\u00e5rleman's light yellow facade coloring being painted over and at the beginning of the 20th century during the reign of King Oscar II when a decision to go back to Tessin's original brick red color was made. As of 2014 it is the color of the facade. (see Coloration below)\nDuring the reign of King Oscar I, there was a renewed interest for older styles and when the Vita Havet (the White Sea Ballroom) was created from the designs of Per Axel Nystr\u00f6m in 1844\u20131850, a compromise between old and new was made. Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander was the royal curator of King Charles XV and shared his taste in interior design, this resulted in rooms like the Victoriasalongen (the Victoria Drawing room) in a lush revived Rococo style.King Oscar II performed a number of additions, improvements and modernizations to the palace. Most of the empty facade niches were filled with sculptures during his reign. He had the palace's technical installations updated, such as installing a water pipe system in 1873, installing electricity in 1883, telephone in 1884 and waterborne central heating around 1900. As of 2014 the property is connected to long-distance heating. The king's interest also extended to the decoration of the stairwells, and he commissioned Julius Kronberg to paint plafonds in the ceiling of the West Stairwell. Author Georg Svensson, wrote about King Oscar II that \"his goal was to complete the construction of the palace as intended in Tessin's plans in a manner worthy of this monument\".During 1922 to 1930, the Log\u00e5rden was rebuilt from the former English park to a more open area with pools of water on either side of the walkway leading from the East Arch to the Skeppsbron.In 1956 to 1958, Gustav III's Museum of Antiquities was restored. Architect and Chief Intendant Ivar Tengbom was appointed for the work. The Treasury was opened in 1970 and the Tre Kronor Museum in 1999.  In 2018 600 solar panels were installed on the roof of the palace and are expected to generate an annual output of 170 MWh or at least twelve percent of the palace's annual electricity consumption.\n\n\n== Exterior ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe palace is made of brick and sandstone. The roofs are covered with copper and are slanting inward towards the inner courtyard. On the main building they are encircled by a balustrade made of stone. The building consists of four rows, commonly named after the four cardinal directions.The facades of the palace were each given their own design and not the same as the original northern row. A triumphal arch in splendid Baroque style framed the entrance and the stairwell in the middle of the southern facade, and niches for statues were placed at every second window ledge. The middle parts of the east and west facades were adorned with Baroque pilasters, herms and statues. The palace has a total of 28 statues, 717 balusters, 242 volutes, 972 windows, 31,600 window panes and approximately 7,500 windows, doors and gates. The facade is covered with circa 9,500 m2 (102,000 sq ft) of dimension stone and 11,000 m2 (120,000 sq ft) of plaster. The main building, without the wings, is 115 by 120 m (377 by 394 ft) and encloses the Inre borgg\u00e5rden (the Inner Courtyard).Projecting from the corners of the main building are four wings facing the east and the west. Between the two eastern wings is the Log\u00e5rden, and between the two western wings is the Outer Courtyard. All the wings are 16 m (52 ft) wide and 48 m (157 ft) long except for the southwest wing which is 11 m (36 ft) long because of the position of the Storkyrkan. The asymmetry is concealed by the two detached, semicircular wings the H\u00f6gvaktsflygeln (The Royal Guards Wing) and the Kommendantsflygeln (the Commanders Wing).Approximately 800,000 people visit the palace each year.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The courtyards ===\n\nThe palace has two courtyards. Outside the western row is the Outer Courtyard which is the main area for the changing of the guards. A statue of Christina Gyllenstierna stands in the Outer Courtyard, erected at an initiative from the F\u00f6reningen f\u00f6r Stockholms fasta f\u00f6rsvar (The Society for the Permanent Defence of Stockholm) in 1912. The Outer Courtyard is enclosed by two curved wings. The northern is used by the Royal Guards and the southern mainly by the Royal Gift Shop.The Inner Courtyard is surrounded by the four rows of the palace and is accessed by portals in the middle of the four rows; the south, west, north, and east portals (or arches). The Inner Courtyard is 89 m (292 ft) long in the east\u2013west direction and 77 m (253 ft) wide in the north\u2013south direction. Tessin had planned to put an equestrian statue depicting Charles XI in the middle of the courtyard, but this plan was never realized.The design of the large Inner Courtyard with its access to the Log\u00e5rden and the Norrbro is inspired by the courtyard at the Louvre according to the general ideas of the Baroque.\n\n\n=== The western row ===\n\nThe western row, or the western facade, represents \"The Male Qualities\" and the King. From the western row projects the Chancery Wing towards northwest. The row also abuts the Outer Courtyard and the two curved wings, H\u00f6gvaktsflygeln in the north and the Kommendantsflygeln in the south. On the facade are nine medallions depicting nine Swedish regents and ten caryatids. The central window above the portal is where the King and the Royal Family usually appears on the Kings birthday.\n\n\n==== Sculptures ====\nIn the frontispiece of the western facade between the windows there are ten female characters called caryatids. The caryatids of the palace are Rococo inspired pilasters in the shape of women, made by the French artist Charles Guillaume Cousin of Gotlandic sandstone in 1744. Each figure is approx. 4.5 m (15 ft) high. Some of them have weathering damages and since there is a risk of small pieces falling from them, a net has been placed over the figures.The Kungamedaljongerna (the Royal Medallions) above the windows are made by Cousin. The medallions depict Gustav I, Eric XIV, John III, Sigismund III, Charles IX, Gustavus Adolphus, Queen Christina, Charles X Gustav, Charles XI. The medallions are approximately 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in diameter and were made of lead in 1745.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The northern row ===\nThe northern row, or the north facade, represents \"Power\". This facade is austere and its location and the perspective that it faces north, is meant to mirror and radiate the royal power.\n\n\n==== Sculptures ====\n\nThe artistic adornment on the northern row is very sparse and consists only of a group of figures above the balcony of the Bernadotte Gallery. The group depicts the Swedish coat of arms the Tre Kronor (the Three Crowns) which is supported by two goddesses of rumor. The coat of arms itself and the wings of the goddesses are made by Claude Henrion while the rest of the group is made by Bernard Foucquet the Elder. It was cast in bronze and was not added to the facade until 1814.Outside the northern facade is the Lejonbacken with the two Castle Lions. The models for the lions, inspired by the Medici lions in Villa Medici in Rome, were approved by King Charles XII in 1700, after which the lions were cast in bronze at the Casting House in Normalm in 1702 and 1704. They were then placed at the Lejonbacken as a royal power symbol. The bronze for the lions was from a well, taken as booty from the Kronborg Castle in Helsing\u00f8r, during King Charles X Gustav's campaign in Denmark. The plinths are made from granite and are 1.9-by-2.7-by-1.2-metre (6 ft 3 in by 8 ft 10 in by 3 ft 11 in).\n\n\n=== The southern row ===\nThe southern row, or the southern facade, represents \"The Nation\". The center of the facade is made in the shape of a triumphal arch with a portal (also known as the South Arch) flanked by three columns made in corinthian order on each side.Along the facade there are a number of niches with sculptures depicting notes Swedish men. The whole facade is supposed to reflect the grandeur of Sweden, its society and prominent persons in the country. Inside the portal is the South Arch with stairs leading to the Royal Chapel in the east, and the Hall of State in the west. This symbolizes the gathering of both the worldly and the divine power in one place.At the triumphal arch there is a stone plaque with writing in Latin. The plaque is flanked by two sculptures depicting war trophies. They were created in 1735, by Antoine Bellette and cast by Gerhard Meyer the Younger. The inscription on the plaque honoring King Charles XII says:\n\n\n==== Sculptures ====\n\nThe southern facade is the most ornate, with statues, sculptures, and reliefs. In eight, initially empty, niches are statues of notable Swedish men. These were added in the 1890s through the initiative of King Oscar II. The statues are approximately 2.8 metres (9.2 ft) tall, made of zinc by Johan Axel Wetterlund. The statues are depicting Erik Dahlbergh, Carl Linnaeus, Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and Georg Stiernhielm to the left of the South Arch, and Haquin Spegel, Olof von Dalin, Rutger von Ascheberg and Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz to the right of the South Arch.\n\nEnleveringsgruppen (The Abduction Group), consisting of four sculptures (two to the right and two to the left side of the South Arch), illustrates the abductions of women and are made by Bernard Foucquet the Elder at the beginning of the 18th century, but the sculptures were not installed until 1897. From west to the east the sculptures depict: Paris and Helen, Boreas and Orithyia, Pluto and Proserpina, Romulus and Hersilia. They are made of bronze and are approx. 2.5 m (8.2 ft) high. The group were made at the initiative of King Oscar II to fill the previously empty niches in the triumphal arch. The originals have been restored by Sven Scholander and were cast by Otto Meyer. Bernard Foucquet also made the lions at the Lejonbacken.\n\n\n==== Reliefs ====\nOver the windows of the ground floor are 16 reliefs made in 1699 to 1700, by the French artist Ren\u00e9 Chauveau. They are made of bronze, and were originally to be placed in the palace's stairwells. In the 1890s, the reliefs were mounted on the southern facade, where they replaced a row of windows of the same size. The corresponding windows still exist on the northern facade.\n\nThe reliefs depict motifs from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Among the motifs are: the \"Flood myth with Deucalion\", the \"Pyrrha and Hellen\", the \"Perseus and Medusa\" and the \"Apollo slaying the dragon Python\".\n\n\n=== The eastern row ===\nThe eastern row, or the eastern facade, represents \"The Female Qualities\" and the Queen. Below this facade is the palace park, the Log\u00e5rden. On a balustrade closing of the Log\u00e5rden from the Skeppsbron are four sculptures representing music, religion, poetry, and mercy. These can be seen as old perceptions of female values and interests.When designing the eastern facade facing the Log\u00e5rden, Tessin is believed to have thought of a Roman country villa, with stairs from the palace garden up to the palace gate. The model for the central part, with colossal pilasters between the windows of the two top floor and the rustic ground floor, are presumed to be Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi in Rome.\n\n\n==== Sculptures ====\n\nAntoine Bellette made the dragons in the eastern facade, the winged lions on the Log\u00e5rden facade with windows, the shells on the middle floor and the roses under the roof.On the balustrade between the Log\u00e5rden and the Log\u00e5rdstrappan, are four allegorical sculptures representing \"Music\", \"Religion\", \"Poetry\" and \"Mercy\". They were made in 1903 by Johan Axel Wetterlund and cast by Otto Meyer and are approx. 1.5 by 1 m (4 ft 11 in by 3 ft 3 in).From the eastern facade, two wing projects towards the east. On the short sides of these are two waterfalls and head sculptures of the artists who created the interior of the palace; Pierre Hubert L'Archev\u00eaque and Carl H\u00e5rleman on the north side, Carl Gustaf Tessin and Guillaume Thomas Taraval on the south side. These sculptures were made by Johan Axel Wetterlund in 1902, and are made of bronze. Between the sculptures there are two plaques honoring King Oscar II on the south side and Charles XII on the north side.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Coloration ===\n\nThe coloration of the facade has been altered several times since the completion of the new northern row in 1695. Tessin's first coloration was brick-red plaster with white-painted sandstone details. The brick-red color was called Dutch brunroot (brown-red), and came from brown ochre that was bought for painting the walls of the building. Carl H\u00e5rleman took over as the head of the building site when Tessin died in 1728. During the construction, the plaster was left unpainted, while the stone details were painted in white lead.Before the Royal Family moved in at the palace in 1754, the whole facade, except for the base which was painted in a yellow ochre color to imitate French sandstone. The yellow tone was the foremost color of the Rococo and the height of fashion at that time. The monochrome yellow color without any contrasting white on the stone details was a way to achieve an architectonical effect with mainly relief.During the reign of King Charles XIV John in the 1820s, the coloration was changed again, but not fully. The stone details of the northern and eastern rows were painted in a pink color that was not widely appreciated. When the western and southern rows were to be painted, the stone details were done in a grey color which better contrasted to the still yellow plaster. This coloration lasted until the 1890s, when Tessin's red color was once again used on the plaster at the initiative of King Oscar II. All paint was removed from the sandstone details and sculptures. As of 2014, this coloration remains but the red-brown color has become more brown over the years. The removal of the protective paint has contributed to weathering.\n\n\n=== Lighting ===\n\nThe present lighting of the palace's facade was inaugurated on 29 March 2006 by King Carl XVI Gustaf. The former lighting was from the 1960s, and its wattage had been reduced over the years, making the palace perceived as progressively darker.The new lights were approved after long discussions and tests. They deliver almost twice as much luminous flux as the old ones and use half the energy. The lighting was made by a collaboration between the National Property Board of Sweden, the Office of the Governor of the Royal Palaces, The Royal Architect Johan Celsing and the Municipality of Stockholm Traffic Control. The color is described as neutral warm-white.According to Johan Celsing, the lighting is supposed to enhance the distribution and nuances of the palace and bring out decorative details not previously visible during the evenings. An example of this is the eastern facade where the wings facing the Skeppsbron are now illuminated.\n\n\n=== Renovations ===\n\nRenovation of the 922 windows in the palace started at the beginning of the 1990s. The age of the windows varies from the mid-18th century to the 1970s. The reason for the renovation was that the windows had not been properly maintained for a number of years. The windows on the south side were the most exposed and the sun had burned the surface causing rot. The renovation of the windows was carried out in collaboration with the National Property Board of Sweden, the Office of the Governor of the Royal Palaces, the Swedish National Heritage Board and the Royal Architect at that time, Ove Hidemark. The work was done in a workshop at the Inner Courtyard and took about ten years. Each window was custom made for the opening where it was originally placed, making the size and shape of each window unique.As of 2014, the palace is undergoing a comprehensive renovation. Almost half of the area of the facade is made of sandstone from Gotland, as well as the decorations such as sculptures and ornaments.\nIn 2008, the National Property Board of Sweden, which is responsible for the maintenance of the palace, found that the sandstone had partially disintegrated and the weathering was only getting worse. Among the incidents was a piece of stone weighing 3 kg (6.6 lb) falling from 20 m (66 ft). Most damaged were the sunlit parts, the facades facing south and west. As an interim solution, the Property Board had some parts of the facade covered by a black net to catch any falling rocks.Ever since the palace was built in the 18th century, the weathering of the sandstone has been a problem and this has accelerated since the oil paint was removed from the stone during the renovation in the 1890s. In the spring of 2008, the Property Board started a comprehensive study on order to make a long-term plan for maintenance of the palace during the next 50 years. The study showed that the Gotlandic sandstone was in worse condition than expected. A number of stones were cracked and loose.The biggest facade renovation in the history of the palace started in May 2011. Starting with the east wing of the northern row at Str\u00f6mbron, all the facades will be renovated during the following 22 years, each stage of the work being one year, at a cost of 500 million crowns. To accomplish this, the Swedish National Heritage Board is planning to open up a sandstone quarry on Gotland and start a masonry school.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nAs of 2014, the palace has 1,430 rooms, of which 660 have windows.In addition to the text on the plans below, the northeast wing is in the upper right hand corner and the south curved wing is in the lower left hand corner. The northwest Chancery Wing is in the upper left hand corner on the plans. The yards are (from left to right): the Outer Courtyard (inside the curved wings), the Inner Courtyard (in the middle of the building) and the Shot Yard (between the east wings).\nThe floors (the number of rooms are excluding smaller rooms, closets, stairwells, vaults etc.):\nThe cellar. There are 104 rooms in the cellar, most of which have been used as storage and prisons. The remains of the old Tre Kronor castle are visible there. Some parts of the cellar are divided into two cellar floors due to large differences in head room in the different sections. The royal wine cellar could be found under the western row during the end of the 1800s and the 1900s, and it is most likely still there.\nThe Ground Floor is the largest floor of the palace. The rooms there have mostly been used by the staff of the court, and there are also the four portals (or arches) that make up the entrances to the palace as well as the Hall of State and the Royal Chapel.\nThe Half Floor, or the mezzanine, has 115 rooms. Most of the rooms have retained their size since the construction of the palace, but their use has varied. The name is derived from the fact that the floor is just half as high as the other floors. The rooms have mostly been used by the staff of the court, but some of the princes and princesses apartments have also been there. The mezzanine also houses the Small Guest Apartment, consisting of a couple of rooms in the north part of the western row.\nThe First Floor has 67 rooms. The rooms have mostly retained their size since the construction of the palace, but their use has varied. The Bernadotte Apartments and the Pillar Hall are in the northern row, and the eastern row houses the private quarters. This is where King Carl XVI Gustaf and his family lived until they moved to the Drottningholm Palace in 1981.\nThe Second Floor, has 57 rooms. Most of the rooms have retained their size since the construction of the palace, but their use has varied. The Guest Apartments, the State Apartments with the ball room the Vita Havet (the White Sea), the Cabinet Meeting Room and Prince Bertil's Apartment are on this floor.\nThe Attic, has about 25 rooms, as well as the upper part and the arches forming the ceiling for the Hall of State, the Royal Chapel and the southern stairwell. The attic is mainly used for storage.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Western Row ===\n\n\n==== The Guest Apartments ====\n\nThe Guest Apartments (also known as the Grand Guest Apartments) are on the second floor in the south part of the western row and are used for visiting heads of state at state visits to Sweden. The rooms got their original interior in the 1760s, under the direction of Jean Eric Rehn when they were set in order for the Prince Frederick Adolf, the brother of King Gustaf III. Three of the rooms that are shown to the public are in the mezzanine suite of rooms with windows facing the Inner Courtyard.\n\n\n==== The Apartments of the Orders of Chivalry ====\nThe Apartments of the Orders of Chivalry are in the south part on the first floor of the western row and consists of four halls, one for each order: The Royal Order of the Seraphim, Order of the Sword, Order of the Polar Star and Order of Vasa. In the Apartments of the Orders there are permanent exhibitions about the Royal Orders. Formerly, this is where the Privy Council had their apartments in the mid-1750s. They were succeeded by the Supreme Court of Sweden who used the halls of the Apartments from 1789 to 1949.\n\n\n=== The Eastern Row ===\n\n\n==== Prince Bertil's Apartment ====\n\nThe rooms on the second floor of the eastern row is called the Prins Bertil's Apartment after its latest noted tenant. King Adolf Frederick used the rooms as his own apartment. During the reign of King Gustav III, it was Duke Charles' apartment and later when King Charles XIV ruled, it was used for some time by Crown Prince Oscar (I). Oscar had one of the rooms decorated in a neo-gothic style in 1828. The room became known as the G\u00f6tiska (the Geatish Room). King Charles XV also used the apartment as his quarters and during the reign of King Oscar II it was used by the Crown Prince Gustaf (V). Later it was Prince Bertil's apartment until he died in 1997. After the prince's demise it has been used for visiting heads of state, interviews and seminars.\n\n\n==== Princess Sibylla's Apartment ====\nThe Princess Sibylla's Apartment, named after the Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, is on the first floor in the south part of the eastern row and is used as the everyday reception rooms for the King and Queen, and is not open to the public. During the history of the palace, the apartment have always been a part of the palace where the king or one of his close relatives has lived. The apartment is known for the Blue Drawing room where the engagements of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Silvia Sommerlath in 1976, as well as Crown Princess Victoria and Daniel Westling in 2009, were declared. The Princess Sibylla's Inner Drawing room, formerly known as Crown Prince Gustaf's audience chamber, still have some interior designed by Carl H\u00e5rleman, such as pilasters and ornamentations over the lintels of the doors.\n\n\n==== Livrustkammaren ====\n\nThe main area of the Livrustkammaren museum are in the cellars under the eastern row and is accessed from the Slottsbacken. It is the oldest museum in Sweden, founded by King Gustavus Adolphus in 1628, and contains objects associated with Swedish royalty from the time of the Swedish Empire and onwards.\n\n\n=== The Northern Row ===\n\n\n==== The State Apartments ====\n\nThe State Apartments, also known as the Apartment for Festivities, are on the second floor of the northern row and are used for the Royal Couple's receptions and representation. Official dinners are held in the Charles XI's Gallery on such occasions as state visits, after elections to the Riksdag and for the Nobel laureates. Since 1950, it is used as the main banqueting room of the palace and can accommodate about 200 seated guests. Five to ten official dinners are held in the gallery each year. A couple of times each year a Cabinet Meeting is held with the Swedish government in the Cabinet Meeting Room. The apartment was originally designed as the Royal Couple's apartment, but when King Adolf Frederick and Queen Lovisa Ulrika moved into the palace in 1754, they chose to stay in the part now known as the Bernatotte Apartments. Later, the Crown Prince Gustav (III) and Sophia Magdalena would use the apartments after their wedding in 1766. The apartments have not been use as living quarters since the time of Oscar I.In the northeast corner of the State Apartments is the ball room the Vita Havet (the White Sea) which used to be two rooms: the queen's dining hall and the hall for the trabants. The dining hall was called the White Sea, a name that was inherited for the resulting hall after the wall had been removed. In connection to dinners in the Charles XI's Gallery, the White Sea is furnished as a salon with sofas, chairs and coffee tables. On those occasions, the room is used as a drawing rooms after the dinners.\n\n\n==== The Bernadotte Apartments ====\nThe Bernadotte Apartments are on the first floor of the northern row and are named after Sweden's current royal house, Bernadotte. The name of the suite is derived from a collection of portraits in the Bernadotte Gallery, the largest room in the apartments, depicting members of the Bernadotte House. Most of the rooms are in the northern row and are used for audiences, awarding medals and for meetings with the Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs. The rooms are also open to the public. The apartment was originally decorated in the 1730s and 1740s by Carl H\u00e5rleman. When King Adolf Frederick and Queen Lovisa Ulrica moved in there in 1754, the rooms were furnished with pieces of furniture made by the best craftsmen in Stockholm at that time. The last Royal Couple to use the apartment as living quarters were King Oscar II and Queen Sophia. Since then, some rooms have been restored to their original 18th-century appearance, while others are maintained as they were at the time of King Oscar II, such as his writing room.\n\n\n==== The Exhibitions Apartments ====\nOn the ground floor of the northern row are the Exhibition Apartments which are used for special exhibitions and public lectures.\n\n\n==== The Tre Kronor Museum ====\nIn the cellars, accessed from street level under Lejonbacken, of the northern and western row is the Tre Kronor Museum. The museum is in the rooms that used to be kitchens in the Tre Kronor Castle and are thus the oldest rooms in the Palace, but the museum itself is the newest of the museums in the palace. It was inaugurated in 1999, and houses an exhibition about the old castle Tre Kronor which was destroyed during a fire in 1697.\n\n\n=== The Southern Row ===\n\n\n==== The Royal Chapel ====\n\nThe Royal Chapel was built during the 18th century and it is the parish church for the members of the Royal Parish. The church is situated in the east half of the southern row of the palace. It is as wide as the building and two and a half stories high. The entrance of the church is in the South Portal (or Arch) at the address Slottsbacken 1. Service is held every Sunday and holy day, and the Royal Family use the church for ceremonies. Before the old Tre Kronor castle burned down, the Royal Chapel was in the northern row, some benches and silver decorations from the old church are still preserved in the chapel. After fire in 1697, when Tessin planned the new palace, the Royal Chapel and the Hall of State were placed in the southern row and these, including the grand stairs, occupies the first and second floor. The chapel represented the divine power and the hall the worldly, or the king's, power. After Tessin's death, his work was completed by Carl H\u00e5rleman. The church was inaugurated at the same time as the rest of the palace in 1754.\n\n\n==== The Hall of State ====\n\nThe Hall of State is in the west half of the southern row of the palace and is two stories high (first and second floor). It was introduced for the Riksdag of 1755. The hall was designed by H\u00e5rleman who modified Tessin's plans. The Silver Throne of Queen Christina is placed in the Hall. The main entrance of the Hall is in the South Portal (or Arch).\n\n\n==== The Treasury ====\nIn the cellar of the southern row is the Treasury, where the Regalia of Sweden are displayed. The museum was inaugurated in 1970.\n\n\n=== The Northwest (Chancery) Wing ===\nThe Chancery Wing is another name for the northwest wing of the palace. It was planned for the central parts of the government administration, the Royal chancery. The wing was finished by architect Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, and was originally used as the royal gardhouse, offices for domestic, foreign and war departments as well as the National Archives of Sweden. As the government administration grew, it moved from the palace and formed new independent departments, and around 1780, the Chancery Wing was transformed into an apartment for the three-year-old Crown Prince Gustav (IV) Adolf and later for his mother the Queen Dowager Sophia Magdalena. The Chancery Wing was once again the home of a prince in 1905, when it became the Crown Prince and later King Gustaf VI Adolf, who used it as his private lodgings until his death in 1973. A part of the mezzanine floor above his apartment was converted into his private library in the 1930s. The Spegelsalongen (the Mirror Hall), updated in 1866 by Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander, is in the wing as well as a Green and a Blue Drawing room. The Slottsarkivet, a part of the present National Archives of Sweden, is still in the cellars of the wing.\n\n\n=== The Northeast Wing ===\n\n\n==== Gustav III's Museum of Antiquities ====\nThe second oldest museum in Sweden is Gustav III's Museum of Antiquities in the cellars of the northeast wing, which open up for the public in 1794. The museum shows over 200 of the antique sculptures that King Gustav III bought during his journey to Italy in 1783 to 1784.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe palace is a place of work for about 200 full-time employees, more than half of whom are female. The palace also hires more personnel for dinners, during the summer and as guides.\n\n\n=== The Royal Court of Sweden ===\n\nThe palace houses facilities for the offices that are part of the Royal Court of Sweden; the organization affiliated to the Swedish Head of State and the Royal House, and are also responsible for preserving and showing the cultural heritage of the Swedish monarchy. The Royal Court is led by the Marshal of the Realm and had 216 full-time employees in 2009.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe museums housed in the palace are: Livrustkammaren, Gustav III's Museum of Antiquities, The Treasury and The Tre Kronor Museum.\n\n\n=== Archive and library ===\n\nIn the Chancery Wing at the palace is the Slottsarkivet. The archive was started in 1893, and since 1964, it is a depot sorting under the administration of the National Archives of Sweden. The archive also contains records from the Royal Court and the Crown palaces in Sweden. In the northeast wing of the palace is the Bernadottebiblioteket (the Bernadotte library, a research library).\n\n\n=== The Royal Guards ===\n\nThe Royal Guards is a guard detail that is part guard of honour for the king and part guards for the castle. The guard is also a section of the military emergency management in Stockholm. The Royal Guards are present at state ceremonies, visits by foreign heads of state or fleets. The guards were established by King Gustav I in 1523, to keep the order in the entire city, the part that is now Gamla Stan. The changing of the guards is a ceremony and tourist attraction held at the Outer Courtyard of the palace, seen by approximately 800,000 people each year.\n\n\n=== The Royal Gift Shop ===\nThe Royal Gift Shop is the gift and souvenir shop for the palace with products connected to the objects in the royal collections. A large part of the items are books about the royal cultural heritage on subjects such as history, architecture, biographies and research. The shop is in the southwestern curved wing and is accessed from the Outer Courtyard.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Palace ghosts ==\n\nThere are many tales of ghosts at the palace. One of them is the Gr\u00e5 Gubben (the Old Grey Man) who according to tradition lives in the cellar ruins of the old Tre Kronor Castle. He is considered to be a kind of guarding spirit for the palace and he is able to predict the future. According to other legends it is no other than Birger Jarl standing guard. He is supposed to have appeared for Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, to tell him that he would not live to see the palace completed.The most noted of the palace's ghosts is the Vita frun (the White lady). A White Lady, White woman, Wei\u00dfe Frau or Dame Blanche is said to exist in many European castles and likewise in Stockholm. According to legend, the White Lady is a messenger of death for someone in the Royal Family. She showed up when someone was about to die. She is supposedly tall and wears a white silk dress, only the rustle of the silk is heard as she approaches. There are several theories as to who she might be and where she comes from. According to one theory she is the Duchess Agnes of Mer\u00e1n, a German noble lady from the House of Hohenzollern who lived in the 1200s. She was married to Count Otto of Orlam\u00fcnde until he died in 1293. She murdered both her children by him to be able to marry Albrect, a Count from Nurnberg also known as The Fair, but he abandoned her. She died in prison and is since then showing herself as a white lady in the Hohenzollern castles in connection to important family events.Other sources claim that the White Lady is Perchta von Rosenberg, daughter of Ulrich II von Rosenberg, a German noble woman from the 15th century, who unhappily married against her will to Jan of Liechtenstein. According to tradition she appears in the \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov Castle in southern Czech Republic. The portrait of her is said to be much like the descriptions of the White Lady at the palace.Deaths of members of the royal family have occurred in connection to the appearance of the White Lady in the palace. In March 1871, Princess Eugenie saw the ghost and three days later Queen Louise died. The White Lady appeared again in 1907, and shortly after that, King Oscar II died. The last time she was seen was in 1920, when Princess Margaret lay dying. Suddenly the flag at the palace was lowered to half mast and a guard is said to have seen the White Lady on the roof. Two hours after this the princess died.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Stockholm\nList of Baroque residences\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nAbrahamsson, \u00c5ke (2004).

          "The Palace itself was interesting and certainly worth a visit, although the layout can get a bit confusing with multiple rooms and entry points. We timed our visit to see the Changing of the Guards but were disappointed with the organisation and the experience. Despite",
          "Didn\u2019t walk the interior but enjoyed walking around the exterior and through courtyards. Architecture was standard.",
          "I rate it average because we did not go in and just hung around the vicinity. By looking at its size, its interior should have a lot to offer. We walked from Stortorget, so we only saw the western fa\u00e7ade which is also the site where the changing of the guard takes place. We were",
          "The changing of the guard takes place end of April to end of August at 12 15 and 13 15 on Sundays. It lasts about 40mins. If you go out of season as we did the schedule changes and doesn't take place everyday so best to check in advance.",
          "Central location so when you are visiting Stockholm, you\u2019re bound to notice the Palace at some point. The same admission ticket allows you entry to the royal apartments, the royal chapel, the armoury, the treasury, and two little museums that center around history of the palace",
          "This palace is really nice both inside and outside but with the great sunny day we decided to enjoy it better outside. Also they have a changing guards ritual that is impressive. We recommend arriving early because there was a huge crowd waiting... The access to the palace is",
          "We only had time to do two things, so we chose this and the Vasa Museum. It was well worth it. My aunt used to be a diplomat in Sweden, and those two attractions plus Galma Stan were the only things she recommended! Obviously, I wish we had more time here because our tickets",
          "As castles go it's OK and if you're a true Swedish history buff then of course go, their free \"listening tour\" is very well designed. But if you're a tourist with only so many days in the area, take the boat to Skolkloster, it's far more interesting in my humble opinion,",

          "My husband and I were in Stockholm waiting for our friends to arrive from the airport so we had some time to kill. We decided to walk across the street from our hotel to see the palace. Best decision ever as it happened to be during the changing of the guard. If you are there be",
          "We took a walking tour of the Palace and the guide was outstanding in terms of his knowledge and his humour. He brought the Palace to life with his stories. We also went to the Treasury and Armoury, both of which were outstanding.",
          "I really enjoyed the architecture and incredible decor full of art and gold throughout this active Palace in the middle of Stockholm. It made is extra special knowing that the current King still conducts official business and dinners here!",
          "The facade isn't as pretty as some of the other Royal palaces in the region, but it is still worth a visit. The interiors are as exquisite as expected and it is an interesting way to get to know of the royal family if you are a tourist. Recommend doing all 3 areas as they are",
          "The massive royal palace is located in the old town of Stockholm (Gamla Stan) and is a very visitable place. You can still see the Royal Guards outside at all times. Visit the museum inside to know the history of the Royal family of Sweden.",
          "You can spend hours visiting this palace, there are tons of stuff to appreciate, and each and every one of those are worthy to be seen. Be ready for spending several hours and no food or drinks are sold inside, but still there are some areas that is not forbidden to have your",
          "The palace in and of itself is worth seeing if you're in the Galma Stan, but there's not much to engage with when you're there. However, if you see the changing of the guard, you get a glimpse of Swedish historical culture. Similar in show to the British and slightly reminiscent",
          "The Royal Palace of Stockholm is open year round, with three parts: the Treasury, the Apartments and the Tre Kronor. Tickets usually include entry to all, and the palace is a must see for anyone visiting Stockholm. The staff is helpful, the gift shops reasonably priced. It was",
          "Must confess upfront we chose not to pay to visit inside. However walking around the outside and the surrounding area. We walked up from the river and enjoyed the palace precinct. Changing of the guard was worth watching. Very popular tourist spot.",
          "The Royal Palace is well preserved as Stockholm hasn't seen any raiders or shelling for a very, very long time. Rooms are dusty as there are only windows and small standing fans. Curtains are closed to keep fabrics from fading. There are audio guides that work very well. Some",
          "We came to see the changing of guards. It was good as they showcase as well how the Swedish army got their wake up call, and so on. However, the duration is about 45mins. Since you have to be there early, then you might be standing for more than 50mins. So be prepared!",
          "My wife and I stopped in here about 90 minutes before closing and felt we had plenty of time to see what we wanted to see, the residence and treasury. The treasury consists of crowns dating back to the 1600s along with swords and other regalia. The crowns feature much gold but",
          "This place is awesome. I went a few times considering its location was in the middle of several places I wanted to visit. Highly recommend it.",
          "If you\u2019re thinking of visiting the palace where the King and his family actually live in, this is not the right palace. This is only where the royal family actually have their official offices and ceremonies. Make sure to have the guided tour, available in Swedish and English.",
          "We made a last minute decision to visit the Palace after we failed to book a New Year\u2019s Eve boat trip as they were all full ! The Palace was fascinating and interesting to look around . The treasury part which was part of the old palace was really interesting. Worth a visit.",
          "This place was a great escape from the cold! Children under 7 are admitted free. Inside you can see the Palace apartments and various other memorabilia. To keep kids interested they can search for a silver gnome! The changing of the guards is good to watch and this is free of",
          "I love a good palace and what I love most about the Scandinavian Palaces is the ability to go at your own pace and walk freely around. It is beautiful and well worth the visit - steeped in history with magnificent ceilings and artworks! Contrary to what I had previously read you",
          "Well worth a visit to this amazing palace and it's history, the story of it's fire destroying it almost completely. All the rooms, treasury and the changing of the guards made this attraction a must see!",
          "The palace inside wasn't anything wildly out of the ordinary (for a palace!) - very beautiful though and there was lots of information to read and learn about. The staff were very helpful and friendly.",
          "After thinking the palace was just going to be a tick in the box, a quick 30 min peek, we ended up spending nearly 3 hours there. Exploring the royal apartments was a sight to behold. Absolutely gorgeous finishing and with one floor offering a free audio guide on the history of",
          "I've visited palaces in different areas of Europe (and the world) and really liked this one. The entrance ticket provides you with entry to the royal appartments, crown jewels and Tre Kronor museum, which is kind of nice. After having been to London, I was expecting to see a",
          "nice to see if you are nearby. there are other places i stockholm which is more interesting! not worth spending money only for this.",
          "Excellent place to spend a rainy day. Interesting exhibits - the Treasury was particularly good. There was also a temporary exhibition of rugs when we visited. Well laid out and plenty of English information. Changing of the guard is good to see if you time your visit well.",
          "If you are in Stockholm over a weekend this is one of the must-visit places for sure. Brilliant history of Swedish royalty and the well-decorated palace will definitely satisfy most history buffs.",
          "The Royal Palace, with over 600 rooms, is the official residence of His Majesty the King of Sweden. The Palace is open to the public and offers five museums. The entrance fee is 160 SEK including the museums. The Palace was built during the eighteenth century in the Italian",
          "We had a tour by a lovely young man, his name was very long, but what a gentleman. English speaking. He listened and he explained in immense detail. The palaces history follows Swedens legacy in splendid detail. A beautiful palace and a place where you can see a lot of rooms",
          "I admit we debated paying to go in to the palace, but it was worth the reasonable admission price. The rooms open to the public are ornate and full of art and historic objects, and there is a fair amount of explanatory information in both Swedish and English. We were glad we",
          "Treasury hall, apartment hall, dinner tble, basement fort and everything was so good. Has a lovely time",
          "Very useful to learn something about the Swedish Royal Family and history, and really nice to visit.",
          "A massive & imposing palace (just a bit larger than Buckingham Palace), I've admired it from the outside on every visit I make to Stockholm. It never seems to be in the cards for me to be able to enter it. This latest trip was thwarted by the president of South Korea: he was",
          "Good value for 3 museums including the treasury and palace apartments. Changing of the guard outside was weird by having a commentary explaining what was about to happen followed by a sales pitch for tourists. An area is cordoned off for tourists to watch the guard change but",
          "Huge place but thought the accessible areas a little small. Granted I don\u2019t stop and read every detail etc so if you do, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d love it. For me, it passed an hour",
          "The standard ticket includes the state apartments, the treasury and the tre kronor museum. They are all well worth the visit. The state rooms showed old and new and it was really interesting to see what is still being used. The chandeliers are particularly spectacular.",
          "Not A Nice looking castle as usual when you see Royal places Not near our Danish We Saw the guard shift Always great to see the disciplin",
          "Not a bad place to visit when in the area. Shame about the construction happening in and around the palace, it takes away the beautiful of the place.",
          "It rained all day on the Saturday we chose to visit the palace. Entry prices were fair (keep your ticket as they mark off each major area you visit all on one ticket). Be prepared for a decent amount of walking. There's so much to see! You could probably spend all day here and",

This castle replaces the old \u201c Three Towers\u201d consumed totally in dramatic fire. Vast collections, and still a daily office",
          "This is an excellent activity while visiting Stockholm. The Palace is quite impressive and the historic information is presented impeccably well. Anyone visiting Stockholm should add the tour of the Royal Palace to their list of things to do and see!",
          "We explore the treasury, apartments and the museum of the Palace. Some parts of the palace were closed already, it was open until October only. But it was still worth it to see inside especially the apartments.",
          "A great place to walk round and enjoy, the changing of the guard and matching band around 12 is a spectacle to see.",
          "If you are in the area of Old Town, you should make a stop by the Royal Palace. Inside you can view the crown jewels and other artifacts of the royal family. Outside there is a changing of the guards ceremony daily.",
          "The Royal Palace is well worth a visit. As you would expect lots of big ornate rooms decorated with nice furniture and the walls hung with oil paintings. Make sure you pick up the free audio guide. It helps to make sense of what you are looking. Overall very interesting for",

I\u2019m told this is where all the work takes place - this being \u201cthe office\u201d. Lots to see inside the palace over a number of floors. Lots of explanation about the various",
          "We were not realy into it - probably because all european royal palaces look the same at the end: a lot of gold, a sense of wealth, but a lack of content. The kids liked the \"treasure hunt\" in the Tre Kronor museum.",
          "It opened at 10 but before it opened the soldiers had the changing of the guard in the court yard area, which was cool but the one in Copenhagen was better. To the museum, for the one price you get to see the palace, under the palace ( I forgot the name), the treasury.The palace",
          "Visiting the Royal Palace, the admission includes in Stockholm pass; otherwise, it is 160 Sek entree fee and additional cost if you want to see the rest of it. It is quite big where you spent longer inside if you were interested in history. We visited the palace on a Sunday; it",
          "The rooms are period correct with the furniture and dress. Be sure to go downstairs to view the crown jewels and the gold artifacts.",
          "We had just an hour to see the palace after taking the little ferry from Djurgarden. We had to rush through the 2 stories of beautiful state rooms with no guide and since we have been to many palaces could guess what each room was used for since we didn\u2019t have time to read the",
          "The building is very beautiful, a pity that they could not keep the previous castle (if you want to know what happened with the castle, you need to visit the palace, no spoilers). Anyway, the actual building is very beautiful. We saw the change of guard and it was interesting.",
          "The palace had no gardens and was indistinguishable from other buildings, except for the guards and signs. It was boring to visit and not worth a visit.",
          "Only 1/4 of the palace available for visit are equipped with audio guide, however, audio guide is free. Only 2 floors, partially, of course are available for visitors to see. There are also 3 museums included as part of your tour. The Treasury is just two rooms that has about",
          "The pomp and circumstance of the Palace is made even more interesting in that it is a residence still active and in use today. Nice also is that the public is allowed into the very same rooms used for functions and for visiting dignitaries.... The King wants it to be so, in",
          "The exterior is quite dull and there\u2019s no \u2018real gardens\u2019 compared to most other Palaces I have visited. The interior is an improvement. Many of the rooms are well furnished. There\u2019s the Kroner museum which is quite dullish whilst the Royal Chapel is well decorated. All there\u2019s",
          "Tour worth taking of full palace to understand Swedish history. But the chapel was amazing and if you can go when there is music it will be unforgettable",
          "We visited the palace, paid our entrance fee, walked through the first rooms, and then discovered that a whole wing was closed. We went on and were subseqiently informed that due to special exhibition some other rooms were not open for visitors. Why do they make us pay the whole",
          "This is the biggest Palace which I ever seen but not the most interesting. Long corridors and countless rooms. For me the most interesting was royal treasury and awards hall. And of course the most impressive is the change of honor guard that takes place every day at noon.",
          "We were able to visit one room in the Royal Palace. Otherwise the changing of the guards was wonderful to observe as they marched toward the palace and came around the backside of the building. Sweden can be proud. Good shoes essential because of the cobblestones and brick",
          "The free portions were the most interesting. We spent a lot of time in the armory, which provided great information on the royalty and history of the country, and briefly visited the chapel. We bought a ticket for the palace but we're not impressed.",
          "This was amazing. I highly recommend that you purchase a tour so you can get a little history on the castle and the people who lived there. The painted murals on the ceilings, gilt everywhere you look, the carving on furniture, and the paintings are amazing. You could spend days",
          "A combination ticket will give you access to the Treasury (Crown Jewels) and the Three Crowns Museum (dark basement with little to recommend it) as well as the Royal apartments. The latter is interesting, with dozens of beautifully furnished and decorated rooms. Though you do",
          "The castle is quite plain on the outside but the inside is beautiful. Be sore to look up at the art work on the ceiling. Also they let you see the crowns. The only disappointing part is the changing of the guard kind of pales in comparison of or h at palaces",
          "I have seen royal palaces in several countries, but I think this is probably the best. Very very impressive. And huge. Excellent guided tours in English available (you will need to book, at the booking counter near the entrance). The guides give you a brief run-down on the",
          "I bought my ticket in advance but there was really no queue at all upon arrival. This is a beautiful palace! Be prepared to take a lot of pictures. The rooms are well preserved and simply beautiful. The ticket I purchased covered 4 sections. The palace, guest quarters which",
          "First visited the Royal Apartments. Managed to watch the changing of the guard. The Tre Kronor museum was excellent, the antiquities were good. The crown jewels were amazing considering how old some of them were.",
          "Our ticket let us see a few different attractions. I would say it's a top 5 destination while in Stockholm - you get a lot of history when visiting. I love walking along and seeing the different rooms and reception halls and learning about who lived there.",
          "Our cruise ship was berthed in the Stockholm\u2019s port for the day and we were touring the city using hop on, hop off buses. By chance we were in Stockholm on Sweden\u2019s national day public holiday. Consequently, the city was full of Swedes out enjoying their nation\u2019s national day.",
          "This is a main stop when you\u2019re in the city, right beside the Gamla Stan, it\u2019s nice to explore the royal ambience. They are offices actually, the queen doesn\u2019t live here. The decoration inside was really royal, a look at the Scandinavian style.",
          "The Royal Family of Sweden reflects the egalitarian values of Swedish society to a greater extent than other European countries\u2019 royals. The laws were changed to allow an eldest daughter to inherit the throne even if she has a younger brother, long before the UK did the same.",
          "Although it is called the Royal Palace, the Royal family don't live here, they only have work offices in the building. The Royal family lives in another residence about an hour outside the city. The Royal Palace is a main stop on the Sightseeing hop on hop off tour between",
          "It was built in late 16th century at Stockholm Old Town which had been constructed in13th century. There are about 600 rooms and many museums in it. The changing of the gurd is an interesting ceremony.",
          "It's historical place. I have visited solo. You could buy the ticked online or at the ticked office.",
          "It's a palace. Very awesome decoration and huge rooms. It was interesting to see where the royalty used to live and still work. For me the city has more exciting sights and I went there because it was included in the Stockholm Pass so I didn't have to pay.",
          "First i didn\u00b4t want to go here, but then it was actually pretty awesome place. It wasn\u00b4t too big and our family had a lot of fun there. Remember to buy some royal candies!",
          "The Royal Palace is the official residence and major royal palace of the Swedish Monach. The King uses this palace for representative purposed for perfirmung his futies as the Head of State. Its a huge and majestic building. Full of tourists visiting this spot.",
          "It was nice, but for 15-20 minutes, no more. The place is crowded, so it is worth to arrive early and be patient.. Do not plan for more than 20 minutes, as it is enough and head on the Old city streets for an ice cream or a cinnamon bun :)",
          "I visit the Royal Palace and i liked it, from outsideit looks like a little bit boring inside it is very nice, go there and buy a ticket for a guided tour it is worth it. And you can also look at military guard and IF you are lucky you se the Royal Guard the are very good. And",
          "The royal palace is just an amazing piece of art! If you don\u2019t dig all the crowds of UK royal places you should definitely visit Swedish royal palace. If you are lucky you can meet them i one of the halls ;).",
          "Be prepared for a big day. One entry ticket enables you to enter 4 different areas of the palace. Definitely recommend comfortable shoes. There is so much to see with varying themes. If you\u2019ve never been to a European palace before be prepared to take your time however it is a",
          "You may be tempted to pass this by, but do not. We only had time to explore the outer courtyards and the armory, but we can say without hesitation that we would have liked more time. The armory has a spec display of weapons, clothing, horses, etc. beautiful items!",
          "Spent the morning here before boarding our cruise ship--it was just the right amount of time to see the best sites and see/listen to the changing of the guard at noon Summer crowds build by 11:30, so get to the parade ground early if you want to stand in the front. No seating",
          "This is one of the highlights if you are visiting the old town, or Gamla Stan as it is know. The flag was flying which told me that the Royal family were inside and I could have bumped into them at any time. This palace is only from the 1700s so I decided that I would probably",
          "You get to go through some of the private apartments and visit several other areas of the palace for more exhibits. The chapel is free. Will take up to half a day and worth the time. Lots of stairs to climb so I doubt those that are wheelchair bound (or with strollers) will have",
          "Highlights in order were; tour guide, audio tour and antiquities museum. The treasury was only ok so if you have limited time you should pass that up.",
          "Well presented, plenty to see and good value for the entrance fee. 4 distinct areas, all interesting in their own way.",
          "Very interesting place. Numerous treasures and historical artefacts owned by Swedish Kingdom and Kings from differrent epochs",
          "Very pretty castle with lots to see. Lots of picture opportunities. A must for a history buff. The kids enjoyed most of it. A little long for young kids",
          "There are fine things to gaggle over in every direction. It seems that every craftsman with exemplary skills wanted to make something for the king. To me it is a fine example of how monarchies maintain power over their subjects: impress the bee jeezus out of them so they stand",
          "It was very easy to get to and to get in. It's not as lavish as southern European palaces but it was very interesting to walk around. We enjoyed ourselves and were happy we went in.",
          "This was our first visit and it is an extensive tour with many rooms to be seen and while the lighting does not help enjoy the experience it sheds a very interesting insight into royal life in the past as well as the current use of the Royal Palace. Good",
          "Touring the palace is an absolute must! So much to see - plan a good amount of time! So much history, art & architecture. The palace history was so interesting. One really funny thing- the Exhibition displaying the Crown Jewels was ridiculous! The numbering & lettering marking",
          "My wife and I recently visited the Royal Palace in Stockholm and enjoyed our visit. You need to purchase tickets to get in and they come with an audio guide. We toured the building on our own and enjoyed viewing the collection of realia contained in the various rooms. We also",

          "The trouble with Europe is that there are just too many palaces. If you've seen a few this may underwhelm, particularly measured against those of France, Great Britain or St. Petersburg, say. But it's still very good, IF you keep to the best bits. (The trouble is that the",

          "If you want to visit all the places on the ticket, set aside a good 3-4 hours to do so. This was our rainy day activity. The Tre Kronor Museum was ok, the royal apartments were impressive. It is also worth seeing the changing of the guards, it is quite a spectacle.",
          "If you like the old authentic stories then this is your place! The nice thing that I went there and they had a government meeting ,yet the palace was open for public however some rooms were closed! You will see the details of great architecture similar to the Victorian style",
          "A large palace with beautiful location in the center of Stockholm, cooperative staff, many rooms are open for visitors, amazing furniture, attend the gaurd changing ceremony if you can.",
          "Even after visiting St. Petersburg's Catherine Palace and the Hermitage, I was able to enjoy Stockholm's Royal Palace. It was different, less crowded and easier to visit. Be ready to spend more than a couple of hours if you want to visit all four areas of the palace that you are",
          "The ticket allows you to visit the Royal Chapel, The treasury, the Tre Kronor Museum, the museum of Antiques and the Royal apartments. They\u2019re i all interesting to see but our best decision was to take the guided tour for the Royal Apartments. The guid was amazing and made the",
          "It is a nice setting - fun to walk around. One day saw a band on horseback. Nothing remarkable. Saw a guard check his cell phone - the guards are not as stoic or focused as they are at Buckingham",
          "We didn\u2019t book a tour, but just wandered around the palace. All the signs are in English so you can get a good idea of the palace history and that of the royal family. Well worth a visit.",
          "Visiting the Royal Palace is a good thing to do, and there are plenty of options from viewing the building or the changing of the guard to taking a tour of the palace. The Royal Palace is an imposing building in central Stockholm and comprises over 600 rooms. The building is",
          "When in Stockholm, one can include the Royal Palace in their itinerary. Don't compare it with the grandeur of French or Austrian or Italian Palaces/Castles or architecture and you can enjoy your visit here. We also booked the tickets for the guided tour of the Royal Apartments",
          "This is bang in the middle of the city and you cannot miss it, whilst it is big I do not think it is one of the most attractive palaces I\u2019ve been to. Worth a visit though.",
          "We enjoyed viewing the palace and watching the guards outside. The view from the palace is also good. Of course, it's also a great photo location.",
          "We were grateful to the staff for surely telling us the four places to see in the Royal Palace. It was a hot day, but the inside of The Royal Palace was very comfortable.",
          "Was On our last day in Stockholm that we decided to go and have a walk around the Palace. A very beautiful Palace with lots to see and read about. The staff that work there are very informative also. It\u2019s well laid out so you don\u2019t miss anything. The treasury was my favourite",
          "It is a interesting tour around the different palaces, but do bare on mind that this is not even close to the luxury, decadence, style or richness like the French or Spanish, or even Austrian royal castles. It is simple and sophisticated, full of history but completely",
          "While we were in Stockholm we decided to see the changing of the Guards at the Royal Palace. Unfortunately is was soo busy that we could not see anything",
          "Great to have such open access to a royal palace. The state rooms were very interesting to see with good accompanying descriptions in each room gave you a real insight into the life of the Swedish Royal Family over the years. The Royal carriages, chapel and armoury were also",
          "Frankly speaking, we didn't see many differences among this palace and other European ones. Same structure, same type of rooms, same opulence, same all.... It's not a must.",
          "Unlike some royal palaces we have toured that are still active, we were surprised at the number of rooms you get to see. It is definitely worth touring, and if you luck out during the changing of the guard that is a fun thing as well with marching bands etc...",
          "Went there as part of a day in old town. It was fine. The surrounding area is more interesting. Fun to watch the changing of the guard.",
          "Takes about 30 minutes but get there at least a hour early to get a good viewing spot. The changing of the Guard is very interesting and entertaining.",
          "It wasn't that warm at the time (15-20 deg C?) but the apartment tour was hot and stuffy. There was the odd AC floor unit but they should put some larger fans as well to keep the air moving. The apartment tour was very good, reminded me very much of Versailles, the tour of the",
          "The issue with writing a review of a collection of exhibits is that they are really uneven, so this is a review of the sum of the parts (all 5 museums). Because they only sell tickets as a package we saw all of the exhibits and honestly 2 or 3 are not really all that good (or",
          "This is a fascinating tour and definitely worth a visit. The audio tour is very helpful going around to detail each room and saves you having to stand in front of boards reading line upon line in front of other people trying to view it also. Amazingly much of the original",
          "A royal palace once used by the royalties in the city centre. Go for it if you love palaces , history and if you have a few hours to spare. Recommended to go for the guided tour as some hidden details will be revealed to by the tour guide, much more informative than just",
          "The Royal Palace in Stockholm tour provides a glimpse into the everyday lives of Swedish royalty - past and present. Many staircases and countless steps can take you through hundreds of rooms, all ornately decorated with wall and floor coverings, paintings, sculptures, and",
          "This is doubtlessly the main attraction included in the Royal Palace and Museums tickets (with admission to four different museums). Many lavishly decorated rooms, some with special exhibitions (such as Swedish medals). Nice but very crowded the day we went, with endless tour",
          "The Palace is magnificent and can be seen in a few hours. Many extravagant rooms. The guided tour of the apartments was great, a lot of history that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be revealed. AVOID the guided tour of the regalia. That was NOT worth the time or money. It was cool to see the",
          "Did you know hen the flag is on the top the king or/ and the queen are present and working! The rooms at display have a multitude of items: paintings, sculptures, gifts from statemen near and far. Carpets, furniture, rooms in various states and styles. Inspiring, cosy.",
          "Good day out, can take a long time to get around it all, you can do as much or as little as you like! Very interesting displays, lots of different areas to see, state rooms, all info is in English too. The Chapel within the building is another good visit.. The crown jewels are",
          "Royal palace in Stockholm just does not look royal. It is a nice place, but, compared to other Royal residencies in Europe, it looks \"casual\". The most attractive thing to see there, IMHO, is the guard change, which is really cool. Other than that it is just another large",
          "Get there early there's a lot see and experience. Price of tickets are extremely reasonable. Changing of he guard was a highlight to witness.",
          "In summer around noon they change the guards with a marching band and this is quite spectacular. Be sure to get there early and try to catch a place adjacent to the cannons.",
          "If you are in a country ruled by royal family, visiting their palace is a must. My tour guide was knowledgeable and funny. The whole group seemed to enjoyed it as well. After the tour I went to see the guards change and it was awesome. The orchestra gave really good show. It was",
          "I may be in the minority here, I didn't love this Palace. I found it cold, unorganized and much less appealing to any number of the other similar palaces I have seen around the world. I found it more touristy too than most. The Palace is two blocks or so from the Nobel square",
          "Did not go inside the palace itself, however was privy to seeing the mid-day changing of the guard. Try to arrive 15-20 minutes prior to get a prime vantage point if you plan to take pictures (be by the statue facing the palace entrance).",
          "A place worth visiting if you are in Stockholm Water and green grounds surrounding the Royal palace Cafes available Toilts free and clean Public transportation cheap Musuem inside the palace",
          "The palace is highly decorative and can be referred to the French style. The ticket to the palace includes 4 different locations: the Palace, the Treasury, collections of Gustav III and the Tre Kronor. We didn't go to the Tre Kronor but paid additional 20kr for the Riddarholm",
          "We went to the Royal Palace on a Sunday, early enough to be assured a front view of the 1:15pm Changing of the Guards, a must-- see. Be there at 12:45pm at the latest. Quite elaborate. We were treated to a half hour of very good band music. Then, we toured the Palace rooms and",
          "The Royal Palace is located near Stockholm old town and the Nobel museum. So I would advice you to combine all three locations into one block for a visit. The buildings are just simply beautiful. On Sunday I had a chance to see the marching band and changing of the guard. It's",
          "We were lucky to see soldiers marching to the palace when we visited Stockholm.The Palace itself and the surroundings are beautiful and worth a visit.",
          "Myself and my boyfriend visited here at the start of July and had a lovely time. The palace is vast and takes a while to walk round and see everything. Some of the layouts are a bit confusing but it was really helpful to have a checklist of all the areas that there are to see",
          "I want there in April for Easter and I had a great time. you can see most of the palace. Worth visiting while visiting Stockholm.",
          "We had a beautiful day to watch the Changing of the Guard and then tour the beautiful Royal Palace. We chose an English tour for the upper floors and used the hearing device for the lower floors. The English tour was especially helpful as the guide offered so many stories",
          "The palace may not be one of the most beautiful buildings of the world but it is definitely one of the kind and worth a visit, specially from inside.",
          "We looked forward to our visit to the Royal Palace Stockholm and were a little disappointed to be honest. There are a lot of steps, so for those with limited mobility this will be a problem, many of the rooms were dark(understandably to preserve what contents were there) but",
          "Very interesting palace. I strongly recommend taking a guided tour. It\u2019s a 45 min tour that can be booked only at the ticket office for a modest 30 SEK per person. Totally worth it.",
          "Royal Palace is located in the old town. They have daily change of guards and it\u2019s great to observe it. Museum displaying the royal treasures is a good place to visit within the palace.",
          "The Royal Palace situated in Stockholm old town is definitely worth a visit and paying to go inside. The Palace has over 600 rooms so is fairly large. The rooms the public have access to a well laid out an interesting and do show the history of not only the Swedish Royal family",
          "The Royal Palace is a lovely place with its beautiful rooms and art. Go on a tour, if you can, so you know what you're looking at and can hear the history. If you time it right, you can also see the changing of the guards.",
          "We joined a guided tour where they enjoy telling you that the palace is almost as big as Buckingham Palace! You don't get to see all the rooms with the guide - he/she will take you to some key rooms and then you are free to go around a second time at your own speed so you can",
          "Visited the Royal Palace as part of a ground tour we participated in. It was very interesting to see the various aspects of Swedish Royalty and to compare it to the other Palaces we have toured in Europe. While not as grandiose as the Russian or English palaces, nevertheless",
          "From the outside it looks a daunting walk in, a very deep slope, however, there is another entrance on ground level in the side street but you have to search for it, also, there is a lift available on asking if needed and you are taken up by a member of staff - after that all is",
          "We didn't go inside,but watched the changing of the guard from several vantage points. One from above while the soldiers and band was marching toward the castle. Then, again in the main courtyard while they performed the ceremony. Always entertaining.",
          "Lovely tour of modern Palace still used for ceremonies & visiting Heads of state. Intimate feel with some rooms still in use like bedrooms, reception rooms etc as well as original rooms. Nice audio guide & not too strenuous walking. Some stuff on various Royal Orders a bit",
          "We were there during a national holiday, so entrance was free and the place was crowded and hot. We were able to tour the Hall of States, apartments, and the royal chapel. The palace is still in use, and some of the rooms look a little worn. Overall, it is a grand palace that",
          "This is old palace still being used for the government business,office administration and foreign guest visits and meetings,inside you have toclimb few steps without lift.A museum,armoury,apartments ,meeting hall,treasury ,antiques are shown and very well explained by guide in",
          "There are 2 ticket offices at the Royal Palace. One is at the Ticket & Information desk by the Outer Courtyard. The other is at the Entrance desk on the South side of the Palace. You\u2019ll need to walk up a flight of steps across from the Royal Chapel to reach the Entrance",
          "With the ticket you can view the royal apartments, the treasury, the tre kronor museum and the museum of antiques. The English guide is very professional and clear in the explanation, and the royal palace is really wonderful. Furthermore the free audioguide are easy to use but",
          "One needs to experience this palatial edifice that is so much a part of the history and culture of the Sweden. It is difficult to imagine the extravagance that is part of the monarchy that is prevalent to this day and age. One needs to sign up for tours to view the royal",

          "The palace was built in 18th century and still sitting in there proudly. The Royal guards were exchanging their guard posts every two hours. That was really worth to see as it was really ceremonial.",
          "we happened to be there on swedish day so they made the changing of the guard a BIG deal. it took a long time - the most impressive was the band on horseback",
          "Wonderful history, great culture, well presented and preserved. Should take a least good two hours to take in all in. Great staff and Ms. Isabella is the very best.",
          "The Royal Palace of Stockholm in the Old Town is used today for ceremonial events. The current Royal Family resides in Drottningholm. We used our Stockholm Pass as our entry ticket. There are various buildings within the Palace complex. The main building houses official",
          "of all the palace I've visited, this had the most air of elegance instead of pure extravagance, really enjoyed the visit.",
          "This palace is quite large and in a portion, the family is still living and conducting business. There are painting, carpets and artefacts at the display. In the courtyard, there are cannons and good photo opportunity.",
          "The Royal Palace is one of the largest palaces in Europe and is the official residence of the King. It was mostly built in the 18th century in Italian Baroque style. Directly across the plaza from the palace stands an impressive mansion built by the Palace's architect for",

          "For free you can enter the main rooms of the palace which in my opinion is the main attraction of the palace. The chapel is beautiful and you can sit in the pews and pray or simply sit and take in the view. The only thing that you really get by paying for the ticket is to see",
          "Visited June 2018. Definitely must see for the Royal Guards Changing ceremony as it was the most interesting - and less crowded than at Buckingham.",
          "I do not go in such places. I am not a museum guy but it is always nice to walk around the structure and take gorgeous photos",
          "Expansive palace complete with grand rooms, a sizable chapel and treasury. We purchased our tickets and were planning on going a 13:30 English tour (check the web page for tour times). Unfortunately, the crowds were over the top with waves of cruise ship tours crashing over us",
          "I was really eager to visit the palace to see inside, since it has such a noticeable presence in Gamla Stan. Overall, I'm glad I visited but don't think I'll need to visit again. The Royal Chapel was beautiful, and I enjoyed the Tre Kronor Museum to learn about the former",
          "The visit with the group was nice one. Could come to know the history and royal splendor. From outside of palace one can see the beautiful city.",
          "Parts of the royal apartments were closed for a state visit when we came, but they offered reduced admission to see the Hall of State, Treasury (with crown jewels), Tre Kronor museum,and Gustav's Museum of Antiquities (Roman statues and busts). The Chapel is free to visit. Great",
          "We visited shortly after the palace opened on a Saturday morning and found no lines. Our ticket included several apartments and exhibits, but the guest wing was not open. The ticket also included the royal jewels in a crypt. The opulence of the royals is on full display as you",
          "There is a lot to see at the palace. We didn\u2019t get to view it all because we arrived an hour before closing. It\u2019s interesting to see the rooms that are classic/traditional and others more modern being used today.",
          "The Royal Palace museum was one of the best sightseeing spots I've been to in Stockholms. Purchase one ticket and you get to visit many amazing places in the palace. My favorite was the crown displays (no photos!). Definitely wait for the 12-o'clock guard changing ceremony. I",
          "If you are near the Palace, can highly recommend changing of the Guard, lots of historic uniforms, horse guards and bands. All very entertaining, try and get there a bit early to get a spot",
          "Their Guard changing was a highlight. we were there on their National day and it was amazing with military bands & parade",
          "We bought the entrance tickets to the palace only. The interior is very well-maintained and opulent, but in a traditional, classic way instead of over-the-top ostentatious. Visitors are allowed to proceed through the palace on their own, at their own pace, to see rooms as they",
          "We used our Stockholm Pass to get entry and we took the opportunity of the audio guide to tour the Palace and learn about the history. Many rooms were well presented and lots of people to help if needed. Some level changes but we found the stairs easy to negotiate.",
          "The palace was beautiful and the ticket include two apartments and two museums. Had a fantastic time.",
          "Definitely worth a visit, interesting to wander around the palace which includes the treasury (crown jewels), royal apartments, state rooms, chapel, carriages, and a couple of museums. Unfortunately the armoury wasn't open when we went. A nearby church is also included in the",
          "A really beautiful building with great features. Lots to see and the statues and water features are amazing",
          "I wasn't sure I'd get round everything in the time that I had (c. two hours) but I did, and I didn't feel I had rushed. Not everything was open - I really wanted to see the Royal Chapel and armoury but they were closed. Still, there were four things open and I very much enjoyed",
          "Yes they have guards, but honestly pretty relaxed and nothing like Buckingham Palace. Also was surprised how many women were guards - we saw more than men. The Palace is nice but I think we have seen so many others so I have to be honest, it wasn\u2019t that impressive.",
          "Ticket covers 4 locations - did all 4. The State Apartments were great - loads of stairs but lots to see. Crown jewels in the Treasury and bit dark and dungeons. Get the stewards to shine their torches on the world orb as it changes and phones are forbidden. The antiquities",
          "We stumbled on to this adventure. We were walking around the Royal Palace when we heard trumpets blaring and saw the royal horse guard coming up the street heading to the palace. We made our way up to the Royal Palace and in the rear area we were treated to not only the horse",
          "Don't miss the Changing of the Guard at the Palace. It's usually at 12.15pm but you need to get there about 45min early to get front row spot. Great military band playing and lots of pomp!! Check on time as it does vary. Great experience.",
          "Not to be missed. Stand on the side before the bridge to the palace and you will be right next to them marching and playing songs. The street is the one parallel to the palace before they cross the bridge. here are some maps as of june 2019. Hope this helps you on your",
          "A great site to visit. Well worth it for great photo opportunities. The changing of the guards is really good.",
          "The hidden gem is the hourse wagon museum under the castle. Find it and enjoy. Also watching the guardians to change is a must.",
          "Toned down by comparison with St. Petersburg's palaces and museums, the Royal Palace is nevertheless sumptuous, but in restrained (how restrained with over 600 rooms?) good taste. Large Baroque and Rococo rooms of every hue keep you moving pleasantly through with thankfully,",
          "Negotiate around as had to push through crowds going in one direction to get to the exit. Needs a re think on getting out of the building for all those visiting as really is unpleasant trying to get back to where you started. Was fascinating to see though.",
          "Wowza ! I wouldn't mind taking up residence here haha. Massive !! So many cool details. Loved the statues on the side (Romulus and Hersilia, Paris and Helen). Heck, even the stairwell's were fancy ! I have to say of the 3 Scandinavian Royal Palaces ... this one is the nicest,",
          "Before going into the museum, I would definitely recommend seeing the changing of the guards in the courtyard of the palace. It starts at 11.45 am but get there earlier to get a good viewing spot. After that there are tickets available which cover 4 parts of the palace which",
          "We were lucky enough to visit the palace over Easter, when the museum planned a golden egg hunt for children. This allowed the kids to explore the palace happily and with purpose, and for the adults to enjoy the exhibits, history and beautiful rooms. Ingenious idea that worked",
          "We have just visited this and were very fortunate to see the changing of the guards. Inside was beautiful. Well worth a visit.",
          "It's a very large castle and the admission ticket includes 3 parts, which not all are worth seeing because it's very repetitive. The royal apartments are nice and it's great to see the evolution of art throughout the rooms; they feature very ornate clocks, antique paintings",
          "I always go to palaces abroad and this one didn't disappoint me! Plenty to.see so good value for your money. Live the old rooms and their interior. Cha going of the guards is nice as well. I was more impressed by the inside as with the outside of the palace",
          "The royal place is on the island of Gamla Stan. It gives an interesting insight into the life of the Swedish royal family and there is a room solely about the honours given in Sweden. The state rooms are also worth seeing and the audio guides are free and informative. The",
          "We were advised to go and check this out at 12.15. It was a nice sunny day and there were quite a few people there already so it was a little difficult to get some good video. We were ver glad we went as it was very colourful and informative. The horses and the pageantry made",
          "We went to see the change of the guards at 12h15 on weekdays and saturdays, 13h15 on Sunday\u2019s. We\u2019ve seen the changes in other european cities as well, so we can compare a few things. In short: the ceremony is smaller, but more animated. With a musical parade, and a series of",
          "Under construction for the next 25 years. Wasn't really impressed with what was there. Okay but not great",
          "Today we visited the Royal Palace for the first time, even though I been here in Stockholm a dozen of times. It\u2019s interesting to visit, and I suggest to book for a tour with guide, to appreciate the place. Luckily we had also the opportunity to see the change of the guards just",
          "I was here with my American relatives and their Swedish friends. We had a nice day out looking round the Old Town and we watched the changing of the guards at The Royal Palace. It was nice to see.",
          "Most of the palace is like any other royal palace, very nice rooms, nice historic memories. But the treasury basement was just beyond all my expectations. Also we were pretty lucky, there was a changing in the guard, which took like 30 minutes with a small show with horses and",
          "This is one of the most regal palaces of Europe! The palace is stunning. Most of it is open to the public. It\u2019s a must see!!",
          "The last place we visited. Booked tickets the day before but the e-tickets never arrived in my inbox. Arrived at the palace and all was gone as they had a record online. Palace is ok, it\u2019s impressive corridors and size are interesting and the \u2018free\u2019 spoken word handsets were",

          "If you as me have seen several castles in the world you will probably find this ordinary. A nice location in the Old Town. Don\u00b4t miss watching the \"Changing of the Guards\".",
          "All the family enjoyed watching the guards doing their drill, even funnier was the guard telling a tourist off for being in their way!",
          "I love the fact that there are 1440 rooms in the palace but only 660 have windows. I love to pretend I\u2019m staying there. A weight of history",
          "We went to the palace which is a fantastic building. The visitor areas are separate and have to be accessed independently. The treasury holds some beautiful crowns and pieces of jewellery. The royal apartments are accessed on the opposite side. There are some beautiful rooms and",
          "A walk around in the Palace and watching the change of guards was a nice experience..The best part to look into was the Crown \ud83d\udc51 used by the Royals... The underground museum for the swords and crowns were the most interesting part of the Palace.",
          "A visit to the Royal Palace in Stockholm is definitely worth a visit. Based roughly around the Royal court of the British Royal family. Free to walk around the walls and to see military guards in the best uniform guarding the Palace. A tour of the Royal armoury and the Total",

          "Being able to roam the inside of the palace is a spectacular experience. You are able to get close to all of the priceless antiques and walk in rooms that are still used. The size of the palace is breathtaking. I highly recommend a visit. If you go when it\u2019s cold there is a",

          "I am so glad I stumbled upon the entrance to the Palace. I didn't know that you could go in and visit until I saw people going in and out. I was able to see the Royal Apartments, Treasury, and the Tre Kronor Museum. I also took a tour in the royal apartments which really gave",
          "Having visited few other palaces before, this one has still managed to impress us with the delicate details put into the design or the building and its decors. We did the apartments in 1h but hurried a lot. Allow yourself more time if you want to read everything and check out",

And we were quite surprised, because even on a gloomy day the interiors still looked joyful, full of light and spacious. The exhibitions were very nice and detailed. We especially enjoyed",
          "It was nice but not as extensive as Buckingham Palace ceremony; but I still recommend. The old city walking tour is a must! Overnight Viking Cruise from Turku, Finland was terrific. Stockholm port is beautiful day or night.",
          "An enjoyable day out. We watched the changing of the guard before heading inside. It was a cold day but well worth standing outside to see. The Crown Jewels were really interesting. There is quite a bit to see so give yourself plenty of time. It took us over 3 hours to see the",
          "Unfortunately the apartments were closed when we arrive however we went into the museum and treasury. The museum was ok but a little underwhelming as it was all poster based rather than showing you the actual palace. The treasury was again ok it held a number of crowns and",
          "Someone explains the changing of the guards and they play various trumpet pieces during the changeover - worth seeing!",
          "The tickets for the palace also allow you into the guest apartments and treasury so thought it was good value. The chandeliers alone are stunning. Beautiful gilded rooms with antique furniture delicately placed. A wonderful palace to look around and it was very quiet when we",

          "Lots of medals and robes on display to look at. We saw the changing of the guard at 12 noon which lasted about an hour. They were guardsmen and women in training. Interesting to see the Royal Treasury. If you like history worth a visit.",

          "Love the royal palace. The grounds are so stately. It\u2019s nice they let you walk the grounds fairly close up. I like watching the guards. They\u2019re so solemn. I wish they had tours when we were there but they didn\u2019t. Great photographic light and angles on the side of the palace.",
          "A place I have been to many times. Once I was part of the Royal Guard during my military services a long time ago. Walking through the castle is an expose through the last three centuries of Swedish royal history. There is a special museum called Livrustkammaren which is more",

          "The palace is cool to visit. However, I probably had too much expectation for the change of guards. Got there at noon to watch it. But I feel it's not that impressive. So if you are on a tight schedule or the weather isn't that good, you can probably skip the change of guards.",
          "Stockholm's Royal Palace has much to recommend it. There is a Changing of the Guard ceremony in the area in front of the palace every morning about 11:00 with at least three bands playing and several different groups of soldiers/sailors marching around. The inner courtyard has",
          "We paid a little extra for a guided tour and so glad we did. The stories of the Royal Family and their history add so much to the appreciation of what the Palace is, it's definitely more than the rooms that are displayed. Would definitely recommend timing your visit to coincide",
          "We toured the palace by ourselves, but you could get a guided tour. The palace was very opulent. They had some places roped off because of a meeting with the top brass, but we saw alot! I would recommend seeing it if you are in Stockholm.",
          "the Palace is Massive enough to be called a Royal Palace, it has a simple architecture from outside but its simplicity is very charming. Many tourists visit there since it is one of the Must see of Stockholm. The changing of the Royal Guard is what you need see when you are",
          "We entered the Royal Palace, the entrance costing 80sek. We started the visit with the Tre Konor Museum, or Three Crowns, which featured remains of what used to be the castle of the city. From there we moved to the palace itself and walked through the rooms of the royal",

          "The grand rooms of the palace are fascinating examples of arctitecture. As an individual who does his own home construction, I found the craftsmenship remarkable - from the faux marble pillars to the amazing wooden floors. The guided tour is worthwhile and it is fascinating to",
          "Being from England, I love going to other countries that still also have a royal family and learning about their cultural as ours can get so boring. Very lovely place. We saw the changing of the guard and visited the royal apartments and the museum. Expensive however im glad we",
          "This is simply a must-visit excursion. Gamla Stan would not be complete without a visit to the Royal Palace.",
          "Very well organise global visit possibilities. Visit the royal quarters still in daily use. Do not forget to visit the throne room. Also the ticket gives acc\u00e8s to the subsidiary royal crown juwels. The third part leads you in the dungeons and lower parts of the castle with well",
          "First if you have children use the restrooms prior to going. They need to be in front. For single adults head back and up on stairway by museum shop if accessible. Riders did a great job entertaining crowds. The horses were trained do dance to the music on this day. Glad I went.",
          "There is so much to see at this place that you never get bored. From the old palace that got burned down to the new one with magnificent interiors and the treasury, the palace is completely worth your time.",
          "You should visit the Royal Placae when in Stockholm. Beautiful palace which is still used today. You even see the rooms where foreigh leaders and crowned heads stay when they visit the royal family. Highly recommended!",
          "I liked outside of palace more, even it is in the reconstruction. Maybe problem is we didnt have a guide. There is a lot of parts, you will go back the same way (often), it is boring. And probably there are ni limits about an amount of visitors. It was full, a lot of people in",
          "Its a very complete museum with the story of the royal family from the past till the current days. Very impressive the royal treasure.",
          "Very interesting Royal Palace.It is also worth paying a little extra to visit the Treasury and Tre Kronor(Old Palace). We were also fortunate to see the Changing of the Guard and it is definitely worth seeing. It wasn't too crowded when we visited,there was a slight queue for",
          "Very beautiful palace and quite ornate inside. Absolutely overcrowded with so many tourists though - which sort of detracted. Don't miss the Changing of the Guards outside though - now that was well worth waiting for!!",
          "Great place to visit. Definitely catch the changing of the guard ceremony that occurs daily. Great place for photos at Sunset and at night. Wonderfully decorated at Christmas.",
          "Great place to visit as Royal Palace is the official residence and major royal palace of the Swedish monarch. The palace is made of brick and sandstone. The palace has two courtyards. Outside the western row is the Outer Courtyard which is the main area for the changing of the",
          "This was a stop on one of our sightseeing tours, its beautifully preserved, dark and rich, stunning chandeliers etc. Dont miss the changing of the guard ceremony, and defo take a tout.",
          "There are probably not the same crowds here as at the Drottningholm Palace or at the Vasa Museum, but Stockholm's Royal Palace is still a popular sight, so to arrive at the opening hour, which is 10am, makes sense. Naturally to watch the changing of the guards one has to be",
          "Was there Just after the Nobel prize so \u00e0 couple of thing Were close To th\u00e9 public. But the two things i'd like the most were open! The treasury is really captiviting. It is situated in a restaurated part of the old castle beneath the actual palace. You will see swords, crowns",
          "Great location full of well maintained treasures. I visited it with my young daughter and she was excited about walking through the richly furnished rooms. I really loved the royal treasures rooms and the royal stables.",
          "Not having these types of palaces and castles in the US, it was amazing to see the different rooms, architecture, and decor. The Palace was part of our Stockholm Pass so we took advantage of it and I am glad we did.",
          "Lots of history and things to look and do but is very expensive for what it is. But was lovely afternoon trip",
          "Good value for money as there are the royal apartments, museum and treasury included in the price. The state rooms are very grand. The staff were very helpful and friendly.",
          "Pretty expensive to visit the palace. Entrance tickets brings you to the total apartments, underground rooms and the treasury. Honestly, the things in display here is a lot more underwhelming vis-a-vis the palaces you visit in Paris, Vienna, St Petersburg. If you have visited",
          "The most interesting part of the visit are the royal apartments. You can see where the royal parties take place and where the Nobel dinner is held. The Three Crown museum is informative but boring. The Treasury is just a small room.",
          "Certainly worth a visit if you're touristing in town. Not that great blast of luxury and lavish refined architecture. It is a royal palace indeed, but not particularly old nor rich, when compared to other European dynasty residences. One regrets the opportunity of seeing the",
          "There was a big banquet scheduled for the evening (sigh, we were not invited) so parts of the palace were closed to visitation. The royal apts were okay but nothing spectacular - Hapsburg palace in Vienna far better. Royal Treasury was interesting and the carriages - especially",
          "A highly recommended visit for travellers to Stockholm. Decorated in opulent style, the Royal Palace in Stockholm is one of my personal favourite royal palaces in Europe. The ticket includes entrance to the Royal Palace, the Tre Kroner Museum and the Royal Treasury. Student",
          "Palace of the ruler of the country that hasn't gone to war in centuries. Lots and lots to see, so much that it made my feet hurt. It's not versailles but very impressive. The changing of the guards happens at 12:15 (atleast) on saturday. There is quite a lot of audience, so",
          "By visiting this castle, wandering through all the rooms and the cellar a well we learned a lot about the history of the Royal family and Stockholm. Also watch the change of guards.",
          "Stumbled into the inner courtyard of the royal palace just in time to witness the changing of the guards. The beauty of the baroque structure mixed with the precision of the military",
          "Did not go into the palace, but was just outside of the with the tour guide giving out the comments and the intro of the place. It was alright",
          "I was expecting an audio guide, but they don't have it. Be sure to wait for the change of the guard that happens in the yard of the palace. Every honor for the soldiers.",
          "The State Visit of the Italian was good and bad: I could see the military formations walking from Kungstr\u00e4garden to the palace where they formed a guard of honor for the Royals and the Italian Representative, to drive through in carriages. It was very nice seeing the carriages!",
          "We only had time to see the changing of the guard ceremony and we were glad we did...i believe Sweden still has military conscription (good idea!) and the young people we talked to were all conscripts....most defiantly worth a visit.",
          "I only came for the \"Changing of the Guard\", which is only Sundays and Wednesdays in October though Spring. Start time says 11:45am, but that is just when the new Guards leave the army barracks to head towards the Royal Palace. The actual \"Changing of the Guard\" doesn't begin",
          "This palace has three distinct sections to visit plus the Riddarholmen Church. Take in all four to get a wonderful view of Stockholms history.",
          "Changing of the guard, rooms very interesting. What I liked most was the carriage display in the basement. Enter from the back. Next to the palace was a very interesting free archaeology museum. Easy walking distance.",
          "A good place to see Sweden\u2019s royal history and how they lived in past years. One can see furniture, clothes and rooms where royal families lived earlier. Three crowns is very nice to see as well.",
          "Great to visit the Royal Palace while exploring Stockholm to soak up Swedish history and culture. See the main Royal Apartments, the Treasury and the Kronor Museum together. The Treasury held impressive crowns, jewels, swords and other regalia. Great to see this part of",
          "This is a functioning Royal Palace which serves as the location for the head of state. Be sure to catch the Changing of the Guard, the music will surprise you.",
          "We visited with our 2 year old during a very rainy day last week. It\u2019s good value and has some really interesting things to look at. We spent most time in the state apartments. Lots of space to move around when it is busy too. The underground museum looked great for older kids",
          "The Royal Palace is an amazing building inside. Lots of furniture, paintings etc to see. You can also watch the changing of the guard outside. Not cheap to go in 180 kroner each. Located at Slottsbacken in Gamla Stan, on the waterfront.",
          "I found the Royal Apartments very dark inside not the best of light for taking photos without a flash, I suppose they must keep the rooms dark so not to damage the furnishings with daylight, this did actually spoil the whole experience, however on a lighter note The Chandeliers",
          "The Royal Palace is an incredible building filled with a huge display of furniture, paintings and decorations accumulated over the past couple of centuries by the Swedish Royal Family. We also saw the Changing of the Guard which was quite entertaining.",
          "The story of the Swedish Royal family is a little different from what the British understand but very intriguing. You must take a tour to get the true flavour of the history. It is an amazing building and the changing of the guards, though lacking some pomp is still worth",
          "The Swedish Royal Palace is on the island of Gamla Stan in central Stockholm. It is a large building on the waterfront. It is beneficial to walk completely around the palace as each side is different and offers something different. The palace is next to Old Town and is right in",
          "I thought the Royal Palace was nice but not spectacular. The exterior of the building is nothing impressive so I was a little hesitant to even go in, but the interior is beautiful. The impressive stonework, paintings on the ceiling and gold everywhere is gorgeous. The museum",
          "Went to see the changing of the guard ceremony, which in Saturday's and Sundays (12.15pm and 1.15pm respectively) includes a marching band (if the weather is ok apparently). It was by far the most spectacular changing of the guard ceremony I've ever seen, and I've seen a fair",
          "Nice to see but there are much better palaces in other countries .. see it if you have time but not a priority",
          "I am not sure if I have to recommend this attraction as a landmark...for me was a must do, but I was not impress about it. It was not cheap, but all the Nordic countries are expensive so everybody have to decide for themselves if they want to visit it.",
          "As palaces go, this one has an very majestic feel. The artwork on the ceilings is what I believe sets it apart. Sweden's historical society has done a wonderful job of making sure this beautiful structure has stayed as true to its original form as possible.",
          "This place is the opposite of opulent. It\u2019s dark and drab. It feels so tired. The exhibits look cheap. The public parts of the palace are just sad. There is nothing spectacular here.",
          "The royal palace is a stunning place to visit, it also has 3 meuseums within the same area and when purchasing the tickets you can get a really good deal for all of the activities including a cathedral 3 minutes walk from the palace. I would also recommend checking the times of",
          "In the first part of the tour of the apartments, a free audio guide is available to pick up as you walk around the rooms. The guide will give you more details about special paintings and the purpose of each room, which I found interesting. I would have liked for the rest of the",
          "While the palace is beautiful, one must enjoy walking through the various rooms to see the architecture. If so, you will love the tour. So much history has occurred here and to be able to see it as it has been for so many years is amazing. Our guide had a tendency to start",
          "First of all, go in the morning. The palace closes at 1600h and, if you haven\u2019t seen all that the entrance fee entitles you to, too bad! The light is kept very low, presumably to protect the already discolored tapestries, so for me it was as though I was experiencing my",
          "We were lucky enough to be able to see changing of the guard, would recommend if you are able to do so. Its very much more than your standard, and the announcer even does everything once in Swedish and then again in English!",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Royal Palace. We arrived near closing time so we quickly viewed the rooms in under 30 minutes, but I would recommend more time if you'd like to look in more detail. We visited during the summer and it was extremely hot inside so if you visit during",
          "We were able to visit the Royal Palace and we don't regret it. It's a wonderfull palace where you're certainly spent some hours. With your ticket you can visit the royal appartments as well as the crown jewels (treasury) and the royal coaches (armoury) At 12h, you can witness",
          "We visited Stockholm recently for a business conference and enjoyed a fantastic tour of the palace. The building, artwork and furnishings are all very impressive and truly highlight the incredible wealth that Sweden had from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Our tour was made",
          "This was our first time in Stockholm (me, husband, and boys 6 & 9 yrs old). The palace was beautiful and my boys were amazed. We also visited the museum downstairs as well as the Treasury which housed the Crown Jewels (no photos allowed). All three require a separate ticket,",
          "the crown jewels are nice but mostly it's the apartments in the palace and that's quite boring. not a must the guards change however, is beautiful and highly recommended.",
          "To be honest we found the royal palace to be a disappointment, but maybe our expectations were too high, comparing to Buckingham Palace. It seemed to be very old and everything that you can see is obviously not in use quite often, so it is less exciting and you cannot really",
          "You could easily spend a day or more exploring the palace. We chose to walk through the Tre Kronor Museum (perfect for anyone interested in medieval history) then the royal apartments on our own. We then did the guided tour of the treasury and it was excellent. The guide was",
          "I should preface by saying that I am always fascinated by history, so to me that was an amazing visit. The place is sort of a maze, so be sure to not just pay and go into one door and think you have seen it all! Perhaps my favorite parts were the crowns and regalia in the",
          "Never knew the Swedes had so many jewels end for. This was a great experience to see the regalia 4 muskets worth the value",
          "My wife and I love palaces, and this one is fine. The apartments are the highlight, but the treasury is also nice, and we sprung a few euros more for the church located nearby. Some of the other exhibits as part of the package one can stroll through if you have nothing else to",
          "The royal apartments and guests' apartments are beautiful and well worth a visit. Do this on your Stockholm Pass, and take in the royal treasury while you're there. If you arrive at 12:00, you can watch the guard changing - not quite as exciting as London, but worth taking time",
          "This castle in the heart of Stockholm is for sure worth a visit. It is very different from other castles we have seen before. The decorations of the rooms are interesting and the exhibitions show a unique side of castle life. We spent a couple of hours walking through the rooms,",
          "They say it is the \"grandest royal palace in the world\". A bit far-fetched, methinks. The exterior looks quite functional though on a large scale. Inside the rooms are dark as they preserve fabrics from light which makes many rooms quite gloomy. There are 5 museums inside so",
          "Definitely plan a visit to the palace when visiting Stockholm. Was interesting to look around the state rooms and see the Crown Jewels in the treasury.",
          "Definitely worth taking the tour to get a better appreciation of the history of the building. currently under some repairs and renovation however still lots to see. try to plan your visit to see the changing of the guards. Pretty neat to watch all of the horses coming into",
          "The rooms of the palace were rather sombre with their muted colours. Even the paintings were uninspiring and there was a distinct lack of explanation about the rooms and the exhibits in any one room. Yes, I am comparing this palace with others I have seen elsewhere in Europe and",
          "We went to see the changing of the guard.....more pomp when the security guards change at Netto.!!! Started late.....and a damp squid for sure. Lovely old square a minute from the Palace tho so worth going up the steps. The museum inside is......a museum.!!!",
          "Went yesterday (Tuesday 25th September 2018). Beautiful palace with lots of things to see and do. We did not know an awful lot about the swedish royal family, but the whole place was really informative, and made us want to know more about the history of the family and buildings",
          "We missed changing of the guard as we'd booked a tour, but palace is certainly well worth a visit by everyone",
          "I visited the inside of the royal palace in Stockholm and recommend it. The inside is very beautiful and historical. The chapel is also very beautiful. The staff were professional and polite and happy to speak english.",
          "The Royal Palace in Stockholm is very plain on the outside so the inside is a revelation. There is a display of the many medals and honours that can be bestowed by the crown. The rooms are beautifully furnished including one with quite modern furnishings. If you want to see the",
          "Lots to see in the historic building mainly from the late 16th and 17th century. Takes time to visit the Hall of State, state apartments, royal apartments, royal chapel, Tre Kronor display about the original castle, Treasury, Gustav III\u2019s antiquities collection and the Royal",
          "This palace has some of the beautiful & rare collections of paintings, murals, armories. Located in front of river !",
          "We came to watch the changing of the guard. Considering it's for free, this is a very entertaining spectacle! We got there half an hour early to get a good spot as it got very busy. An army band plays for a lot of it (they're very impressive) and there's lots of marching and",
          "I would definitely recommend making sure you\u2019re there for the changing of the guards at 12.30 I believe, it is such a great watch and just gives a wonderful atmosphere too. The inside of the palace is just beautiful and ornate, I would definitely recommend visiting on your trip!",
          "The Royal Palace is located in the old part of Stockholm. It is quite expensive - 180 Kr for adults and 90 Kr for children - but well worth a visit. There is plenty to see including the extensive royal apartments and the treasury where the crown jewels are on display.",
          "There\u2019s nothing that can be said bad about this visit. You can spend hours here visiting all that it has to offer and with free audio guides in some of the places it just gets better. Add the visit to the burial church onto your ticket price for another worthwhile venture.",
          "The history of the palace is amazing and beautiful. I recommend listening to the guided headphones as the explanation is helpful. Beautiful gardens, a must see!",
          "The majestic palace was an important itenarary in our visit to Stockholm. The weather was so good. There is an entry fee. Apart from the magnificent structures, there is always a crowd waiting to watch the guard change every day at 10am and 1pm. About evening time I don't know.",
          "The 605-rooms, Royal Palace (also known as The Stockholm Palace ) is beside Storkyrkan (In Swedish it is known as Sankt Nikolai kyrka.) and a few minutes walk to Old Town (Gamla stan). There is always a soldier on guard outside the main entry doors. Waking through the large",
          "From outside, this doesn't look like much of a \"castle.\" We only got to visit the \"royal apartments\" but they were beautiful, with amazing wooden/marble furniture and decorations. The parquet wood floors,made with dozens of different woods, were incredible. The beautiful",
          "We went to see the changing of the guard it was worth a visit and we enjoyed it. Quite busy so hard to get a good spot",
          "We really enjoyed seeing the changing of the guards in the palace court yard. We were also lucky enough to see the Crown Prince and Princess up very close. The Swedish people adore their royalty - they treat them like rock stars - which is very nice to see. It is easy to walk",
          "This immense square Palace is the official home of the King and Queen of Sweden - Royal Apartments, as well as the center of official/state functions. You can visit the Royal Apartments (not the rooms where the Bernadotte family stays - they are off limits) - we found them okay",
          "Spectacular cathedral upon main entrance with a wonderful carriage house displaying beautiful historic royal carriages. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "Don't miss the 12:00 guard change. Very basic, yet with explainations and a lot of place to see clearly. The treasure safe is ashtonishing, with all the diamonds and furs.",
          "We only saw the guards arrive on horseback during the changing of the guard, but it was fun. It was very crowded, so really couldn't see much else.",
          "We entered the palace square, just in time to see the changing of the guard. Lovely buildings, situated in the old town.",
          "As a non-Swedish visitor, I found my tour of the palace to be a great way to get an overview of the history of Sweden, while enjoying the building. I was very entertained by the charming tall man who led our English tour. He was both funny, and very enthusiastic about the",
          "Having been to see Versailles and Schonbrunn during my recent trip, this palace did not quite reach those standards but was still very nice. Easy to get around, and the Royal Apartments were nice. The Hall of Mirrors was beautiful as it took inspiration from Versailles as was",
          "To understand a little bit of the Swedish Monarchy history you need to visit the Royal Palace. It\u2019s a good three hours visit if you move fast, is there four sectors, all them have information in English. Guided tours available at extra cost.",
          "I visited the place but did not go inside because it doesn\u2019t seem exiciting. On the other hand I coincided the shift change oh guards and took their picture. It was a nice moment to observe.",
          "We visited the royal palace in 12 pm. It\u2019s was the time that the royal guard changed. It was very nice.",
          "We really enjoyed visiting this palace! You actually get to see a lot of rooms! This palace is easy to walk to or take the hop on hop off bus or boat!",
          "This review is for the changing of the guard. We didn\u2019t pay to see the palace. Changing of the guard is free! It lasts about 30+ mins. If there is a cruise ship in port, arrive early or it\u2019s hard to see. There is a ceremony and a band that plays. It did last longer than we",
          "A local said when royalty are young they live there but when they have children they live further out for the summer anyway.It is huge, quite plain and solid. You can go in but we didn't bother as it looks like a small part that you see. The Kungstradgarden nearby is quite",
          "As someone who is rarely drawn to palaces or castles, I'm so grateful to have toured the Royal Palace (Kungliga Slottet) in Stockholm. It's filled with interesting\u2014and imperfect\u2014history. Simply witnessing these realities can be the greatest gift to our own reality. A few",
          "Very impressive palace, chapel and museum. Part of the palace used ideas from Versailles. Also collection of medals",
          "I was really looking forward to seeing the crown jewels, etc, but they were not impressive and it was so dark and hot, I could not wait to get out.",
          "The royal palace is a must see in Stockholm! The buildings are beautiful and there is plenty to see. The Crown Jewels were a particular highlight, but the changing of the guard is something to behold. The whole process takes about 45 minutes, but is definitely worth seeing if",
          "Went to see the changing of the guard, but it was very crowded... the palace itself is magnificent, a lot to see. Really enjoyed the royal stables. The chapel in the royal palace is magnificent as well.",
          "The Swedish Royals clearly love their bling but one of the downsides of a trip to this Palace is that there is no one way system so you trail through endless rather predictable rooms, largely empty of furniture and once you have completed the trail, you have trail back through",
          "We visited the Palace and were lucky enough to be there to see the Royal Navy band provide music in the Square around midday.",
          "Aside from the museum, the changing of the guard at the palace was very good. Takes place at 12:15 so suggesting getting there at 11:45. Also recommend standing on the side facing the cannons so the sun is at your back.",
          "loved its tre kronor museum, small easy to navigate. they only offered a guided tour of the royal apartments that day, the rest of them on our own to explore. again interesting anecdotes of the royal family, approachable and human. changing of the guards was not easy to see",
          "We chose to do the guided tour as we usually get way more out of such visit when having a guide. The guide was really good and explained things superbly. Interesting stories about the interior and some history about the royal Sweden. Recommended",
          "The Swedish Royal Family has a very long history and the palace was started to be built since year 1697. It is one of the largest palaces in Europe, which we can see how magnificent and majestic it is. It has more than 600 rooms and counts 7 floors. With its greater than three",
          "Visited the beautiful city in Sweden and made our way to the Royal Palace. A most impressive building or buildings with the Royal Guards on duty outside the entrance We were lucky enouigh to have arrived just in time to witness the \"Changing of the Guard\" ceremony which took",
          "We made sure to be around for the changing of the guards which takes place each day at 12:15. The whole event takes about thirty minutes. There's the military band playing on horseback, the guards and some flagmen. Pretty interesting, but it was crowded. If you're not up",
          "Royal office and former residence. Long walks but you can arrange in advance for a no steps your. Changing of the Guard ceremony has been unchanged in a couple hundred years.",
          "We booked the guided tour including the treasury and the royal chapel. I think the price was only 50 SEK more for the guided tour and it was worth it! The male guide was amazing and we learned a lot about Sweden\u2019s history and the royal family. We got to see at least 30 rooms and",
          "The palace has, we were told, 650 rooms, and though only a few are open to the public, you feel you have seen all 650 by the time you leave. It's not too bad to begin with, but as time goes on every room seems identical to the last and more boring. However the Royal chapel is",
          "Very close to the Nobel Museum, you can spend half the day in both places and break for lunch. I visited the museum on a Sunday, in the morning before going into the Royal Palace at 12. That gave me enough time for the changing of the guards. Don\u2019t miss this.",
          "If you have two days or more then add it to your list. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a must. The guards have a very cool uniform",
          "Go early to avoid the crowds. Loved the royal Palace. I spent 4 hours here. Saw the Treasury, but its small.",
          "The Royal Palace is steeped in history and is a great tribute to Sweden. We saw the mounted unit on the streets, but missed the changing of the guard. The palace is huge and incorporate a number of museums. The apartments was especially impressive.",
          "We made judicious use of our Stockholm pass to see all parts of the Royal Palace that are open to the public. By arriving right on opening time we avoided the queues that develop later in the day. The Royal Apartments were stunning - magnificently decorated in baroque style. We",
          "Nice place but not a whole lot to see, unless I missed something. Cool to walk around and see parts of the palace. Close to other attractions so it was easy popping in for a few minutes.",
          "Spent a good three hours viewing all four museums and definitely worth the entry fee. Get there early to beat the stampede of visitors.",
          "We didn't have time to visit the palace, but wanted to see the changing of the guards. A large crowd gathered well before it started so unless you were on the line first, you couldn't see the ceremony or band. I did happen to go outside the courtyard to look for our bus stop",
          "I have never thought that a \"Changing of Guards\" was interesting. We skipped it in London, but so many people said it was amazing here in Stockholm, that we thought we had to go. First of all, it didn't start until 12:15, but everyone was lined up at 11:45 so it was hard to",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed this palace. It was too busy and it had lots of interesting rooms. Make sure you find and go into the separate Carriage house museum, its great and its free.",
          "While visiting Stockholm, Sweden, my wife and I enjoyed our tour of the Royal Palace with an English speaking guide on May 29, 2018. The history and the architecture was definitely worth the visit. Plain outside and beautiful inside. The Royal Palace is very big so allow ample",
          "We briefly visited the palace going to the Royal Chapel and the inside patio. The chapel is beautiful with very elaborate altar, ceiling paintings, and lovely organ.",
          "The Royal Palace in Stockholm is a very nice tour. We spent less than an hour in the whole place, including the crown jewels exhibit. So, coupled with a trip to Old Town/Gamla Stan, it's is a quite lovely site worth visiting. It is not air conditioned, like much of Europe, so we",
          "visited Stockholm as part of cruise. Went to Palace on our own. Although very hot like all of Europe Palace was very interesting and my wife and I spent a very enjoyable 2-3 hours on site. We did not visit royal chapel which was a mistake on our part. Price was OK for this sort",
          "We visited the royal palace in two parts -the first evening we walked around the exterior and visited the chapel which is free and quite nice. We returned the next morning for the tour of the royal apartments and the treasury - fee required. The apartments tour started slowly",
          "Part of our trip to Stockholm was to visit the Royal Palace, opulence at its finest all the details still in place even though the state apartments are in use daily. We did get told off for using a selfie stick by the people working there a bit over zealous if I\u2019m being honest.",
          "Definitely worth the visit. Reminds us all how opulently some of our predecessors lived. Staff was helpful and glad we took the time.",
          "The royal palace is a wonderful time enjoying the royal palace and part of it\u2019s still used rooms. Interesting to see are he master bedroom which is still in use for visiting heads of states and the dining room for large parties is simply amazing to walk through. There is too",
          "My husband and I had time for a quick walk about prior to the expiry of our Stockholm pass, enough to tour the highlights and beauty of many of the halls and chambers, with regal opulence rivalling Versailles. Given that it borders within the region of the Gamla Stan, its",
          "We joined the guided tour through the various rooms of the Royal Palace after visiting the other parts that the ticket includes (chapel, kitchen and basement/foundation). Very informative and lots to see and take in. Also, after the tour take sufficient time to wander back",
          "I have visited Stockholm and the palace on a winter noon. We have seen the guard change ceremony and must admit that it is one of the best synchronized ceremonies I have seen. Apart from the ceremony, the palace as such is an average one and not gigantic either. This is well",
          "It's an easy walk to the palace and I enjoyed soaking up the ambiance of the city. The architecture was pretty and there are lots of opportunities to take photos next to lion statues and the guards. I didn't pay to go inside, but I enjoyed the views from the outside.",
          "I enjoyed visiting the Royal Palaces and it houses some great architecture, regalia and portraits. Everything is explained in both English and Swedish so this is a great place to visit if you're interested in learning about Swedish royalty. A ticket comprises of several",
          "I visited the Palace last week. Many of the reviewers here on TA note how disappointed they were in the visit overall. I will say this - this place is not Versailles or Buckingham Palace. However, the changing of the guards here is very engaging and you will see more than you",
          "Lacking the grandeur of palace in Rome or Paris I feel depressed after visiting the castle. Mediocre at its best awful and grotesque to often.",
          "We went early on a Sunday morning and did the guided tours of the royal apartments and also the treasury tour. The royal apartments guide was very engaging and we learned some interesting things but the 45 minute tour was really too quick and had too many people on it. You",
          "There is good access to the courtyard, restaurant, throne room etc for free. Changing of the guard was fine but not sure what fuss is about it",
          "Being someone who loves palaces/castles, this was a treat. It is HUGE, along the lines of Buckingham Palace or Versailles in size. You can spend a long time here if you take your time to read about items in each room, which I did not. Be sure to see the Chapel.",
          "The admission ticket (160 SEK adults) actually includes entry to four separate museums. As we had a limited time we went for the Royal Apartments. Each room has a detailed description both in Swedish and in English, usually explaining how it was used in the past as well as its",
          "Gained admittance here and special exhibits with my Stockholm Pass. No air conditioning and lots of steps. The outside of the palace is not very attractive but the inside is worthwhile viewing. The jewels are in the basement in the hottest part of the palace! I lucked out",
          "Great place to visit. You don\u2019t have to pay to see all the places in it. Some courts are free of charge.",
          "The outside is reasonably impressive but not overly so. The previous palace on the site was more so. The royal rooms are nicely decorated with interesting history so good to visit. The blinds protect paintings and decorations but make everywhere very dark so spoil the view of",
          "We spent half a day exploring the Royal Palace and associated museums and sights. When you get your ticket, you can make sure to see everything you've paid for by studying your ticket, and then checking off the destinations one by one as you check them out: The Royal Apartments,",
          "A real must when in Stockholm. You can see much of the palace without paying. Do try and get there when there is a changing of the guard",
          "This is a great place to visit to see history in Stockholm. Nice exhibits and the palace is well maintained. The Crown Jewels were pretty cool to see alone with the state rooms.",
          "As part of the exploration of the Old Town a visit to the Royal Palace is a must. There are 4 separate areas within the Palace so a good idea to get the combined ticket. The Palace opens at 10am on weekdays so if you are in town early pop into the Cathedral first and then walk",
          "The palace is well maintained mainly because parts of it are still used. It has a lot of history and artifacts inside. The architecture is beautiful.",
          "We visited the Royal Palace first to witness the changing of the guard, then visit the interior of the Palace. The changing of the guards in scorching heat (32\u00b0C) was quite a spectacle, and we wondered how the guards in their heavy outfits and helmets or hats were dealing with",
          "It is a beautiful building in the centre of this beautiful city. I think the layout is not very successful, not enough stuff in the rooms and certainly not enough pretty or interesting things to see . Also they show the chairs and sofas with clothes covers to protect them",
          "The Royal Palace is very nice and there is a lot of access allowed. You can visit the royal rooms, the treasury, the chapel, the courtyard and other places. I also saw the changing of the guard. It was a nice experience. The chapel is very nice and the big hall is great.",
          "We only visited the palace grounds which were wonderful and very like Versailles. However we did not walk all round as it was raining quite a bit. It is worth a visit and if you have time go and see the inside too.",
          "The way to do this is to get there early. The apartments open at 9am in summer, which gives plenty of time before the other elements after 10 am. And there is space at that time to help the air circulation (there are some fans). Similarly, you don\u2019t have to cram into the pack",
          "This unfortunately was yet another place that was uncomfortable to visit due to the ridiculous temperatures. There are no ACs in Sweden which is totally understandable considering their geographical location and usual temperatures. What I cannot understand, however is the",
          "Well, it was similar to a marching band at half-time at a football game. To get a good position to watch the event, it is necessary to go about two hours early. Then the event took about one hour. Overall, it was not worth the wait plus we had to stand in the hot sun. Wasted",
          "Stopped in on my walking tour of Old Stockholm. It started with the band marching by for the changing of the guard. Next I walked into the court yard and them to the Royal Chapel. The Chapel is beautiful. Next I visited the Royal Apartment. Do this early to cut down on the",
          "Great palace with lots of history , beautiful rooms ect . Must go to treasury to see the jewels . I didn\u2019t go to armoury and horse carriages but heard it was good . Worth a visit",
          "This royal palace is a must for Stockholm visitors. In the visit they can learn about the countrys' history of monarch and other things.",
          "This is a spectacular building inside and out. The architecture of this building is iconic and beauty. Truly befitting the era it was originally constructed. It\u2019s located in the Gamla Stan neighborhood of the city. The building inside also is architecturally impressive. The",
          "The Royal Palace is for those With a romantic heart, and those who love history and pomp and ceremony. A tour through this palace brings you under the impression of what it must be like to live like a king",
          "Well laid out visit. Lots of good information in English translation.The lighting was poor with some displays",
          "My hotel was just a short distance from the Royal Palace and I was able to get many photos during the entire ceremony",
          "We went at opening time on an August weekend so it was PACKED with tour groups. I was annoyed they would allow groups so big (20+) because in many rooms it was impossible to move past them. It was also stiflingly hot inside on a 24C degree day. But it was still a lovely palace",
          "Line up along the inside edges of the buildings for a great view. Don't sit on the lions as they will make you move! Arrive about 30 minutes before scheduled time for a good view. Stay a few minutes after the changing of the guards for the band music.",
          "Gigantic from outside very little to see inside, if you are in a hurry visit the treasury it's worth seeing) other than that it's not much to visit especially if you have been to either to Germany, France or the UK",
          "Not the best castle in Europe but definitely worth a visit for the changing of the guard and the beautiful Royal Apartments which get better as you go in and then get bland again as you go out. Don\u2019t miss the changing of the guard at 12:15 although it\u2019s hard to see. Due to the",
          "Somewhat different from the other Palaces of Europe. Very impressive architecture. Chapel area was very nice.",
          "The Royal Palace is a place worth seeing . It is huge but with good signage so that you don't get lost. Photography is permitted except in the jewels room, but without flash.",
          "If you like history, don't miss it out. The whole area is nice and when the where is good oh boy, the area is stunning.",
          "We were walking around the old town and saw several people entering the palace. It was pretty impressive. The chapel part is amazing. The grounds are super clean. Worth stopping.",
          "We had a conducted tour of the palace from our cruise guide which definitely helped our understanding of the building and its history. The palace has an impressive interior of which I took many photographs without using a flash. The changing of the guard occurred during our",
          "Come and watch the changing of the guard for a look at pomp and circumstance at its best. The palace itself is full of beautiful architecture and history. Worth a visit even if you might have to wade through the crowds.",
          "I am not a museum person, so the changing of the guard at midday is a nice. It really does not reflect the term military precision as appears a wee bit relaxed but the marching band is great to hear.",
          "I thought my kids would get bored, but no. There's a treasure hunt that keep the kids interested and actually causes them to look at the details of the design and decorations. Nice way to cool off during a hot day.",
          "We had an uninspiring guided tour around a rather grand but uninspiring building. Can quite see why the royal family moved out to Drottingholm palace Worth waiting to see the changing of the guard (every day at 12.30) quite theatrical with a marching band",
          "We came to the Old City, popped into the palace but we did not go in. We have seen many palaces all over Europe so we settled for the change of the guards.",
          "Visited the Royal Apartments and Royal Chapel. Though both are quite interesting and worth a visit as they provide a bit of history on the family and country, etc. However, as others have mentioned, not as impressive as some of the other European castles and palaces; however,",
          "An extremely large building that you can access easily but hasn\u2019t quite the same character that many we have seen before Worth a quick visit while you ate here but there are plenty of other attractions inStockholm where your time will be better spent",
          "You dont have to pay to see the guard changing ceremony. Make sure you time your visit so you can witness it.",
          "I found the organisation and signage confusing as it was not immediately clear what was included in the ticket. The state rooms, as expected, were of particular interest as was the chapel. Some of the other sites included were more specialist.",
          "We walked around the outside of the palace, but we didn\u2019t go inside. It is a very impressive building that is having a lot of renovation works. We just happened to catch the changing of the guard which was really cool to watch. The gardens outside are small but perfectly kept.",
          "Arrived late afternoon about 90 minutes before closing. Just watched the changing of the guard which was cool. I would hate to stand outside this palace during the winter months. The place itself even though very large, was not a palace that I would walk away in awe. The",
          "A must visit sight in Stockholm - can get a bit touristy during lunch time, but I guess it is one of those places that people come straight too. Wonderful architecture, very good for a photo.",
          "We arrived around 11:30 which was great timing to see the changing of the guard in the front courtyard. We then bought our tickets (160 kr per adult) which allowed us to go to 4 different areas. The coolest parts in our opinion were the gorgeous cathedral and then the palace",

          "I enjoyed most the underground exhibits that show the early parts of the castle. Later on I caught a tour going through and enjoyed hearing the history.",
          "Very good. Not just the palace itself, which is big and pretty, but the change of guards at midday. It is really nice and entertaining. After the national anthem, they offer a mini concert with famous and modern songs. After approximately 40mins, they finish with the \"advice of",
          "Went to visit because the walking tour guide claimed it was the largest royal palace in the world. However it's not super grand and can definitely be skipped if you have seen other royal palaces in Europe. Only thing i really liked inside was a sculpture entitled the wave and",
          "We visited this during the unusual very hot weather so we were used to places not having air conditioning ( after all it's a normally cold country!) but this was something else. It was so hot and airless that it actually made me feel sick. Also I presumed that \"Royal Apartments\"",
          "We didn\u2019t see the whole place but the outside was impressive! We walked around and found a museum in the palace of days gone past! There was a great collection of old carriages and it was a free museum! Worth a visit",
          "The royal palace is full of paintings dated back to earlier centuries, decorative galleries and medallions are well displayed. The pairing tell a story of the royal living at that time. Crystal chandeliers glitter the halls. Ceilings and walls depict their time of living and",
          "Expensive entry so we did not pay that. However quite a lot is viewable without. As elegant and grand as you might expect",
          "You need a good couple of hours to spend doing the tour of the main palace and it does not disappoint. There are plenty of artefacts to look at and guided tours are available. The temperature was in the thirties when we visited and walking around the palace was quite draining.",
          "The palace is good but please stop taking photos of the guard by zooming him in the eye. Standing for hours is tiring enough - plus the tourists!",
          "A nice Palace, good to see the soldiers on guard, whilst we were there we saw the beginning of changing the Guard. Not as good as ours in London but still worth seeing. A nice visit, well worth a look around.",
          "right in the middle of this fabulous city is the royal palace. it is worth the entry fee to gain access to everywhere in this palace - the armoury, church, royal museum and the apartments. be prepared, there is a lot of walking and will easily take a couple of hours but well",
          "The Royal Palace isn't as grand as some. There are a number of areas that are quite cold and then there are others that have a more homely feel. The chapel is quite impressive. This wasn't the best palace but worth a look around if you have the time to spare. Please click below",
          "As we went to enter the Palace grounds to buy tickets, we were swept up into roped off areas set up to begin the viewing of the changing of the guards. It was quite a crowded scene with people pushing each other jockeying for space at the front rows! We did not know what to",
          "The only thing royal about it is the size but that\u2019s it. It\u2019s neither a beautiful building or located in nice surroundings - it\u2019s merely a giant block you have to walk around to get to the heart of Gamla Stan",
          "We wandered down to the old Town at about 11:00 found one of the ticket offices and bought a multiple entry ticket including the Palace at 2:30pm. We headed to the start of this in the 'State Room', where we were all rounded up by our guide and he led us around the apartments,",
          "With one ticket you can visit 4 museum. The exhibitions are really interesting. If you decide to go there, you can combine the visit wit the Royal Gards Ceremony. It starts at 12.15pm every day and it lasts about 45min.",
          "PROs: * HUGE, Access to so many rooms, including crown jewels, apartments. * Not crowded, even in July! This made our frenetic day at versailles seem like a waste. * Fantastic audio tour in a small portion of the palace (Bernadotte Family 200 Year exhibition). CONS: * Audio",
          "I was unimpressed with the palace. There were two tapestries that if they were on your living room floor, you would throw away. There were marble columns which looked as if they were originally nicely done, and then someone added gold decorations to make work and spend money.",
          "We were fortunate to march with the band to the Royal Palace to witness the changing of the guard. Great experience!",
          "The palace was impressive and very nicely maintained. The architecture was interesting and we enjoyed going through the royal apartments.",
          "A lot of pomp and circumstance but you'll be entertained for about 45 minutes. The band puts on a great show. Much more elaborate than most other changing of the guards (except perhaps Buckingham Palace).",

          "We did not join any tour group. We toured the palace by ourselves. They provided us with a free audio and it was helpful to understand paintings, palace, sculptures, etc. We also watched the change of guards and it was entertaining. It lasted 30 minutes and started at 1:15 pm.",

          "The palace in Stockholm in comparison to others in Europe I feel, doesn\u2019t gleam, but what it does do is whisk you into a bygone era! When you get there just sit and imagine ... it\u2019s amazing....of the people who lived and worked there... The comings and goings... We also went to",
          "This is a beautiful working palace that has two royal apartments open to the public. The rooms are beautiful and our guide did a good job of informing us about the royals who had lived here in centuries past. The current royal family chose not use the palace as their residence",
          "If you happen to be in the area of the palace by 11:30 and want to stand five or six deep to see the changing of the guard at 12:00 then you certainly need to see this, I did and I will say they are more impressive that the changing of the guards in Copenhagen",

          "A lovely old palace in the middle of Stockholm, easy to get there and you can Not miss it, which is huge with around 600 rooms and are in everyday use by the Royal family. Do take your time and tour the castle for about two hours (audio guides available) and try to be there for",

          "Out of hours of guard change is ok, because it is not to crowded. Interesting interiors and museums. If you wanna see all procedure of guard change you should be there at least 30.min before to get some place in inner yard",
          "I did not expect this to be as interesting as it was. Every part was great. I especially liked the cellar and seeing how the old castle looked and the parts that remain.",
          "There's a lot to see and this museum provides great detail into the history of the swedish royal family.  The museum itself has 3 areas and takes about 2h to complete.",
          "Self guided with headsets, there are guides throughout to ask questions.  If you do the whole thing can take several hours.   Well worth the time,  price is reasonable 160 SEK for adults and 80 SEK for children 17 and under.",
          "I love that small island Gamla Stan with a tiny and smalls street",
          "It\u2019s nice to check but not necessarily have to. It\u2019s only 10mins and nothing really astonishing, especially compared to what I have seen in Monaco and London. I would recommend you not have to put it on your must-see list, unless you happen to pass by it at 12:15.",
          "Would recommend the guided tour of the Royal Apartments. The guide has amusing stories of the royal family's practices. It makes the palace come to life. Without, it's just a walk around some lavishly decorated rooms with a little information about each room.",
          "I can only advise to take a tour in this beautiful castle which allows you to take a look how the royals and their guests lived. The palace is quite similar to other palaces of the time. \nEntry fee is definitely worth it. Seniors and \u2026",
          "Impressive place. Classic and nice. The guards are very willing to help if you ask them any question.",
          "Superb place. History speaks here.. the royal armoury is special attraction over here. Entry to the same is located at the lower tier of the front side of the building and without any fee.",
          "Interesting place. We were able to see the change of guard and it was awesome :)",
          "Nice  complex, and well preserved for obvious reasons: The Royal line is unbroken, Sweden was not involved in wars in the XX century, and it's very much a \"lived in\" palace. Actually the most modern room, which can be seen but alas not \u2026",
          "Was a great afternoon, a must see landmark and museum. I loved the treasury in the lower level basement. The afternoon parade was fantastic",
          "Good value and perfect for a overnight in the middle of a trip. Also super central and close to lots of restaurants and bars, a matter of 10 min walk.",
          "Another large piece of architecture in the heart of stockholm that boasts 3 museums! Well worth a visit as you learn a lot about not only Stockholm\u2019s but Swedish history! There are guards that are on watch posted around the palace with gives it a real palace feel!",
          "Magnificent experience and lots of things to see. Only few guided tours in English.",
          "One of the most tourist populated places in Stockholm, since it's basicly in to Old town. Several coffee shops and restaurants, also a good place to go for sightseeing some old culture in Sweden. Would recommend going with public transportation since parking spots are almost impossible to find.",
          "Free museum below the palace showcasing the royal armory and carriages. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Change of guard ceremony is completely different from anywhere else in the world . They give a complete description about the palace.",
          "Palace not as grand as Windsor or Versailles but worth a visit if you have the time. Apart from main palace itself, entrance ticket includes visits to the crown jewel vault and palace history museum.",
          "Nice place to visit, but not that much to see.  Entry is in 3 different locations for 3 different exhibits.  Not much explanation or context is provided for much of what you see.",
          "you can see soldiers at this place.  this is great and fun\nPS.there are even 2 wonderful museums nearby\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29",
          "Worth a visit.\nThe ticket gives admission to the royal apartments including guest the apartment, the museum for the old \"Trekronor\" castle and the treasury. \nPhotography is allowed in the castle and museum without flash, but not allowed in the treasury.\nAlso worth to come and watch the change of the guard ( e.g. 10 o'clock).",
          "Majestic, historic, beautiful.  We enjoyed this tour very much, and highly recommend this during your time in Stockholm.",
          "Beautiful building, never ventured inside to much to do outside",
          "Outstanding and great museum. Since there was no war here in the previous few decades, everything is untouched what is great, because it can tease the entire piece of history in one.",
          "Worth a quick look if you like to see where all your taxes go.",
          "Beautiful from outside. We didnt go inside",
          "Since Sweden has an acting king - having about the same role and responsibilities of a president of a republic - the royal and state apartments have an official function today and are still in use.\n\nThe royal apartments serve for state \u2026",
          "Nice place to see historical architecture. Big statues with beautiful history. Enjoyed this place with family. Definitely recommend this place in Stockholm.",
          "Classic and historical place.  \nDates from the 18th century and it is the official home of the King of Sweden.\n\nI don't know what time, however, they have a guard changing around the palace in a Swedish and modest way.\n\nThe square in front of the palace is always busy and the atmosphere is pleasant.",
          "My son, my brother and his son enjoyed watching the changing of the guard.  It is not as spectacular as the ceremony at Buckingham Palace, but then again it is done the Swedish way, a more modest affair that is more understated.  We enjoyed seeing it and I would recommend it as being worthwhile.",
          "Beautiful place to visit and take pictures! Could not find any information inregards to internal areas as I believe its prohibited. Good views from palace front balcony.",
          "Awesome, just pure and utterly awesome.\n\nSo much history compacted into the one building, huge though as it is, it has a lot to offer all kinds of people :) \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Excellent place to visit. Lots of artifacts were showcased in this palace.",
          "Very unique historical building",
          "Great sights. The armoury downstairs is terrific, loved the Royal coaches as well",
          "Lots of furnished rooms to walk through on your own, many exhibits and items of interest with description in English. Guided tour optional. Light levels quite low inside so adjust your camera iso as  pictures permitted but but no flash \u2026",
          "To me The Royal Palace of Stockholm has never been especially tempting. It is a rather gloomy looking structure. So, it was a delightful surprise to explore it and find out, how interesting and informative the palace\u2019s exhibitions are. The \u2026",
          "Very cool and well worth the price. So much amazing art and artifacts tied together with history and design. Well suited for a casual stroll to see everything or a sprint through you won\u2019t be disappointed! A definite must if you are in the city.",
          "Very fancy place, I feel very nice walking around, it is a fantastic place I would love to go again!",
          "i have been only outside of the complex. The water front has a nice open view. On the west side i found a military orchestra playing and walking in their fancy uniforms , and lots of impressed spectators. The building itself is not beautiful from outside , but more of a fortified castle",
          "Changing of the guard occurs at 12 on a daily basis. A must see if visiting the Palace. The palace itself is impressive in stature, but the most incredible parts are underground in the foundations - the remains of the original castle. \u2026",
          "The Palace was stunning, very well preserved architecture inside and out. Very much a glamorous European castle in every sense of the word. \nThere was a cute freckled Swedish girl behind the ticket booth at the treasury, is she single? \ud83d\ude02 \u2026",
          "Don't let the outer shell fool you. Doesn't look much from the outside but the interiors are fancy. Also the history of this building is intresting.",
          "Every visitor will be here when they come to stockholm, Sweden.",
          "The palace contains many interesting matters to look. In addition to the Royal Apartments there are three museums steeped in regal history: the Treasury with the regalia, the Tre Kronor Museum that portrays the palaces medieval history and Gustav III's Museum of Antiquities.",
          "Such a cool experience to see a palace that royalty used to live in. Absolutely gorgeous and something you'd never be able to see in the US. Definitely recommend if you're in Stockholm.",
          "The changing of the guards is unmissable. BTW this one is much larger than Buckingham.",
          "One of the main attractions of Stockholm city",
          "The weather was mild on June, no open market for walk except medieval buildings. I like that the cities doesn\u2019t need street lights. I stayed in the hotel till 3am but the sunlight not goes away!",
          "Nice serene place. Clear waters. Can spend around 1 hour",
          "Neon is the cutest guy of Sweden",
          "One of the largest palace in Europe. Apart from the palace one can enjoy the surrounding area.",
          "Very nice, very royal! Must to see.",
          "We didn't leave ourselves enough time to see everything! Beautiful glimpse into Swedish history, including the remains of the original palace.",
          "Walked from the outside looked good. Guards mean business. Make sure to catch their change routine. Inside review coming later!",
          "Watched the changing of the guard. The marching military band was very impressive.  Get there early to be at the front of the barricade for a good view. Got there by 12 and it starts at 12.15 and it was already 3 deep.",
          "I really liked this palace.  It is well preserved and had some very beautiful displays.  I would like to do more research before I went again so that I could better understand the history.",
          "Swedish royal history 101. Fascinating place!",
          "It's alright. A ticket includes entry to the Royal Apartments, the Tre Kronor Museum (historic castle museum) and the treasury. The style of the palace is not particularly unique, borrowing from Italian and French rococo styles, but it is \u2026",
          "Strong demonstration of Swedish power and wealthy .\nAmazing architecture and rich museus \nWorth spending a good time looking",
          "Best palace/ castle I have been to \u2014 and I have been to many. Loved how it\u2019s still operational so it has real furniture and you can see so many of the rooms. Incredible amounts of golden decor, chandeliers, chariots, uniforms, etc. The audio guides provide a ton of information and are easy to use. This is definitely worth visiting!",
          "Decent museum, but nothing out of the ordinary.",
          "It was good, althought one of the staff was very rude but most of them were very nice, its full of hostories! Worth going!",
          "Amazing the public gets access to the castle. Very beautiful. You can easily spend 2-3 hours both in the at the castle, church and cellar.",
          "Worth going. I never regretted that got there. It's interesting to get known with swedish royal history. Collections are impressed. Treasury is really fantastic.\n\nUnfortunately, the amount of restrooms at the palace area is not enough. Also it would be great to have audio guides for each exposition, not only for two.",
          "Historical places , beautiful areas for taking photos \ud83d\udc4d",
          "THE royal castle of Sweden. Visit, take the tour and have a look at the classically pompously ridiculous change of guards... It's all worth it!",
          "Loved it! Very rare to walk around an active palace!",

          "Great place to visit. Need to bring my family to visit",

          "Very cool place, lots of history. Changing of the guards happens every day around 12 pm. Band, horses etc. We took a tour of the treasury, royal estates, the throne room etc. The young gentleman working at the treasure was extremely \u2026",
          "Great to visit while in Stockholm. Schedule a visit when a tour starts. Part of the palace was closed when I was there and it is not always open. It takes 2-3 hours to see this and the two associated museums.",
          "Beautiful church inside and out. A sort of safe heaven in the middle of the busy old city",
          "Would recommend going to other attractions in London first",
          "Exceptional tour of an historic palace that is still used to this day.",
          "It was a great experince. A must see place if you are in Stockholm.",
          "Good to go and visit if you are in town",
          "If you have been to Peterhof or the Hermitage, no royal palace can compare. But this one is still very interesting and beautiful. Plus--many fewer visitors. Take your time. Enjoy this and that without being rushed through. Plus there's a free changing of the guard at 12:15 (or 13:15 Sunday)",
          "We witnessed the changing of the guard, the Palace is beautiful and I would recommend this as a place to visit.",
          "Best place to visit in Stockholm. When you go to Sweden, this should be the first place to visit. You can spend a day exploring old City and palace, museums, streets, shops, lakes, gardens, ferry rides etc\nYou can have fun roaming around \u2026",
          "Good place to visit when youre a tourist",
          "One ticket gets entry into four separate areas of the palace, all of which are interesting. The treasury is a small area displaying various crowns and jewels of the Swedish royal family. The royal apartments are various \u2026",
          "Lost of history to read about and see here, but the price is crazy steep to get inside. Unless you are a history buff or really want to see the bling bling of the royal family then skip it..",

          "Just walking by, big and nice looking building, palace is",
          "Be prepared to do a lot of neck exercises when you visit the Royal Palace! The ceilings there are breath-taking. The Palace is stunning, every single chamber is a treat because of different reasons. It is worth booking a guided tour there.",
          "Beautiful quiet place nice view",
          "Oh My God this castle is really beautiful in the inside! The honor guards look great! We saw the switch between them. Recommend visiting and it's too bad the outside part does not look as fancy as the inside.",

          "Nice experience and also have Changing of the Guard outside",
          "Definitely one to hit on your Stockholm walking tour. Nice building to walk around with a museum in the basement. One thing I noticed compared to the UK was that a large number of the guards were women - all of out busby-wearing guards in London are men. Sweden scores one for equality!",
          "The Royal Palace. You pay a small fee to visit inside the palace and see the museum. The museum needs to be seen to experience the grand way of living of King Carl. It is important that visitors do not miss to see the treasury . Inside the \u2026",

          "No comments! Fantastic place",
          "Beautifully maintained and a stunning collection of historic treasures. Really a delight and well worth the price of admission.

          "So much history. Beautiful architecture and sculptures.",
          "It gives a feel of being in the palace. The palace is being preserved so well that the essence hasn't changed. They have a lot of things and details in the . You get a audio guide for free in the first floor. You also get a in person guide \u2026",
          "It is weird that Sweden used to be a kingdom, never really understood it until I saw it in person. The castle is really cool and the rooms really makes you feel like you are in a royal atmosphere. The crown jewels were incredible. \n\nI guess \u2026",

          "One ticket, practically allowing acces to four different museums. The treasury, a small museum displaying Roman figures, the old royal chambers and a small museum telling about the history of the palace. Definitely worth the visit and the money.",

          "It was nice to simply walk around the vast grounds. You could pay for a tour if you were interested in touring the palace.",
          "Without any (audio) guide, it's boring to me, you only see expansive stuff, as always in castles. If you don't know anything about the history, it's only stupid walking and watching. Things like that are very subjective. The place itself is nice, the staff is very friendly.",
          "Amazing period displays. Just go early to make sure you get to see everything. They are strict about closing time. The inside looks much better than the outside.",
          "I want to say it's amazing, but it was just OK. I might have set my expectations too high, since prior to this I visited the Royal Palace in Vienna, Austria and that was amazing. So, the Royal Palace in Stockholm was big and was still being \u2026",

          "So much history, the acces is really quick. I enjoyed this visti.",
          "Nice place, but not very well organized. They have lots of different places to visit, different entrances, some on same ticket, some not. Royal apartments, state apartments, guest apartments, treasury, antiquities a.s.o. It drives you crazy \u2026",
          "The Royal Palace of Stockholm is being still used by the Royal Family. Located at the heart of the city, everything is close by, just walking distance. The parliament is at arms length distance. Must visit place while at Stockholm.",
          "Highly recommended. The ticket includes three museums. The actual castle is the main attraction. The museum shop is bit pricey but a good place to buy quality souvenirs. We didn't have audio guide and I think that could have been a good investment.",
          "Such a beautiful place. It has so much history and things to learn. There is no better place around to see a peice of swedish history.",

          "Very nice place especially in summer",
          "This place is definitely worth the entrance fee. I recommend coming earlier in the day and then watching the changing of the guards at noon. This royal palace is very fun to visit, because you get to see the boil apartments and they even \u2026",
          "I visited the palace and it is one of the smallest and poorest palace I have seen in Europe. It is true that Sweeden is not in the continental Europe and Swedish Kingdom has a shorter history of civilisation than Rome,Greece,Austria  or \u2026",
          "Very nice... and windy ;)",
          "Amazing place with a rich history",
          "Really beautiful palace. Disabled friendly. Managed to see all but a couple of rooms. Staff were exceptional. Only suggestion is that some of the rooms were rather dark and it was difficult for our visually impaired guest. Apparently you \u2026",
          "Interesting place to go.",
          "Great architecture and stunning interiors",
          "Interesting look at another Royal family and their lives.",
          "Its a pretty interesting experience to explore the various exhibits.  Highly suggest use one if the devices to hear the background in English or your langauage of choice.  That makes all the difference.  It was free at least in one of the exhibits.",
          "its nice to visit and spend some hours learning about Sweden history",
          "Well, not bad. But kinda underwhelming.",
          "Smaller than Buckingham palace hence quite cute. You will not finish the visit tired. incredible how much furniture there was",
          "A good place for tourist",
          "With one ticket, you can see four different sections, each has their own interesting aspects. Armory and some other parts are also free. However, start early if you want to see everything, it may take up to 3 hours to see all if you want to look into details.",
          "Very huge palace. Lots of work done all over. Must visit.",
          "Most parts were free to walk into and the gardens were well maintained...its huge..I am going to do it in parts",
          "It is an awesome place with so many good areas around it",
          "Nice walk with family and the kids.. don\u2019t forget to bring your jacket because I was always experienced the cold breeze everytime I went here. The view was amazing. No charge for entrance. You can go by the boat from central and stop here.",
          "As a real tourist \"must to visit\" I suggest to visit a tourist information on site to get the current schedule for guard change. Also take the opportunity to book a guided tour for the castle and/pr Livrustkammaren",
          "One of the most beautiful historical places, a quiet place, where you discover a lot of stories",
          "Excellent. You can walk  around the buildings, across the gardens and along the lake. You can also go into buildings. There are several good places to eat and drink. You can go on a boat to and fro from Stockholm.",
          "We hired a guide to take us into the Royal Palace and have a tour. It was a neat place to visit as it is still in use. We learned about the origins of the Royal Family (interesting story) as well as see the living quarters of the king and queen. It doesn\u2019t take long to see the whole palace.",
          "Our family loves to visit historical places all over the world. This castle is huge! The jewelry collections, the clothings, the ornaments in each and every room are gorgeous! Full of history.",

          "It is a nice place to visit, but I guess very few chambers and halls are openned. It looks huge at the outside, but not that much in the inside.",
          "Awesome place for tourists, especially to see Swedish architecture",
          "Beautiful castle. You can visit the archery and some of the official rooms that are still in use. If you're interested in swedish history and royals definitely a must see.",
          "Great and beautiful palace, I recommend this place",
          "One of the \"must sees\" in Stockholm. My key advice is get there early, 10.00am so you get see the lavishly furnished Royal apartments before the big groups of Chinese tourists arrive. The Royal Palace is like a collection of museums, but \u2026",
          "Wonderful. You must see.",

          "Noble museum. Palace. Most famous building of Stockholm. Continental food. Happening place and a must go.",
          "It was fun. Loved the room with many statues and the audio really helped understand everything well",
          "Nice place to visit not only the palace but also the treasury and armory. The palace opens many of its rooms for public. Unfortunately not all open rooms are open at all days and all times, especially the apartments closed sometimes without any information in advance.\nAudio guides are available in many different languages.",
          "Changing of the guards 12.15 Monday to Saturday and 1.15 on a Sunday.\nWith no historical significance it's just a great ceremony to watch! The band are fabulous!",
          "Beautiful architecture and the view from this area is stunning.",
          "Pretty interiors in the castle, a lot to learn about the royal family and the history of the castle. Plan at least 3-5 hours of you want to see the 4 exhibitions that are included in the day ticket ( cost 180 Sek in 2019)",

          "Very pretty and beautiful artwork",
          "Beautiful, must see when in Stockholm",

          "Very beautiful and not crowded at all when I went. It's definitely worth going to.",
          "Beautiful style.  It's located in the heart of Stockholm.  Has several stores and restaurants around so don't get shy. Go for it !",
          "I loved this place with my family and so beautiful weather if you are in September",
          "Such a beautiful location filled with amazing history. You don\u2019t have to go far back in time to find that this palace was involved in a lot of crazy things. Though the royal family don\u2019t personally live there anymore it still has a feeling of grandiose wonder. It\u2019s powerful, and inspiring.",
          "while you're walking around the islands you have to drop by and take a look at this palace. Absolutely worth a brief visit. I wouldn't plan on spending any more than 15 to 20 minutes maximum though.",
          "This is where the Swedish royal couple live. A nice castle with museums next to it. Also visit the Ole one Drottningholm if you like castles as that is Sweden answer to Versailles",
          "Very nicely kept and good instructions for tourists",
          "Wonderful attraction. Don't just go to the main courtyard, be sure to check out the others entrances as well, especially the ones that lead into the old part of town. Be sure to get there early if you're trying to see the changing of the guard, it gets packed quick. Small gift shop available as well with a nice selection.",
          "Amazing! An absolutely gorgeous place!  We took a guided tour and learned so much about the history of the Swedish monarchy. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and had the best sense of humor!\nWatching the changing of the Royal Guard was great!\nAn absolute must see if you're in Stockholm.",

          "It's beautiful, on the inside. Outside it looks like pretty much any other Swedish building, which are generally nice, but being the palace that it is, it's slightly bigger. When you go inside, if you get the chance, you're able to step \u2026",
          "Very good, excellent",
          "The Slot wasn't real nice to look at and pretty dark in most places. Also the prices are pretty high and i would prefer to visit another castle or palace in Stockholm.",
          "Stockholm castle is a very big building complex which includes the treasury, the apartments for both royal family and guests and the 'Tre Konor' museum. All of these can be visited by buying one museum ticket. \n\nMoreover, you can watch the \u2026",
          "Beautiful palace\nVery well maintained. A very nice recreation of that era. It's very surprising to know that bricks were a very expensive material then and most of the palace interior is made of brics. Changing of guards is a nice session to view",
          "Beautiful architecture and could see the change of guard.",
          "I didn't go inside, but was extraordinarily fortunate to arrive ten minutes before the Changing of the Guard began. I had a 'front row' view of 40 minutes of marching, mounted cavalry manoeuvres and horseguards playing a concert entirely on horseback. It was absolutely brilliant.",
          "A lot of interesting historical information",
          "Royal palace is beautiful. Outside the palace there's a lake that provides water for the city of Stockholm. In the palace we saw paintings of previous royals and learned about Swedish history.",
          "Nice palace to visit especially when you have bad weather - rain like we faced\ud83d\ude0a A single adult ticket of \u00a315 gives entry in Royal apartments, chapel, treasury,Tre Kronor Museum with free audio guide which beautifully describes the history of various Bernadotte kings.It has a nice cafe as well for coffee or tea with some cake.",
          "Nice and historic buildings",
          "A great place for history lovers.\none of the fascinating tourist desination in stolkholm gamla stan.",
          "Nice old palace can be visited from inside also on payment of some tickets",
          "Popular with the tourists. If u r lucky u can get to see the horse mounted guard canter by. It is right opposite the docking station for the Hop on Hop off boat tour",

          "Palatial..... if that's your jam. I like sparkly things so happy days!\n\nNo but seriously, it's a lovely palace that is still lived in, and considering that you can see quite a bit. If you have the time, head down to the cellars for dome medieval architecture and history.",
          "One of the best place to visit in Stockholm",
          "Clearly a must see when in Stockholm although not quite as grand as other European castles or palaces.",
          "One of the Nice places to visit",
          "Absolutely worth every penny we spent there. Very interesting and a mustsee in Stockholm",
          "It's a majestic and enormous place.... The architecture in rooms was marvelous and the structures remarkable.... The tour guide was nice but I believe that you can make the same tour on your own... Information were everywhere in the \u2026",
          "Infrastructure and interior design was awesome in palace..",
          "Guard change shows great ceremonial sense. The horse hand is awesome.",

          "Such an Amazing experience here.",
          "Very imposing, great location by the water, a need to see if you're in Stockholm for the 1st time I suppose, but wouldn't go back.",
          "It's a palace, simple as that. If you're not into royalty it's not that special. The building itself is nice to look at though.",
          "Fantastic place, recommend spending as much time as you can here...",
          "Small entry fee but worth paying to look around. Gives you access to crown jewels and historical artefacts as well as living quarters in the palace",
          "Wonderful place to see",
          "I like this old places make you feel better and more relaxed",
          "I just stood and watched the changing of the guard, about midday, I think. The band was very good. The guards were a bit silly, but that's all part of the deal!",
          "Very square and no garden around. Almost difficult to distinguish from the surrounding buildings. The guards are polite and answer question.",
          "Beautiful location on the outskirts of the old town in Stockholm. Time it right and you get to enjoy the ceremony of the change of the royal guard. Well worth checking the time for before you go. The museum in the basement of the castle is really nice with many historical artifacts from different royals.",
          "A beautiful palace, second largest palace in Europe counting the number of rooms, with a lot of history and a changing of the guard that has been running uninterrupted since 1522.\nWell worth the visit, not only for the changing of the \u2026",
          "Soo nice place..",
          "Very pompous and huge building",
          "This the historical palace of Stockholm. Most tourist attraction of the city.",
          "Quite interesting, but also quite small and still expensive. In comparison with other residence museums worldwide it falls behind.",
          "I was here 3 years ago too and its just as magnificent as it was. It can get very busy with tourists so expect a wait for the palace tour.",
          "Fantastic and clean place for tourists",
          "Very nice building",
          "Nice, but a built is just a building.",

          "Lovely buildings around stockholm and a beautiful city",
          "The french crepi covering the stonework spoils it for me. The pictures of the previous building were impressive. Pity that sfter the fire that it was not restored along those classical lines.",
          "Big!\nWorth a visit just to walk round the outside of the Palace if you haven't got time to go in. At night it is impressively illuminated. If you on one of the other islands the best way to get to it is to take one of the boat trips to the island that the Palace is located on.",
          "Place was good for taking photos in front if it",
          "Gorgeous! It took my breath away.",
          "Much to watch, historical stuff about the royal palace.",

          "Loved to be there! Hope to go there again!",
          "Another palace. Nice though.",
          "Great architecture, sumptuous buildings. A pleasure to walk around and taking photos.",
          "Good place to see to say you have done it and that's about it. The royal apartments were a bit of a let down, they were nice but there wasn't a lot to see. The royal guards were probably the highlight and they were free",
          "I mean it's a palace. It's got some fancy rooms you can visit and a couple museums along with the treasury all at a decent price of 180kr for adults and 90kr for 7-17 year olds. If you like looking at fancy things while also being slightly \u2026",
          "Although similar to many of the European palaces.... Highly recommended... Worth a visit with the combined ticket.",
          "Worth a visit around lunchtime when the guard changes.\nBetter when the band is accompanying the guard, adds to the ceremony.",
          "Brilliant ,visit the Vassa and ABBA museum next door,easy access by ferry ,get ticket at tram stop. Buy the others online to save Qs.\ud83d\ude0d",

          "Beautiful city with a nice people, worth to visit.",
          "We were only outside for the changing of the guard. Beautiful building, partly being renovated as we speak. The changing of the guard was quite long and maybe too informative, but on the other hand very interesting to see so many women and \u2026",
          "Very very interesting",
          "Amazing to step into a real life, active palace, to see how royalty lived here thrpugh the centuries.",

          "The history of Sweden's Royals, very interesting",
          "Serenity and historic vibe",
          "Probably the dullest and most uninteresting 'palace' in europe. And i've seen many. Time better spent elsewhere",
          "This is a very nice palace.  You are given the opportunity to walk through at your own pace and there is a lot to see.  Signs are in both swedish and English and there are audio guided tours as well.",
          "Absolutely fabulous. A history lesson in each room. Make sure you take the time to check it out.",
          "Lovely palace to walk around. I paid extra for a tour (but it wasn\u2019t necessary). I\u2019d recommend just exploring yourself.",
          "Nice and historical place to see",
          "Not as good as expected, however, still a lot of stories to dig out. About the royal family, the big fire and so on.",
          "Best Place ever.",
          "Nice palace. Bit too touristic for my taste",
          "It charges into different areas to visit,  confusing and expensive. Sections were closed off.so we just went to the *apartments. Was nice and excellent exhibt but much.more costly then other palaces i have seen in europe",
          "Beautiful interior designs",
          "It is a great experience to see their history. Was also amazed how they preserved all those things up to now. Every piece in the Royal Palace got a story to tell.\n\nIf you were to visit the Palace, i suggest to go somewhere 10am and wait for the exchanging of Royal Guards at 12 to 13:00. It is held in the main entrance",
          "Everything in this Hall is almost perfect. The staff was so good i went there more than 20 times and the staff behaviour was the very friendly i love the service and hospitality...",
          "One of the main attractions in Stockholm, dont miss the show! Google the times",

          "We were there on Swedens National Dax June 6. Watching the changing of the guards which was great and extremely impressive! The tour through the castle was great (and for free on this day, not sure if always). Definitely recommend the guards` change!",

          "If you've been to any palaces in France or England, I'd say skip this. It was interesting, but not worth the price imo. The crown jewels were cool, but there isn't much. There is a museum that explains the fire that destroyed the first \u2026",
          "Loved the royal apartments and treasury. The museum even has some interesting design and history. Absolutely worth the visit.",

          "Nice museum, not too expensive fee entrance (80kr),nice rooms but obviously, if you compared to French palaces and castles, it seems a bit light and plain. Other than that, the history behind the Palace still stays very interesting",
          "Probably the must, once in Stockholm. Very nice place, typical \"humble\" nordic style. Once you are spoilt by Italian or French architecture of Royal Palaces, you should expect something different, but positive.",

          "Completely gorgeous and ornate palace! Very massive! Loved it all!",
          "Such an amazing place. Requires good 3-4 hours if you'd like to visit everything ( there are 3 different parts of the palace which can be visited ) . And as a bonus -they offer student discount \ud83d\ude01",
          "Interesting place for the hostory buffs.",

        "wiki": "Skansen (Swedish: [\u02c8sk\u01cen\u02d0s\u025bn]; \"the Sconce\") is the first open-air museum and zoo in Sweden and is located on the island Djurg\u00e5rden in Stockholm, Sweden. It was opened on 11 October 1891 by Artur Hazelius (1833\u20131901) to show the way of life in the different parts of Sweden before the industrial era.\nThe name Skansen has also been used as a noun to refer to other open-air museums and collections of historic structures, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, but also in the United States, e.g. Old World Wisconsin and Fairplay, Colorado.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe 19th century was a period of great change throughout Europe, and Sweden was no exception. Its rural way of life was rapidly giving way to an industrialised society and many feared that the country's many traditional customs and occupations might be lost to history. Artur Hazelius, who had previously founded the Nordic Museum on the island of Djurg\u00e5rden near the centre of Stockholm, was inspired by the open-air museum, founded by King Oscar II in Kristiania in 1881, when he created his open-air museum on the hill that dominates the island. Skansen became the model for other early open-air museums in Scandinavia and later ones elsewhere.\nSkansen was originally a part of the Nordic Museum, but became an independent organisation in 1963. The objects within the Skansen buildings are still the property of the Nordic Museum.\nAfter extensive travelling, Hazelius bought around 150 houses from all over the country (as well as one structure from Telemark in Norway) and had them shipped piece by piece to the museum, where they were rebuilt to provide a unique picture of traditional Sweden. Only three of the buildings in the museum are not original, and were painstakingly copied from examples he had found. All of the buildings are open to visitors and show the full range of Swedish life from the Skogaholm Manor house built in 1680, to the 16th century \u00c4lvros farmhouses.\n\n\n== The open-air museum ==\nSkansen attracts more than 1.3 million visitors each year. The many exhibits over the 75 acre (300,000 m\u00b2) site include a full replica of an average 19th-century town, in which craftsmen in traditional dress such as tanners, shoemakers, silversmiths, bakers and glass-blowers demonstrate their skills in period surroundings. There is even a small patch growing tobacco used for the making of cigarettes. There is also an open-air zoo containing a wide range of Scandinavian animals including the bison, brown bear, moose, grey seal, lynx, otter, reindeer, wolf, and wolverine (as well as some non-Scandinavian animals because of their popularity). There are also farmsteads where rare breeds of farm animals can be seen.\nIn early December the site's central Bolln\u00e4s square is host to a popular Christmas market that has been held since 1903, attracting around 25,000 visitors each weekend. In the summer there are displays of folk dancing and concerts.\n\n\n== Funicular railway ==\nSince 1897, Skansen has been served by the Skansens Bergbana, a funicular railway on the northwest side of the Skansen hill. The funicular is 196.4 meters long, with a total rise of 34.57 meters.Skansen is also served by modern and vintage trams on line 7.\n\n\n== Keepers of Skansen ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCulture in Stockholm\nRoyal National City Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAndy Carvin's Skansen Gallery\nSkansen-akvariet\nPanoramic virtual tour of brown bear enclosure at Skansen\nThe Skansen Funicular Railway",

          "Out of all the places we visited, the Skansen open air museum was top choice by far looking back. A very unique museum, not stuffy or intimidating as others, spent hours here, but it was as lovely day, would not have been as great if it had been rainy.",
          "The open air museum is very very large so take your time to explore! We really loved our visit and seeing all the old buildings.Definately recommended!",
          "I always go to the Christmas Market. There is a lot of craft things and a lot of food things. Plenty of coffee and buns available. We got our gravlax and it was beautiful for the Swedish Christmas table. Best value had to be the Skansen 'lucky dip' for 100kr a 'present' -",
          "Be sure it is a nice day, as there is much walking around. Kids will love it. Saw my first reindeer here. Take the escalators up. Wonderful gift shop.",
          "I have really enjoyed my time at Skansen as I am passionate about Swedish culture and it helped me understand better their traditions. Visiting it in the winter did not bother me that much as I am a convinced lover of the winter time. They still had the Christmas decorations on",
          "It's amazing to me how so many of these historical places around the world tell a lot of the same stories - they're just set apart by time, location, architecture, or landscape. Walking through Skansen reminded me a lot of similar historical grounds around the United States.",

          "I was little bit sad to come here in winter time because in summer for sure it is more beautiful. But.. there was barely somebody. It is a nice picture of swedish tradition, history and nature. We spent there almost four hours! Highly recommended!",
          "A fantastic open air museum. Skansen has a bit of everything so the whole family can enjoy a day out here. We spent most of the afternoon enjoying the traditional houses, the blacksmith and traditional crafts as well as the children\u2019s petting zoo and play areas. I\u2019m pretty sure",
          "Went in winter so very cold. Think you should get half day price or some sort of discount as most of the animals were no where to be seen. Nice enough. Staff ok in the outside houses but rude on concession stand.",
          "I loved it there. I think in summer it will be a bit better, but the buildings, history and also the employees were very informative. Yo can spend around 2 hours there. It is a mix from zoo and \"theme park\".",
          "Great place to visit when in Stockholm regardless of the weather, a lot to see and do, great little food stalls and experiences",
          "We visited during winter, when many of the workshops were closed. However, the introductory talk for the reindeer and the playful lynx family was very rewarding! A great experience with a nice environmental awarness touch in the Baltic science centre. I would highly recommend",
          "Even though the weather was miserable, this was an excellent visit. For a visitor to Sweden, see some northern hemisphere animals, like moose and reindeer, up close. Learn about Swedish life through the ages. Interactive and informative for all ages",
          "Much hyped in the reviews but most things closed in winter(even the bears were hibernating) and still pay the same entrance fee. Enjoyed the exterior architecture and absence of crowds. Overall would not recommend a winter visit",
          "Skansen has existed all my life, but never visited before. Our trip took place in January so not much going on in there. We saw wolfs, monkeys, seals and such but most of the cafes and restaurants and some attractions were closed. Pretty sure the place is much more lively in the",

          "It's kind of a park mixed with zoo. A great experience, although options for eating could be improved, since it's a trip for some hours, like an entire afternoon for example. Highly recommend for nature lovers!",
          "I have travelled a lot, and this was by far the worst tourist attraction/activity I have ever done. Almost everything was closed, it could have been marketed as an abandoned town/theme park, which might have made it more interesting. It doesn\u2019t fulfil its purpose as an open air",
          "Me and my boyfriend visited to see the animals specifically - we loved it!! They all looked happy and cared for and the place had loads of interesting species! Note - you have to pay extra to go visit all the reptiles and monkeys but it\u2019s worth it\u263a\ufe0f",

          "We loved Skansen! It's a marvelous open-air museum and cultural center in Stockholm and doubles as a world-class zoo. The center was founded in 1891 on the island of Djurg\u00e5r\u00adden.

A lot of areas were closed off and not many people around in traditional costumes as it says are generally the case. We did visit in the afternoon and it does get dark early but",

          "It was an interesting visit. The place was well kept, the island was enormous so when you want to come, it needs to definitely be the only thing you plan to do that day and not on winter where most of the animals are hibernating. Lots of modest stall around but only 2 were open",
          "Okey first is first when is best time to visit Skansen, I would say May-August. Next: Be prepare to spend more than one full day here. There is a special zoo for children and the rest of the zoo is a great opportunity to se wildlife in the Nordic countries, Reindeer, Elk, Seal",
          "I took my extended family to visit here for the Christmas Market. It was wonderful, the cakes (Bulle) and coffee were excellent. We loved the free entertainment that was put on, including the reindeer talk by the keeper in English (see the website for what is on when) Highly",

          "Went at the weekend as we wanted to visit the Christmas Market. We weren't disappointed! Best to arrive early as it did get busy, but lovely stores with interesting crafts and good food, lots of samples available. Not too expensive either. Also enjoyed the normal exhibits",

          "The Christmas market was a nice touch. We really came to see the nordic animals. But the scenery was beautiful with the snow. We loved the wolves. The bears were not on display because they were in hibernation. I would recommend visiting the aquarium to see some exotic animals",
          "we went too late, didn't realise it closed at 4pm. Its a huge area of Sweden as it used to be in the 1700-1900's. Beautiful buildings, lots to see, people in traditional dress. Definitely worth a visit. Hosts Christmas markets on weekends in December, crafts and homemade",
          "Skansen open air museum got a star in Lonely planet. I think it is not at its best in December - we went for the Christmas market which was very good - but the short day and the dull weather made the appearance of the open air museum rather dispiriting. The bears were",
          "This island escape in Stockholm is worth a day. We took a ferry from Gamla Stan, and enjoyed perfect weather as we wandered this outdoor cultural treasure. Animals native to this area live in their natural environment. And there are many demonstrations of Swedish farm life.",
          "Plenty to take in from historical buidings, plants or animals. Learn of life in Scandinavia. See history as you walk around or go see the animals. Wild or domestic. There is plenty to do as old or young. Petting zoo, riding, See how glas is made, or how people looked and",

          "Skansen is AmAzing! I have never experienced something like that! It is a well organized open air museum, with a lot of things to see. There are old Swedish houses, schools, farms, then a great zoo, baltic sea museum, aquarium etc. Of course, you can find good food and excellent",

          "The place is very pretty but looks terribly sad with grey sky. We were there at the end of November, most of the animals were missing, and the price of the tickets seems very expensive looking at what we were able to see.",
          "Definitely worth a visit! Plenty of things to see and lovely animals around. We went in a rainy day, but it was still beautiful, in fact it was one of our favourite places from our visit to Stockholm.",
          "Absolutely recommend this for anyone that wants to know more about Swedish history or architecture, or just wants to have a nice walk. Very informative, and you can absolutely find something for all age ranges here. The day we visited was very windy and cold, so we didn't stay",
          "With limited daylight and limited hours in November, Skansen was nevertheless a great experience. We were told at the beginning which areas were \"open\" but in fact all of it was open as far as we could tell. The \"open\" areas were the ones with period correct persons that you",
          "This is a large reserve, and to see it all will take a few hours and sensible shoes! There are several opportunities to sit, have coffee or a meal, so plan on a half day out to get around all the exhibits. Wonderful to see big animals, seemingly unstressed, in a relatively",
          "We enjoyed exploring Skansen, and would have spent more time there if the weather had been better. It was cold and damp, and some of the food vendors seemed to be closed, maybe because of the season and lower demand. It would certainly be lovely in warmer weather. There were",
          "Trying all the old style bakes and cracker breads was amazing, The local wild life was also good to see.",
          "This is a really nice park to spend one day, especially if you have children (but not only for them!) It has lots of traditional houses and buildings, animals, views of the city... go with enough time to explore everything!",
          "Went up there to see what they can offer, I think the best time to visit this place is during summer time. We didn\u2019t stay long & explore the whole place because it started raining but the place was packed with children. The place is huge & full of history info and fun things for",
          "We went there with 7 and 11 years old children. I was thinking that they would be bored there, but in fact there was a lot of things to do and we had a lot of fun walking around. You can spend there easily half day, maybe even full day with family.",
          "My wife and I had visited Stockholm a few times before but were not really aware of Skansen, which was the world's first open-air museum dating back to 1891. The site is a wonderful mix of historical buildings, shops, staff dressed in period costumes, a zoo featuring Nordic",
          "Just love Skansen, for kids and for adults. Sometimes I forget that it is worth visiting even during the low season, this time (end of October) it was raining and it was cold but still lovely to be in this beautiful surrounding. A lot to see, a lot to do and a lot to learn!",
          "This open air museum, which brings Swedish history to life, is a must for any visitor to the Swedish capital. Ranging from real life cottages that were painstakingly brought from their original location to this open air museum, to a zoo of Nordic animals, there is plenty at",
          "Skansen is fab! Take the funicular to the top and work your way down, but make sure you take in the old cholera town. A really stunning place right in the heart of the city",
          "Recently visited with my 5 year old daughter. The museum was interesting, very clean and well kept. The small zoo was the best part and we enjoyed cooking sausages over open fire in the town square.",
          "We went there with teenagers - it was nice to walk outside, but would recommend it more for younger children. It was also very crowdy - we had a feeling every kindergarden in Stockholm was there. Otherwise, nice.",
          "The park is quite interesting with various experiences from local houses, a zoo, markets and shows. It definitely does not have the Disneyland magic but is a great way to spend the day as a family. The yearly pass is a great deal as there are many changes in the park along the",
          "Amazing time, deep into the ancient Sweden culture. For all ages. Nordic animals are presented, kept in better conditions than zoos (big cages). Really good and unusual activity and memory",
          "The entrance fee for the museum costs 170 Sek, and if you want to see the Aquarium is an additional 120 Sek. But if you have the Stockholm pass, it is for free. I love wandering around the museum, and they have a good bakery inside selling fresh bread. You can even take a look",
          "Skansen is definitely well worth the visit - part aquarium, part open zoo, part history, part nature, part anthropology - full on wholesome fun and educational for the whole family. Be wowed, humbled, inspired and amazed at how far Sweden\u2019s come. Definitely one of the highlights",
          "This is by far the must visit museum on top of the list, it is highly impressive and gives you the best insight on Swedish history and culture. It is also a good opportunity to travel by ferry, which takes a mere 6 minutes to reach via 82 commuter ferry. A word or notice, give",
          "As a 30-year old female, I loved it here on my trip to Stockholm. So many fun/different experiences & a lot to photograph. It's a great place for nature, see animals & to get an idea of the historical Swedish culture. I visited Grona Lund to ride rollercoasters, the aquarium,",
          "We visited here on a short timetable at the end of September on a rainy day. What a shame. There was a lot to see and we just saw bits and pieces before we had to grab lunch and leave. We had to get the bus and leave Stockholm by Ferry. If I had my way, I would have taken the",
          "We visited here in early May on a sunny day, best to visit in nice weather as this is truly an out door museum.. Buildings from all over Sweden have been brought to this museum to show the history of how people lived in the country side. You learn a lot about how challenging",
          "The day e had set aside to spend at the old village and zoo area of Skansen we had steady rain. We still enjoyed the old village area quite a bit and loved getting out to the animal park. This is a very lovely wildlife park with well kept natural areas for the native species. We",

          "Make sure you go into the entrance near the tram stop - if you go in the one that Google Maps guides you to if you're walking from the Vasa Musuem you'll have to either make a steep climb or pay for a funicular, and you'll start in the animals section that's open until quite",

          "This place is spectacular. So many beautiful well cared for animals! We had the best meal ever in a small cafe right next to the old pharmacy. We came upon it by accident. It looked like an antique store and everyone was so friendly. It was slightly rainy when we were",

          "The Skansen museum is a large outdoor complex of historic buildings and farms collected from whole Sweden. While we visited in October there might be less indoor demonstrations of crafts etc., we could get a good impression about living in Sweden in former times, and also had",
          "Whether you wish to just stroll or check out the wide variety, this place is super. For families with small children needing naps during the day, you can stroll slowly and just take in the scenery. The amusement park bit was being renovated when we were there so couldn't check",
          "We went there in September, weather was great, th eplace was quite empty, so we did not queue at all, being an international traveller and just speaking English , Skansen was a great place to learn about Sweden its culture, its past, its different areas, indigenous people,",
          "Really interesting place - but sadly quite a lot of the buildings closed in off season. Considering the huge range of old buildings I\u2019m surprised more couldn\u2019t be opened - even if just with doors open but barriered off. The ones that were open were fascinating and the guides",
          "There are little shops with storekeepers in period costume, little old farmhouses with costumed guides to tell you story of the farm and the people who lived there, windmills, a church, an aquarium and zoo...just lots of things to see and do here. Great place for children and",
          "We visited last week. We really enjoyed walking around Skansen. There is a lot to see and do, ranging from Swedish traditional houses to Nordic animals and an aquarium! Skansen also offers impeccable views. Definitely worth visiting if you\u2019re traveling to Stockholm. We had so",
          "The journey through time, places, the people, native animals, and history was truly hands on. Walking amongst the farmsteads, stores, school, windmills, manors, Saami exhibit, etc enabled me to realize how people lived long ago in Sweden. It was a truly real experience. Must",
          "Hard to describe Skansen. It is so much. We saw about half but visited the old town and animals plus the crafts. Easily accessible and delightful",
          "Visited skansen with my partner she was interested in the buildings and I was interested in the animals and old trades, skansen had heaps for both of us we spent about 2 hours wondering around and really enjoyed it. I would recommend checking it out",
          "We spent about 2 hours visiting the buildings that were open (not all were because it was a weekday after the main tourist season). Each building has a docent who is very happy to provide information about the building and answer questions. There is a good variety of buildings",
          "Discover how people used to live in the old days, especially in the countryside. See the old houses and interiors from different regions of Sweden. Livened up by actors in period clothing who tell interesting stories. There are also demonstrations of old crafts, such as glass",

          "We took the ferry to this island from Gamla Stan, and spent half a day here. Skansen is on the island of Djurgarden, which besides the open-air museum and zoo, has the additional sites of Vasa Museum, plus open-air restaurants, bars, and kayak/bike rentals. Trails in Skansen",
          "This is my second trip, and I was in a wheelchair due to hip problems. At 1 point the path dead ended, and I had to climb at least 25 stairs! Skansen needs better wheelchair access and better signage. There was a fall festival that weekend, with old fashioned foods and costumed",
          "Nice scenic place that is best enjoyed in good weather. We had nice sunshine and 10degrees C first of October. The houses that were open were exciting to go into, and the guides were very knowledgeable, helpful and nice.",
          "A nice opportunity to go for a stroll and view some Nordic animals. Perfect timing to see the bears before they go to hibernate. We used the Stockholm pass to get in and also used it for the African animal component of the zoo. Many activities/stores were closed but the last",
          "In fairness, we went on a Monday the second day of September which I am sure is not their peak season. But it seemed to us like most of the stuff was closed. The town square looks like it has about 40-50 booths available and less than 10 were open. Many of the places that",
          "Skansen is an interesting property that includes a collection of buildings in which artisans demonstrate crafts like glassblowing and pottery making, as well as a zoo, an aquarium, shops and food. The day we went was sunny but a little chilly. I think Skansen would be more fun",

          "We visited for the day whilst in Stockholm as a group of six, four adults and two children. As ever, Skansen fails to disappoint is and there is something for every age to enjoy. Our particular favourites are the wolves, the brown bears and the moose but also the opportunity to",
          "I went here mid-September. I discovered that, although advertised as open \"year round,\" only about 1/3 of the place is \"open\". Very few homes open, very few craftspeople showing off their trades, very few food vendors open. (That being said, the place I did go to eat -",
          "Took a trip across there for some fresh air and I wanted to see the bear. I liked the conditions they were in, large area, nicely set out and some interesting approaches for giving food. Moose was also a nice sight, the pigs. Food was plentiful and interesting and since it was",

          "This is a good attraction and makes for a pleasant walk around the extensive grounds. I'd been some years back in June, when there was much more on offer by way of 'open' indoor exhibits. This time many of these were locked and unavailable, which was disappointing. Those we",
          "We had a really great time exploring this park! It's perfect for all ages, at every step there is something new and interesting to discover! In some houses there are people with traditional clothes doing day to day things the old fashion way (like ironing), there are also farm",

          "We had beautiful weather and headed to Skansen early. Easy and quick ride on the tram. Most of the exhibits don\u2019t open till 10am but it was nice being in the fresh air. Nice gardens, easy walk ways. Entertaining local bans playing in the center, lots of choices for food.",
          "This was our second time here and one of the reasons we came early to Stockholm before our cruise. Weather was exceptionally warm, and crowd was small--so we could see as much as we wanted at our own pace. Lots of interpreters around ready to answer your questions ( in little",
          "Skansen is a theme-less theme park. There is something for everyone. We were there on a beautiful sunny day and there were many locals there, many with children of all ages. There\u2019s a zoo, an aquarium, and rides. What attracted us was the outdoor museum of Sweden in past",
          "We visited Skansen because the living history aspect of it appealed to us. We saw buildings from various eras of Sweden's history, and we loved the wildlife area. The windmills and the recreated village near the entrance were also very interesting. We never did find the glass",
          "A very good way to spend a nice weather day. It was interesting to see the older buildings and what life would have been like before the industrial revolution changed things.",
          "When we entered skansen we had the option of going up by a light railway which was a nice touch. Skansen has mixture of different types of historical buildings such as farmhouses, grocery stores, schools, pharmacies, bakeries and workshops. Many of the buildings had guides",
          "We visited in late March and there was still some ice in the animal enclosures; not all of the buildings were open. The park itself is beautiful with a lot of workshops making traditional goods. There was only a guide in one of the buildings and she was very informative, but it",

          "We visited on 6 September and enjoyed our visit but it is artificial compared to the quality of other choices in and around Stockholm. It is worth allocating some time to if you would like to get a sense of what Sweden\u2019s history was like but it is still somewhat artificial. For",

          "Enjoyed seeing this open air musuem. They did a great job of portraying life in Sweden in the old days. Very impressive that some of the buildings have been moved from various parts of Sweden. We loved seeing the traditional Swedish architecture. It's a great spot for families,",
          "We visited this right after the Vasa museum. This place reminded us of Bokrijk in Belgium. We had a lot of fun and really enjoyed all the animals. It was definitely better than a regular zoo and I had the feeling they paid a lot of attention to the living conditions of the",

          "My first time to an open air museum and did not know what to expect. For me it is like a theme park but instead of rides, you get to see old buildings (most moved from other parts of the country) showcasing how people used to live. There is a working bakery where people are",

          "I was intrigued that in the late 1800's someone thought to create an open air museum to showcase how people lived in the past. The staff who are dressed up in costume and can talk at length about their 'jobs' and what their lives would have been like brings the place to life.",
          "Good day out at skansen. A funny mix of things to see there with the aquarium, zoo and traditional town and houses. It was well done though and very interesting. The glass maker was very expensive though.",

          "This is more of a children\u2019s activity park than a living museum. Really disappointed to see seals in such a tiny pond that is nothing like their natural environment. The animal welfare is questionable. The Elk are kept in a tiny enclosure too and are unable to roam naturally.",
          "Skansen is a great outdoor museum but do not go on Midsummer holiday. It was way too crowded. You could not see the midsummer dance/raising the pole etc. unless you camped out in one spot very early in the day and just waited. Go another time!",
          "Nice place If you have young kids, go If the weather is nice, run This place shall be more alive with more people explaining and showing how live was. Indeed , if you compare to other similar place (Canada Upper Village), this place needs some improvements",
          "I have visited Skansen in winter, at Christmas last year and now in summer. This is a delightful venue for all ages, but I went with my 2 year old granddaughter and she loved every minute of it. We walked through the outside area and saw the animals. There are a variety of rides",
          "Great open air museum on island of Djugarden. Focusing on Swedish life before the industrial age, there are historic buildings from all over Sweden. We had a lovely afternoon strolling amongst the buildings and learning about several centuries of Swedish history and rural",
          "This place peeps into the swedish culture. How people lived, Their farms, Clothes etc. it is a lovely open museum with a nice walk. Perfect activity on a good summer day. Kids can also play and run around freely. The nordic animals are fun to watch.",
          "Beautiful location. Easy to reach. Friendly staff. If you want to spent the day away from busy downtown area, this is the place to be.",
          "We enjoyed Skansen, but it was not exactly what we expected. It\u2019s almost more like Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, than many of the other European open-air museums we\u2019ve visited. For example, there is basically a large food - craft court in the middle, many of the interesting old buildings",
          "This is a highly promoted attraction for the young and old in Stockholm and to be honest, after spending 3-4 hours there I struggle to see why. Yes, it is somewhat interesting to see some of the Swedish workshops/houses/farmsteds in action. But, emphasis here is on the 'some'.",
          "Expect to spend all day here if you want to do it justice. The whole place is super, though some bits aren\u2019t very accessible for buggies or wheelchairs (cobbles are very unforgiving). My only complaint was the very overpriced main restaurant which served very naff food.",
          "Skansen is something special. It doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in the center of Stockholm. It feels like you have been lifted to another time. It is beautiful here. The buildings are interesting and the animals are incredible. You can easily get lost here for hours. The one",
          "Our \"kid\" being a grown up, we were above all interested in the history of Swedish architecture and Skansen is a nice way to explore that. We were quite puzzled though to be asked for an additional payment right after we had bought the (rather expensive) entrance tickets to the",
          "This is an amazing place and is covered well by the other reviews. However, I think it needs better food options. Some of the food stalls aren't bad but the sit down restaurants aren't great.",
          "I absolutely loved Skansen! Seeing real Swedish homes/homesteads and schools, etc that they brought in from all over Sweden...you can't get more authentic than that. The workers are dressed in period clothing. Such a treasure in teaching how Sweden was over the years. Lots of",
          "In this parc, you can see animals that are typically found in Sweden (elks, reindeers, wolves, wildcats...) and others such as crocodiles, piranhas, pigs etc., as well as small houses that you can visit and where you can see how Swedes lived before. People are inside (dressed as",
          "Very well done. We took the role of gardeners but learned a lot about how the manor house worked. Great performances from the two guys who did us. But where was the baroness?",
          "We arrived through the \"Bergbanan\" entrance, which is a tram taking you up to the very top of Skansen (for additional SEK 30.00) Prepare to be here for several hours. Lots of walking, and much to see. Like many wild (?) animals as wolves, bears, lynx, moose etc. And you really",
          "A lovely outdoor museum which showed buildings from Sweden\u2019s past, contained an aquarium, had traditional shops, a little zoo and lots of gorgeous walks. Great views from the top of the hill and a house with chicken legs!",
          "Quite ok, but could be so much more fun! The animals were hard to find, there was very little inter-activity. Most activities seemed to belong in the mid 1950\u2019s. Our two year old grandson was happy - but that doesn\u2019t take much.",
          "Had a lovely morning wandering the site. Mixed in with the history are plenty of animals and food. The aquarium is worth a vIsit too.",
          "Go there with kids and enjoy. Make sure to catch the train up which starts at a side entrance. Lots of things to discover, so tale your time.",
          "Do not miss the rhubarb dessert at Oppet inside Skansen. Plan to spend at least half a day or longer here. There is so much to see and do. I wish we had more time to explore.",
          "We enjoyed our day at Skansen immensely. While the other attractions in Stockholm were stuffed with other tourists and somewhat stressful, Skansen was peaceful, relaxing, and informal. There were lots of buildings to walk around and see, and while not all were open, there was",
          "We spent some hours there, exhibitions from all over sweden placed in a nice maintained park. Animals, huts and houses, everything with its background and origin explained. On a centrals quare affordable food of good quality.",
          "Beautiful nature, buildings, animals, aquariums. A lot of people during the summer season, though...",
          "We are a family of three and very looking forward to our visit to Sweden and being history buffs, a visit to a live open air museum was on the plans. The park is beautiful but there is lack of staff \u201ctelling the story\u201d and some of the buildings were in disrepair and the few",
          "We are confused as to why Skansen seems to have so many negative reviews, we thought it was great. The buildings are very impressive, especially when you consider how old they are and how far they have been transported. We visited on a rainy weekday in June and most of the",
          "Skansen is billed as an outdoor museum, with historical structures from the 16th thru 20th centuries offering a taste of what life was like in Sweden over the years. Unfortunately, there were comparatively few people in period costume during our visit, so the bulk of vignettes",
          "I was very excited to visit Skansen having heard that this is a must do. We attended in the summer on a beautiful day but there really wasn't much to do. I thought that it would be more educational and interactive but it seems that you just walk around some nice wood buildings",
          "Despite going on a rainy day, we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. In our opinion the animals were the highlights of our time here, especially the bears. However, the cultural areas were also really interesting. We even saw an area where elderly visitors could dance with their",
          "Although there was nothing offensive - indeed it was nicely presented, clean and meticulously set out - there was very little to inspire in an attraction which seemed to cater to very little. The \u2018zoo\u2019 part was nice; but a lynx,bison,warthog, wolf and pigs does not a zoo make.",
          "We had a 9 year old and a 90 year old. Both really enjoyed it probably for different reasons. However, you get a real workout pushing a wheelchair. Had we read previous reviews we would go to the funicular entrance but we were in a cab and the driver didnt know the place.",
          "It has been going in since 1935 or something during the summer months. Swedes meeting up at Skansen singing classical songs combined with live artists. Good fun. Skansen in itself is a mere monument and a must see when in Stockholm",
          "Loved this. Lots of walking. Allow half a day. Wolves. Bears. Moose. Great views of Stockholm too. Also an aquarium",
          "Spent a great day in the sun / rain here. Plenty to do, with properties from many eras from Vikings to 1950s. The actors in some houses were happy to explain about the houses and the lifestyle of each time. Artisan workshops showcase skills long forgotten to most people. Its a",
          "Skansen has a lot to offer - a glimpse of how life in Sweden used to be, local treats, an aquarium and several domestic and wild animals to see. We really enjoyed it here. Make sure to visit early because many of the attractions close at 17:00. We had been told that it only",
          "Accept that not all buildings are open every day nor all day, nor are all staffed all the time. When a building is open, go in and talk with the people there. They are a rich source of information and make the day worthwhile.",
          "We were in Stockholm for Midsommar and came to Skansen on that Saturday. What a lovely day! They had a giant Maypole, and costumed dancers paraded to the pole and encouraged everyone to dance with them as a traditional band played. The singer called out instruction in Swedish",
          "This is a must-go if you are in Stockholm and love to see animals. I think I had an lucky day because most of the animals were not hiding/sleeping and just walking around and enjoying their time. Most of the information boards are in swedish and english. I would recommend",
          "This is something what you need to see, every Tuesday in summertime, full on happy people and really nice guest, everybody sign together and have great party, suits for hole family!",
          "It felt like Skansen was trying to be a museum, a zoo, and a theme park all in one. Lots of interesting things to see and do, but a lot of kind of cheesy things as well. Sometimes the maps/signs weren't all that helpful, so we probably did extra wandering. But it was fun, lots",
          "There\u2019s lots to do at Skansen, & I would definitely recommend it for families. The kids (aged three & six) loved the animals, especially the bears, & the playground, although we didn\u2019t bother paying the extra fee for the aquarium. The houses are pretty, although we only saw a",
          "I highly recommend a visit to Skansen. It is a wonderful outdoor folk museum and we all enjoyed our visit there. I recommend arriving earlier if you can. We loved the different buildings and speaking with the helpful staff who were in each space about history, they were all",
          "I enjoyed walking around the historical farm buildings, shops, school and residences brought from all over Sweden. Liked seeing the reindeer, moose, wolf and bears. We arrived about 4, told it was open till 8 but not told all the vendors and docents left between 5 and 6.",
          "It was all about the moose - visitors from Singapore and we had to take them here to see the moose. But Skansen has so much more and a beautiful wander in a summer sun was fantastic. The villages, the gardens and the old buildings are a joy to see. We had a great couple of hours",
          "Historic as well as in the moment, informative, relaxing and truly unique theme park in the heart of Stockholm. The new Baltic Sea Aquarium is important and gives good input to the climate issue with focus on the Baltic Sea. The rest of the park gives you everything from",
          "Visited Skansen in July 2019. This is an outdoor museum that showcases traditional Swedish culture. If you have plenty of time in Stockholm, this is a nice to go place. But if your time is limited, don\u2019t feel bad to skip.",
          "The houses and farms were interesting to see. The animal area showed Nordic animals - not sure it is ethical to have animals in this sort of area, but the children loved seeing them. The views of Stockholm was great.",
          "I think if you are visiting Stockholm with small children this would be a good way to relax and spend some time. But for a 3 - 4 day visit, there are better ways to spend the time.",
          "Having visited the Beamish museum in the U.K. we had high hopes but they weren't realised I'm afraid. Many buildings weren't accessible. Navigating around the site was not easy (that is a basic requirement) I was made aware by the CEO of a major visitor attraction in the U.K.",
          "We hadn't planned to go here but found ourselves with some time to kill after visiting Vasa. Firstly it's expensive! Unless you are super interested in historic Swedish buildings which have been moved here from round the country, then this is probably not for you. Also each",
          "There didn't seem to be much going on. It was hard to find anyone to provide information. The layout was disorganized and it was difficult to get around. We visited a section with some old houses and establishments that were more focused on selling things than on sharing",
          "We visited in early June and were disappointed that we paid full price when only a quarter of the buildings were open and had docents in them. Those that were staffed were interesting. The animals were good to see, but this was a disappointment mostly due to minimal",
          "Wonderful scenery and a great display of swedish history and culture. This alongside the possibility to see nordic animals such as wolves and bears make Skansen a given spot as one of my top spots in Stockholm. If you visit during july or early august try to make it there on a",
          "A good summary of the Swedish country life. With some extra attractions such as Ape-house and the terrarium. Very suitable if you have small children in your company.",
          "if you want to know what Sweden is, whether in terms of natural scenery, history and architecture, but also the typical Nordic animal species, and you do not have days, but only hours, visiting the Open Air Museum is a great idea where these attractions are collected for you a",
          "Not sure how to describe thus. Its a mix between a theme park, zoo and cultural park. Swedes love it, we were perplexed. If you are visiting with kids it could be worth a visit. The nordic animals felt reminiscent of Zoos in the 1980s. Small enclosures very little info no",
          "We had a great time looking at all of the historic buildings, a real look at history. The animals were fun to watch, the moose were great. I had to go all the way to Sweden to see a moose. The baby goats were a blast to watch. This is a great visit for d Families and adults.",
          "What a depressing sad open air so called living museum. Some broken down buildings staff by a few disinterested staff. Poor aquarium. Really not a place to visit.",
          "Enjoyed our afternoon there. We skipped the zoo and could not find the entrance to go down the incline. Food was fine especially the pastries. Nice crafts. Attendants were very pleasant and helpful. Easy to get to on the bus. Would go again.",
          "Hard to describe this place. Part historical and part mini zoo. We have kids ages 10 and 13 and they were pretty bored. It was nice to walk around for an hour or so but definitely not a place you could spend all day unless you have very young children or you are really",
          "Great place to experience a traditional Midsommar festival and learn about life in Sweden in the past!",
          "The buildings in Skansen were very cool to look at, but none of them were open and no one was around to tell us about them so it was mostly just walking around outside. One building did have staff inside but they weren't willing to talk to us. There is a lot of walking and a lot",
          "Historic buildings of old Stockholm, people dressed in period clothing and doing period work (blacksmiths, bakers, et al). Great place to spend a few hours strolling the grounds and exploring the various buildings while experiencing the history of the city.",
          "This \u201cpark\u201d is an experience that has it all for those who desire to delve into the history, culture, Nordic animals, entertainment and great food. One can spend at least three hours to tour the complex. It also caters to young children with a petting zoo and an amusement park",
          "As a former director of education and interpretation at a U.S. living history museum, I had to visit Skansen when I was in Stockholm. This is a place that can be interesting to children, and there were many school groups there when I was there. Skansen attracts 1.5 million",
          "Spent the day walking around with my adult kids and two small grandchildren. It was not too crowded on a Thursday but some of the public areas ( bathrooms and food seating areas) were not as clean as they should be. Seemed that a a fair number of animals were not in the",
          "We had heard good things about Skansen, but the whole place needs sorting out. Very tatty in places with uncleared litter. Not what you would expect in Sweden. Reconstructed regional houses, but hardly any of them open. We found just one with a traditionally dressed young lady",
          "the world's first open-air museum since 1891....a place you can enjoy relaxing strolls dwelling into history. five centuries of swedish history from north to south has been presented with real people wearing actual traditional attires portraying various characters presenting the",
          "It was a great place to stroll and the living museum with 'characters' playing the part are really interesting. Places to picnic and the little funiculaire ride make it a fun place to hang out.",
          "This place is a mixed bah as some parts of it are great... You might get to see some folk dances and exquisite glassware being made in the old town area but the zoo is a huge disappointment. The animal enclosures are bare. None exist there.",
          "A great family attraction and also for anyone interested in Swedish history,shows the the country and the city and all forms of life during the centuries Zoo plus many and varied attractions A pleasant and ordered outing Lots to see and do",
          "We arrived about an hour after it opened and most of the homes, etc. were not even opened. The zoo is ok but some of the animals look a little neglected. It would be fun for little kids but my 14 year old thought it was a little boring. I feel like there are better things to",
          "This is a large outdoor open air museum..that is how it is described. It's part zoo, part historic recreation of an old Swedish town. The moose looked very sad and since we visited on midsummer, it was beyond crowded. Might be fun for family with small children on a less crowded",
          "To Pre-teens and a baby. Costly Day for parents. One have to pay extra for everything, but the young ones loved it.",
          "i was skeptical about the museum before the visit, but is is really well done, kids get to get close the the animals and the history. Will come back again after my kids are a little older to get the whole experience.",
          "This place is a cross between a zoo, a historical museum, and a time machine. The visit is exactly what you make if it. We really enjoyed seeing the Nordic animal display and watching glass art being made.",
          "The day was lovely and the park delightful. Until we came across the bigger animals & sea creatures in such small enclosures. That was a bit of a shock. I really did not expect to see this. How sad. I dont think I would have gone if I had known this. It is a shame,it ruined",
          "Go walk around and see the Nordic structures and go visit the Nordic animals. This is a wonderful place to spend a couple of hours with families. Plenty of places to eat or get ice cream. Ride the funicular and enjoy the view!",
          "We arrived at the perfect time of year. The Celebration was amazing. Glad I got to experience the portion of the culture. A great location to visit. Worth the trip",
          "Our Globus tour happened to be in town for the perfect way to celebrate Midsummer Night at Skansen! We arrived early to see the animals and visit the inside of the beautiful old church. . . The maypole dancing was everything our guide had described and more! So fun to see all of",
          "The best out of the 3 Scandinavian folk museums I visited. So large with many different eras of buildings Great for children with lots of places for them to run off too. The animals had decent areas. Cute cafes",
          "This place is an open air museum. There are so many different animals that you don\u2019t know where to look first. The wildlife section together with the aquarium completes the tour. You should consider spending at least 3 to 4 hours at this museum.",
          "Part of the open exibition that features human life in and around Stockholm through few last centuries is really interesting. You can see houses in original/restored state from farm workers from 18th century through the farm owners to the apartments or houses of city dwellers od",
          "Me and my 21-yr old daughter went expecting to see all we wanted in just a couple of hours, thinking it would be mostly geared towards kids. We were wrong! It was worth spending most of a day there. It has something for everyone. There is a wildlife center that costs extra, but",
          "If you're looking for a sense of Sweden, yesterday and today, Skansen is a unique and enlightening place to find it. Plus--if you'r looking for Swedish gifts, there is no better place than the Skansen Store to find them!",
          "The entrance fee is only to enter the city park. But them you need to pay extra for the tropical animal zoo. The two fees add up a lot but it is worth to walk \u0131n between monkeys and lemurs without any barriers and your children can pet a tarantula and a live snake There are nice",
          "We went there to see the traditional houses and some animals. I've enoyed a lot that employees of the museum were dressed with traditional clothing and told us interesting facts about people's life in the past. The are also several houses showing different crafts. Definitely",
          "One of the best attractions in Stockholm. We were delighted to be there. The place is amazing. Every detail is perfectly placed. If you are visiting Stockholm, definitely reserve one day for Skansen.",
          "Skansen was not what I expected. I was expecting a typical zoo but it was far more than that. Although there may not have been as many animals as a normal zoo or any safari trips, Skansen was full of old traditional Swedish buildings. From Churches to Schools, to Houses. There",
          "The place is nice but I did not understand what it is. It's a mix between some revival of Norway old traditions, displays of old homes & farms, but also a zoo ... So it's multi-faceted but each one is weak so it's pretty disappointing",
          "Spent 4 hours there; could be more if I had more time in Stockholm. A Wonderland for kids; history and memory made alive for everyone. A real time machine, bringing you into various households, artisans' workshops, peoples, social strata, landscapes. (Plus the zoo and the",
          "Two of the four of us considered this a pilgrimage. Skansen essentially invented the outdoor living history museum and it is a must-see for museum workers. But our spouses also had a great time. The staff all spoke perfect English so we were able to talk with them about all",
          "Very nice and big park for those who want to experience a little bit more the Swedish heritage. We really enjoyed the visit. Extremely clean too!!",
          "We visited as we had been recommended to do so and were glad we did. We could have spent about 4-6 hours in there but visited mid-afternoon on a rainy day so didn't spend as much time outside as we could. The museum has a somewhat dated feel to the displays but that sort of",
          "Best to visit on a nice day as it's mainly an outdoor site with a number of traditional buildings which have been moved to this site. Not all buildings are open everyday but there's plenty to see and do. In the open buildings there are people dressed in traditional costumes",
          "I visited Skansen by myself as I was travelling alone, and I heard it was a must-do in Stockholm. However, I disagree after having gone. -The informational placards aren't terribly detailed. I could probably learn more from a book. -There were tons of kids, families and school",
          "Great views,educational, a LOT of walking. The zoo part is small but has animals from the region, Their habitat are beautiful. Learn the history thru old houses and artisans on display. It reminded me of Colonial Williamsburg VA o. A smaller scale.",
          "Very comfortable journey and best way to travel to airport from City. Loved the scenic view. Good...",
          "on Fri 31-May-2019 afternoon (so between 14 and 17 CEDT), most of the attractions inside Skansen were closed/unmanned. We were hoping to enter some of the farmyards, workshops, the Segla Kyrka, Sami camp etc. but most of them were not in use. It was kinda disappointing ... we",
          "A unique open air concept. Got in using the funicular but came down walking, which wasnt too bad. Saw several animals like reindeer, moose, seals in the open air zoo, but we seemed to have missed the rest of Skansen as it was raining and we couldn't really figure out the open",
          "This is a classic outdoor museum that has a collection of traditional houses scattered in a large park, and on top of this the best of Scandinavian wild animals to observe. No person is untouched when they see the bears walking/eating/taking a swim, they seem to have a good",
          "We visited with a local friend, who thought we were crazy to pick this attraction over other museums in the area with our tight schedule. We spent less than two hours there, including lunch. Though there was a lot that was juvenile (You really must visit this place if traveling",
          "I planned to spend the best part of a day here and was glad that I did. The only thing I regretted was not starting with the old-time shops and businesses as many were closed / closing when I finally reached them. The animals were lovely and it was nice to have them wandering",
          "I've visited many zoos and this is one of the worst of them. The poor animals have such tiny spaces to live in, and all have the same environment - one size cannot fit all when it comes to animals! They all have such diverse needs and these simply aren't being met here. We left",
          "Really worth the visit. We took the ferry over which was cheap and really easy. There are so many activities and it\u2019s a lovely atmosphere for kids to explore, so (importantly!!) parents can relax. When we were there the food options were extensive and great quality. Plan for",
          "We went to Skansen on a nice, sunny Sunday in early June, and entered the parc at 1030 am. Many, if not all of the houses and farm were closed, no craftsmen around, no re-enactors in the villages, very disappointing! But the parc is nice, teh free map accurate, and by 0100 pm,",
          "Most of the animals seemed to be too shy to show themselves but the period buildings were very interesting and the characters acting out the part of early Swedes were entertaining.",
          "Wasn\u2019t a location I enjoyed. Difficult to navigate your way back out once you get in. Could be a good location to bring children.",
          "really fun, sloths are the best by far. would recommend to all ages, with lots of walking. you can even walk through some of the enclosures and animals jump around you",
          "I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019d call this place - amusement park, theme park, historical village? Whatever you call it, be prepared to walk up a few hills! The gardens throughout the park are delightful. There are a number of historical buildings that have been relocated to Skansen",
          "Not only are there buildings from all over Sweden and covering several hundred years, but there are actors playing roles in the various homes and commercial buildings. The fun is interacting with them to learn about the history or activity or social standing involved. And most",
          "I took the no 7 tram from the city centre to this open air museum. As well as a great range of buildings brought from all over Sweden they have 'peopled' some of them. These characters are well versed in their particular life and times and are very interesting to talk too.",
          "You can easily spend half a day in this open-air museum full of farmsteads, manor houses, workshops, and village churches from all over Sweden. We went on Midsummer Day, a major holiday in Sweden, when there were lots of activities everywhere and the museum staid open late. Not",
          "Skansen is a time capsule of Swedish life with many old buildings, ways of life and custom dress. If that's not enough there are numerous wild animals; wolves, bears, monkeys etc, and an aquarium. All in all there is something for all the family no matter what the age... We will",
          "A place not just for kids! A trip taking you through the scandi culture and changes throughout the years. Native animals and how they were and are looked after. walk through the villages and changes in buildings and farms. This place show so much history. We only managed half of",

          "A cashless hotel. Very welcoming and helpful. Excellent breakfast and most travellers filled their lunch from it, they were even given bags by the staff! Very clean and bright room",
          "The grandfather of all open air Museums in the world, a bit quirky and in need of some tlc in places but a must-see in Stockholm.",
          "This was a perfect place to potter around on a sunny day. Not everything was open, but the places that are were very interesting. There is a huge variety of buildings, different crafts being done, people reanacting life from different parts of swedish history (you can interact",
          "We had expectations of this place being better than what we experienced. The zoo section with limited animals was a let down. And we didn't come across any performers in traditional costume as was advertised. However there are plenty of historic buildings throughout the complex",
          "Back after 10 years or so. A bit surprised that most of the buildings could not be entered, only about 20% or so. Maybe that's the season. But you could more easily get an idea of Swedish building heritage at many local heritage parks all over Sweden for about 10% of the price.",
          "Skansen is the oldest open air museum and is situated in the island of djurgarden. It takes you back in time and showcases the various aspects of old Swedish life style. With farmsteads, houses, wild animals, children's zoo you can stroll through the history and have a very",
          "A nice place you must see if you visit Stockholm. Even with small kids and baby strollers you have to go. It\u2019s not the number of animals they are there to see but the old village, the simulation of how people they used to live, the actors playing their role etc. Great experience",
          "A lot of different houses from different times in Sweden and surrounding countries. A zoo with nordic animals where wolf have been the main attraction for our son. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This zoo/museum take you back to the 19th century in Sweden and makes you discover the Nordic faune that you would see nowhere else. You could choose to spend the whole day or just 4-5 hours in the park, it's up to you. Feel free to bring a picnic, but you can also buy food over",
          "Expensive entry fee. Most(almost all) animals invisible. Buildings closed with little info except the artisans and shop village. No attraction except a great jolly music band. A good day out but expensive for nothing special. Been to Beamish (near Durham, UK) and Schwarzwald\u00ebr",
          "After seeing the price I wasn't sure if I wanted to pay so much just for seeing a couple of old houses. In the end I did and I don't regret it. The building are charming by themselves so it's fun to just walk around. In addition the place is huge with lots of attractions to",
          "Having spent a very disappointing day at Skansen two days ago. I felt very let down by what was available having brought some foreign friends along, after telling them what I had been able to enjoy on previous visits over the years. Many of the farm steads were shut and looked",
          "The zoo is not so much of a zoo. It has a lot of domestic animals like gooses, cows, porks, etc. Also a few types a monkeys, wolfs, and other wild ones but not exceptional. All the houses are pretty much the same inside and outside,like the ones from decades ago but for who has",
          "Like every part of Stockholm, Skansen park is beauty and full of surprises. You can see old Swedish houses from different eras, with people dressed like that era, inviting you to visit every house and explaining the history behind each one. I was charmed by the simplicity and",
          "I must admit to being surprised at all the rave reviews. Views are pretty and the funicular ride was fun, but otherwise we were underwhelmed by the buildings and reenactments. Didn't make it to see the animals. Food service was especially surly. If you have young kids this",
          "This place is really wonderful.. you can admire ancient swedish buildings, nature and animals.. there is also a zoo for the children with funny entertainment for them. Besides you can have lunch there inside due to the food stands. One of the most beautiful places i have seen in",
          "We have very recently visited and I must say it was like stepping back in time with all the old buildings and staff dressing up, We really enjoyed this even though it was bitterly cold. Well worth a trip if your in the area. Also some stunning views.",
          "This is where you go if you want to see Nordic animals, there are also nice and old buildings from around Sweden.",
          "If you are tired of museums and want to spend time a bit differently, go to Skansen - heaven for children, amazing for the city views and appreciating the nature.",
          "Skansen is a must visit. It gives an insight to Sweden over the years in the form of typical cabins and old shops. Some have guides inside who are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. There are descriptions of everything outside as well. Some of the craft shops also give",
          "Skansen has something to offer to anybody. Whether it\u2019s a dinner or a snack with the views of Stockholm, a relaxing walk in the huge park, or a visit to the local souvenir shop, all the activities are worthwhile and to be enjoyed by the whole family.",
          "Be prepared for a lot of walking, but it will all be worth it. Skansen is a step back in time, and it is as if you are visiting an entire city from long ago. Do not miss eating here - there are many wonderful restaurants and the prices are reasonable.",
          "we really enjoyed walking around, so many animals and even the are where they do role-play and pretend to be real ppl. If it's a rainy day you won't be able to enjoy it as it is mainly outdoors. You will spend at least half a day there.",
          "We went there with our son. Weather was sunny and it was rather warm, therefore best timing for a visit to Skansen. Place was full of people and we very much enjoyed our time there. Place has a lot to offer including few animals, number of attractions, nice restaurant with a",
          "catch the number 69 bus from Stockholm Central station or the number 7 tram just outside Stockholm central station.Skansen is next to or very near Vasa ,Abba and Nordic museums.Set on a hill (there is a furnicular to take you up the hill)is ideal for children.Skansen is set up",
          "Salad near the tower on hilltop. There is a small kiosk near the high tower on the hill top of Skansen. There is salad with smoked salmon Is simply spoken excellent. Also the fries are really. Beware of seagulls loving them to.",
          "We had visited the open air folk museum in Oslo and had such a great experience that we were excited to see Skansen. Such a disappointment. Lots of food and drink to buy, but 75% of the buildings were still closed and even the animals weren't ready for viewing. There was a",
          "The concept behind this museum is amazing. It\u2019s an open air museum depicting life in Sweden over centuries. There are homes, animals, fauna, community centres, schools, parks and a whole lot of things brought here from all over Sweden from different time periods and put together",
          "We really enjoyed strolling around the park, very scenic and interesting. Good zoo area and lots of old buildings well presented.Aloos plenty of time . Good refreshments on site. Maybe half a day after morning visit to nearby Vasa Museum. Number 7 tram stops outside",
          "Great place for all ages, plenty to do and see, you need at least 3hrs is more. Loads of stalls, snack places etc",
          "I visited Skansen on Easter Sunday. I was worried it would be packed with families as the two days prior while passing I saw very long lines. Fortunately it wasn't the case this day as we queued up first thing in the morning (9:50 AM with opening time at 10:00 AM). The 7 tram",
          "Great park with loads of variety. Animals seem to have relatively large cages. The \u201cvillages\u201d are super cute.",
          "I think it's especially a nice place to spend with little children, but even without kids it's such a nice place. Seeing the animals, the buildings, the view. Overall great day trip.",
          "This is essentially a nice farm, petting zoo combo. Nice for families with young kids. For us it was a nice enough walk with some pretty views, some mildly interesting historical sections similar to Williamsburg or Mystic and some animals. Nice to see a Reindeer. There are",
          "Went there start of April with my younger son and wife. But was so shocked to see most of the animals were shifted due to the preparation works going on due to upcoming busy summer season. But they still charge us full price on entry and never informed about us about",
          "This is a lovely museum, quiet in April but probably much busier during the summer. The premise is fantastic- share Sweden\u2019s heritage and history- and the place was full of families with small children enjoying themselves. Amazing views also.",
          "It\u2019s a very pleasant walk around parkland with old buildings that were pretty much all locked up. That would be fine if it wasn\u2019t for the price, which is the same as if the park was fully open. We saw the Nordic animals - elk, bears, otters, wolves, etc - that was good. Just",
          "Good to see old style Scandinavian buildings that had been brought to one location for preservation. Good labelling. Animal enclosures for wolves, seals, otters, moose, farm animals, bears plus a few others too. Whilst the chickens and peacock were roaming free the rest were in",
          "Lovely way to escape from the trams, the cars, the buses and the bikes and walk around here taking in the views of life in the past and the Nordic animals.",
          "if you are looking for ancient Scandinavian history,skansen is the place. Old houses,huts, ancient nordic living style is beautifully displayed. attractions for all ages, a zoo , aquarium and woods .overall an amazing experience to spend a day.would recommend to everyone.",
          "We visited Skansen as a party of eight, cross generational family (ages 10-69) and there was something for everyone to enjoy. It is extremely well done and we noticed that someone was getting married there, it is a stunning location! As well as buildings throughout the ages",
          "My daughter and I loved visiting Skansen, what a fab place to look around and see Nordic animals, many of which we\u2019d not seen in real life before, like reindeer, moose, bears and wolves. We also saw the Lynx which is apparently a bit unusual as it\u2019s normally hiding. We didn\u2019t",
          "We recently visited this attraction. Very interesting to see the animals and also to see the old buildings/farmsteads which have been reconstructed and show how life was in different parts of Sweden.",
          "Skansen has old houses with Swedish traditions and animals, but not like a big Zoo. Also has food, dance, music and shops to buy traditional Swedish things. Recommended visiting period is summer time.",
          "I\u2019d rate this as good for the area with the animals and poor for the area with the recreated village. I loved the concept of the place and was really looking forward to visiting. The animals area looks well maintained and is filled with interesting things to see. The indoor",
          "An outdoor museum. Was a relatively quiet time to visit as it seems more buildings are open during peak season but still plenty to see and do with the staff all well-engaged with their jobs. There's animals, activities, crafts, food and drink. The various open buildings housed",
          "A nice park, but unfortunately for few interesting animals and hardly that you see the animals at times. Compared to the Zoo in Berlin, this is nothing to compare with. But for a cozy family trip and relaxation a nice day it might be worth a visit. But don't have too high",
          "There is so much to do and see here and on a nice day one can wander for hours enjoying the scenery and the many historical buildings and Nordic animals. The children\u2019s zoo is fantastic and both of my boys loved spending time there. I would only complain that while the entrance",
          "Not the best time of the year to visit in early spring, as place is still quite grey (not green) but the bears had already woken up and not too many tourists yet in April. Too much to see for one visit, so might go again when next time in S:holm. Don\u2019t understand the hype",

          "Very interesting museum to visit. It's quite big with loads to see. They have many animals around. I did not try to enter too many buildings, but was able to go into the church. Some of the other buildings seemed closed, but could be due to the time of the year.",
          "Part of it is a zoo and even though the enclosures are larger than in other places (to the point that the animals can hide if they want to, thankfully), it's still a zoo. And their idea of protecting their animals is basically killing their offspring. One could think a modern",
          "Take the tram and you can get off right in front of Skansen. This is a very unique concept, an open air museum. There is a zoo, aquarium, lots of farm animals and exhibitions by craftsmen. You can roam the total area on your own and at your own pace. There is a big area with",
          "Skansen has actually everything to do for familys. Swedish animals, aquarium with animals from many places in world and a tivoli. It's a whole day and its worth the visit.",
          "An opportunity to get some fresh air, connect with real life and learn about the Swedish past. Nothing silly or trying too hard just a genuine experience great for all of us.",
          "This is an open-air museum and zoo located on the island of Djurg\u00e5rden. Opened in October 1891, it consists of numerous farms and dwellings from different parts of Sweden that show the way of life in previous times. Skansen, pronounce Sconce includes various workshops and shops",
          "We saved a day of our trip to Stockholm to visit Skansen. Total waste of time and money. All the buildings were locked up, there were no staff about to talk about the history and the animals looked sad and unhappy. There is a lovely view point over the lake... this was the only",
          "This is a lovely place to visit. A lot of it was closed when we visited due to the time of year. They do also charge extra money for some of the experiences once inside. However, the museum itself is lovely. I really enjoyed being able to go in to the old church, farmhouse and",
          "Very interesting idea. A very nice open air museum. The weather was bad when I visited Skansen. I\u2019m sure it would have been a much better experience in good weather.",
          "Pretty cool to see, there is some cool animals too, I really think that a good museum for kids. We learned a lot",
          "A great place to spend time with family, acres of wonderfully maintained historic monuments, farm houses with farm animals and architecture well preserved. Some of the farms have livestock that are fully local to Sweden. We could even see wild animals like bears, moose and grey",
          "We went all round this lovely Zoo. Saw the beautiful wolves basking in the sun, and the seals begging for their fish amidst the swooping herons!! There was so much to see, and the quaint old fashioned shops and houses was a great touch. The shop was very appealing, so much",
          "It is a huge open air museum, so there is a lot of walking needed. It was a great to experience Sweden's history in terms of what kind of houses people lived in, their lifestyle, businesses etc. The place is very picturesque.",
          "Visited during the Christmas period where they had markets, snow and traditional dancing. It was brilliant to get involved with the dancing and music going on in the middle of the park. The stalls full of Christmas gifts and food was lovely and we really enjoyed seeing all the",

          "Very nice place to visit in the city. I like the fact that you get to see and experience things from different places of Sweden there. They have some really cool animals too!",
          "Came here in February with both a teen and young child, and we all enjoyed it very much! Considering the park had many sections closed because of the winter season, we found that there was still so much to see and do! We loved seeing so many animals that we don't get to see up",
          "We spent a few hours here as there is a lot to see. We got \u201call attraction\u201d tickets which were good value at about \u00a320 per head. Short funicular ride saves the legs and is a good start to the experience. Zoo was a bit disappointing as many animals were sheltering or hibernating",
          "A Calm space for an educational stroll in the city with chance to learn about the Swedish history. have some scenic spots for a lovely view of the city skyline. it might feel expensive for the amount of animals available for viewing but feels like a nice break from the other",
          "Very cool layout of the grounds with plenty of things to see with families. There was a skating rink and some delicious almonds next to it. Lastly, the animals were very cool, first time ever seeing a Wolverine, my school mascot. Would be better in summer due to more being",
          "I vist Sakansen at least two times on year since 2008, and every time I discover new hiden places, I learn new thinks about Sweden history. I love to speak with the people who work there, they are very friendly and love their job, so they are happy to share with the things the",
          "An outdoor museum with some Swedish animals and an expedition of craftsmanship in the old days Nice aquarium Mostly for the kids",
          "Some bits are a little dated, but the history is good, and it is a really enjoyable day out for all of the family. My daughter loved the pony ride and the zoo was good too.",
          "The price for this means it definitely is not worth it....I really like the idea and was looking forward to going there but I was utterly disappointed. One of the goals is to show the way of life in the older times but I found maybe 2 houses where they were actually interested",
          "It's an interesting place to visit and requires a fair amount of walking which was nice after being cooped up in meetings. I visited it in the autumn when there were very few visitors but unfortunately, this also meant that quite a few things seemed to be shut down and/or not",
          "We visited during school hours so the place was very quiet. Wandering around the animals and they offered chats with staff who were very friendly and knowledgeable about Skansen and the heritage of Sweden. Worth a visit",
          "Nice day out, not many shops or cafes so take snacks with you. We didn't see loads of animals but had a nice time",
          "We read other reviews which said out of season not all the exhibits would be open but we weren't quite expecting so many of the buildings to be closed. We did ask on entry what was open and we were told there was 'lots to see'. For three of us (two adults and an eleven year old)",
          "Beutiful during summer but also good at other times of the year. Of course for example the beats are hibernating but still lots to see and a very nice area to walk around.",
          "Ever curious about what Sweden looked like way back when? This is the place to go. You will find original buildings from several centuries, moved here and resurrected. You can walk the streets in this outdoor museum, enter the houses, look at furniture and tools, crafts,",
          "This open air museum had many old shops and houses. Many of these were sadly closed in the winter - it would have been good to have some information at the beginning of our visit about what was open. In the shops which were open, there were people who could answer questions",
          "An open-air museum that shows what life was like in Sweden in earlier times. There is also a zoo which focuses on Nordic animals and domestic animals.",
          "The price is very suitable with the museum. there are many kinds of animals and they have a lot of small cute houses interesting for them. we enjoyed it alot !",
          "I really enjoyed the Skansen Museum, especially the zoo area. First time seeing reindeer and a moose. The guides are very friendly and there are lots of old Swedish houses all over the park, making the whole place look like a part of fairy tales. An extra feature was the market",
          "Great place for family to spend an afternoon together. If you have some idle time on your visit and the weather is nice, you should definitely spend some time here.",
          "I think it's a wonderful place to visit in spring or summer but in winter is a bit desolate and bare. Almost all the houses and attractions were closed and the heavy Snow made it worse. Anyway the animals were lovely (reindeers, seals, owls, wolfs) and the atmosphere almost",
          "Skansen is a really unique place in Stockholm. A great location close to the city centre, and certainly with great views!!! There is a little bit of everything: an ethnological museum with traditional crafts, a great bakery, domestic and wild animals, great places to walk",
          "Walking around the whole Skansen requires warm clothes in the winter but every step is worth it. Everything is beautiful, if you\u2019re at least a little bit interested in history and you\u2019d like to walk around in a mesmerizing atmosphere then you have to visit! Also the boutique at",
          "We did not get to see all of the open air park, but what we saw was really neat. I got my mom a bluebird at the glass blowing shop, we saw an old timeclock and ate some goodies at the bakery. We saw lodgings of how they lived back in time and the old buildings and the gardens.",
          "If you have a good few hours on your hands Skansen is a really good place to visit. We came out of season, so a lot of areas were closed which was a shame, but what we did see was certainly worth it. It seemed like there was a good amount of things to do and see for all members",
          "We visited in mid January, a lot of the houses were shut. The website shows lots of people dressed up as villagers,there were none and most stalls were shut. I would imagine in season it would be a great place to visit. Maybe an out of season entrance price should be offered.",
          "Very beautiful place, a lot to explore, especially for children as it\u2019s very kids friendly! Animals are very well kept and I\u2019m impressed that they did very good research about their needs. It is very rare nowadays! I only wish more attraction would be available during the",
          "Massive open-air museum and miniature zoo combined. Has traditional Swedish houses and buildings where staff are in costume, but not exactly in character, doing traditional things like baking bread and various pastries, making chairs, etc. They are there to interact with guests",
          "Everyone in Stockholm has been to Skansen atleast once when they were kids. It is an absolutly amazing place where both kids and adults will have a great time. Pet the animals, grab a traditional swedish fika or just walk around among small houses and pretend you live in the",
          "Everything here is just amazing. A great way to learn about history of Swedish culture and also amazing environment with all the gardens. And what a happiness when I saw all the gorgeous northern animals which I hadn't chance to meet before!",
          "Must-see in Stockholm! Do not know what I liked more, the atmosphere, the animals or the bakery with great bread!",
          "A terrific museum.....We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Loved the orchards and gardens, the live demonstrations of live skills like glass blowing were excellent.",
          "All of Sweden's history and culture condensed into this beautiful wooded setting. It offers an opportunity to immerse oneself in history through sensory experiences in historic buildings. Plus, the views of the city alone are worth the cost of admission!",
          "This is one of all the attractions that makes Stockholm wonderful with kids. Make sure you have a full day here and take your time to explore. There is so much to see that it might be worth spendig two days here depending on the age of your kids. This is perfect for kids up to",
          "Skansen is a cool place to spend a few hours,gives u an idea how the Swedish life was lived back in the day,a few exhibits etc were closed when we visited but all in all it was an enjoyable experience,enhanced by the mini zoo/aquarium, there's not loads to do but a nice place to",

We made the easy ferry ride from S\u00f6dermalm and",
          "Basicly an museum with old rebuilded crofts,buildings, and shops collected from around Sweden to get a look into the old days. An animal zoo containing Swedish wild life animals in between,very child friendly. In the summermonths there's a big scene where popular Swedish artists",
          "We went on a xmas day. Not all the period houses were all but they very kindly set up 2 homes to showcase how Xmas was celebrated in the old time. I also enjoyed the xmas music performance in the church.",
          "The museum is in fact the ethno village where you can see how people used to live in the past, plus there is also a ZOO. We went there in winter so it was quite cold but still interesting. It is even better in summer I guess. It is fun to visit with kids.",
          "Loved the place absolutely. It has something for everyone. It had amazing Christmas markets when we went there. Great food choices in the Christmas market. The funicular ride was short but fun. We did get to see several animals even though it was cold. Pleasant walk that leads",
          "This first open air museum in the world is a must when visiting Stockholm. There is a lot to see even in winter time - from typical architecture, some arts and crafts, people in typical costumes and some animals like moose and raindeer. Highly recommended!",
          "I was amazed at how big Skansen was, I hadn\u2019t expected it to take so long to see it all. A big recommendation is to take nuts with you to feed the blue tits and red squirrels. Definitely the best part of my day. Great to see all of the house styles and i enjoyed how staff were",
          "If you go with kids it can be good as there is loads for kids to see and do to keep them entertained. As adults not so much, some of the things looked really interesting but I couldn\u2019t understand as the guides all spoke Swedish so I had no idea what was going on. And the entry",
          "This was nice to check out in between some of the other indoor museums. They had some nice fall activities going on and the grounds are beautiful with great views at the top of the hill",
          "The museum is astonishing featuring many attractions that would interest almost anyone. There are many scattered caf\u00e9s and places to eat and rest, however it does get extremely cold during Christmas time (of course) so be aware of that because there is a fair amount of uphill",
          "We had so much fun visiting old houses and learning about differetn crafts, life in the past... The old shop was a real treat and also other buildings in the old street of wooden houses. I was glad to vivit the ZOO as wel as this was my first time to see moose from the close - a",
          "Excellent place to spend half a day with family and friends. Good for adults, teenagers and children",
          "Not a standard museum, but much nature and other buildings to see. Bigger than expected also many options for children to interact. Unfortunately many animals wheren\u2019t outside which was a bit of a dissapointment but since it\u2019s january I feel like this is a common thing. I\u2019ve",
          "Taking advantage of the fact that it was 1 January with so many attractions unfortunately closed, we decided to visit this place a little off the mark. In fact it turned out to be perhaps the nicest place or among the top three admired in Stockholm. Not so much for the part of",
          "Very close to the city (take the ferry from Slussen!), and a nice relaxing day at Skansen waits you. Just stroll around and enjoy the old house, animals, and kids running around.",
          "A visit just before Christmas, after Christmas Market had closed, was still a nice experience. A great variety of workshops, booths with different products, zoo, entertainment, restaurants (not all open, though) - well worth a visit.",
          "Brilliant open air museum. If you do nothing else with kids in Stockholm do this! We spent the whole day but could have come back for more. We saw the zoo, the aquarium, the buildings, the views. We where there New Year\u2019s Day so the funicular was not running but not busy either.",
          "Very interesting way to connect animal world (zoo, but to exotic, but original). Historical buildings are cool and animals are accindentally situated around them. It is a littlebit longer walk but great. It is good to have half day for a visit and other half fir Vasa museum,",
          "This an interesting look at the old Sweden. There are homes, barns, churches, village stores, windmills and farms on display. Some you can enter and some you can only view from the outside. There is a small zoo of native animals. There is a small playground for children. There",
          "We visited Skansen in December, on a snowy day and it was a wonderful experience. Nice little houses, relaxing walking paths, not too many people ( at least when we were there). If you schedule your visit well, you can view the sunset from the top of the hill. Some tips: you can",
          "We visited on a cold snowy Boxing Day, skating a bit on the icy paths but loving the open fires in the old houses. As ever the hosts were brilliant in English and Swedish, and we even saw the wolverine giving his Greatest Show (geddit?). One down side, the prices in the pub at",
          "This place is good to visit with kids, especially because they have a little children's zoo with tunnels children can climb through and animals like voles, which are tiny, adorable and fast. It is also a nice ace to walk around. With our daughter, in very cold weather, we didn't",
          "Nice place to walk and the houses look like the old west. Most of the places were closed since it was Sunday and cold. We saw bison, wolves, an owl, peacocks and the cheekist red squirrel you would ever meet. Would love to see it in the summer.",

          "Skansen is a great place. It's a good place to see how the culture and way of living has changed over time. In addition it has a nice Zoo with wild animals from Sweden. The Zoo also has monkeys and a museum for the Baltic sea. Skansen is a \u2026",
          "Interesting old vernacular buildings and great to see the Nordic animals'; I was particularly taken by the wolverine!",
          "Visit the glass blowing studio! That was our favorite part of the entire museum. The store was fantastic and fairly priced for the quality of the work.",
          "Very nice place, for your spirit and mind",
          "It's a fun play yo spend the day in, a lot of things to see and discover besides the zoo which has some cool animals as well.",
          "Nice aquarium but the wild life could of been a little better",
          "A visit to Skansen is part history lesson, part adventure. The grounds are huge, and there is plenty to explore and do-- from traditional Swedish housing through the ages, to northern indigenous art and architecture, you get a great \u2026",
          "The whole family can easily spend entire day here and not be bored, best park in its own category!",
          "This park is extensive with many historical buildings some you can go in some you can just look at it from the outside. It also has a zoo with some Nordic animals. We enjoyed seeing the lynx and the moose but the bears didn\u2019t come out for \u2026",
          "Fantastic visit with a huge variety of things to do; easily a full day visit if you want to take it all in. Besides the animal attractions there are also a number of cultural exhibits, and interactive elements to enjoy, especially for younger visitors. Plan for more time than you think!",
          "If you wanna take a nature walk just go! if you wanna lost in the history just go. if you wanna see different kind of animals just go.",
          "Took ma and pa here and we all had a good time, lots of things to do and overall a nice clean park.",
          "Very nice place to visit, walk and relax in Stockholm. It is like a open air museum and a park, and a zoo 3 in one. \n\nHere you will meet the elements of the Swedish culture of 18-th century represented by the numerous houses, built and \u2026",
          "Great family day out. Wonderful combination of Swedish homestead history & wildlife. Plenty of services available but you can take your own food and drinks to keep costs low. Aquarium is an additional cost and due to the size of the park & \u2026",
          "Nice enough place. Admittance fee was a bit steep since I was mostly there for the Aquarium / Baltic Sea Center.",
          "Really nice open air museum/zoo. You have to walk a lot but it is worth it. Many old houses, animals and places. Perfect for kids or if you want to slow down a little bit - went there in September when sun was shining. Not many people and not much restaurants/shops/cafes open but really nice atmosphere.",
          "An excellent experience in an open museum.  Very organized museum shops at the entrance and around the districts. Excellent choice for the families.",
          "It's a really nice zoo. Scandinavian animals and a small tropical zoo.",
          "Good open air museum, however zoo area did not have many expected nordic animals.",
          "Good value for money. The place is large, with different areas to visit. \n\nMy personal favourite was the old town where they show you how people used to work in the past. \n\nSeeing a moose in real life for the first time was also great. \n\nHighly recommended for families and for people interested to see Swedish culture and history.",
          "Skansen during christmas time is partly magical. 1940s style Lucia celebration, artisan glassware and wonderful views. If you have the chance, take it!",
          "Great visit really nice place to visit to get to know about the swedish heritage. For all ages. It features parks with local animals, but also houses of former eras and people explaining about them",
          "Beautiful park with all the Nordic animals and a perfect place to spend New year's eve with live music and fireworks!!",
          "Probably the oldest open-air museum in Scandinavia and a beautiful one. Old buildings, people dressed as they are in early 1800\u2019s and the Nordic animals, a must see. \nYou can spend three or more hours easily in this place.",
          "It may be my pride in Swedish things but this is simply one of the best places to go. Give you a real insight into the Sweden of past and present",
          "Time passing place. Relaxing and getting a chance to know the past and their culture lifestyle etc. Must go with enough time in hands , otherwise one cannot enjoy the place",
          "Nice museum, there are lots of Nordic animals and the Swedish houses part were so great. It was so fun. I totally recommend it",
          "Is nice place, but I think is necessary more advice to know where you are and the attractions are.",
          "It's not a traditional zoo it's more than that. It's a great big park with animals and old buildings and so much more. This is a recommendation for everyone that spends about 4 days or more in Stockholm to go to. Spend a few hours here, you \u2026",
          "A great place to spend time as family. Due to all the animals (in the early summer with young animals) it never gets boring. \nYou learn a lot about Sweden's ancient time and cultures. The aquarium incl the Lemurs is also a must see. \nIts definitely worth those d as much time as possible there.",
          "Best place for a Sunday stroll when in Stockholm",
          "So lovely to see the native animals of Sweden in as natural an environment as possible. The surroundings were well maintained & the staff polite & helpful",
          "I love Skansen! It's so pretty and relaxing! For the ultimate experience I recommend that you bring your own food and have a picnic somewhere nice. Some of the restaurants also got a nice atmosphere if you don't want to bring things with you.\nIt's a must do thing for tourists!",
          "Beautiful and magical place to spend time with friends, family! It's like walk in another place and time! The architectures are amazing and typical! There are some animals to see like wolves, lynx! I'm going to visit it again when is winter \u2026",
          "Very interesting insights about Scandinavian heritage and wildlife. Especially good if you have kids as there are many activities to keep them occupied. Make sure to go in the summer time because the interactive experiences and buildings would otherwise be closed, while the entrance price remains the same.",
          "Beautiful place, beautiful animals, and really interesting to see there small house's we're they create different things like glass sculptures.",
          "Beautiful open air museum on the \"island of museums\" that is representing the Nordic lifestyle, architecture and fauna in a professionally created environment. \nWooden houses, churches, farms and villages are good places for wanderers and \u2026",
          "It was such a nice day in Skansen! Wasn't too crowded either. I love that the animals are kept in a place that looks as true to their natural habitat as it can. Families, or couples, anyone can enjoy this amazing place!",
          "Nice to visit with the kids and easy to spend the whole day.\nSee, learn and play!! My kids (2 & 4) loved it.\n\nI gave it 3 stars because the main restaurant was horrible and very expensive. You had to wait a very long time in a very \u2026",
          "Would recommend this place! So much fun for a day trip, take out the whole day when going here because their is a lot of walking and a lot to see. Good for all ages! Would have only liked to see 1 or 2 extra places where you could have a descent lunch",
          "I love Skansen. This is despite and perhaps even because I have no real idea exactly what Skansen even *is*. Is it a zoo? A historical re-enactment village? A concert venue? A park? It\u2019s all of these and none of these at once, and this \u2026",
          "A very nice skansen, but be prepared to walk a lot. The place is just immense! In addition to learning about Swedish traditions and the way of life, you will also have the occasion to visit a great zoo and a Baltic Sea aquarium!",
          "The best museum I have ever seen in Sweden.",
          "this place has a lot of history and also a really cool zoo and aquarium. there is a lot to see and also a really cool christmas market during the winter. i would defeneltly recomend visiting here on your vacation to learn a bit more about how the people lived before. (also the bakery sells amazing foods!!!!)",
          "Amazing whereabouts, a well-taken care of garden and village. The zoo was fun,too, also the waffles. \nA great experience, perfect for family with kids encounters.",
          "Great day out. Lots to see and do including finding out about how the old buildings were used with helpers dressed in athentic dress for the time lots of native animals and a petting zoo. An abundance of eateries on site and some rides for small children. Worth the entry fee",
          "If you like tradition and nature, check this place out ! Historical buildings and alot of storys. Go discover them!",
          "Would be a great thing to do if you have children with you, but I wouldn't recommend if you're adults only. Pretty much a tourist trap. Despite being high season, a lot of the buildings were closed, and the ones which were open didn't have \u2026",
          "Beautiful and huge. Great explanations and live actors who can tell you whatever you want to know about the history and life in Sweden.\nI don't like that there's also a zoo included because I don't want to visit zoos, but I wanted to see the museum. It would be better if that would be separated.",
          "Skansen is a massive open air museum with plenty to see. Walking around will take you past enclosures with various Nordic animals, replica's of old Swedish houses and stores with actors. Definitely worth the visit",
          "It was awesome. Beautiful \u2764\ufe0f. It is nice to see how people celebrated Christmas in the olden days",
          "Lovely open air museum. It's a wonderful experience.",
          "This a must for all who come visit Sweden. What a lovely walking experience. Sights to see, animals to look at from a distance, photographs to keep for always. Come to Skansen..the biggest and most beautiful open air museum in Sweden!!",
          "Very authentic place, although charging more than 100 SEK for the primates exhibit right after having paid a similarly pricey entrance fee to the park itself is bad taste. However, as primates aren't part of Swedens fauna (as I recall) I \u2026",
          "Adorable historic town inside the busy city. You can bring your own hot dogs and marshmellows  and grill them on the fires provided inside, on wooden benches.\n\nQuite interesting for little children as they also have a zoo and numerous \u2026",
          "Nice place...needs one full day to visit",

          "A big outdoor museum with old Swedish houses and zoo with scandinavian animals.",
          "Open air museum with collection of traditional Swedish rural buildings of different types - churches, schools, houses, belfry, barns etc. Not very exciting, but as a nice quiet place to walk in, absorb the atmosphere and take a break from \u2026",
          "It was a nice place but I hope they have free pass.",
          "Place is beautiful. One can see the Stockholm skyline as well from a height. Earlier lifestyle can be experienced. Can find Nordic animals.",
          "The concept is great, but half the workshops were closed, I guess cause it's in winter. Worth a visit if you have time and if the weather permits since it's outdoors.",
          "Visited with family. It is amazing place to at least spend half day. This will take you back in old days how they use to live and all. They have so many exhibits -animal life etc. Highly recommend",
          "A very pleasurable experience for the whole family. Lots to do and see. The wild animals are a must. The funicular was somewhat disappointing as it was a very short ride up and down. Food venues plentiful and decent",
          "Absolutely beautiful!! Has everything from a Zoo to a old Swedish open air museum with farms and houses. \nPerfect place for a family day. \nDon't miss the Nordic animals section and the African animals section. The African animal section has an extra fee for 120 kr per adult. Definitely worth the fee and the time.",
          "This is a wonderful place to see nordic animals and just enjoy nature with kids and family.",
          "A beautiful place, need a whole day to enjoy around skansen, must visit aquarium and small zoo.",
          "Very nice outdoors museum with lots to explore. At least a whole day's worth of programme for the family.",
          "AMAZING PLACE ! This is a must-go in Stockholm. Everything about this place is great, especially for children and families. This place is huge, there is a lot of restaurants, caf\u00e9s and seating areas. The animal are in big spaces and are \u2026",
          "For sure this place has lot to offer, everything for making crafts, shows for the younger kids. But overall the place is boring. Bring your own snack's/food with you because buying here can get very expressive. The staff working here are very friendly and welcoming.",
          "Very beautiful place and lot of nature and old oak trees.",
          "I do find open-air museums fascinating and you can always talk to the people and get more information. They have quite a lot of different buildings. There's also a bit of a zoo at the top of the hill, with wolves, lynx, otter, moose etc. The animals are well housed by and large and generally visible.  A good trip for all the family.",
          "Delightful petting zoo and traditional swedish village.  Many native animals living in large lush open air enclosures.  I saw elk, wolves, bison, wolverine, lemur, goats, wild pigs, domestic pigs, bobcats, and cows.   Reasonable food prices.  All in a very pleasant visit.",
          "Perfect weather, extraordinary views.\nBest way to spend 3 or 4 hours in Stockholm.\nThe staff is more than glad to assist with various informatikn, and the cinnamon  rolls...",
          "Beautiful place, even in the winter although there are a lot of animals locket in cages which is against their will.",
          "It is a strange kind of museum. It tries to keep the olden days alive in front of you. They have nordic style homes, restaurants, shops etc depicting the older times. There are even people with cloths dating 15-16th century. There are horse \u2026",
          "Very good place to see in stockholm, Open museum people singing folk songs in the open, all the amenities available, with an open restaurant place where you can also buy some souvenirs.\nIf you are in Stockholm then it is a must visit place \u2026",
          "Interesting, though not so much open on cold winter days.  Unfortunately Christmas market only at weekends.",
          "Wow, this is a coolest spot in Stockholm. Like a zoo we have to walk a lot more places. However it all makes cool !",
          "An amazing open-air museum/zoo. The place is huge, so you have to walk a lot, but it definitely is worth it.",

          "When exiting Skansen yesterday there was a fine dressed lady pushing the fence-door. A SCARY SCENE: the tourist in front of her was leg injured. \nI have seen the whole thing while she didn\u2019t stop herself.Luckily the tourist got out before \u2026",
          "It's an exposition of houses from all around Sweden really well preserved",
          "This is an open-air museum(?) and/or entertainment facility that offer historically designed houses with friendly stuff giving information about Sweden history. I found it fun and informative. The food in the cafe and bakery are delicious, \u2026",
          "Great place to visit and wonderful Christmas market. Great view of the city from here too.",
          "Nice visit with lots of memories from the past. It's a Theme park and you will meet lots of families. Better you buy a yearly ticket if you want to visit it more often.",
          "Love this place! Such an unusual find, best outdoor museum I have visited. Lots to see and do, with rides and animals for the kids and culture for all the family. Could easily spend the entire day here, with so many places to visit. \u2026",
          "A great experience to see what Sweden was like many years ago. We spent many hours there exploring. It was great to see people wandering around in traditional dress too. The animals are a bit of an obscure addition, but do add a little more interest",
          "Amazing place, definitely we will visit again to spend more time there!",
          "Skansen is the old and modern Sweden all in one place\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea \u00e5rskor/yearly card is a life saver \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude4c",

          "An awesome place to spend quality time with family and friends.",

          "I saw some really adorable animals and I went into a lemur cage.",
          "Beautiful place to learn about the swedish history and how the people lived in the last centuries.",
          "Skansen is a really interesting open air museum. You can visit the houses and are greeted by people in traditional clothes, as if they were living there, more than happy to explain what they're doing. There is also a zoo with nordics animals. You can have a nice view of Stockholm.",

          "Nice Christmas market with all the traditional swedish food you can eat",

          "Great place with aplenty of Swedish history to live in real time.",
          "Fun place to go and get some history of Sweden. Also the aquarium was a good treat. If you go during mid summer use the side entrance at that's much shorter of a line",

          "It's like a park-zoo-museum. Great for many occasions, like a family picnic, a fabulous view of Stockholm, see some animals living in a good place and well treated, know more about Swedish (and Nordic) history, admire nature... You have to \u2026",

          "Wonderful place! Besides of a great park and mystical atmosphere of old Sweden, there are also a beautiful aquarium and zoo. Skansen is definitely a must-visit place in Stockholm! \ud83d\ude18",
          "A great place to enjoy the zoo and museum",
          "Skansen is always nice, but the prices are steep and it feels very much like a tourist trap sometimes. My recommendation is to eat before or after your visit instead of inside Skansen. Some animals are hard to spot, in general Skansen is worth a lot more as a historical park than a zoo. Recommended place if you are visiting Stockholm.",
          "Interesting place. It is good to walk here with children.",
          "I enjoyed it much better twenty years ago when it was not so commercial and Americanized. And only the church was open. Disappointed.",
          "Skansen is great for kids and adults alike. Stunning views, great playgrounds, big scenes for performances, cool old buildings, big enclosures for wolves, bears and a lot of the other Swedish animals. Lovely little Petting Zoo.",

          "Best ethnologic place i ever visited",
          "One of the must-see places in Stockholm. Very authentic place. There are special events happening everyday so make sure you check the event schedule before going there. There are many families with kids because the place is also a zoo and there are special events for kids. Enjoy!",
          "A day is not enough. You have to come back again to explore a whole place. It's really a great place",
          "It\u2019s a super cool park that consists of zoo (Wolfs, Owls, Bear, Wisents, goats, cows), historical park (a lot of different reconstructed villages) and just a huge park to walk in. Children can ride a pony, parents can sit in a cafe. There is an interesting village near to the enter. There is a bakery with cheap delicious buns.",
          "Love this place! You can spend whole day there. A lot of old buildings from all over Sweden and very nice people working there - will answer all your questions.",

          "Interesting place for little and not so little ones",
          "Nice big place of 30000 m\u00b2. The Baltic sea science museum is amazing. Animal museum is also nice but you have to pay extra to enter it. During special occasions like Easter or Halloween or Christmas, it is very alive and appealing especially for children. You can spend the whole day without getting bored \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Sooo nice. Go there and enjoy",
          "A beautiful family outing full of history, fun and animals. Gardens are beautifully kept. Allow quite a few hours if you plan to visit. We were there for 8 whole hours!",

          "Sweden history open air museum",
          "Skansen is a very nice entertaining place especially for young kids. They get to see nordic animals, cultures and many traditions. \nHowever I have a suggestion, they can rent electric walkers or scooters for people who get tired of walking so much.",
          "A great day out with plenty to see and do for all ages",
          "This park is beautifully cared for. A bit of an outdoor wildlife and domestic farm life overview from times gone by. Very well cared for. A peaceful place to stroll around. Children would love this as well. Very large area and many animals \u2026",
          "Very pretty and organised ''old town''. Worth every SEK. We spent a whole day there! Loved it!",
          "Perfect for a day of leisure with family.",

          "Good place to spend a day for the whole family.",
          "As someone who used to come here throughout childhood in the 70s, not much has changed. It's still a rather small area on a steep hill, where buildings of a bygone era competes with animal enclosures for a look-in. The are a few newbies, \u2026",
          "Get ready for a ton of people for the Christmas market but still nice!",
          "Very disappointing. We have been to open air/folk museums in other countries and have had a wonderful time learning about the history and livelihoods of the residents. Actors churning butter and caring for horses and bringing history to \u2026",

          "Visited the museum today and fell in love with Sweden. So much to see , plenty of places to eat, souvenirs shops , the zoo and the entertainment. Lots of free bathrooms and no problem buying with cash. You need 2 day to see everything do \u2026",

          "A must see in Stockholm Sweden. Several historic buildings and farms were brought here from all over the country. They cover more than 200 years of history. You can spend an entire day here and learn a lot about the culture and history. \u2026",

          "Very cool living history museum.  A must see if visiting Stockholm.  Animal portions are hit or miss, with lots of animal pens completely empty.  Many of the houses were closed as well during our visit but there was plenty to see regardless.  Lots of great food offerings as well.  Be ready to walk if you visit.",
          "Nice environment and outdoor space",
          "Awesome place! Especially the Aquarium with all the monkeys. The northern wild animals can be a little hard to spot. Food is great and affordable, though the waiting time can be long-ish during the summer, it seems.",
          "Skansen is a museum comprising of old buildings collected throughout Sweden and rebuilt on site. Including animals typical of Sweden. Very well worth a visit. Take a whole day and bring good shoes.",

          "Don't visit the children's area or the zoo if you don't have kids as it's great for them but boring for adults. Btw we saw only one animal out of three enclosures as they are all able to hide!\n\nThe recreated old town, the farmsteads and the \u2026",
          "There are a lot of things to see, one day is not enough to discover everything. The historical farms and buildings can be interesting and there are beautiful gardens, but a lot of the animals seem to be quite elusive, so don't expect to see \u2026",
          "Nice place to bring your kids but gets boring after a while.",
          "Good place to view the city",
          "Mini old Sweden in a great setting.",
          "Beutiful park excibiting Swedish flora and fauna. But the restaurant Soliden might not be the best kitchen in the zoorounding area =)",

          "very special kind of garden: semi openair museum and semi garden. very peaceful place for anybody. farm animals for children,   typical Swedish buildings of all regions. And the last but not least: artisans workshops. An amazing tobaccos \u2026",
          "Good place for a visit with children. There is an animal zoo both hosting farm and wild animals, some very old houses where you can explore how people lived in old days.",
          "Museum in open. Perfect.",
          "Opposite the ABBA museum, went in there to see how the old town in Sweden was like. Actually felt like I travelled back in time.",
          "Plenty to explore for kids about traditional swedish farm life. Food not great and expensive at the on-site restaurant.",
          "Would probably be a great place to take children to. Still interesting for adults although there is less explanation than what i'd would like.",
          "Skansen is an open-air museum, zoo and an outdoor place to spend a day, especially with a family. There are a lot of places to see that are simulating life in the past. The zoo is small but good enough. Due to hilly landscape, old people \u2026",
          "A beautiful, exciting and informational destination I was so happy to have experienced",

          "Excellent place to bring the family. You could spend hours letting the kids run around in a fun and safe environment.",
          "Absolute joy at the xmas market, dance at the hill top is amazing",
          "This is an absolute must if you're in Stockholm. I went for midsommer and it was amazing. The staff were all super friendly and while there were lines for everything, the lines moved very quickly. I highly recommend the aquarium with the monkeys, they are so fun!",
          "Nice park to take a walk with some swedish animals to see.",
          "Very Beautiful. Good view of the old town in the evening. Animals come out when it's more quiet in the evening.",
          "Based on hundred visits, Skansen is the top entertainment ror kids. We always find something new, something to learn, something to spent several hours. A yearly card would be a wise choice for those who live near Stockholm and have kids. There are a couple of nearby parking places, but parking is generally difficult in the area.",
          "We entered at the museum close to 4 pm and most of the houses were closed and no activities planed even though the museum closes at 8 pm. They should be warn people before entering about that or offer a discounted ticket.",
          "This is a wonderful museum in nature that has a zoo too. It also has many attractions such as bear feeding. It has an aquarium too, and a lot of shops. For those who want to see some African animals, they have to pay extra money.",

          "Amazing place to know the culture of sweden",
          "Nice open air museum and park, especially for children. We liked the zoo. \n\nWe went on a Monday early. Alltough the park was open many attractions were not. They started to open gradually but we could not see all we wanted as we had made other plans already.",
          "A full experience, best in late spring and summer but sites close too early at 4 o'clock. You can still go around and enjoy the scenery after that. Prepare to stay there for at least 3 hours, when planning your day!",
          "Very beautiful place where you can see different parts and different times of Sweden without leaving Stockholm. All kinds of houses , crafts , birds and animals that lives in Sweden in the same place. So many things to see and do over here \u2026",
          "I've been in most of the skansens in Poland and neither of them is as good as this one. The best Skansen experience ever. Very instagramable place. Lots of beautiful building and people dressed-up there describing the old times.",
          "Interesting place to look at life and household of rural people, domestic and wild animals and simply to spend time in open air.",
          "Open air museum with a mix of swedish wildlife and history. A really nice place to visit in Stockholm, almost serene. Usually it's not crowded at all and it's a big place. Bring food and enjoy the views. Prepare to spend at least a couple \u2026",
          "Attended in the low season and most attractions closed....... Should have paid half price.",
          "The best skansen ever. Much more than a skansen, offers so many programs, also hosts a zoo and a fun museum to educate about sea life. Definitely worth a full day visit!",
          "Great place to bring your family! Fun for the kids especially.",
          "BEST. PLACE. EVER. This is literally one of my favourite places in the entire world. Definitely 100% recommend coming here\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf",

          "We went f your Midsummer celebrations. It was warm. Remember and wear sunscreen. There is plenty to see and the water birds wandering freely gives a nice surprise",
          "Really cool walking visit showing history of Swedish dwellings. +Fika!!!",
          "Great place to spend a whole day! I only was a few days in this city and I am very happy to have gone to Skansen.",
          "Kids enjoy the zoo along with rides and shows.",

          "Enjoyed the christmas market and learning the about Sweden's history",
          "Recommended to all tourists! Tickets costs cheap and good in kronas",
          "This is a beautiful zoo / aquarium and is so much larger than we thought it would be. They have bears, lemurs, lynx, wolves, sheep, etc. The aquarium section has crocodiles, and all sorts of fish. It was really cool. We spent 3 hours there \u2026",
          "I love Skansen, the buildings (material and technique), the nature, the animals, the handicrafts. I only miss allergy friendly food, but then again hardly any place can cater to my needs - and I'm allowed to bring a pick nick.",
          "Great place to visit!",
          "It is a nice concept and surrounding, but I would personally prefer if there was maybe a guide, more historical references... There is a shop town, but I didn't have enough time to see what is it about. Also, you have a zoo, with animals who were very shy to come out :( a fun park, aquarium... Overall, it is ok, expensive tho.",
          "very fun big place with zoo",
          "Super cute and fun for all. There's a \"zoo\" of Nordic animals. There are houses with grass roofs, windmills, historic reenactments. There is ligonberry juice. \n\nIt is open air so does get hot.",
          "One of the must-see destination for the whole family if you happen to visit Stockholm.  We went there in November a few years back and we were so lucky that we were greeted with the very first snow of the season on that day. Local as well as overseas visitors had a wonderful time under the fresh snow.  Highly recommended :)",
          "So much to do and see! History, culture, animals. Peacocks walked right up to us. Lots for kids to do! Just make sure you go when weather is perfect. And watch out for birds if you eat outside.",
          "Very good and exact place to spend time",
          "Beautiful to let you know how our ancestors lived.",
          "Totally overpriced and simply too full",
          "Very well organized. Beautiful place , I love the traditional way of life.",
          "A wonderful and live look at the past and wildlife of Sweden .The Folk art is also amazing.",
          "Like a theme park but with exhibits instead of rides. All sorts of Swedish culture: glass workshop, furniture workshop, machine shop, printers, bookbinders, farmhouse, Sami village, zoo... All outdoors. Don't go on a rainy day.",
          "Great place to get out of the busy city vibe and immerse in the slow pace park. We learned a bit about the traditional Swedish life and played with the farm animals. It also offers a great view overlooking Stockholm.",
          "Fantastic open air museum, bringing history of how people used to live in different parts of Sweden to life, together with nordic animals. A great insight into rural Sweden in the heart of the city!",
          "I enjoyed my trip to Skansen. Animals had nice enclosures and I could see two bears playing in water from very close distance. I also saw some wolfs and wolverines which I haven't seen in many zoos. The historical houses were really fun to \u2026",
          "Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to look around the entire park. However I was able to see reindeers, drink coffee and eat pastry at a cafe located inside Skansen.",
          "Nice place, lovely people and great atmosphere!",
          "Great place to learn about the history and culture of Sweden. Children's activities really interactive.",
          "Skansen is a must have in Stockholm. We have been here in December while the beautiful Christmas market. We needed a lot longer than we thought. The whole park is full with little attractions. It's so lovely there. We will come back in summer again.",
          "This is a great place to visit, especially with children. You could probably spend the whole day there. One learns a lot about Sweden's history and there are plenty of cool buildings to view or visit. The highlight of our visit was the \u2026",
          "A must, for those who are visiting Stockholm in a sunny day. Lots of old buildings from rural areas, with reproduced scenes from five centuries of swedish history. Actors would tell you the stories and relevance of most places. Lots of relax and recreational areas, plus a bio-park, make this place ideal also with kids",
          "Really nice place for kids and family! Zoo, museum, park...",
          "A must when staying in Stockholm ! Skansen is the oldest open air museum and you will enjoy walking through sweden history and nature while visiting this one of a kind place.",
          "Great tourist attraction. Skansen is an organic zoo. It's a large area with many animals and it is very kid friendly. When it is busy it isn't noticable since the park is so large. Would definitely recommend to family either living in Stockholm and to tourists.",
          "A great place to come with a young family. Lots to do and see and plenty of places to grab a bite to eat. We queued for a little while to get in, but it was Easter weekend. Would recommend.",
          "Good place to hang around with kids.",
          "Was overall a really nice experience. Only downside was that in April when we visited a lot of buildings were closed and not a lot of costumed workers which was dissapointing but understandable since it was winter. Otherwise walking through \u2026",
          "there are awesome restaurants here and every 30 April eve there is a celebration called Walpurgis night which is a tradition to celebrate Spring time.  A huge fire is lit along with singing. Nice recreational facilities to bring family along as well, one needs to purchase an entry ticket though",
          "A lot of houses were closed unfortunately, but it was very calm and beautiful",
          "Very good place. Some say it can be viewed in 2 hours. This is not true. You can run thru on it in 2 hrs but will see nothing. Spent there a good 4-5 hours and we've been moving quite with a pace. Had a short (20mins) break to drink a \u2026",
          "An absolute must in Stockholm. Skansen is the oldest open air museum. It contains buildings from all over Sweden, animals like reindeer and moose, a model old town, restaurants, gift shops, aquariums and so much more. Entrance fee is 160 SEK, very VFM. Prepare to spend up to a day to fully explore it. Highly recommended!",
          "This place gives you a true glimpse into how life used to be in Sweden in the past. I really loved the zoo and the interactive museums. The glass blowing demonstration is really cool. If the weather is good, this should be a must visit on your trip to Stockholm",
          "Every time we go, it's different. And there's always something new to learn. If you ask questions and engage with the 'characters,' you will understand so much more about the history. Love this concept and this way of learning.",
          "What a fun place to visit.  Lovely Swedish village theme area and walks.  Food choices are very limited so may want to pack your own picnic.  Kids loved the play area and the mini zoo and a few rides.  Petting zoo was not open but they have that and horse ridong and an acquarium as well.",
          "This is one of the top things to do when you visit Stockholm. Skansen is a beautiful outdoor, historic Farmstead area where you could see how people used to live back in the 1600 and 1700\u2019s. This is located quite a bit outside of the \u2026",
          "It's a huge park. Except the open air museum consisting of traditional houses, farms and gardens, the basic ticket included access to the zoo, aquarium and baltic science centre. In houses there are real people talking as if they were in the past. Sort of a time traveling trip. Highly recommended!",
          "It is another world. The one that no longer exists.",
          "Great place to feel how was the Sweden of the past. The staff was lovely \ud83d\udc96",
          "Beautiful gardens, animals with their babies running around and a bit of Stockholm history all in one place. The area on which Skansen is located is a bit elevated in comparison to the rest so you can take cool pictures of the city.",
          "Great place to experience Swedish holidays",
          "We really enjoyed walking through historical houses and shops, seeing different people and learn about the Swedish culture,  it is such a unique experience.\nHowever, the area with the animals was heartbreaking for me. \nkeeping animals in \u2026",
          "A wonderful place to spend a day with kids. Lots of activities are happening all round the year.",

          "Unique outdoor museum that gives you a glimpse into life in the past in Sweden - both rural and urban. There are farmsteads, homes, workshops, stores as well as domestic and wild animals found in and around Sweden. Try to visit on a weekend \u2026",
          "This is a really beautiful place to visit in Stockholm. Skansen is the world\u2019s oldest open-air museum . Don't miss visiting the beautiful old wooden Church which is known as one of Sweden\u2019s most popular churches for weddings. Don't forget to visit the bakery from the 1870s and try a freshly baked bread or buns. There's a lot to see.",
          "Just came in today. Every sports are closed except 3 buildings. They charged in full before telling us that everything is closed. Make sure that you check at the counter before making the payment.",
          "To see old city of Sweden before Industrial time. You can also see lots of animal from Sweden. Really well treat. Large area. Good to go walk with kids or baby in strollers. Price is okay. Will be cheaper if you can take a year card. See my video exploring Skansen on Youtube NGATINISHOT",
          "Nice outdoor museum close to the center of Stockholm. The line 7 tramride is a great way to get there and see some sights along the way.\n\nMuseum consists mostly of historic Nordic buildings from various eras as well as animals native to the \u2026",
          "Just amazing. If you want to experience Sweden as it once was make sure you visit Skansen. It offers so much, it takes about 5 hours to visit all of it at a moderate pace. There are plenty of animals you can see as well as part of their zoo \u2026",
          "Something for everyone. Loved it!",
          "Beautiful outdoor museum, best in summer",
          "Great place to spend a warm summer day in Stockholm. Perfect for kids.",
          "I like the open air museum. You can imagine how people live back to 19 century. The animals are always fun to see. The location of Skansen is really good. High up on the hill you can see nice view OS Stockholm, especially the central Stockholm. I will go back for visit for sute",
          "Seemed way too quiet, couldn't go into any of the buildings except maybe 2. I didn't understand the purpose of this museum",
          "Best Museum ever",
          "Great place to experience nordic culture.",
          "Amazing park! I came here by myself as I had a free day and had a great time. The open air museum is very interesting and the Nordic animals area is wonderful for those visiting Sweden on a tight schedule. Staff are all very friendly and all demonstrations were in both Swedish and English - which is very helpful!",
          "Amazing place... So much to see and learn for Sweden. A lot of facilities to eat, drink and just fika :) There is a small zoo inside, but don't expect too much. The glassblowing was amazing and is totally worth it.",
          "Obligatory visit for tourists interested in Sweden. Also, animals. Don't get lost - this place is big.",
          "Very nice. Bears and seals are really wonderful",
          "This is World\u2019s first Open air museum and I suppose it to be biggest as well. There is so much to see, learn, cherish, and amazed about this place. Kids will love the Kids zoo. A must visit place if you\u2019re in Stockholm.",
          "Too much think close in the wintet time..",
          "Good place. But too much expensive entry tickets. Should be much less !\nLooks like a park with activity theater, more than a zoo with much lack of animals.",
          "I have been going to skansen for years regularly and have a years card. There is plenty to do here. I love the zoo, and there is so much history. It's great for kids and adults alike. The prices are a little high, but take a picnic and sit \u2026",

          "Nice with many different animals and nice food at the restaurants.",
          "Awesome open air museum/zoo. I went knowing very little about the place and had a grand time. The museum portion is amazing and pretty informative. They have all kinds of traditional workshops and trades going which is very unique. The zoo portion is also great where they have many of the regional animals available for viewing.",
          "Skansen Open-Air Museum is a favorite both among Stockholmers and visitors passing through, and it\u2019s a perfect family outing. \n\nThis is the oldest open-air museum in the world and also the Stockholm zoo, with animals native to Scandinavia. \u2026",
          "Love this place, you can relax here and look on animals or just enjoy nature",
          "Lovely museum and zoo. The zoo itself actually had some of the most naturalistic enclosures I\u2019ve ever seen. Visited a few days before Christmas and the staff gladly told me all about how Christmas was celebrated in the past and were obviously interested in it all themselves.",
          "Definitely a must see to better understand Swedish heritage.",
          "I spent 4 hours at Skansen and i have t got to see everything , other than i marked before on the map.

          "Amazing place to be, to visit with children, with parents, friends, relatives, beloved and even alone! Love Skansen!",
          "We arrived later in the day. A few of the exhibits we're still open, but we were disappointed that much of Skansen appeared to have closed up well in advance of it's scheduled close time. That which we did see was informative.",
          "Really it's a nice place.... You should have full day to roam around..... Unfortunately we couldn't see it nicely from inside view as we were late.... But still it took 2.5 hrs to overview the place ...",
          "I visited here during winter and although I  lost the sensation in my toes due to cold, it was a lot of fun. There was a bon fire to keep you warm with a small coffee shop to buy hot drinks, soup and freshly made waffles. There's a outer \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Vasa Museum (Swedish: Vasamuseet) is a maritime museum in Stockholm, Sweden. Located on the island of Djurg\u00e5rden, the museum displays the only almost fully intact 17th century ship that has ever been salvaged, the 64-gun warship Vasa that sank on her maiden voyage in 1628. The Vasa Museum opened in 1990 and, according to the official web site, is the most visited museum in Scandinavia. Together with other museums such as the Stockholm Maritime Museum, it belongs to the Swedish National Maritime Museums (SNMM).\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom the beginning of 1961 to 1988, Vasa was housed in a temporary structure called Wasavarvet (\"The Vasa Shipyard\") where she was treated with polyethylene glycol. Visitors could only view the ship from two levels and the maximum distance was only 5 m (17 ft). In 1981, the Swedish government decided that a permanent Vasa museum was to be constructed and a competition for the design of the museum building was organized. A total of 384 architects sent in models of their ideas and the final winners were Marianne Jakobb\u00e4ck and G\u00f6ran M\u00e5nsson with Ask (\"box\"). The construction of the new building began on and around the dry dock of the old naval yard with an inauguration ceremony hosted by Prince Bertil on 2 November 1987. Vasa was towed into the flooded dry dock under the new building in December 1987, and during the summer of 1989, when visitors were allowed onto the construction site, 228,000 people visited the half-finished museum. The museum was officially opened on 15 June 1990. So far, Vasa has been seen by over 25 million people. In 2017, the museum had a total of 1,495,760 visitors.The main hall contains the ship itself, and various exhibits related to the archaeological findings of the ships and early 17th-century Sweden. Vasa has been fitted with the lower sections of all three masts, a new bowsprit, winter rigging, and has had certain parts that were missing or heavily damaged replaced. The replacement parts have not been treated or painted and are therefore clearly visible against the original material that has been darkened after three centuries under water.\nThe new museum is dominated by a large copper roof with stylized masts that represent the actual height of Vasa when she was fully rigged. Parts of the building are covered in wooden panels painted in dark red, blue, tar black, ochre yellow and dark green. The interior is similarly decorated, with large sections of bare, unpainted concrete, including the entire ceiling. Inside the museum the ship can be seen from six levels, from her keel to the very top of the sterncastle. Around the ship are numerous exhibits and models portraying the construction, sinking, location and recovery of the ship. There are also exhibits that expand on the history of Sweden in the 17th century, providing background information for why the ship was built. A movie theatre shows a film in alternating languages on the recovery of the Vasa.\nThe museum is in the process of publishing an 8-volume archaeological report to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the salvage. Vasa I: The Archaeology of a Swedish Warship of 1628 was published at the end of 2006. Subsequent volumes will be published annually.The museum also features four other museum ships moored in the harbour outside: the ice breaker Sankt Erik (launched 1915), the lightvessel Finngrundet (1903), the torpedo boat Spica (1966) and the rescue boat Bernhard Ingelsson (1944).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Stockholm\nBeckholmen\nMary Rose Museum\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKvarning, Lars-\u00c5ke and Ohrelius, Bengt (1998) The Vasa - The Royal Ship ISBN 91-7486-581-1\nAnnual report of 2008 from Statens maritima museer(The National Maritime Museums)\n\n\n== External links ==\nVasa Museum homepage",

          "This was an amazing experience! Highly recommended for all of those who are lovers of history. PS, get there early.",
          "The museum was spacious. Many love the museum and I thought it was fine. Wouldn\u2019t bring my children, as it\u2019s dark and a bit austere.",
          "A must see when in Stockholm. You will get impressed by the ship and learn more about the history of Sweden. Great family tours and gift shop. Also a good restaurant, lunch or \u201cfika\u201d.",
          "We took the ferry boat from the key near Slussen then a short walk to a large red brick building. On entering you see this huge wooden sailing ship, the largest built, that sank due to no one daring to tell the king that the extra gun deck would make the design unstable. Ha\u013af a",
          "Nothing can prepare you for the size of the ship. It is beautiful. The museum is interesting and interactive. It has to be really dark in there as bright lights are harmful to the boat. Small restaurant at the top of the building for a pit stop. Takes a few hours to go round.",
          "This is an impressive museum with fascinating history. Go to the second and third levels for different vantage views of the ship",
          "I have never expected that we would spend half a day in a museum dedicated to just one ship. We arrived before the museum opened in order to avoid the crowd. First thing first, check out the activity schedule and plan your intended activities accordingly. The tour which is",
          "There is just so much to see here. The ship itself is simply spectacular. This alone is worth the visit, just amazing. You can definitely spend a quite a bit of time exploring the whole museum.",

          "We were tipped to go to this Museum. As it was raining, we decided to go. Upon entrance it looks dark, but when you get used to this and start reading/looking/listening the ship reveals its mysteries. We totally forgot our time and were sorry we had to leave! Must go!",
          "I had not planned on visiting the Vasa museum with the logic being that it could not be worth paying to see an old ship. I could not have been more wrong. This is a unique opportunity to see an actual 18th century ship which has been perfectly taken care of and which will",

          "If you only have time for one museum, go to this one! We walked here from the main Galma Stan area and it took about 30 min. It was a beautiful walk by the water. The atmosphere of the museum definitely matched the Vasa and its history. You pay to enter then have access to",
          "Viewing such as well-preserved ship from the 1600s was fascinating as was learning about how archeologists recovered it. Well worth a visit, but be prepared for dark lighting.",
          "This is a Stockholm\u2019s Must! This is one of the most important and particular Navy museum in all Europe. It has a particularly history that is good to know.",
          "Be careful that you check beforehand about purchasing tickets in anticipation of a trip. Granted that no one would have know before it happened, but we planned out trip several months before the first coronavirus infection was reported and bought tickets. We checked the day",
          "If you are ever in Stockholm, these two museums, which are right next to each other, are a must. The vasa is a ship that was pulled from the icy waters and is completely preserved and very ornate. If you are ever in Stockholm I recommend an afternoon at these museums.",
          "Really interesting and so well organised with enough information but not too much! The ship itself is fascinating and I appreciated the exhibition focusing on the women's roles.",
          "We planned 2 hours for Vasa museum but it was so interesting we forgot to leave. Vasa museum it's a MUST in Stocholm. You can learn all about the fully intact 17th century ship and about Sweden's history.",

          "Extremely interesting and well done displayes along with seeing the ship itself makes it one of my favorite museums to bring my out of town guests to. I do find children don't do well there, too much reading for young kids to enjoy.",
          "Great museum with the displays really well set out. Great information on all aspects from 17th century life to the raising of the Varsa and its subsequent history. If you visit one museum in Stockholm this is it...utterly brilliant!",
          "One of the best museums in Stockholm. Be suprised about this unique museum. Also situated at a great location.",
          "I have visited many museums but this is one of the best museum all over the world. You can see many interesting things.",
          "Slightly underwhelmed with this. Hyped as the most visited museum in all Scandinavian countries, it must count as a striking example of flawed ship design. The ship is a monstrosity and the museum is funny for showing how the eternal aggressive drive to impress and rule over the",
          "Early March is a great time to visit. No crowds. Don\u2019t miss the gift shop. Unbelievable ship. Do take the guided tour, short but informative.",
          "To have a museum built around a ship is remarkable! It\u2019s a shame the staff have such poor customer service. Unfortunately the experience was ruined by unhelpful, lazy and rude staff. Even with a \u201cterrible\u201d review, I do recommend you visit this price of history just expect",
          "This is a must visit when jn Stockholm. The galleon is 98% original and when considering that it had spent 333 years laying on the seabed - it is unbelievable! Very interesting and comprehensive with a multitude of visual aids - the visit is enjoyable to both kids and adults",
          "This is a amazing opportunity to visit to see a real old battleship of it\u2019s kind. You can feel the size by viewing it from bottom to the top.",
          "Sent with the family and all of us found it very interesting. Even the three year old found things to see and do",
          "The whole museum is dedicated to one historical war ship, that was completely renovated afrer 333 years beeing under water. A lot of details from past, really interested, if you have 2 hours, surely go there. Good to see film at the beginning.",
          "Thought it would be bigger. Saw the museum with the tour in English, which I recommend to understand more about the ship.",
          "This museum is a must visit museum in Stockholm. It is the beautiful Vasa, a ship, built between 1626 and 1628, that sunk in the harbor on her maiden voyage. It has been wonderfully preserved and provides a rare look into a seventeenth century ship.",
          "I've visited Vasa Museum twice and it let me speechless every time! A great setting for Vasa's History.",
          "I would consider this a must see while in Stockholm, really enjoyed seeing the ship and the other exhibits in the museum.",
          "Fascinating to see this centuries-old boat in most of its glory. To see the colors preserved (or recreated) and hear the history of how it was preserved were highlights for me. I definitely recommend starting with a tour that takes you around the ship",
          "Vassa is breathtaking to look at but at the end of the day it's only the boat to see and not much else!",
          "To see a full ship is a very rare experience. I would also recommend guided tours, which tells you a lot about Swedish history. This also will help to cover many things you would like to know while touring in Stockholm.",
          "It's just amazing to see the ship ...tho Its not as glossy as u would see in pictures ...but it's still very interesting with such minute details and carvings",
          "Many museum elicit groans from at least one family member but I can\u2019t imagine anyone, of any age not being absolutely captivated by this exhibit. There is something for every age here, a trip through history for some, hands on things and dioramas for others, science and social",
          "To see a ship that is 98% intact, after sinking in 1629, is an otherworldly experience. Pictures don\u2019t do it justice! If you are a history buff, a sailor, or just interested in a significant piece of Sweden\u2019s history, the Vasa Museum does not disappoint! It\u2019s a true must see!!",
          "The Vasa is worth going to see even though it is a celebration of maritime failure. Extraordinary task to lift this off the riverbed and preserve.",
          "What a big boat It was great to read about the history of the boat and how families lived back in those times",
          "World-class museum. Incredible restoration, well told story, helpful staff, immaculately presented. Thorough recommend..",
          "We were amazed to see the huge ship considering that it was made in the 1600s. The visit was informative it included information on the recovery and extraction of the ship. The museum is worth 1-2 hours visit. Entry is free for below 18 years old, for adults entry is SEK 150",
          "The retrieval and restoration of this amazing sailing ship is well worth a visit at any time of year as it is wholly contained within a purpose built museum. It is easily accessed by local ferry or tram.",
          "I was quite overwhelmed by the size of this ship and to learn about its short maiden voyage and return to Stockholm harbour. It is an absolute must if you visit downtown Stockholm and a brilliant visit. I learned a great deal about a part of Europe and it\u2019s wars I was never",
          "Three hours just flew by in this amazing museum. If you're a history buff, it's a must. Even if you're not , there's enough well presented and intriguing reconstructions, displays and films to keep the whole family entertained. The actual ship, rescued almost intact from a 300",
          "I think it\u2019s one of the best places to visit if you want to go to museum in Stockholm. Very nicely rebuilt ship!",
          "If you don\u2019t know anything about the Vasa to begin with, I recommend watching the short movie that is played continuously near the entrance to the museum. Seriously remarkable restoration project\u2014 very cool to walk around and look at all the details\u2014 there is a LOT to see in",
          "Vasa museum is much different than any other museums you may have visited in the past. It's well made and very impressive. The fact that you get to approach such an old ship wreck is really unique.",
          "I am not a great fan of boats or naval history. But this is so much more. The Vasa itself is a stunning sight \u2013 it is difficult to imagine how awe inspiring she must have appeared on her maiden voyage. The detail of the ship and the lives of those who would have seen her,",
          "If you love history, you will love this museum. For any brits that loved the Mary Rose in Portsmouth, you will be gobsmacked by the Vasa. The museum is well organised with free guides at certain times of the day in numerous languages. Theres also lots of boards in English",
          "While doing research, the Vasamuseet has been recommended by many other visitors. I agree it\u2019s one of the museums that is a must-go in Stockholm. Remember to try to catch a guided tour (included in admission fee) because the history and details that these guides can give you",
          "Everyone said \"you must go see Vasa\" but it's just an old boat right? The trip on the tram in the steady drizzle did not help to set expectations high, the entrance to the museum is relatively low key and there were not many people buzzing around but I gave it a go and paid my",
          "Public transport via ferry is very convenient. There are a couple of museums in this vicinity, makes for a good day our. The guided tour is worth the money.",
          "This was one of the greatest things we've ever seen. The scale is mindblowing, the story is really interesting and the presentation is excellent. Please visit this incredible museum. The best thing to do in Stockholm.",
          "My friend was little shocked I want to come here, that what could be interesting about some boat wreck. But at the end she was also thrilled. I think the museum squeezed the maximum from this discovery. Recommended!",
          "The Vasa has been high on my bucket list for nearly 4 decades. And it was absolutely worth the wait. The ship is incredible and the exhibits and displays around and about it were fascinating, informative, and moving. I wound up spending 5 hours in the museum!!",
          "It\u2019s a special place to go,audio guide in many languages for free using own smartphones and better to bring a earphones to avoid noise distractions. If you like something like this it can be spending long time to look at and it has 7 levels, coats and locker service are free and",
          "The Vasa Museet takes the visitor right next to the restored battleship from the 1600's, which is something that you don't get to experience too often. The ship is unique and the story behind it is indeed interesting. We visited the museum with the family and the kids (8 and",
          "Quite the most stunning wow factor museum I have ever visited. Breathtaking. I thought two hours would be enough but was there for four hours",
          "This is such a great exhibit both in terms of history and scale. You learn so much about the history of Stockholm (and Sweden) while learning about this fateful voyage. Very nearby other great attractions so make it part of one of your tourist days.",
          "Amazing museum with detailed explanations on the sinking and founding/putting the Vasa boat on this great museum.",
          "Impressive! Did the tour. Only 30 min long. But gave a good overview. Has 6 floors of of exhibits. Would recommend this tour for all ages. Cafe was very good also.",
          "Enjoyed learning about the Vasa, the history around it and how it came to be sitting in the museum. The sheer size of it is awesome. Would recommend.",
          "Couldn't believe the spectacular view as soon as I entered the main hall.....got to be seen to be believed. (I would liken it to seeing the Saturn v rocket in Cape Canaveral....totally mind blowing)The ship is huge and in fantastic condition with an amazing story. A must visit",
          "A fantastic museum. The Vasa is displayed in all her magnificent glory. Such a huge ship. Plenty of interactive stuff for kids and interesting reading and displays for adults. Set aside at least 3hrs",
          "Poor ship only sailed a short distance before it sunk but what an achievement to raise it whole so we can see it\u2019s glory. Tours in English and a film about the raising too.",
          "Really worthwhile visiting, we where surprised about the stories and other information. Fantastic to imagine how people really lived at that time. Go there, i would advise everybody to visit this! Have fun!!!",
          "It\u2019s was interesting to hear about vikings (colonisers). The ship structure is stunning, a slightly sanitised history, but worth it. Very informative",
          "When we visit places we generally aren't museum goers but we really enjoyed this. You visit different levels that are set all around the ship. It informs you about the crew and there are artifacts dotted around - Clothes, money, cooking utensils etc. It really demonstrates how",
          "Allows for getting a good understanding of both historical facts and the actual feeling of being at sea at that time. Well worth a visit",
          "Excellent experience. Great history to be seen and totally informative information. We entered at peak time and it wasn\u2019t too overcrowded. A must see if you enjoy history and old craftsmanship.",
          "All I can say is Wow! As soon as you walk through the entrance you see this impressive ship, over 300 years under the water and recovered in all of its glory, in fact it is over 96% original is just unbelievable. We spent 4 hours walking around, there is so much to see, and",
          "Visited the Vasa Museum this afternoon with our teenage son. Wow - as soon as you walk through the door you are met with the enormity of this ship. We went into the auditorium to listen to the history of the ship which was very interesting also & a must. We ate in the",
          "Spectacular - there is no other word to describe the view that awaits you, as you walk through the door from the lobby into the vast hall of this museum. Just as amazing as the incredibly well-preserved ship at the number ous galleries and exhibits, explaining in a fascinating",
          "When you walk in..., you gasp.....this is amazing...loved seeing this fantastic ship, highly recommend!",
          "If one museum only in Stockholm - this is the one. It has it all. Drama, lighting, beauty and uniqueness.",
          "The Vasa museum was amazing! Easy to get to and well worth a visit. The museum was very informative and the ship was incredible to look at. The museum itself was very nicely layed out and I also admired the overall architecture of the place. I highly recommend visiting the",
          "Quick and simple review- the sound of visiting a boat museum didn\u2019t really sound appealing to us but our concierge highly recommended it saying he wasn\u2019t into boats either! Wow- it is breathtaking from the moment you walk in- that\u2019s all you need to know",
          "The completelly recovered vikings` ship Vasa in a great museum. Must see in STO. This unique 5 stories museum desplays this fascinating ship in a original state.",
          "Must visit if you are traveling to Sweden. You\u2019ll learn a lot about the heritage and culture of the Vikings who lived in Scandinavia long ago. If you are a student I highly suggest to bring your student ID.",
          "This is a must when visiting Stockholm, a 500 year old ship with cannons fully restored, it\u2019s amazing!!",
          "The over 350 years old Ship was rennovated after 300 years unser water - with dedication and endless patience. My 8 years old son loved it. For me it was very interesting as well. Unfortunatly (at the moment?) you can't enter the Vasa. But all the exibitions and historical icons",
          "Architecture wise ,It\u2019s great how they moved the ship inside and kept it in good shape and restore all the details, but I think need more lighting we found it a bit dark",
          "The Museum has interesting stories about the boat and the man who built it! It is sometimes fun and impressive to watch. Not realy expensive. Perfect for a cold or rainy day !!",
          "Very well done museum, the ships itself is incredible to see close up. Nice restaurant/cafe. Good information and exhibits, we really enjoyed our visit.",
          "Big highlight visit of our visit in Stockholm this year. You will so small once there, the boat itself is very impressive, the story and the way it is presented in the museum is great. You should definitely go there when in Stockholm. The fact that it\u2019s spread on different",
          "Very interesting museum with informative guided tours and film presentations. First visited approx 20 years ago and still find it just as good with updated exhibits. I won't spoil the story o f the Royal ship Vasa and havent yet visited The Mary Rose but can't imagine it being",
          "Everything about this museum was well thought out. It was easily my favorite museum I\u2019ve ever been to! They give an interesting history of the ship, the people and Europe. It\u2019s a great place for all ages because the exhibit is both parts interactive and reading and it\u2019s free if",
          "My second time through and it was still as interesting. learning new things. Give yourself a good couple of hours and visit each deck. We also had a tour that was very helpful.",
          "Really interesting and the only ship with that much history that is authentic. Wonderful wood work. You can use your phone at different stops and they show a very informative movie.",
          "The ticket costs 150SEK and has a shop out front. The Vasa ship itself is huge and the exhibition is very well done. Certainly worth a visit!",
          "I went with some friends for the English tour. The ship is truly a marvel, and the history behind it is fascinating. Our tour guide's name was Karl-Simon, and he did an excellent job. He was very easy to understand in English, funny and threw in a lot of fun facts. He also",
          "Very interesting museum with lots of displays and obviously the big draw card - the Vasa itself! The many levels allow for viewing of the whole ship from top to bottom. Plenty of information available around the museum in English or there is the availability of guided talks and",
          "From the outside the building in impressive, walk in through the three environment controlling doors to see a 97% original 400 year old warship retried from the icy depths of Stockholm Harbour is breathtaking. The boat is surrounded by floors of beautifully presented history....",
          "LOVE grate museum. My wife is not mutch museum person but she loved Vasa to. Grate for all. If you do one thing in Stockholm go to Vasa",
          "Pictures can not describe how beautiful is the place, it is a must in Stockholm. The museum explain everything h related to the warship vasa, the real warship is there and it is stunning.",
          "The Vasa (a boat) has a fascinating history and it is just as interesting how they salvaged the Vasa from Stockholm Harbour after 300 years.",
          "It is all about a ship. Quite simply stunning. An amazing museum & you get to feel what it was built for & what it was about.",
          "This museum is really spectacular! It hosts a huge navy battle ship from the 16th century which sank on its maiden voyage. Still more than 95% of it is authentic. It tells the stories of life during these ages, how it was recovered and the people on board. It's a definite must",
          "This museum, built around the salvaged four hundred year old entire ship, tells you so much about life in Swenden and on board ship at the time. Tours available too - but there is so much info and great displays and films, you may not need it.",
          "I got impressed by the fantastic state of preservation, the stories about the wreck\u2019s history, I strongly recommend it!",
          "The museum is spectacular! I never had such feelings from visiting other museums. This one is unique! Great! Fantastic. Worth visiting, first place in Stockholm. The object (ship) is above the imagination! Great job was done reconstructing it for about 30 years!!! And very well",
          "We visited this museum with a big group as tourists. The museum is quite well organised and has depicted lots of interesting history. We had a local guide explain to us the place and then had free time to explore on our own. Museum staff could be placed at vantage points to",
          "I visited the ship with my 3 children, 10-13 y.o. We can speak Swedish so we joined the guiding group without having to wait for the english speaking.... Informative and interesting. A very thoroughly planned museum.",
          "Interesting museum with lots of new insights into 17th century Sweden. Could be a bit more interactive. Audio tour (for free, bring your phone and earplugs and go to the Vasa website) was a good addition.",
          "Firstly it is a very well located Museum which is about a 20-25 minute walk from the train station. On entry to the museum the staff seem happy and friendly and helpful. After buying a ticket there are 3 weighty doors to pass through to help with climate control. The ship is",
          "We took an English based tour which gave us a good overview of the ship and its history. There are several floors and many different aspects of this recovered ship to learn about. I really enjoyed this museum. It was well worth our time to visit.",
          "If you do not know what you will see, you just stay with an open mouth! My husband did not, so when we entered he was stunned! It is a unique museum, where you can learn a lot about its- the boat's- story. Worth a visit , even if it is the only museum you will visit when you are",
          "If you go to just one of the plentiful supply of museums in Stockholm then this is the one. Not to be missed. It was a dizzying and extraordinary experience. Highly recommended and very well done.",
          "This is an interesting exhibit with a great story Ship has been preserved well but it has a lot to say about the engineering design of that era a lot of time and money wasted to sink in the harbor",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. It has a whole ship from 400 years ago which you can view at several levels. It also has dioramas of how the ship and the shipyard. Very engaging. I am a history buff so it would not be a wonder that I enjoyed myself so much in the museum. But",
          "The first thing we did once inside this museum was to watch the 10 minute movie in the the theatre. Next was a short, guided tour and then a wander around by ourselves. What a marvellous place this is. Amazed at the size and condition of the Vaas. The work that has gone into",
          "The ship was an amazing backdrop for a formal dinner. Tour guides were extremely entertaining. Exhibits to walk through were very well done.",
          "The museum shows a beautifully preserved wooden ship and has an excellent film in a variety of languages with English subtitles. Because of very poor design it sank on its first voyage. The ship remained under water for three centuries before being salvaged.",
          "Seeing the Vasa is an amazing experience. A fully preserved historic war ship. The story behind why it is so well preserved is worth learning. A must. A unique & interesting museum. The Vasa is stunning to behold! The craftmenship and beauty of this boat is quite stunning. Easy",
          "The absolute must see museum in Stockholm. Salvaged 1628 warship with the story told and associated exhibits. All have English translations.",
          "As part of an insight tour we visited this museum which houses the shipwreck of the Vasa and many other artifacts found near the ship. It would be easy to spend many hours here, unfortunately we didn't get much time to soak it all in. Highly recommended.",
          "So a friend of mine dragged me there, thinking that it would be an awesome experience. Don't get me wrong, it certainly was a fascinating experience. The restoration of the ship, the size of it, actually seeing how it would be living in a ship to how it would look like coloured",
          "Vas\u2019s Museum is great; went there using the Stockholm pass 4 times over the past 10 years; should not miss",
          "It's an old ship shunk and restored. Only the history of how they got it out the sea is enough to visit it.",
          "This is a must see if in Stockholm as the museum has so much to offer. The actual ship is extraordinary, it is unbelievable that is was submerged for so long. There are many parts to the museum and lots of mini exhibits about different aspects of the ship and history. Would",
          "Great for kids, interactive museum and plus the ship is incredible sight, well worth a visit. God tip- go early in the morning, later it may become very busy",
          "2nd time visited, first with our child. 8 year old absolutely loved it, she said \u201cit was totally amazing\u201d. Not expensive either.",
          "I'm not a big fan of Maritime topics or ships in general but I visited this \"because I had to\" while I the area and I was not disappointed. The Vasa was quite humbling to see. It was pretty crowded while I was there which made it a bit uncomfortable for an introvert but there",
          "I'm usually not into museums, it's like, \"OK, another old thing\", but this was really cool and worth the time.",
          "Amazing museum to learn about viking ship and good deal if getting museum pass. Close to nordic museum, viking museum, spirit museum and more in the area so you can plan a full day",
          "What a beautiful wreck, they sure knew how to build good looking ships back in the day. Very interesting details on how they are working to preserve the wreck. Worth a visit.",
          "Could have spent the whole day here, amazing one-of-a-kind experience and they don't leave a stone unturned, unlike the ship's designer who had major problems with the ballast.",
          "The Vasa is not a sterile museum. It provides for a very interesting and informative visit. After an introductory film, you can wander on several floors to see the ship from different vantage points. There are some interactive, hands-on opportunities that give you a glimpse",
          "We had visited the Mary Rose in Plymouth just a few months earlier, similar idea but this was way more impressive",
          "We spent about 90 minutes walking through the various exhibits, mostly focusing on taking in the amazing ship. It was not terribly crowded and did not require us to get tickets before hand. I would recommend doing a self guided tour.",
          "Located next to Nordiska Museet, this museum housed the almost complete warship Vasa. It was quite a busy museum when we visited around noon but there were plenty of ticket kiosks so queueing wasn't a problem. Storage lockers for bags were included. The museum spans several",
          "The ship has a good story behind it. But the museum was all about it. Don't expect too much. If you love the architectural of ships, then this is the place.",
          "We planned for a visit to the Vasa museum and thought we would be out in a couple of hours. It is just a ship and hence how long can we stay there. We were absolutely wrong! We spend almost 4 hours here and had to tell ourselves to leave so that we could make it to the other",
          "The Vasa Museum was extremely educational and interesting, the boat was absolutely enormous and excellently preserved - 95% the original boat! Really beautiful to see in real life.",
          "There have been so many praises about this museum, so expectations were high. Well, for me, it is not as outstanding as it was told to me. It is just like a mid-size museum in any European country. The story is a bit interesting though, a sunk ship was found and restored and",
          "World class display of a 17th century Swedish navy ship that sank on its maiden voyage. Contemporary museum is dedicated to this master piece of ship building, that admittedly, had a fatal design flaw. Suitable for all ages.",
          "The Vasa museum is a very nice museum to see as a visitor or inhabitant. The museum holds the world's best preserved 17th century ship. The Vasa ship capsized and sank in Stockholm 1628. After 333 years on the sea bed the mighty warship was salvaged. The museum is located on",
          "We had an awesome experience at the museum. The work they have done on the project is stunning. I'd highly recommend a visit. However, watch out for the taxis outside. Ask questions. We got a criminal who charged $57 for a $16 ride.",
          "Very nice museum ! Impressive presentation of the old Vasa ship, we much appreciated the introductory movie",
          "Vasa is an interesting museum to visit. It is solely based on the capsized ship \u2018Vasa\u2019. But the way the museum is designed and the little 20 min show played... it all comes together and makes the visit worthwhile. Highly recommended.",
          "I wanted to give this a 3.5 but that isn't an option. Anyway, it's shocking to me that this is the #1 thing to do in Stockholm on TA. Yes, the massive ship is impressive and I did find the preservation process as well as how preserved things remained after all of that time",
          "The museum is dedicated to one ship, a huge, massive impressive ship that sank in its first voyage, so it is 98% original! Truly astonishing!",
          "Use every accolade and you still will not adequately describe the phenomenal beauty, enormity or historical significance of the Vasa Museum. It's just beyond wonderful, with the ancient vessel in its full glory, as if it were setting sail in 1628. While England boasts the",
          "Let me start by saying I am not a big museum person but I loved this one. Everything here is centered around the Vasa. You enter the museum and immediately you are presented with the ship. No waiting and passing thru smaller rooms for the build up. The Vasa is the museum and",
          "The Vasa Museum is a \u201cmust see\u201d museum in Stockholm. The ship is amazing, as was the recovery and restoration efforts. Definitely worth spending half a day here.",
          "A very interesting and factual tale of the Vasa and how she sank moments after she was launched. I was particularly interested in the innovative diving equipment they used after she sank in order to rescue the canon and other treasurers aboard her. Well worth a visit.",
          "I was mesmerized by this ship! It's breathtaking just the thought of everything it has gone through and it is still looking awesome.",
          "All reviews say this a must visit and they weren\u2019t mistaken. Well laid out, good free tours, good, video, and excellent free audio tour. You will spend much longer there than you would think given it is just one boat.",
          "I am not a big fan of museums, but seeing an old war ship at it full size and some really interesting aspects on this ship and how to preserve it was just stunning!",
          "Everything about this place is impressive and overwhelming. From the actual ship to the footage of its rescue. I\u2019ll never forget it!",

          "At first I thought, how boring a museum with a Viking ship in it but as it was rated the #1 thing to do in Stockholm I thought we should check it out. We caught the #7 tram from near Central Station which was easy to do and convenient and saved us walking in the cold. This",
          "We visited this Museum during our first visit to Stockholm this new year time. Walking in and seeing this amazing ship that was recovered was truly breathtaking . A really fascinating story and one not to be missed.",
          "Amazing story and presentation of a stunning and well preserved wooden shipwreck. Terrific tour guides added a great deal. Note that the museum is kept cool to help preserve the ship, so good to dress in layers. Helpful free lockers where you can leave coats and.or go",

          "Found this museum fascinating and very interesting. Make sure you watch the film when you get there and go on the free guided tour that takes 20 minutes!",
          "The Vasa museum was great. The ship was huge and it is so incredible to walk around it - it is hard to believe that it sat under the ocean for so many years. This museum exceeded our expectations. You can view it over many levels learning about life at time and there are audio",
          "The most stunning wooden shipwreck I have ever seen and presented so beautifully so that you can marvel at this warship at all levels.",
          "Itis one of the top sights in Stockholm and when you visit the museum, you realize why! Not only the ship that is almost 100% original but also the venue itself that it was build around Vasa to highlight every aspect of it and keep it in a good shape as long as possible. AMAZING!",
          "Spacious, warm, uncrowded, well organised. The ship was beyond our expectations and the free guided tour was excellent.",
          "Not to be missed by any age visitor. The Vasa is the best kept and pristine shipwreck to be seen in all its majesty. Incredibly well keeps with an amazing history you can travel back in time and dream how life was onboard during it's short life. It sunk on its maiden voyage. Go",
          "The Vasa is amazing, from the second you walk in the door you are struck by the majesty of the ship and the magnitude of the task to raise it from the sea bed for so many of us to now enjoy! Can\u2019t believe it in such great condition! A must for anyone who likes history and even",
          "Well worth an hour or two. I enjoyed the history available about the era, and bravo on the exhibit about women\u2019s role at the time, though the latter could be more fleshed out. (It felt thrown together and as if it were done because a law or policy said it had to be done.)",
          "Vasa is majestic and I don\u2019t recall seeing something similar anywhere else. The story behind it is amazing. Don\u2019t miss it while you\u2019re in Stockholm!",
          "Great exhibits, fascinating background history, enjoyable informational videos. Also very clean! Wonderful experience, would recommend to anyone, regardless of interest in history.",
          "Unique in the world. Fantastic. Intelligently designed to enable visitors to see each level and have an overview. Great for adults and children",
          "A beautiful museum and the ship is a sight to behold. Well planned set-up with easy access to information and spots to take some good pictures. Would definitely take out an hour atleast to see the museum as a whole. Fairly crowded.",
          "The Vasa looks like something straight out of Pirates of the Caribbean. With an intriguing history, even going purely for the visual amazement is worth every second. You\u2019ll never see anything like it! An absolute wonder.",
          "I was super impressed! What amazing history. A piece of interesting history that everyone must know about. The Vasa museum is child friendly, wheelchair accessible, elevators to reach the different floors, auditoriums, a picnic area you can take your own food and a",
          "If you have to choose only one museum in Stockholm, this should be it. The ship itself is impressive, there are a lot of entertainment for children and merchandise in the gift shop is fun!",
          "It\u2019s remarkable to see such an amazing restoration and history! 7 floors to feel your curiosity to a maximum. It\u2019s brilliant",
          "Museum with an old and enormous ship made of wood that it's amazing to see. It's not a must see museum but if you have time it's fine to spend it there.",
          "Quite an amazing story and restoration of a 400 year old ship. You could dismiss the museum as simply a old big boat - but undertsanding the history and many stories of the Vasa is fascinating and not many places (if any) you will see this.",
          "A really well-crafted exhibit of a truly amazing piece of underwater archaeology. I remember reading about the Vasa and its raising when I was a kid, so this was an exciting experience for me. Huge amount of information and lots of retrieved artifacts in amazing condition.",
          "This museum is FANTASTIC. As a 400+ year old viking ship that sat under water for hundreds of years, the preservation of the ship is phenomenal. I still cannot believe how BIG the ship is. This museum is a must see while visiting Stockholm! The admission is very affordable and",
          "I was on business trip and had one day off. My friend in Stockholm recommend me Vasa museum. Though I don\u2019t like museums but since it was strongly recommended so I thought of visiting for few minutes. But when I entered I was so surprised and glad to see such a huge ship. And",
          "Displaying the vamous Vasa ship of the 17th century, a very interesting maritime museum in Stockholm.",
          "After reading some negative reviews we were a little sceptical but totally loved this museum. The sheer size, history and detail in this ship is totally worth the visit.",
          "We were blow away by this from the moment we walked through the door, the history is incredible and something I was not prepared for, it is a striking and dominant piece and the museum is such a great layout with plenty for the kids to keep interested.",
          "It's impressive to think that the vessel stayed more than 3 centuries under the water and is still in pretty good shape. A place to visit and learn how the vessel was built, with beautiful wooden sculptures, and how it was finally rescued.",
          "When I was a kid, my grandparents visited the Vasa Museum and bought me a book called the Vasa Saga (which they still sell \u2026 much to my delight!). So when we decided to visit Stockholm, the Vasa Museum was at the VERY top of my list and I wasn't disappointed at all. The only",
          "It was certainly one of the highlights during my visit in Stockholm. It is a Museum featuring the well-preserved, 17th-century warship, Vasa, that sank on her maiden voyage in 1628. Start off with a short informative film about the ship, available in a variety of languages with",
          "Trust me wheter you are young or old, you are going to love this. Never seen anything like this ship. Supersized, only when standing near can you really feel the power and size of it.",
          "I was travelling to Stockholm for the weekend and my cousin, who had been there before, highly recommended the Vasa museum. Even though I had an idea it'd be great, it was 10x better than I thought! The best part is when you first walk in the area where the ship is, it's",
          "We definitely under estimated the visit. I was by far a highlight of our visit to Sweden. Rich history.",
          "What an experience this was. This ship was under the sea for more than 300 years. The preservation of this ship is a credit to the Swedish nation. The ship and the exhibits are fantastic and very informative.",
          "There was a large area whit great lighting. Every thing was amazing. I recommend to whacating short clips about Vasa's story before seeing the ship.I enjoyed visiting this ship full of artistic detail.",
          "well worth visiting!!! unique place with a fantastic boat for the whole family to see!! if you go to stockholm this is a must!",
          "Impressive ship and very detailed information about the ship and history. It was a nice visit to see an old ship and experience how it was back then.",
          "Let\u2019s face it.. thanks to the bad engineering the ship sank almost immediately in the harbor of Stockholm. But so immensely impressive to see it put back together in what used to be an old dry dock. What a great museum. Wow! Must see!",
          "A must-see if you\u2019re in Stockholm and have an interest in history or boats or both. The story of the Vasa is incredible in itself, however it\u2019s the vessel itself which is absolutely awe inspiring. The museum has been built around the Vasa which is now in its own dry dock. You",
          "Definitely worth a visit to this museum. They have done a great job in preserving the ancient ship. You get to see the making of the ship and the history.",
          "What a fantastic experience both myself and the wife were completely blown away from the first step you take inside the museum, what an incredible story and the memory of the day will last with me forever",
          "Turning a flop to a success- what an achievement. It's interesting and it gives a good glimpse of history from another point of view, the simple worker",
          "Unbelievable atmosphere. Before visiting the museum, I recommend you to watch the movie in the entrance hall.",
          "We arrived here about 30min after opening. There weren\u2019t much people bit after a while that changed. There are lockers to put your coats away. Check out the english introduction film about the ship at 11 AM. The Vasa is amazing to see.",
          "Had it not been for the ship's bad design and its failed maiden voyage, we wouldn't have the opportunity to see it today. This is a 400 year old, 95% complete, warship - where else can you see this? Cheap entry, great 17 minute film, free guided tours and thoughtfully",
          "VASA is a nice attraction to stop by, however, if you do not have much time in town and unless you are really fond of its history, I would skip it. Stockholm has lots to see and the couple of hours we spent at the museum made us leave other attractions behind.",
          "The museum is built around the ship, giving it a unique shape and letting visitors get a good view of the vessel up close, from all angles. Informative signboards and multi-media displays everywhere. Free guided tours offered regularly in multiple languages. My favourite section",
          "You will meet not only the ship but also the people from the era. Excellent displays and interactive learning. Great for both families with small kids and adults.",
          "At my last business trip to Stockholm I finally decided to do some sightseeing. And after doing the usual hop-on-hop-off bus tour I decided to follow the advice on my little tour guy book to visit the Vasa Museum. I never had heard of the Vasa before and was astonished that they",
          "I knew a little of the history of the Vasa, but nothing compares to actually seeing her. A wonderful afternoon spent looking around the entire exhibition.",
          "This was just an amazing museum to visit!! This is the one place to visit when you go to Stockholm!!",
          "This museum is a must see when in Stockholm. We got right in and were able to see the vessel up close. The film also helps to understand how the Vasa failed and how they were able to salvage it. The museum staff were very well versed and always answered your questions. Don't",
          "Fascinating due to original ship, a touch of history you can feel there and stand and look in owe! Stories make it even more real and impressive!",
          "One of the best experiences in Stockholm and I highly recommend anyone visiting to take the time out and see this awesome museum. Free guided tour is the cherry on top.",
          "A must when visiting Stockholm. Impressive! use the early morning hours to avoid queuing at the entrance and to stroll through the museum with a limited number of vistors.",
          "A unique experience in a great location. One of the best museums I have ever been to and a must visit if you are in Stockholm.",
          "I was not expecting to enjoy this quite as much as I did, but it was a wonderfully insightful few hours. A beautifully curated exhibition, with incredible attention to detail. We did the guided tour which provided a little extra insight. If you only have a day in Stockholm,",
          "You need to make sure that you have min. 2 hours to fully appreciate this place. Fully recommend to visit all the floors, each one provides unique perspective on the ship.",
          "We decided to see that \"ship in a musem\" we were told about. We started with a walk from Gamla-Stockholm to the Vasa-Museum (but 30 minutes) which was an experience in itself. After arrving some of us where happy to find a public toilet :) Arrived in the Musem we bought a",
          "An amazing experience and a most see for historians and navy people. I went there with my dad, both of us served in the Israeli navy and we both had a good time together.",
          "Extremely impressive and informative museum detailing the ship Vasa, it's creation and sinking, as well as the time period around it. The ship itself is incredibly impressive - amazing that the staff have done so well to preserve its condition and continue to do so. The 'side'",
          "The Vasa Museum is one of the most entertaining and organised museums in Stockholm. Here you can see the unique and well preserved warship Vasa with lot of interesting exebitions. I really suggest you visiting it.",
          "I was here with work. The ship itselfe is very impressive. It\u00b4s quit cool walking around it and you get overwhelmed.",
          "Amazing and well worth the visit. Please dont miss this place. The exhibition is really informative and good for all ages. Seeing the Vassa was breathtaking as I wasnt expecting it to be so large.",
          "After reading all the reviews, I knew we needed to visit this museum, but we were all surprised by how much we all ended up liking it! We were all fascinated and really got caught up in the story. I do agree with another reviewer who said that there isn't as much for children",
          "In general is interesting to se the boat, but little bit complicated to visit with young children- there is almost most nothing for them to do there. Not complaining, but comparing to other Stockholm\u2019s museums.",
          "The museum vastly exceeded my expectations. We learned not just about the amazing ship itself, but so much about life in Stockholm in the early 1600's as well. Great interactive displays along with films and artifact exhibitions. A great value for the money, too, since the",
          "The history and the restoration is well worth a visit . It\u2019s a remarkable part of Swedish history . It\u2019s accessible with the hop on bus line.",
          "You get to see a really old ship from close. The museum has 5 floors. You can check the ship from top to bottom. The museum also has an auditorium, where you can see the history of the ship. The place is full with miniature ships and places that mimic the way things were back",
          "The only reason we visited this museum is because we had an hour to burn before dinner. We were incredibly glad we went. This museum highlights Stockholm's strength with museums in general. Every exhibit is bursting with deep knowledge and you come away feeling like you have to",
          "the guided English lang tour was a good choice for us. Kept the kids interested the whole time. We had an amazing time at Vasa with nice lunch at their restaurant as well.",
          "This museum has fabulous interpretive displays. Tours are available in English as well as Swedish. The whole museum revolves around the world\u2019s largest, authentic warship in the world. In fact, the building was built around the ship. In addition to hearing its tragic history,",
          "Amazing to see this ship in amazing condition! So many floors to the museum there's plenty to see and learn. Great opportunities to take some photos and enjoy the details.",
          "Amazing history here, the splendour of the Vasa, and its tragic past. The amazing point is that this ship is fully intact and preserved due to the Baltoc Sea. Do a guided tour, the english speaking young man was outstanding. The food in the restaurant is also delicious also.",
          "The was the boat was salvaged from the sea and restored is absolutely amazing. The story of the boat itself, less so, having sunk on its maiden voyage. The entrance fare is very high for a museum where you spend less than two hours though.",
          "This incredible museum has to be one of the best in the world and a must to visit when in Stockholm- we loved it!",
          "I was not sure about it, I am now glad I visited it. It is more than just an old ship, it is a view into life in the past. Impressive, so well preserved and the presentations around it giving a vivid experience of the way they used to live 400 years ago.",
          "What a phenomenal museum. There is essentially one object on display, but it is worth seeing! Ok, there are really dozens and dozens of artifacts and displays, but the main attraction will leave you agape. This museum would appeal to teenagers, adventurers, art lovers, and",
          "I really wasn't to excited about visiting the Vasa. However so glad I did. It was amazing even for someone with no maritime experience. Defintely see the 17 minute film.",
          "I do not go for the Excellent rating very often but this time I needed it and more! What a great ship! What a fantastic place! Great museum! Can not recommend this enough. An absolut must when in Stockholm.",
          "What a great museum to visit. The Vasa is absolutely beautiful and it's hard to believe she was under water for so long. Lots of information available and a good gift shop at the end.",
          "This is a must see in Stockholm! It is without a doubt the best museum I have ever seen in my life. I usually spend about 2 hours in a museum, but I stayed in Vasa the entire day. I could just not get enough of it!",
          "This museum is really interesting and definitely worth a visit. I would recommend taking the free guided tour. You always learn more on a tour and get more engrossed into the subject matter, and this tour was no different. You can easily spend a couple of hours here looking",
          "Impressive! The Vasa captures your attention with its enormity. Sheer size would have been overwhelming if not for the thoughtfully placed exhibits of the Vasa's recovery as well as snippets into life AND the role of women at the time of its original construction.",
          "It's hard to go to Stockholm and come away and not be able to tell others that you have seen the Vasa, but in reality it's nothing more than a monarch's folly in a dark, noisy and crowded shed. We had a guided tour which was probably the best way to see the Vasa and we got a",
          "Having been to Stockholm many time, it was my first visit to the Vasa museum - and what a visit it was. Upon entering this wonderfully preserved ship comes into view. What a sight! (goosebumps). The whole museum is really good and interesting to understand what life was aboard.",
          "A must see if you are in Stockholm. Boat was salvaged after 333 years in the sea and restored to its former glory. We walked from Old Town just over 30 mins and then got water taxi back to Slussen which worked really well.",
          "Loved the huge ship and the story behind is very interesting. The whole museum turns around that one special piece of history. Food is very nice aswell in the restaurant. Worth it.",
          "The Vasa is sooo impressive! I have never seen a big ship that up close, and surely not that old. It is amazing how the ship survived for over 333 years below sea. It is a great thing to see, and everyone who can, should visit. Also, do not forget to first go to the \"cinema\"",
          "This is an enormous ship made out of huge planks of timber and well worth the visit. The museum is easy to get to by tram or ferry.",
          "We were very impressed by this medieval ship and its museum. It is really impressive how it is preserved and how it was \"rescued\" and recovered. Really worth it.",
          "This is on the HOHO Bus stop. Very interesting. Had a video that explained the restoration of the ship. Its very busy but the do have a large auditorium",
          "We had visited vasa museum. We saw the story. After knowing the history i really appreciate the work of people who find the big ship. I really enjoyed the place.but the entry ticket is very costly.",
          "Fantastic museum. Quite remarkable to see this 400 year old ship in the flesh, together with lots of restored artefacts etc. A must see in Stockholm!",
          "The Vasa museum was stunning, to give an indication of what life was like in 17 century Sweden. The work that had gone into building the ship in the first place and then to raise it 300 years later was amazing. Great place to take kids. To spend so much time and money on",
          "This museum well deserves its number one rating for things to do in Stockholm. The ship is breathtaking and incredibly well preserved. The museum is well presented with interesting displays. The free tour was very informative and a good length at 25 minutes.",
          "I absolutely enjoyed my visit to this museum. The ingenuity of preserving a 300year old ship was just second to none. The historical perspective that you get from this museum is unforgettable. Also had a 3-course inclusive dinner.",
          "I'm usually not all that intrigued about ships and historical stuff (unless it's architecture) but I was intrigued with its story (sunk on first sailing), the recovery, and the fact the REAL THING (not a fake recretion0 is right there in front of you. See the move that",
          "Wonderful museum, great explanations of the history of the Vasa and the salvage effort. A highlight not to be missed!",
          "First i thought A Ship ... hmm But its amazing And Big The story of how- when - and the battles Its worth every penny",
          "Not to be missed when in Stockholm. Not a museum person but this 1 was very impressive. Free guided tour or go at your own pace by downloading guide info. Lockers & coat rack available.",
          "Take a trip back in time whilst viewing this amazing vessel. The story that accompanies the rescued ship is truly enlightening. Magnificent restoration work!",
          "This museum is a must for any history buff. It's an amazing glimpse of the past brought to life. The 20 minute tour and short film were also worth attending and included in the price of admission.",
          "Fascinating museum and story. The restoration and scale of the ship is striking and the history really grabs you. A must do visit",
          "Ahh what to say about VASA, when I heard the story in the video I was awestruck and then I saw the actual ship and it is unbelievable that 98% of the ship is restored after so many years. Beautiful place a must visit in Stockholm",
          "I always read the \u201cnegative\u201d reviews of places before I visit them as well as the positive. Some people seemed to be amazed that this was an old ship. Yes, it is, but it\u2019s the history of it, the restoration of it, the sheer size of it that\u2019s amazing. I imagine that if the museum",
          "This museum is unbelievable. Really interactive and modern, interesting exhibitions and the ship is huge!! Must see attraction even if you have no interest in ships, good historical content and would say great for families with kids as safe and fun.",
          "Fabulous museum detailing the history of the Vasa. After you enter the museum you can choose to start at the top or bottom. Either way you can see the Vasa from multiple perspectives. All along the way there are written details that describe what you are seeing. One of my",
          "Great museum. There is a 25 minute film that tells the story of the ship and a free guided tour that also takes about 25 minutes. The full ship - 98% original material is the central feature of the museum. The atmosphere and lighting in the building is perfect. Even the",
          "One of the most interesting stories I have discovered. The museum is impressive. Well worth the entrance fee.",
          "Amazing musem even for people who don't know a lot about ships in general. Vasa ship looks stunning. Highly recommended!",

          "This ship has an amazing story and the level of preservation for the ship and its relics is astounding. The stories that you get to read about the passengers and the sailors are very well done. The whole exhibit is great. If you are not into ships, or if someone has already",
          "Ticket 150 SEK It's worth visiting the Vasa museum. 6 floors in the museum with games, videos , photos , historical objects and of course the war ship Vasa which is the only one in the world from 17th century.",
          "This Museum is incredible, you could not believe what you are seeing! The is conservated in perfect condition! You can learn about the history of Sweden!",

          "The museography is spectacular, you feel the power of such migthy war ship from the 1600's - you will be amazed the moment you enter the museum and see the Vasa for the first time - Unforgettable. And also if you are traveling with kids DO NOT MISS THIS MUSEUM",
          "I would highly recommend listening in on one of the free tours while there. I did not do this & left the museum feeling not very satisfied. Reading the plaques situated around the boat one tell you so much and it can get quite boring so take advantage of the resources provided!",
          "Its been amazing...Gorgeous Museum with a lot of details and facts about Vasa ship story...! There is still plenty of space to run around and explore for younger children too but doubt they get much out of it. For adults it is a must. I love this place.",
          "It was a fun experience seeing this grandeous ship. The museum is on several levels and it features several parts which showcase the various equipment used on this ship.",
          "I was on a tour while on a cruise. My tour company (TJ Travel) had lined up the tour of Stockholm and this was part of our day. I had no idea what Vasa Museum was and I was in awe while touring this facility. It is absolutley stunning and I would go back again next time in",
          "Highly recommend a visit. We enjoyed the boat ride to the museum and the exhibits. Amazing restoration work and educational.",

          "This is truly impressive and the restoration of this ship is amazing. However, if you are not a total old ship fanatic an hour is long enough to visit. The architecture of the museum which was basically built around the ship is worth admiring.",
          "Finally, something of great value in Stockholm is a truly expensive city. The museum is worth of every Krona. See it to believe it and learn a whole lot.",
          "Have been visiting several times when we are in Stockholm and love coming back here. Such a fantastic museum and really gives a historical look back in time when Sweden use to be a super power in Europe. Can really recommend a visit for all!",

          "I was really impressed to see the ship just standing there like its nothing, so big and so much details! The free movie and guided tour is definitly recommended, really helps understanding how this happened and what the stories where.",
          "Lovely museum, very educational. The way they've set this up is very nice. You'll get to know more than just how they salvaged and preserved the boat. There's a lot of information about the unfortunate victims of this disaster as well, and about their lifestyle.",
          "Yep. Had very little time to visit. Wish I had more! The (roughly \u00a312gpb) entry fee was a bargain.. the museum wasn't just a \"look at this piece of history showcase\". It gave so much more, how the ship was lifted and preserved etc... so I glad I went. Give yourself minimum",
          "This visit to Sweden's own Titanic was worth every cent. Factual and interesting at the same time. A lot tot take in in one visit. I recommend buying the book to go over in your own time after the visit.",
          "Step back in time to the age of old wooden ships. The Vasa is completely intact. A rare sight. Impressive!",
          "Lovely museum, interesting exhibition and a lot of info you can read about. Very lovely organized, and also good prices.",
          "The whole museum is about the ancient ship that sunk during its first moment of sailing. The ship is beautiful and nothing more.",

          "I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but the whole thing was beautiful and interesting. All the explanations were clear and although there were many people everything could be seen and explored well. Worth a visit!",

          "The real history of mankind mighty and failure that you may observe by your own. Biggest more than 300 years ship preserved in ideal condition unique for the entire world! Excellent museum, and it really worth the entrance price!",
          "This museum is like nothing I've ever seen. Definitely one of the great atractions of Stockholm! (maybe of Europe...)",
          "We went to the museum with our grandchildren (3-4) and it wasn\u2019t that much to do for them. We have been there before and as adults it is very interesting and a lot to learn about the history. I think it s a bit expensive though.",
          "Yes - I live in Stockholm nowdays. When people come to visit they always ask what they should do... please don't miss the Vasa Museum I answer. It is amazing. Such an old big ship preserved so well. They have also done a huge job with the storytelling around the ship. I love",
          "A huge boat, 300 ago, restored and exhibited in the Vasa Museum, you should see that. Amazing place. You can do it with your love and your children or alone.",
          "Well worth the time to tour and learn history of this remarkable ship! Highly recommend. It was part of the city tour we did while cruising",
          "The 15- minutes introductory video is great, and very useful to understand the other sections in the museum: don\u2019t miss it! Guided tours are available, but we didn\u2019t do it, as we didn\u2019t have much time. An MP3 audio tour is also available for free. The boat is impressive, as well",
          "Could not believe the amount of ship that is preserved and the detail that can be seen. The exhibition is interesting and informative. Worthwhile watching the different films around the museum to understand the whole story. The cafe inside id reasonable and a good selection of",
          "What a big ship! Don\u2019t miss the tour, you do get a lot of insight about the ship and also watch the short film on how the ship was raised out of the water.The craftsmanship and detail on the ship is amazing! There are a lot of artifacts on the different floors of the building.",
          "This is a museum where it brings history to life. For someone who has an interest in history but admittedly did not know too much about Swedish history this is a fantastic introduction. The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming, and also knowledgeable about all the",
          "What an amazing place so rich in history. My tour guide, Bengt was very informative! I cannot wait to visit Stockholm again someday.",
          "This was the highlight of our week in Stockholm. We had both been to the Mary Rose in England, but the Vasa was something else! If you do one thing in the city, this had to be it! Just unbelievable history with a brilliant guided tour and a fascinating film. Special",
          "If you are a lover of old ships and history, then you must visit this museum. It is almost unbelievable that this ship sat underwater for over 300 years. Inside the museum, you can see this huge ship. With visual props, the researchers show and explain how the ship was lifted",
          "Very interesting museum. A lot of information of this historic ship. The stories behind this ship are very interesting.",
          "It was really nice to see the Historical Ship and know about it. Museum has really nice amenities specially restaurant.",
          "I am not a museum person and this is the first one I have ever liked. The ship is amazing, the tours are well done, and they have great exhibits around teaching about the ship and the times back then. Highly recommended!",
          "Spent a good few hours here on a rainy day. Despite some of the 1 star reviews, we thought it was an interesting museum. We didn't watch the video or do a tour of any description, but instead wandered around reading the info and looking at the boat. To be honest, that was enough",
          "An amazing history told by an amazing vessel. Shocking story of a boat which didn\u2019t get to sail that far and which became a tomb to so many lives. Well organised museum with lots to see and do, well laid out. Eateries available.",
          "A strange feeling looking at such treasure - stimulates your imagination! The kids loved the forensic part at the end most. The museum is big enough not to have a sense of crowdyness even though it was packed with tourists. Would recommend it as a \"must see\" to all, regardless",
          "Not ,many places you can see a whole vessel that was under water in such an exceptional condition. A lot of money, time and effort was put in this project.",
          "If you visit Stockholm, do NOT miss this! Watch the film, take the tour and bring your smart phone and ear buds for 15 free topics during a free self guided tour! As a physician, I loved learning about early medical practices.",
          "This is so worth going to. Admission is only 15 Euro and it is absolutely fascinating! I build model wooden ships as a hobby and am a military historian at heart and to be able to see a sailing warship from this time era is like traveling back in time. The Swedes should be so",
          "They've done a fantastic job of setting up this museum. We started off with a short guided tour, where the guide provided the main highlights and then took our time wandering around looking at the amazing ship and the interactive exhibits. The kids had a great time, touching and",
          "We did not know anything about the Vasa but were recommended to visit and are so glad we did. It is awe inspiring to realize the ship in front of you has spent 333 at the bottom of the ocean and then raised, preserved and restored. The museum is great value for money. Adults",
          "The brutalist architecture is a perfect surrounding for the fabulous seventeenth century ship. A must see! Oh and don\u2019t forget to wat the documentary",
          "Love the museum. Learned a lot of history about the building and sinking of this ship . I would definitely plan a trip here .",
          "Truly one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. Seems like it is taken from a movie, an unreal world... a must!",
          "This museum is brilliant and the ship and all the information makes it well worth a visit. Sat in a nice location on the side of the bay",
          "This is a world class experience and hard to experience history in a more vivid and concrete way. The Wasa ship is a truly unique piece and the museum enhance the visit even further. This is a must stop when coming to Stockholm.",
          "Highly recommended and well worth hearing the English tour guide who gave lots of extra information. Exhibitions and film were really good. Teenage kids enjoyed it too Good value for money at \u00a330 for a family of four.",
          "Realy amazing and breath taking sight, this ship has been on the bottom of the sea for hundred of Years. it is amazing that this ship was New when it sunk, it had only traveled the harbour and sunk.. Amazing and \u00e1 must see...",
          "Vasa museum is a must-see when visiting Stockholm. The entrance to the museum is around 15 euro and it is open on Sundays as well. as a visitor, you get the chance to see from very close the old but very well-kept ship and read its history. They also offer guided tours in",
          "This was my favorite museum during our visit to Stockholm and Helsinki. If you like history or ships this is a must see!!",
          "The Vasa was Sweden's largest warship at the time it was launched but sank 20 minutes later! The guided tour will explain why. An amazing ship and the museum helps to explain the how, where and why of it. It's mind-boggling to see the work that so many people have put in to",
          "This is just one off those places you shouldn't miss while visiting in Stockholm. Great museum if you can avoid the bus loads of tourists that often take over this museum. This ship is sadly rotating away and will only be available to se for a limited time as an object. The",
          "This museum is a must-see if you're in Stockholm. There is much to see and learn and they present the information in interesting and engaging ways. Get there when it opens and join one of their free guided tours(given in different languages) which are about 25 minutes. They",
          "The Vasa Museum was a highlight for us! This ship was amazingly preserved after sinking SO many years...an amazing part of history!",
          "I knew that I'd enjoy visiting Vasa museum but I didn't know I'd enjoy it this much. We spent there 2 hours and would've spent more but the museum was closing down. It's amazing to see such an old ship that we'd normally see only in pictures or in movies. It's bigger than I",
          "You don\u2019t get a real sense of the size and history of the ship until visiting the Vasa museum. Genuinely interesting. Also their restaurant is pretty decent for lunch.",
          "An adventure back in time not to be missed. Rich history, albeit sad given how Vasa\u2019s maiden voyage never quite made it to open seas. The ship has been painstakingly restored to its former glory for all to see - near and far, young and old. If there\u2019s one site to visit in all",
          "The exhibitions were breathtaking - besides the ship itself (amazing efforts to maintain, well done to museum for that!), there were many small collections of preserved objects and small interactive set-ups. Insanely interesting! However, I must say I found the layout of the",
          "The Vasa Museum is beyond interesting. The unseaworthy 17th century warship was pulled from the sea floor; it was one of the largest ships in the world when it set out in 1628, only to sink in the harbor 40 minutes into its maiden voyage. Very cool and a must see.",
          "Outstanding story, great displays, DON'T MISS THIS ONE IF YOU ARE IN STOCKHOLM. The efforts made by Swedish authorities to preserve this ship and tell the story.",
          "It is mostly irrelevant for visitors from the US since ultimately it is just an old boat that sunk right after it was built and it is primarily an example of a failed design. Most of the displays on the preservation efforts were boring, as were the other displays. This is a",
          "My Friends live in Stockholm and they asked me what do you fancy doing. My friends had visited Stockholm, but I could not go for other reasons. So I was thinking and I remember my friends saying if I ever visited Stockholm that they said you must see the boat and I was thinking",
          "We had a good time spent discovering the Vasa museum, its exibits and history behind the Vasa. For the first time visitors (to Stockholm) I would recommend you to have it first on your museum visit list.",
          "I spent 2hrs, reading Everything. It is impressive how big the ship actually is. If you fancy a real man-o-war which in addition spent 333 years underwater - this is the place",
          "Pricey, but this is a royal ship with exquisite wooden carving and the finest example in the world of a ship of this statue. Don't miss it...",
          "Very well displayed and executed exhibition, Impressive ship, evidently way heavier than should have been to successfully sail...",
          "Great museum. The Vasa ship is very interesting, and they have set it up on several levels so visitors can see inside much of the ship.",
          "This ship really takes your breath away. The museum also starts free tours in regular intervals, which is highly recommended (Thanks Pedro!)",
          "Lots of details, tasty restaurant and the Vasa itself is huge! The life in 15th century exposition was entertaining, but the best was the model reconstruction of Vasa excavation.",
          "So beautiful, amazing view inside. We were with four kids (from 10 months till 8 years) and they are so happy that saw it.",
          "This is just amazing! I spent more than 2 hours in this museum and it\u2019s just great. The exhibition, the explanations and the place itself, just woooow. Perhaps one of the highlights in my trip in Stockholm.",
          "Great historical story you hear during tour. To just see the immense size of this boat is amazing. Lots to see and do in the museum. Recommend for all ages.",
          "Words cannot describe how in awe you are when you set eyes on the Vasa for the first time. The carvings on this ship are a work of art. The history and story behind the raising of this ship are something told in the movie that is included in the price of a ticket. Not to be",
          "Really well done exhibition, time flies with this masterpiece! Lots of facts and interesting history shown the best way!",
          "We spent the morning here learning about this magnificent ship that sunk on its maiden voyage. Very well preserved and presented clearly. Information about what it would have been like on board and about those who lost their lives was good. Would recommend!",
          "There are many museums in Stockholm, this is a special one though. Just the share size of the ship from the 1600's makes it worth a visit. Then it is the story of the salvage, the people who died, the artifacts and much more.",
          "Must see, amazing museum and what a story about this old ship. But as many other museums entry price is off.",
          "Great to see an old ship that has been resurrected back to it's original state, minus the cannons. One of Sweden's pride and greatest failures. Worth a visit.",
          "The ship was very impressive to witness with most of it being from the original. The rest of the museum didn\u2019t offer too much, although it tried with content on the salvage, the people who died in the incident, etc.",
          "So much work has gone into this incredible project. The ship( which sunk in 17th century) has been preserved/restored to amazing detail. You need at least a day to take in all the exhibits and interactive displays. The sheer size of the ship is awesome. The building itself",
          "Explorer the story about a ship that sank 20 minutes into it's first trip. The wreckage is very well preserved and deserves a visit itself. Besides from the ship you can se loads of artifacts found around the ship. Watch a movie about it and much more. Start of with a guided",
          "This museum is unique in that it was built around the full size viking ship inside. There are several floors where you can read about and see items from the period and life on the ship. I totally enjoyed this museum.",
          "Really impressive!!! Beautiful ship, interactive experience to understand everything that happened. 7 floors in order to get a really good look at everything. Make sure you get at least an hour or 2 to get to see everything. If you don't want to see the movies in the auditoriums",
          "We spent several hours here examining the ship and reading the incredible story of its history and recovery. The musem is marvelous.",
          "Brilliant place to visit. Well set out. Really enjoyed it. Worth the entry fee. Went on a Saturday and was busy.",
          "Definitely worth the visit, there is also audioguide which you can listen to on your own phone downloading it from their website (there is free wifi). Its interesting, and you can spend a good 1,5 - 2 hours inside if you go through the whole exhibit.",
          "This was an extraordinary experience to see this historic very old relic of a ship that was submerged for years under the water. I understand it is starting to disentegrate being on land now.",
          "I mean the museum is great I highly recommend you visit it and discover for yourself how one of the most visited attractions in a world started as an absolute fiasco from the site of Swedes. I suggest you start by doing a quick (around 25 mins long) guided tour and finish with",
          "An old ship may not sound very interesting, but it is - both the scale and the detail are breathtaking! The introductory tour is excellent, the film is good too - try to set aside at least 2hrs for your visit. You can walk here from the city, I recommend that you do because the",
          "I entered the exhibit hall, turned around, and went back to the entrance to take a picture of the view one sees upon first entering. This is a 300 year old ship that sunk on the first voyage, literally traveling about a mile. The story of how it was found and how it was raised",
          "I had expected to see a bit boat. Instead the museum was full of different exhibits and artifacts and I ended up staying there longer than I thought I would. Great for kids!",
          "A must see. Well done. Lots of walking but elevators provided if needed. Bathrooms have been made into gender neutral\u2014very disconcerting for a lot of women, who chose to stay to one bathroom instead of mixing. I noticed that people with small children were very uncomfortable",
          "There are some sights that, being seen for the first time, leavean impression that lasts a lifetime. Rounding the corner of the Siq in Petra and seeing the Treasury at Petra is one; entering the Vasa Mueum and catching sight of the restored ship is, I am sure, another. The",
          "We visited a lot of museums in Stockholm and Vasa was the best one. Well organized, interesting movies which explain what happened and why. The 4 levels allow a very good view of all the boat",
          "A ship sunk for 333 years on display! More than that the way the museum is designed is amazing. Very well designed spaces to get best views of the Vasa, display, and information about every item recovered from the ship.",
          "Interesting stories surround this ship, including the absence of sea worms in the brackish water, which accounts for the great shape of the ship after being underwater for 4 centuries.",
          "The ship was amazing to see in person. We all enjoyed walking around and seeing what it was like to be on it.",
          "Fascinating to see the intricate woodwork on this resurrected old merchant ship. It's size is impressive and the detail , amazing",
          "This museum was well worth the time. Very interesting to see a ship from so long ago It's amazing what the Vikings did in those days being able to build something like that",
          "You can not imagine until you see this ship and how well preserved it is. It is stunning. And a must is watching the 15 minute movie on the Vasa. When you enter the museum, go directly to the theater to see what time is the English (or whatever language you want to watch it in)",
          "Spectacular, very detailed presentation of the ship, its destiny and the time it was built. Fantastic experience! It's unbelievable how many stories a ship can tell. Absolutely recommended!",
          "Quite fascinating to see an old ship of quality. The museum provides some interesting moments in history and overall I would recommend visiting.",
          "The only 17th century war ship which could be restored (nearly) completely - what a sight! Even if you are not interested in ships, the Vasa museum is absolutely impressive and gives good insights into the restoration of this ship and about contemporary living and sea warfare.",
          "I had been to the Vasa approximately 4 years ago. This was my second visit. The Vasa is a incredibly display of the ship and its story. The museum is still restoring and continues to research this great piece of history. A must see for anyone interested in history and the old",
          "I almost didn\u2019t fit this into my trip, despite having it recommended a handful of times, I felt museums can take up a lot of time and I only had a weekend. Then I saw on the website a page on \u201chow to do Vasa in an hour\u201d and I went for it. And I am SO glad I did. It\u2019s such an",
          "Was hesitant to go to the museum but wow am I glad that I did. The story, the ship, the exhibit, the explanation all absolutely amazing. I must see in Stockholm",
          "We were visiting Stokholm for a couple of days and we are definitively very grateful that our cousins pursue us to pay this museum a visit! The exhibit is very interesting, from the story to the smallest details about life of the people of the time was breath taking. Especially",
          "A great museum with lots to see. The story of the Vasa is very interesting so do remember to see the movie (at the museum) first before you start walking around.",
          "2 cues in, 1 for groups, the other one just marked \u201centrance\u201d. We weren\u2019t a group, so we used the regular entrance. 5 minutes cue when we arrived exactly at 10 when they opened. Once inside we saw 3 lines. The group one, one leading to ticket machines. Since we had bought",
          "Amazing 300 year old ship almost entirely preserved. worth a detour.. plan a few hours out on Djurgarden. we went twice to this fabulous spot... once by boat, the other by bike tour",
          "Very impressive what they've done to recover and restore this ship. Well done. One thing that could improve the experience is better audio guides. Our's kept stopping, I think bc too many people were on the WiFi signal. Very frustrating, but we could still read and move around",
          "The Vasa Museum is very attractive and pleasant. The story of the Vasa ship is interesting as well as the Ship itself. Besides the ship, there are many displays including a continuously playing movie. There is a nice souvenir shop as well as a coffee shop but as with any",
          "Our overwhelming feeling was the size of this ship and the amount of work it must have taken to salvage it. Lots of interactive rooms and films. It was a good couple of hours.",
          "What an amazing place!! What an incredible piece of work the did with the VASA. You have to go !, don't forget to take the free tour of the museum.",
          "Must to see in Stockholm. Amazing story about the ship from 17th century which was over 300 years in the see. Open until 8PM.",
          "Sad story, great museum. If you don\u2019t take a tour make sure you read the placards so you understand the details. Don\u2019t miss this place.",
          "I loved my visit to Vasa Museum. It was very impressive and well done. Explanations were great! Also situated in a nice part of Stockholm!",
          "We took the short ferry ride across to the Vasa Museum, which to say the least is a very large building. When we entered the building, the first site of the Vasa ship in subdued lighting took my breath away. Almost ghostly in all her magnigicance and we were fortunate it wasn't",
          "Most impressive preservation and exhibition I can remember... That magnificent vessel literally is a time machine bringing the past to life...",
          "On a two week tour we were allowed 30 minutes for film and see the ship. Not enough time so we returned another day on our own and spent 1 1/2 hours to see the exhibits and learn the history. Dynamic displays and a 400 year old magnificent ship that is 98% original as it spent",
          "Interesting Swedish history of an incredible looking ship that never really sailed. There is a room to the side to view a 10- 15 minute video with historical info. , You might miss the room if you are not looking for it as the lighting is low in the general area . Awesome site",
          "One must visit this museum for a minimum of 2 hours to fully appreciate this beautiful & magnificent warship, her crew, weapons and personal belongings. It is really hard to believe that a ship of war had such intricate carvings. Words really can't describe its beauty. A real",
          "When you enter the hall where the mighty ship has been preserved you will be overwhelmed by an enormous WOW-feeling. The worlds only surviving original 17th century battleship is a sight to behold. It is remarkably complete and still lots of details can be seen. Go see.",
          "If visiting Stockholm a visit it worth a visit to see this incredible vessel and the amazing intricate detail of some of the design features.",
          "This museum is centered around a ship that sat at the bottom of the sea for 300 years until it was raised. There is a free tour in English and a movie that gives good background information. Unless you want to see everything on display, an hour or so is sufficient time for a",
          "My daughter & I visited Sweden to learn more of her Swedish grandfather's heritage. The Vasa Museum and its grandure gave the feeling of going back in time. The gigantic vessel was almost intact after 300 plus years under water in Stockholm. Amazing, detailed information,",
          "Often museums and sights that everybody says you must see are a bit disappointing. Not so with the Vasa. Whether you are a history buff or have zero interest in history or ships this is an absolute must-see. The reconstructed ship is astonishing and the building is exactly",
          "The museum is super, the exhibitions very well laid out, and the whole building is very accessible. But avoid cruise ship tourists. When we came there, there were several groups of cruise ship tourists there at the same time. And when you are in a big concrete building the noise",
          "I had hear about the Vasa from one of my daughters who had visited it 10 years ago. I had a few spare hours in Stockholm following a work meeting and went out to visit it. Great setting on top of the old royal dry docks and it was stunning. I recommend watching the free movie to",
          "We have been to this museum two times but let me tell you one thing that you will not regret coming here. One of the famous museum in Sweden. Detailing provided at each places related to all the events happened with VASA can easily interest even for not interested persons.",
          "I cannot believe there is a virtually intact ship from the 1600's still in existence. this cannot be missed. The personal details about the crew that were recovered puts a real life perspective to the story. Then there is the story about recovery of material from the wreck in",
          "There isn't a way to adequately describe the sheer size of this vessel and no camera can capture it either. We were awestruck by the carvings all over the ship and vastness of the whole thing. There are lots of other things to see in the museum such as the people they found with",
          "The pictures of the ship do not do it justice. It\u2019s absolutely enormous and fascinating to be able to get so close to it. I especially loved the levels so that you could see the ship from literally all angles. Fun fact - the elevators are to the left from the entrance on the",
          "This museum is about a boat but very interesting to know the history. They are also showing Movie about boat was excellent and informative.",
          "This museum is dedicated to a gorgeously restored ship that has a very unusual story. While the ship didn't succeed in its mission, it offers an opportunity to see exceptional craftsmanship from that period. The ship and exhibits transport you back in time for a couple of hours",
          "The story behind the building, sinking and restoration of the 1600\u2019s oak ship is astonishing ....... a must see!",
          "Enjoyed my time at the Museum. Get given a code to use on your own mobile phone. Fantastic restoration and a well organised Museum, although was very busy when we were there. Get there early before all the large bus tours.",
          "This is probably the best museum I've ever visited. I planned to spend half an hour here but spent almost three. In addition to the fantastic ship, I was impressed with the concept of the museum. Here you can see how the sailors lived, what they ate, what they were sick of, how",
          "Very impressive! Great intro film Good guide in English Beautifully presented ship Amazing to see Central location",
          "A beautiful building constructed around the amazingly preserved hulk of a 17th century warship which had lain under the sea for 333 years. The tale of the salvage is remarkable, and the way in which this superb feat of recovery and conservation was achieved is a story in its own",
          "Make sure to watch the video on the recovery of the Vasa before seeing the ship itself. The efforts to save this ship and its treasures are inspiring. In the museum itself, we especially enjoyed seeing the items from the sailors' personal watertight chests such as their shoes",
          "This was everything I'd hoped and read it would be.......a stunning museum and restoration of the famous ship that sunk on its' maiden voyage and laid at the bottom of the harbor for over 300 years. The ship, the artifacts, and information provided about the people on the boat",
          "We had a guide with us for the visit. Apparently this ship on display had all the features and weaponry that were desirable in a ship in the 17 century. Unfortunately the engineering work was not well-thought-out and the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1628. It was quite",
          "It was a magnificent museum to see in Stockholm. Location is nice however you have to buy a ticket to enter in",
          "They manage to create a special place and atmosfere around a perfectly preserved ship . Realy one of a kind museum.",
          "Awesome Restauration of a great old ship. Interesting informations all around, even a good restaurant",
          "I enjoyed my last visit to the Vasa Museum, but now it is even better, one can descend to see the hull of the ship, which makes it even more impressive",
          "Crazy!!! That we were able to see a ship that sank in 1628 and was at the bottom for 333 years. It was a grand ship of workmanship and carvings, but just could not stay afloat. Definitely get the free tour in your language or the movie. We did the tour and just looked around",
          "This museum is very impressive, as you walk in and you are faced with the front of the ship in front of you and wow just wow, it is huge and amazing. The layout of the museum has been well thought out. Certainly one of the best museums I have visited in a while.",
          "A beautiful ship indeed, the place itself is very nice and I enjoyed the museum very much . 0-18 years old entry is free !",
          "Just amazing entering in the museum and watching a full line ship in front of you. All the matrials explaining how they built the ship, why it capsized and sink, the people that make it, the political situation that lead to its builld gave you a frull descripotion of the scene.",
          "Visit is a must as very impressive. It is probably unique to see a ship from the 17th century in such great conditions. The setup of the museaum allows to see the ship from various floors and angles. Very well done.",
          "Really interesting museum. The ship is amazing. So pretty. There are multiple floors so you can see the ship from many heights. It is a big place so didn\u2019t feel super crowded. A free tour in English happen to start right when we arrived. The museum is near a Viking museum, the",
          "Don't often do museums but have to admit this place was excellent. As well as the history behind the Vasa, it also discovers the mass way the wreck was salvaged in the 1960s. It is set across 4/5 floors each with its only theme. There is a nice little cafe too. If you are",
          "If you have a Stockholm pass, the admission is free by showing the pass. The entry costs 159 for adults which is worth the price. Furthermore, you can leisurely walk around and wonder about the massive boat. There is a guided tour inside for those interested, but we prefer",
          "This is a place which is rich of history and pride of the Swedish kingdom. You can see it everywhere in the ship that was built in the 1600 decorated with a nice Swedish art everywhere of its. Everything explained and showed up with it\u2019s supposed and how it staid with a minor",
          "Visited this on a Sunday afternoon and wasn\u2019t too busy . Leaflets for exploiting weren\u2019t ideally placed but didn\u2019t spoil our visit .",
          "We started by watching the movie, then we Walker all floors. Very interesting! The exhibitions gave answers to all our questions and gave loads of new insight.",
          "The ship is gorgeous and the story behind it is intriguing. Who\u2019s fault was it? who got punished instead? How long did this maiden voyage last? How many died? Should Leonardo play the captain?",
          "We visited here whilst staying in Stockholm last winter. Very impressive museum and amazing to see how well preserved the Vasa is, which sank in 1628. The museum offers guided tours, but we were happy to just wander around and absorb all the displays they have, which are spread",
          "This is simply one of the very best museums we have ever seen. The tour, the movie, the informational displays are all top notch. It is large enough that it does not feel crowded even though there are a lot of people in the building.",
          "Fabulous museum. Worth going into the introduction film first, starting on the first floor & gradually working your way up through the floors is a lovely way to reveal this astonishing ship.",
          "They said this is the best museum in Stockholm and I agree. A 333 year old warship that is still in its finest form.",
          "The history of this tragic shipwreck is amazing. Plan to spend at least 2-hours exploring the 5 floors of interesting artifacts.",
          "Spent over an hour here taking the magnificent ship in. What a feat to restore it. Its a must see. Worth every cent.",
          "I would highly recommend a trip to this museum. I have never seen anything else like it. A ship that sank in 1628, salvaged and cleaned up, 98% original. It's completely worth a visit.",
          "We got loads out of this trip, there are five floors around the trip giving you lots of different angles and seeing so much history and information. I would say this is a MUST for a stockholm trip",
          "Wow! Amazing to see this beautiful ship! You feel a true sense of history. Details the story of it\u2019s discovery and restoration, too!",
          "I have been here in September 2019, very big ship and many floors to see all history but they have a map for you.",
          "We had previously been to the Vasa Museum about 18 years ago when we were last in Stockholm, and I remembered it was very good so we were keen on going back again. It was every bit as good as I remembered. The ship is amazing, and the museum includes a lot of background",
          "Don't need to be mad about ships or history to appreciate this museum. Really amazing restored ship but with a lot of extra displays all around to provide a lot of insight. Well worth a few hours.",
          "Everything about this museum is amazing. So well done and so much to see without getting bored. It's a must-see.",
          "This was the highlight of our Stockholm trip. Absolutely worth the visit. I mean the ship is there! The story behind it is very interesting and well displayed in the museum exhibits. Go to the museum and learn about it!",
          "I will be honest and had little to no interest in going when I first decided to go to Stockholm, but all the sites said to go. Now, I agree. Go! It's so interesting, you get the walking tour and learn so much about the ship and why it failed. They have plenty of other displays",
          "This was a fabulous must see museum! You can not get an idea about the size and detail of this ship without going to see it yourself. One of the best things we did in Stockholm",
          "No trip to Stockholm is complete without the Vasa. We were happy to see that so much of it is all original. The story behind the ship is also interesting.",
          "First I thought: one museum around 1 boat?? Then 1.5 h later I exited and felt enriched with history, boat engineering, live 400y ago etc.. well done!!!",
          "Enjoyed our 1/2 day tour at Vasa. Great information supplied and easy to review on own or by a guided tour. Recommend if you are interested in history and ships.",
          "You walk into the Museum and are just totally blown away by the sheer size of a large Viking ship. This is a great educational opportunity for adults and children alike. You move through the levels of the gallery to see what was on each level of the ship and learn different",
          "We were told by many to make sure to visit this museum. Absolutely fantastic! Great layout. Great history lesson. Check it out.",
          "Best museum in the city is dedicated to a failure. Can\u2019t imagine many other cities would celebrate failure like this In the back right corner of the 6th floor is a great little interactive exhibit for the kids. My kids also liked the 1:10 scale model of the ship just as much",
          "Exceeds all expections! The hype is REAL. A truly unique experience. I guarantee you will be impressed. I almost passed on this as the weather was so perfect in Stockholm I wanted to be outside. So glad I changed my mind. GO!",
          "I have been wanting to see the Vasa since I read about it in a boys paper, 50 years ago.Finally made it this year. Well worth the wait.The scale of it, the complete ship in the hall is awesome. The exhibition and artefacts are well presented, the 20 minute film well done, and",
          "So beautiful the shipwreck (big and well cared) but the museum in general is a little bit boring. Too many rooms and not interesting objects.",
          "Until I reached Stockholm, I did not know about The Vasa, or its story. But I am so glad I found out about it, because I would have been super upset if I had visited Stockholm, and missed this fabulous museum. The Vasa sunk 333 years ago, and only 30 years ago recovered it",
          "The museum celebrates one of Sweden\u2019s least illustrious events, the sinking of the king\u2019s prize battleship \u201cVasa.\u201d The Swedes find the story hysterically funny, as an example of government, especially royal incompetence. The king insisted that the boat have two decks of cannons,",
          "Knew nothing of the story beforehand but the museum does an incredible job of explaining everything about the story of the boat and the recovery process. Didn't complete everything but desperately want to go back and go again",
          "If you like history, this is an excellent place to learn more about Sweden. The ship is pretty amazing but the history behind its building and the people involved is a good story. Plan on 1-2 hours but only if you are interested in this type of history. Worth the cost of",
          "Spent an interesting couple of hours here, well worth a visit for those interested in history, and the is a film of the restoration to watch in various languages, well presented.",
          "The ship by itself its amazing. Pure beauty, so much detail and pretty well preserved. I just can believe that water didn't corrupted, soo cool! And the stories inside wow! I just wish they could figure it out a way to go inside the ship, no touching nor stepping. Just saying!",
          "Your mind is not prepared for the sheer size of this magnificent ship INSIDE A BUILDING! One could easily spend several hours reading all the interesting information about this ship, watching the 20 minute film, reading the profiles of those lost in the tragic sinking. It is",
          "This is a must-see for the Stockholm visitor. A fairly easy transit ride (several options) from old town or the riverfront area. I highly recommend the English tour (I believe offered hourly) or whatever your native language is - you will learn a lot more than you would by",
          "We are not really museum people, but this museum was recommended and we really enjoyed the visit here. Interesting video footage not to be missed and there is lots to see. Great way to spend an afternoon in Stockholm!",
          "No wonder this is the most visited museum in Sweden. The ship is huge and the have a video that explains the restoration process. It was mind blowing how dedicated they were/are in restoring and preserving it. The ship itself is beautiful and astonishing. I highly recommend it.",
          "Initially I thought it will be a huge museum but when I saw and entered I was really shocked it\u2019s just a big hall having a ship. After surviving from initial shock then I noticed it is unique. It is really historical and the way they preserved the ship is really remarkable. Must",
          "Everyone told me I had to visit the Vasa Museum while I was in Stockholm. I wasn\u2019t convinced as I\u2019m not typically into anything nautically themed. I went and was glad I did. The history and restoration of this ship that has been restored with 98% original components is really",
          "It was worthwhile making a stop at the VASA Museum. There isn't anything quite like it! Try to take one of the tours offered inside in different languages. It really enhances the visit and your understanding of the ship.",
          "This is a must-see in Stockholm no matter what your interest in maritime history. Short of letting you clamber over the ship, it's hard to imagine how one's experience could be improved. Five stars",
          "The whole visit was the high light of our Stockholm pre cruise visit to the city. It is amazing they were able salvage the ship.",
          "I didn't find the Museum all that satisfying. Seeing the huge Viking ship was good, and it is huge, and the models showing the excavation of the ship and the task of bringing it to the surface from the ocean floor was interesting, but the rest of the exhibits in the museum were",
          "Very interesting exhibit of the warship that sunk on its maiden voyage. Be sure to watch the film that shows the history. The Swedish government has invested probably more than it expected in preserving this impressive historical artifact.",
          "A full warship 98% original salvaged from the water after sinking on its Inauguration Day. Take the guided tour included in the ticket. Check ahead the timetable. Also watch the movie. 150 sek and no cash.",
          "I don't think there is anyone who can fail to say \"wow\" when they walk into the Vasa Museum for the first time and see the sheer size of the ship before them. It's huge! And although, understandably, you can't actually board it, you can get very close to it from all angles, even",
          "This museum reflects the Swedes\u2019 earlier embarrassing shipbuilding flaws, although they mention design was under two Dutch leaders. That\u2019s probably why it was left underwater for 300 years after sinking as it set to sail. Perhaps this design fail motivated Swedes to become top",
          "A local treasure and well worth a visit. Display and explanations are very interesting and well done where there is something for people interested in ships as well as a historical mystery.",
          "This was so much better than expected. Three of us went and all thought is amazing. Definitely worth seeing",
          "The Vasa museum is a must for every visitor to Stockholm. The restoration of this mighty ship is a sight to behold. It is very special to be able to get up close to a ship that is nearly 400 years old. Well laid out museum. Very nice restaurant to finish off the museum visit",
          "What fun to see this super cool ship which lied at the bottom of the port for centuries, possibly as all to ashamed to lift a war going behomoth that barely made it out fo the dock and sank as design flawed! beautiful, go see it!",
          "When I entered Vasa Museum I looked like a little surprised child: speechless, mouth and eyes wide open. I found myself in front of this incredibly XVII century huge ship, conserved at its best, 95% original parts, the only one in the world. Absolutely stunning. The rest of the",
          "This was one of the most unique museum experiences I've ever had. Thoroughly engaging and a must for your trip to Stockholm.",
          "This is an amazing ship to see. The condition of the boat is beyond belief. The tale of how it sank over 400 years ago and then was finally resurrected in the 60's was very interesting. One of the best museums we saw on our vacation",
          "I knew going in that this museum was going to be cool but I was amazed by how big the ship actually is...over 4 stories high. A must see in Stockholm. Give your self around 2 hours to see the museum and maybe a little more if you are someone who likes to take more time and read",
          "It was a pleasure touring Vasa Museum. The beauty and history of the artifacts was well worth the time and money. Highly recommend the museum.",
          "It's difficult to explain how good this museum is! It is simply a \"Wow\"! moment as you walk through the door. This is much more than just the vessel itself, and is a well-presented picture of everything connected with the ship, right up to its recovery. Can't recommend it",
          "The story of the raising of this ship and the finding of people and things on board is really interesting. Then there is the ship itself. Mind boggling how they have it all there. Great shop with tasteful souvenirs too.",
          "I'd been to Vasa some years ago but it was just as compelling second time around. As an exhibit it has all the ingredients - a great story with a theme somewhere between 'Sweden's Titanic' and 'The Emperor's New Clothes'; an authentic ship - 98% original; the accompanying",
          "There is a definite 'wow' moment when you walk in. To think this ship was underwater for 333 years its current condition is incredible. Do visit.... You won't be disappointed.",

          "I would say this museum is on my top 3. It costs around 15 dollars and it worth each cent. The history of the ship is absolutely amazing.",
          "The museum is gorgeous, and built really smart. It makes you unravel the history of the ship layer by layer, and it just grows on you in the process. And the ship itself plays the role of a pathway to many different aspects of the period \u2026",
          "Very impressing museum with the sunken vasa boat from 1650. Definitely worth a visit. Nice restaurant in the museum. Also good for kids!",
          "This was impressive, not something that you see elsewhere. It is not only the ship itself but the way that all artifacts about the ship are presented. With the guided tour and the short movie, it makes the 2 hours you spend there totally \u2026",
          "So overwhelming in its story, size, and splendour. i particularly loved the exhibition on women and the Vasa, and just walking around the ship imagining what might have been. thought I'd be there an hour, ended up staying all afternoon!",
          "I\u2019ve been dreaming about visiting this museum for five years and then I finally saw it. I had built it up so much in my mind and I was not disappointed. This ship totally exceeded all high expectations I held.",
          "What a stunning museum.\n\nThe recovery that was performed on the ship is amazing. \nWhen you stand close to it and experience the size of the wooden structure that was taken out of the mud. Only then you build the respect for the people that \u2026",
          "Great for visitors of all ages and accessible to a global audience.",
          "Best Museum I've ever seen. 300 year old war shipwreck was pulled out of the sea and rebuild there. It's massive. Around the impressive ship there are many rooms, explaining life back then and reconstructing the bodies found on the wreck. Just go there. Best museum, and im usually not a museum fan.",
          "Awesome please you must see it. Museum has six levels with elevator. You can see ship in 360 degrees.",
          "We both loved it, so amazing how well preserved it really is. Will be back in the future for sure, also wanna recommend a visit to others.",
          "Amazing museum on the Vasa Ship and Swedish culture of 17th century. I loved the chance of choosing the audio guide in your language on your phone and listen to it freely. Highly recommended if you are in Stockholm!",
          "A must-see for any visitor to Stockholm!\n\nThe warship Wasa sank in the harbour just a few minutes into its maiden voyage in 1628.\n\nThe museum gives you the whole story behind Wasa and the actual restored ship on display is absolutely majestic.\n\nEven if you're on just a short visit to Stockholm, you've got to see this!",
          "Absolutely loved this exhibit around the vasa ship. The displays and craftsmanship around the boat explaining how it was made and why. The history of it and detailing what it may have been like to live on the ship. Extremely detailed and \u2026",
          "A must visit if you are in Stockholm.. it is a very historically rich place! Very detailed exhibition of so many things.. amazing place.",
          "The restoration work is very well. You can really feel the vintage ship. The works on the ship is amazing. It was totally worth it to visit this unique museum.",
          "Great the new rooms and the new installations on the museum. More and more interactivity and more and more spectacular. Bravo!",
          "Really interesting, glad I saw it! They offer a short movie (20 or mins) in various languages that gives you all the context and it was a fun area to walk around and read up on",
          "I realized that I had been here some ten years ago. I'd say it's a must-come in Stockholm. One got to appreciate the craftsmanship achieved in that era. The exhibits were authentic. Imagine the poor chaps sinking with the vessel on her maiden voyage inside the harbour- what an anticlimax.",
          "A fabulous old ship that, because it was designed incorrectly, it sank almost immediately after launching into the water. So it could be almost completely recovered (98%) and it was a strong reason to build a dedicated museum for it.\nOtherwise a great museum with many interesting things, all about the Vasa - the old ship.",
          "Was a pleasant surprise! Was not expecting much but as we entered the museum, was completely struck by the awesomeness of the ship! Beautiful details and sculptures. Could see much effort was invested to recreate its original glamour. Great tour and film to explain what might have happened. Must visit!",
          "A fantastic museum, brilliantly presented exhibit and the ship has a real impact when you walk in! A bit more information about each of the exhibits could be nice rather than just what it is but it's still interesting to see!",
          "Thrilling to find the huge ship mostly in original - which had once sunk. Beautiful ship with beautiful handcrafts on the front and elsewhere. Very well preserved. The museum has created various rooms of the ship separately where visitors \u2026",
          "Found the museum very interesting from the perspective of the boat itself, as it's spectacularly well preserved and wonderfully pleasing to the eye, but found a lot of the accompanying exhibits somewhat uninteresting by comparison. We \u2026",
          "Fascinating (and sadly unfortunate) history comes to life at this must-see museum.  Great for folks of all ages.  Spend a few hours and learn about 17th century shipbuilding, the salvage effort, restoration techniques, and the story behind the doomed ship.  Truly a first-class museum.",
          "If you want to experience goosebumps from looking at a ship, this is the place to go or to put on your bucket list. The wait was not long, even though there were a lot of visitors. Everywhere in Stockholm they accept Google pay or Apple \u2026",
          "We planned 2 hours for Vasa museum but it was so interesting we forgot to leave. Vasa museum it's a MUST in Stocholm. You can learn all about the fully intact 17th century ship and about Sweden's history.",
          "Enjoyed the history behind the VASA museum. Tour and short video highly recommended!",
          "Knowing the history and knowledge of our ancestors was great. Highly recommended museum.",
          "Simple but inspiring \nSmall but efficient to see what\u2019s happened in this world and how sailing and ward changes the human life \nGreat touch and recovery of the boat and well organized entertainments. \nVery impressed with design and \u2026",
          "very interesting museum, definitely worth seeing",
          "I was wondering if it's worthy to come here, because tickets are quite expensive. But seeing such old ship in live is an unique experience and all this work made by so many people to get this boat and to renovate it is worthy to appreciate.",
          "Simply impressive place. The guided tour was also one the best (maybe the best) I have ever had in my life.",
          "Such an impressive piece of history! Well organized and informative exhibitions along the history of this monumental ship. Interesting architecture of the museum and very polite and educated personnel. Well spent money and worth a visit for young and old! No extra charges for lockers or guided tours and clean toilets.",
          "Extraordinary museum. An excellent preservation of the history. I enjoyed the documentary film, and great English guided tour. Exhibits are all well constructed. I especially enjoy the wood restoration section.",
          "One must visit this museum if you're in Stockholm. I was fascinated and really got caught up in the sheer beauty of the majestic ship. I do agree that there isn't as much for children upto the age 7 here. There is a small section devoted to \u2026",
          "Amazing place! Huge ship, many information and a lot of space for walking. It's also possible to learn about that time and about maritime.",
          "One of the best museums in the world? I have been to a lot of them and this qualifies on my list. When you go here I really recommend the guided tour which is included in the entrance fee and take about 25 minutes. The movie is also \u2026",
          "Fascinating story and an epic boat that's been preserved for over 330 years!\nWell worth a visit.",
          "Spent 3 hours here! I honestly expected to be bored, but it was far more interesting than I could have imagined. \nWatched the video first (it\u2019s in multiple languages and runs for 20mins) and then did the walking tour (included in cost). \nHowever she just repeated everything in the video.",
          "Must see when in Stockholm. Amazing story about the ship that never sailed. The ship is huge, with so much detail and history. A lovely walk from the city and a great place for Fika!",
          "Amazing. You can easily spend there around three hours, as it covers history, restoration and ship life.",
          "One of the most interesting museums I have seen in Sweden, Stockholm. It's really interesting place to visit even if you aren't interested in museums at alk likw me. It's giant old ship located inside the museum. The local guide will \u2026",
          "in the museum there is just the vessel.  it should also be written and highlighted that the vessel sank on the day of the launch.  consequently it has no engineering value and the reconstructions on life on board are simply meaningless.",
          "Incredible piece of world history - if you are in Stockholm this is an absolute must DO .....just amazing and we spent many hours reading about the history, amazing logistics to raise the Vasa and how life was back in the 1600\u2019s. Highly Recommend",
          "It\u2019s not just a boat. Never has the world of hundreds of years ago been more immediate to experience. Great for young and old.",
          "Great museum, except they have audioguides in so many languages but not in Ukrainian. Make it and receive 5 stars :-)",
          "Features the Vasa ship that was salvaged 333 years after sinking in 1628. I took the free English tour which lasted just 20 minutes. The guide shared interesting stories and historical facts. Souvenir shop inside features interesting items. I bought Swedish souvenirs there.",
          "I had a great experience, and I would like to come back because it's a perfect place and you can to know more about Sweden and your history.",
          "This is a mist see if you are in Stockholm. They have preserved a ship from 17 century so well and you can see all the details. The environment is also very cool. Tons of cool stuff to see and learn",
          "Well well well, if it ain't the good ol Vasa museum... Here you can find corpses of the old crew that worked on the boat, the history of this first class gunship of the great swedish power. Thankfully it sunk for the whole world to see it almost 400 years later. A must once in a lifetime",
          "Came expecting a boat. Left four hours later after reading everything about boats. The Vasa is magnificent and really shows how big the boats were.",
          "Loved the museum. The tour was worth the cost since their insights were much more in depth and allowed our group to ask more questions.",
          "This was probably my husband's favourite place on our recent visit to Scandinavia. It's a modern museum, lots of space and exhibits. The ship is spectacular and can be viewed from many angles. It cost a small fortune to raise this vessel \u2026",
          "Absolut impressiv. A really good musem with a fair price. I was shocked by the size of the ship. I would recommend to visit the museum if you have enough time and are interested in such topics.",
          "Fascinating story and museum is well done, but it's a shame you can't get onto the ship",
          "Wonderful museum. I love that the boat sunk because they put too many guns on it. Something the American in me definitely appreciated.",
          "Would definitely recommend visiting this museum if you get a chance. Fascinating history. I was curious as to how interesting it could really be to just see some sunken ship but they do such an amazing job of showing you not just the ship, but everything else that went on in the ship and the history of how and why it was built.",
          "This was absolutely worth it. Vasa is a beautiful shipwreck, restored and cared for. There is a lot of history. You can take photos and spend a lot of time in this museum.",
          "Great museum about the Vasa ship. Would definitely recommend the visit if you are in Stockholm!",
          "It is fantastic to see this huge ship. The museum has many artifacts which describes the life Sweden has several hundred years ago.",
          "The best museum I've been in the world seriously! It's just incredible what they did with everything! If you are in Stockholm, make sure you don't miss this place!",
          "Great place to visit. It's awesome to see the only left warship of the 17th century and to learn about its history. They did a great job recovering and preserving this vessel in the past 40 years. A must-do when visiting Stockholm!",
          "For sure one of best museums in northern part of Europe. Just take you time and walk into polar explorers past. You can visit even decks and cabins on the ship.",
          "Incredible feeling after visiting this museum. Probably you will not see such a fantastic ship built over 300 years ages ago anywhere else in the world. Strongly recommend to visit it.",
          "The Vasa Museum holds almost an entire ship from the early 1600s that was discovered in the mid 1900s and brought up from the bottom of the Stockholm harbor. I really enjoyed this museum, but I wanted more! This is an incredible story about \u2026",
          "Should be the normal museum. If you have time, I will suggest you guys go to national museum which do not have entrance fee.",
          "Wow! The museum is about the Vasa ship a gigantic piece of human work. There are guided tours in all the languages. You can easily spend more time here that planned.",
          "Great place to explore the history of Scandinavia. Loved the way they maintained the museum and a must checkout place for all the travellers to Sweden or Stockholm.",
          "It is amazing how the Vasa is conserved! The history of it is kind of curious on how it sank.\n\nThe museum is really amazing and the coffee are always good here on Sweden. That's is a for sure must go place for everyone. No only tourists. \u2026",
          "I called in mid week, mid morning. The place is very impressive, I like the self serve ticket kiosks to speed entry. The centre piece of the museum is the boat, however the are fascinating smaller exhibits that chart its creation, building \u2026",
          "They really made this place interesting, fun and cozy.  The ship is of course amazing and the \"movie about Vasa\" is professionally done and very informative,  yet easy to see.",
          "Very amazing to see this preserved old ship. The size of the ship was surprising, even though I read about it beforehand. Worth a visit and I recommend to come when they open at 10am, with first guided English tour 10:30am.",
          "Surprisingly good for a museum with only really one exhibit.   I am always surprised that we recognize our extreme failures.  This boat only sailed 1500 metres before sinking and yet there is a whole museum devoted to it.   Still it is worth a few hours if you are in Stockholm.  The scale of the boat is amazing for the time.",
          "Amazing museum, watch the films they're well made and informative. Well worth the \u00a312 entry fee",
          "Incredible Museum, a aight to behold and well worth the small entree fee. It's something you can't experience anywhere else and the reconstructed parts blend in rather well without being jarring.\nIf you're going to Stockholm it's a definite must see",
          "Crazy story. Cannot miss. Best tourist attraction ever.",
          "The huge Swedish wooden ship from the first half of the 17th century being the main attraction in this museum is truly impressive. You can find a lot of information about day-to-day life on the ship, about historical context and how the \u2026",
          "It is a very impressive museum. You would spend hours without getting bored.",
          "Very impressive massive ship wreck, the only one as old as 1628 and 98% complete. Beautiful wooden sculptures, very interesting exhibition.",
          "Very interesting to see this ship. If you are going to enjoy Vasa visit it in winter, when there are no so many tourists",
          "An impressive visit to a unique warship from the 17th century. A must-see if your in Stockholm.",
          "Very impressive. I recommend to see the museum's movie about the ship",
          "This is an incredible and fascinating museum that really should not be missed during a visit to stockholm.",
          "The boat is great and it is interesting for sure to see a 17th century boat for real. \nI would have love the museum to go more in depth about what this shipped represented at that time in term of money spent, job created and also what it \u2026",
          "Great Museum with lot of information. Interesting film about the Vasa in many languages. Bit cold due to conservation matters for the ship. Way worth to go there!",
          "Great little museum definitely worth visiting. The entire museum is about one ship but it's fantastic just being able to see the rescued ship and all its history.",
          "Fantastic afternoon. So much to see and learn",
          "Mind blowing. Beautiful and sad. Awesome historical lesson that things well executed do not compensate for lack of planning.",
          "I wasn't expecting much when I planned to visit - boy was I wrong! This is a spectacular museum to visit - one of a kind. The Swedish people take pride in this museum and it shows. You can consider this a living museum! The Vasa ship is \u2026",
          "A one of a kind museum! What an amazing experience! Worth every penny, but make sure to arrive there early, the lines can be long!",
          "I thought it would be a \"tourist trap\" but actually it's very nice! Even if you are not into \"ships\". The restaurant was good too, with a variety of foods like soup and open sandwiches",
          "This is a must see museum in Stockholm if for no other reason the chance to see a sailing ship of this era fully assembled and right up close. And what a ship! Meant to be the pride of Sweden's fleet with an intimidating array of cannon and \u2026",
          "An interesting and extremely well-curated museum. Check out the film before exploring the museum exhibits. You can do a self-guided audio tour or join a group tour (both are offered in different languages, as is the film), or just wander \u2026",
          "Wonderful museum doable in about two hours. Well worth the entrance fee and the history and restoration of the ship are amazing to behold!",
          "Only one Great ship with its history.\n\nTicket is quite expensive - about 30 euro. But you will hear some story, will see some exhibitions and some things from this ship. Will hear story of failure and will know why it was doomed from the beginning.",
          "The restaurant at Vasa is one of the best I've visited in Stockholm. Great view, good vegetarian options and the best thing to do after visiting one of Stockholm's most famed museums.",
          "Simply awesome! Even if you're not normally into museums or ships and the high seas, I'd highly recommend a visit. It's a real-life ghost ship, skillfully restored to its eerie, impressive beauty... Disney or Hollywood don't even come close!",
          "It\u2019s cool, but not in my opinion worth 17 euro. It is just a museum dedicated to a ship that never sailed. Way too dark to appreciate any of the ships details. Not really sure why this isn\u2019t part of another museum.",
          "It's amazing to think they were able to move the ship and build the museum. An amazing restoration.",
          "Great museum, great exhibition organization, amazing ship, 3 hours of sightseeing are enough.",
          "Amazing museum featuring the complete remains of the famous Vasa ship. Quite large and interesting way to see a large man o war style ship. Lots of information and in a huge overall area so even when the place is full it doesnt feel crammed \u2026",
          "Pretty breathtaking to see an entire ship in the museum but that's about it. 150SEK per entry so make sure you are ready to part with that amount of money!!",
          "Fantastic, great, very well organised. Enjoy a lot",
          "Very nice museum. The Vasa is in a perfect condition and ir is very interesting. If you are in Stockholm this is the place \"must see\".",
          "Spanish ship found..kept and preserve in the Vada museum..",
          "Stunning craftsmanship and history. Really impressive. Definitely a must do in Stockholm!!!",
          "Highly recommend for visiting!!\ud83d\ude0e \nOne of the most important things to do in order to get a good point of view from the Stockholm city.. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "An excellent peek into 17th century life at sea.  very accessible with information and tours available in both Swedish and English. give yourself about 2 hours to see all levels,  and i recommend raking the elevator to the top and then walk down.",
          "There is more to read, see, and learn than you can handle in one visit. It's why it's so good; because it's a real education. Absolutely great for people of any age.",
          "A great museum. One must watch the short 17 minute film found at the entrance level since it helps to understand the whole process starting from the time the Vasa was built up to the time it was found and restored. An amazing job \u2026",
          "Spectacularly restored 17th century war ship. Great for kids. Best exhibition in Stockholm!",
          "Fantastic museum. The ship is amazing and it's really interesting to see how they raised it up and preserved it. There is a video running in different languages giving u some of the history. I watched the German video as it had English \u2026",
          "Amazing museum. \nLots of information and separated on different levels to take it all in and learn about the Vasa.\nShop and restaurant is very good too.",
          "This place is simly awesome! Do not forget to watch the interesting movie (about 20 minutes) and wait for a guided tour (in every hour untill 15:30) during exploring this extraordinary museum!",
          "Very interesting. With the audio guide you can have information in every language.",
          "A great museum. You will go 400 years back and get a lot of information of this time. A must to go in this museum when you stay in Stockholm",
          "Wow! But it would be nice if the inside of the ship can be visted also.",
          "Very, very interesting museum. Nothing quite like in the world. Seeing the gigantic ship is one thing, but the museum doesn't end there. There's free tours in various languages, information and displays about life in that time and life on \u2026",
          "One of the best museum I ever saw! That place is awesome.",
          "The ship is a time capsule. From it's intended use, to belittle a Royal family cousin, to its importance in showing how ancient iron bolts are corroding despite all we know about chemistry today. While trying to retain the biophysical \u2026",
          "The Vasa museum does a fantastic job providing the history of the ship and its restoration.  The information panels surrounding the ship give a good summary of the features of the ship and/or what would be happening in that part of the ship.  Easily worth the $15 entry fee and worth the time if you're visiting Stockholm.",
          "Spectacularly preserved ship. A must see! Sunk on its maiden voyage and recovered 100's of years later!",
          "The museum is a completely must to visit in Stokholm. Inside the museum there is the Casa which a well-conserved ship of the 1600, its view is totally amazing. In addition there are a lot of areas that describes the story of the ship, life on board, how it wrecked. All is perfectly managed and organised, visit it if you can!",
          "I try to visit this museum whenever I return to Stockholm. I am in awe of the sheer amount of work and dedication that went into the restoration and the other highly informative and in some cases absolutely beautiful displays. \nThe staff \u2026",
          "Fantastic ship and history behind it.  Great museum for all ages with many activities geared for children.  Museum cafe has great food too.",
          "Amazing exhibition of a unique ship with an even more unique  history. Not surprised about the fact that more than a million people visit the Vasa museum. Great background information about life on  board and other specific items about live in Sweden in the early 17th century .",
          "It's a great museum  with the ship wreck so well preserved and the scale of it it's just give you a great idea of what it's like back then to be on a battle ship",
          "An excellent museum where the  centrepiece is a magnificent actual ship built in the 17th Century. There is a lot of background information about the ship and it's crew. \nIt is easily reached using tram 7 and there is also a cafe.",
          "Impressive and interesting. The ship is amazing, and the museum's efforts to set the context of those time very effective.. Unbelievable  how people were so creative carving statutes in such detail...",
          "Definitely worth visiting awesome museum! You can experience the whole history of building, sinking and recovering Vasa. There are also movies about tall ships like Vasa and exhibitions about life and duty on board of a sailing ship. You \u2026",
          "Even better than imagined. An excellent and engaging museum, even without the ship. Obviously a labor of love for many volunteers, engineers, craftspeople and historians. I recommend arriving early to avoid crowds, especially when the cruise ships are in town.",
          "One of the most impressive museums that I have ever visited. To see this ship in real is so amazing. And it's big. Huge. There was a lot of visitors, but it is a big museum, so not that much of a problem. It's easy to move around and expect to use about two hours there.",
          "Great museum!! This was my third time. The first time with my family. They also loved it. Vasa is Impressive. For the kids it is great that they have a movie about Piglet who tells the story about what happened with Vasa.",
          "Loved the museum, great design that allows imagination to run wild!",
          "Largest single object preserved Vasa  ship sunken on her maiden voyage in 1602.",
          "Great museum around the recovery of a full-size war-sailboat from the 17th century. Much more than a boat: it's a whole exhibition, well laid out. Seeing such a boat in real from up close is amazing. Must go in Stockholm.",
          "Amazing place. Unique museum that was built to save and old ship. Interesting exhibition and history of the ship will definitely touch your feelings.",

          "Truly amazing ship and lots of information to go with it. Fun trip out!",
          "What a fantastic museum. Definitely worth a full day's visit, with interest for all the family. Lots of varied displays, plus film showings and tours in a range of languages. We went on the English-language tour - brilliant. It's pricey to go in but well worth it. Excellent restaurant too.",
          "Well what a place absolutely amazing a fully intact galleon a fantastic place to go for an afternoon 100% recommend",
          "Really interesting. If you have ever visited the Mary Rose, this is much more impressive. The English guide was engaging, if a little cheesy... The exhibits have been well thought out too, focussing also on women's role on warships at the \u2026",
          "Loved it so much, a must for everyone. The science, history, innovation, just amazing.",
          "Interesting place with many informative displays and the impressive Vasa ship. Recommend for everyone, even those with no particular interests in ships. It was quite busy when we visited on a weekday afternoon. I suspect it's always busy!",
          "Great museum. Very informative came as part of a tour group so we went right in unlike the very long line of people outside. An hour or 2 is more than enough time here. Outside are some beautiful areas. Very dark inside.",
          "Very impressive but not somewhere I could spend hours",

          "It's a very unique museum with history of different water ways used during old time. The building is also of the shape of the boat.",
          "Reality of the life in the early 1600's.  Artifacts have been recovered and detailed along with this wonderful example of a shipbuilding blunder.  Remarkable efforts by thousands that will keep you wanting more during your visit.  Plan on a whole day here!",
          "Fantastic, focused museum. A must-see in Stockholm!",

          "Vasa is a museum frozen in time. It is a must visit when you are travelling in Stockholm. One is teleported to the 16th century with this majestic ship. The staff is super helpful and professional. There is free cloak room with plenty of \u2026",
          "Truly amazing! They made of a disaster a great opportunity. Forward thinking!",

          "The only vessel in world that survived 343 under the Baltic Sea. 90% of the boat is still in tact. \nAdmission is free for senior citizens and youth.\nIf you come to Stockholm, Vasa museum is a must.",
          "This is a museum not to miss. This old boat is amazingly intact. The films and mock ups of portions of the ship and explanation of what life was life on a ship at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Plenty of things to entertain \u2026",
          "Even my young kids loved this place. It is their favorite museum.",
          "Great experience for the youngs and olders. Smart organisation nice people.",
          "It was an informative and enlightening experience learning about the maritime design and the politics involved in the construction of that period. I was also impressed that 98% of the Vasa was salvaged after being underwater for something like 300 years. It\u2019s the only preserved 17th century ship in the world.",
          "Really interesting museum. The ship is amazing. So pretty. There are multiple floors so you can see the ship from many heights. It is a big place so didn\u2019t feel super crowded. A free tour in English happen to start right when we arrived. \nThe museum is near a Viking museum, the Nordic museum, and the ABBA museum.",
          "Pretty cool museum to see this restored 18th century ship.  Good two hours can be spent here if you watch the informational movie and do a walking tour either guided or on your own.  Several floors to view the ship from which is a great way to get the full scale of this ship.",
          "The Vasa itself is worth the price. The research and reprodcutions are nice but could be more interactive. \nMy recommendation: remember you are on an island full of museums and an open zoo.",
          "The ship is beautiful and it's so amazing how much work has been put in to keep it intact! Our tour guide answered all of our questions and was very nice! I can't wait to come back!",

          "The Vasa museum is one of the best museums I've visited. The facility is well looked after and easy to navigate with a wide range of information spread across mixed media. The ship is amazing and in fantastic condition. I did not expect it \u2026",
          "A must see while in Stockholm. This is super cool to see.  It\u2019s busy with tons of people but worth it.",
          "It's not just the ship. You also have skelettons or things like weapons or daily life utensils they found in the ship. You can see the ship from like 5 levels and different angles, which is cool. I would love to have a protected area where \u2026",
          "One of the best places that I have visited. Very fun and amazing story behind the vasa, very detailed. Love how the history was preserved. I was so curious I couldn\u2019t leave until I read all the information and knew everything, didn\u2019t feel bored at all, it you like knowing history then you will have fun",
          "Fantastic museum for a failed ship and an amazing recovery. Watch the movie first before seeing the rest of the museum - gives you some good context.\n\nComing early is also good. Around noon on a Saturday it was starting to get crowded.",
          "Very good, free guided tours which last 25 mins. Then a 20 min movie that lasts 20 mins. Available in different languages at different times. Exhibits itself is very good and building is a really nice space. Luggage lockers are free inside so you can drop your bag there while you walk around",
          "A unique experience in Stockholm. If you are not a museum person this is the only must-see museum to visit for you. It basically displays the prominent Vasa ship that was sunk and taken out of the sea 300 years later. Every detail about the ship is explained in the museum and there are also short films on how and why it was built.",
          "Always great when you can visit history itself. The display of Vasa is magnificent but funniest was that they now had mimicked how it looked onboard so you could enter a room and see how it would have been when Vasa  was young and new in 1628 just before she sank!",
          "Being able to walk around and look at a ship that sank over 330 years ago and was raised over 50 years ago, reminds one of the amazing technological feats possible.\n\nAlthough I did not spend as much time as I wanted to in the exhibit, just \u2026",
          "Amazing experience. Every floor gave you the opportunity to see a different side of the ship. I would go with what they recommend on the folder, and start with the movie. We didn't have the chance to go on a guided tour so I can't comment on that. But just walking by yourself and reading all the signs was fun by itself.",
          "Cool and informative museum! Worth dropping by for a few hours! There's a great restraunt next door!",
          "Amazing musuem with interesting content. I recommend a 2 hour visit and don't forget to take a guided tour",
          "Nothing special. You may read history of the ship building and elevating in the Internet. It's just a museum for making photos. It would be interesting to visit the ship itself, but there is no such tour.",
          "Such a lot of maritime history. Well worth visiting use the hop on hop off bus as part of planning a visit and have a quick lunch in the restaurant. Good value.",
          "The Vasa ship history is interesting. But the main attraction is the main ship and rest are just stories and not much to explore and see.",
          "Amazing work on this museum! It's not just a ship. You learn about the daily life of the people, the art, the community.\nIt could be the main reason to visit Stockholm.\nDefinitely a must see.",
          "Cool museum, interesting enough for all ages and the ship is absolutely fabulous! It stands majestic in the middle of the hall and the restoration process has gone really well \ud83d\ude43\nWorth a visit for sure!",
          "Really worth visiting, absolutely magical. Will go again if I have the chance to.",
          "The preserved ship is a majestic sight. If you are in Stockholm and are interested in romantic tales, history or boats you should definitely pay the museum a visit. Other than the ship, you have some fun activities you can try out, you can \u2026",
          "It is a different kind of museum. The 17th century ship Vasa has been rescued and restored in this museum. The ship is huge and in a good shape.\nThe museum consists of 7 floors. Each floor has special interest. They have elaborate \u2026",
          "It was a really fascinating visit and worth the money. Great to see such a giant medieval ship like the Vasa. Unfortunately we didn\u2018t have enough time. You can definitely spend there up to two hours to see and learn everything about the Vasa.",
          "Such a great experience.  This is very interesting history and something you can spend at least two to three hours at.  The cafe was very good with many selections and great tasting food.",
          "Wow!! Just WOW! As an ex Naval Officer & square rig sailor, the was definitely my highlight of Stockholm. \nIf you\u2019re wondering if to go or not, I think just go. I can\u2019t imagine how anyone could be disappointed. \nThe ship was extremely well presented with galleries to view it from all angles & the displays were first rate!",

          "The most amazing museum I've ever known.",
          "$15 per adults, kids under 18 free is always going to be a good result in my book. Hugely impressive entrance as the massive bulk of the Vasa rises above you. Wonderfully comprehensive collection of artifacts and set pieces, and some \u2026",
          "What an amazing museum. We had no idea there was a ship as large as this so well preserved. The side exhibits explaining life onboard and the Swedish royal family at the time were also quite interesting. Well worth the visit.",
          "Love it the ship was really in an amazing condition. There is also lots of exhibitions inside therefore it might hours to explore all of them. They gave you free guide, and free theatre as well. It is a truly great museum!",
          "Fantastic museum with a real full sized 16th century warship.   Museum does a good job of laying out all the interesting facts and info across multiple floors that surrounds the ship on all sides.  There are also physical bones of those who died on the ship on display on the lower levels.",

          "Awesome place!  Much time and care was taken into all the exhibits and my only regret is that I didn't have more time.  Being able to go inside the vessel would be amazing, but I realize that simply isn't possible.",
          "I have been here three times and the ship is as impressive as the first time. The exhibition could not be more interesting and appealing to all senses. For children and adults alike a great experience. If you go after 4 p.m. it is cheaper and -more important -less crowded.",
          "Awesome museum. The ship is so impressive and well preserved. Worth visiting!",
          "It is worth exploring. Costs about 15 euros. They have a film about the ship and it lasts for about 20 minutes. That roundsup the story behind the wrecked ship. Great recreation.",

          "It is a must do if in Stockholm, great museum with high standard.",
          "Great museum. It is better than I have expected. Worth the price and We have spent there a lot of time with a pram and year old child. The ship is making a stonishing impression.",
          "It was a pleasant surprise and worthwhile visit.  The museum is solely dedicated to the 17th century ship \u00ab the Vasa \u00bb that sunk in the 1600s and was recovered.  There are very nice displays of its history and life onboard.\n\nHigh recommend for day out with the kids - or when it\u2019s raining.\n\nEntry is around 15-17\u20ac.",
          "Great story of top down incompetence. Don't tell the king he made a mistake. Fascinating exhibition of 17th century warship with 64 guns and 700 wooden statues. Good movie and guided tour.",
          "An amazing exposition of one of biggest ship of that era",
          "Very interesting story about the ship and it\u2019s creation. And the ship is very well preserved. I recommend to take a guided tour within the museum. It takes about 20 minutes.",
          "Interesting place. The wreck is absolutely stunning!",
          "A very detailed and informative museum about the Vasa. You can see the ship in details, from different floors, and every floor there are many detailed explanations about separate components and concepts for it. If you are into naval stuff, \u2026",
          "A wonderful museum where you can view the huge sunken Vasa warship that spent 333 years underwater. Each floor contains different information from highlighting the people behind the Vasa (based on discovered bones and clothing) to what life was like \u2018back in the day\u2019. Incredibly informative and very interesting to see!",
          "Very good and free for up to 18s but would be worth the 150sek",

          "Very interesting ! Full of information. Perfect museum !",
          "Really good. Outstanding battle ship and wonderful displays. Pictures honestly don't do it justice especially its size.

          "Wasa is the one o fthe most famous museum in the world\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Its OK. Not amazing but cool.",
          "Wonderful! If you are interested in how they lifted a ship from the ocean in the 50s and how they preserved it this is a must see. If you are also into giant 17th century ships then why are you still reading this and not getting over to the museum?",
          "A must visit museum. Free guides tours are offered so make sure to take one so you understand the mistake behind the sinking of the ship. The ship is well preserved and the museum has 3 floors which allow you to see all the parts of the ship..from bottom to top. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable.",
          "I would give it 3.5 stars..\nIt's a great ship with great history, impressive to see how many details there are in the ship.\nBeautiful to see but quite expensive for the time you need, 2 hours max..",

          "The best old shipwreck on the word.",
          "Wonderful lesson in history. Very impressive refurbishing of an almost-400-year old sailing vessel. Give yourself at least a couple of hours to see it all. Go later in the day to avoid the crowds in summer.",
          "This is a must-see attraction when visiting Stockholm. The story behind it is somewhat funny and tragic. The ship sunk in 1628 but the conservators/restorers have done and are still doing a marvelous job. You can download the audio-guide on \u2026",
          "The vasa ship is an amazing experience, well worth the entry ticket.",
          "Very well designed and informative museum. You have to go there. The Vasa is impressive. We were there directly when it opened in the morning, thus, it was not crowded BUT one star less for the dirty and very bad smelling toilets.",

          "Fascinating museum. The size and the condition of the ship was really impressive",
          "Brilliant work done in preserving the 400 year old ship which sank in to the sea before it's maiden voyage actually began. Worth a visit.",
          "The ship has been put together beautifully. Gives a great sense of the projection of power intended, and how it ultimately failed. Also plenty of history of the 16th and 17th century as well as the recovery of the sunken ship.",
          "A really impressive museum. The sheer size of the ship is mind-blowing, a beautiful display of history.",
          "The exhibitions are interesting and have a lot of information. The movies give you a good background about the ship and the museum, and ongoing conservation. It is obvious lot of hard work and dedication has been put into Vassa and it is well worth the visit.",
          "Big boat! Great guided tours",
          "Very informative exposition with a story how the ship was recovered from the bottom.",

          "The Vasa museum is a very nice museum to see as a visitor or inhabitant. The museum holds the world's best preserved 17th century ship. The Vasa ship capsized and sank in Stockholm 1628. After 333 years on the sea bed the mighty warship was \u2026",

          "Very nice place. Cool ship.",
          "One of the best museums I have visisted so far. Focused on the Vasa - the ship, its people and its time - the museum does not deviate from its concept and everything feels right.",
          "The Vasa Museum (Swedish: Vasamuseet) is a maritime museum in Stockholm, Sweden. Located on the island of Djurg\u00e5rden, the museum displays the only almost fully intact 17th century ship that has ever been salvaged, the 64-gun warship Vasa \u2026",
          "Museum with an old and enormous ship that it's amazing to see. It's not a must see museum but if you have time it's fine to spend it there.",

          "Very informative piece of Maritime history.",
          "Ok.Very Good.",
          "Great story about the ship, what happend and how things where  back then. Worth the trip!",
          "Love the actual Vasa ship on display.  They've done a great job of explaining and displaying how life and conditions would have been.\nAnd the to scale replica is well done.",
          "Loved it. Incredible story and awesome up close look at a national treasure.",
          "Get history as to the vessel, how it was constructed, and being able to see it's size in person was great.",
          "Very impressive museum. The live Tour guide was lack lustre which was why it gets a 4 but the film is definitely worth seeing.",

          "Amazing experience. Totally recommend.",
          "Amazing museum, especially for history and navy lovers, highly recommended! \ud83d\ude03",
          "Been before a number of years ago & still as lovely as I remember. Liked the pouffes that you could just lie on whilst looking up at the wonderful painted ceiling. Could have stayed all day - so relaxing & considering just one room , steeped in history & fascination.",
          "Fascinating! My favourite museum in Stockholm. It takes almost 2 hours to visit",
          "Really enjoyed this museum. Full scale ship. Make sure to take the time to watch the intro video. It is dark so remember your glasses. Lots of displays with genuine artifacts, skeletons included.",
          "Pretty impressive museum, totally worth the visit! They reconstructed a 1620\u2019s warship that had sunk. The exhibition takes you through history showing how it was built, how people lived in the boat, all the way to why it sunk and how it was \u2026",
          "Very interesting history of the Vasa ship. Beautifully restored. Nice ambiance.",
          "Would definitely recommend visiting this museum if you get a chance. realy such a nice Museum and Beautiful ship which had sunk  in the past.",
          "Not bad, featured a huge viking ship and historical facts",
          "A must see. Largest preserved ship of this era in the world. Awe inspiring! Museum is cold so bring a jacket and also very low lighting to help\nPreserve the wood so bring a camera with good low light capability.",
          "What a great place to visit while in Stockholm. The view of the ship as u walk in to the museum is just breath taking ,high recommend visiting the Vasa myseum",
          "Absolutely stunning.  It is a must to see",
          "The biggest object found and conserved, the history of the boat is very interesting, worth the ticket!",
          "Very nice museum with lots of interesting exhibition objects. For young and old many things to explore and hands-on demonstrations",

          "Incredible museum, really immersive ! A must-see visit to Stockholm",
          "Truly a spectacular ship! We went with our 4 kids and they all enjoyed it. There are two auditoriums that show the film about the Vasa, we went to the 2nd auditorium because there were fewer people but it seems like they only show it in \u2026",
          "Historic and so amazing, enjoyed it completely",
          "Must see in Stockolm! Even better if you could take the guided tour. Try also to get there by boat. Imprescindible de Estocolmo!",
          "Very impressive. The history of the restoration project is intriguing. The \"imagined\" representations of some of those aboard is very informative. Well worth a visit.",
          "What an impressive museum. The ship is indeed an impressive artifact and worth the visit just to see it, the wealth of information and the obvious love and considerable efforts and attention to detail are evident in each corner. Highly \u2026",
          "Excellent - so much to see and read - very organised and well thought out. Several floors to view the main boat from giving excellent views. The shop is nice also.",
          "The Vasa museum is a lovely indoor museum to attend. While the battle ship never saw battle and only sailed 1500 metres, the ship is amazing and most of the information is worth reading. The downfall is that it\u2019s a busy place and not a lot of space for everyone.",
          "Amazing historical museum of the Vasa a shipwreck which was saved after 300 years. Amazing design & workmanship, well worth a visit.",
          "awesome to see an entire ship of that age in that amazing condition",
          "Excellent place with a huge ship in the middle of museum. It's just very interesting. Must visit place in Stockholm",
          "You see the boat when you walk in. It is big, looks like a crazy design and it is amazing it still exists today. And that is pretty much that for this museum.",
          "Decent museum. It is mostly irrelevant for visitors from the US since ultimately it is just an old boat that sunk right after it was built and it is primarily an example of a failed design. Most of the displays on the preservation efforts \u2026",
          "My second visit to the museum over the years and it is every recommended. I don't think one needs all day but 2+ hours ideal.. Great story telling of the shop. Very interesting and impressive to see the shop in real life. Truelly gob stopping.",
          "Great place, definitely must visit in Stockholm! \n\nMuseum of an ancient ship which drawn 2 hundred years ago! The museum is well organised, an advice is to take a paper guide and connect to the museum wi-fi, visit the museum website and \u2026",

          "Mind blowing visit to Vasa museum, not to be missed in Stockholm!",
          "What an amazing exhibition! The ship is so incredibly huge. I think this is a must-see in Stockholm. Plan at least 2 hours there. We arrived at approx 9:30am and there was no line for the tickets. When we were leaving at noon, the line was \u2026",
          "Very large and detailed museum that includes an clear video in multiple languages about the history of Vasa as well as a cartoon for children in many languages. The different aspects of the discovery and the ship, including the skeletons pulled from the water are very well presented. The cafe is nice too with some seaside views.",
          "Only Swedish people can make a complete failure into a unique and amazing thing. Really something you should see, completely preserved ship from 1628.",
          "This place was a real treat. Highly recommend.",
          "Impressive exhibition in a modern space with an unique atmosphere",
          "Awesome galleon up close. Brings the ship and times to life. The galleries give good views of the ship from all aspects. The exhibits give an insight into the building of the vessel and the role of women . The museum can get rather crowded on Sunday mornings",
          "This is a must see in Stockholm.  The ship is very well preserved along with many artifacts.  The story is very interesting.",
          "Very interesting museum about the naval ship, the people in that time and the restoration & preservation work.",
          "Awesome place awesome history... the big ship is splendid...a must visit in Stockholm",
          "Is a great experience to visit this Museum. You can have a experience of the rarest old ships which take you to history where Transport, trade and wars were dependent on wooden ships. You can feel yourself as the Jack Sparrow Pirates of \u2026",
          "Those who build this museum are much better builders than those who built the ship... excellent museum, incredible to house a ship that big. The documentary (~15') is a must.",
          "Fascinating museum. Definitely worth the trip!",
          "1. A must visit for tourists in sweden.\n2. The musuem is well maintained and does not just explain artifiacts from the vasa ship but also how the musuem operates.\n3. The various narratives and storyline presented with the artifacts spurs imagination of the visitors.",
          "How do you turn Sweden's greatest socio-economic disaster into one of the nations greatest archaeological treasures? They know how at the Vasa museum! In different exhibitions around this truly enormous shipwreck, you may find information \u2026",
          "You expect a ship and you get so much more",
          "Nice place, good experience... But really too expensive although everything is keeped in perfect caring!",
          "This was one of the most educational museums I had ever been even interested in. The guides are so great and speak English very well like most young people in sweden",
          "Really good display. Loved that the information was varied but not so much that you'd spend all your time reading off boards. The boat is really impressive.",
          "Make sure you watch the move inside. Also, it's better if you buy the tickets online. At the opening (10am) it's very busy with a long line.",
          "The ship is very impressive, but the museum has nothing else so the price is abit high",
          "Enjoyed our time here greatly. Very interesting exhibit.",
          "There isn't much new we can say about this amazing slice of history 400 years ago recently raised from the sea bottom. The museum's attention to detail and exhibits of life in 1628 are worth a long visit.",
          "Beautifully restored historical war ship. Very well maintained. A movie about the ship is played in multiple languages and the also offer a guided tour.",
          "150 kr to get in. There is movie session the goes for about 20 minutes showing how the ship sank and the recovery process. Also tour guide in english that goes for 30 minites and other languages included. But have to wait for the schedule. Recommended to attend both of them before spending your own time exploring the rest of the museum",
          "Amazing place, worth visiting.",
          "If you visit anything in Stockholm, this should be it. More than just the ship, the museum is packed with information, videos and things to see. English tour guide was excellent.",
          "Perhaps the best museum experience I have had. Outstanding curation and consideration of the widest possible rang of visitors. Breathtaking scale.",
          "The centrepiece is the amazing (huge) boat, but there are a host of interesting exhibits around it.  And a fascinating film (loops every 20 mins), do not miss !   All in all, fabulous !  Allow lots of time.",
          "Amazing ship, in really good condition. Exhibits are really well preserved.",
          "Its a must see attraction. The ship is worth seeing. The museum is very well organised. It contains information about how it was built, how it sank, preservation of the ship after recovery and much more. There are guided tours as far as i \u2026",
          "Super interesting! Even if you are not a big geek for history, it is still really fascinating. The finding and restoring process is amazing and i hope you visit it. \u263a\ufe0f",
          "An archaeological tour de force, the story of the raising of the ship and treating the wood for years to preserve it is most compelling.  The ship itself is a hilarious vanity project that sank on its maiden voyage, not even getting out of the harbor",
          "A one of a kind museum and worth visiting if you are in Stockholm. The museum is about the Vasa ship, but it is so much more. It gives the visitor a good insight into the very harsh reality of 17th centrum maritime life. \n\nThe museum caters to all ages, with special activities for the little ones.",
          "A bit expensive, but worth every penny. The whole ship can be seen and all the infos that could be gathered from the recovery of the former sunken ship.\nFor the non historians like me:\nThere are some recreated parts of the ship and models \u2026",
          "Got our backpack stolen *Inside* the museum cafe. That meant paying a $15 ticket and entering a closed space with 0 security systems. And we were not the only people who got something stolen that morning. They really need better security systems and CCTV.",
          "Definitely not worth it's payment. Over rated but nothing great in this.",
          "This was one of my worst museum experiences ever. While the ship itself was no doubt amazing, it was so full of tourists and huge tour groups that you couldn't read anything or follow along with the history. They seem to not care about crowd control and will let as many people in.",
          "Wow! This place shouldn't be missed if one is visiting Stockholm. One of the most interesting and well organized museums I ever visited.",
          "The ship is amazing and you're able to see every detail of it."

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden (Swedish for \"King's Garden\") is a park in central Stockholm, Sweden.  It is colloquially known as Kungsan.\nThe park's central location and its outdoor caf\u00e9s makes it one of the most popular hangouts and meeting places in Stockholm.  It also hosts open-air concerts and events in summer, while offering an ice rink during winters. There is also a number of caf\u00e9s, art galleries and restaurants; for example Galleri Doktor Glas, a name taken from the novel Doctor Glas by Hjalmar S\u00f6derberg published in 1905.\nThe park is divided into four distinct spaces (south to north): (1) Square of Charles XII; (2) Molin's Fountain; (3); Square of Charles XIII and (4) \"Fountain of Wolodarski\" (which does not have an official name).  The park is administered and events in it organized by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nA number of Stockholm landmarks are found around the perimeter of Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden:\nSouth of the park is the quay Str\u00f6mgatan interconnecting the bridges Str\u00f6mbron and Norrbro, both of which stretches over to the Stockholm Old Town and the Royal Palace.\nNorth of the park is Hamngatan with the department stores PK-huset and Nordiska Kompaniet (NK) facing the park.\nKungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rdsgatan stretches along the park's eastern side.  A series of prominent buildings are lined-up along it:  Stockholm Synagogue by Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander, 1867\u201370, Jernkontoret by Axel Kumlien, 1875, Palmeska huset by Helgo Zettervall, 1884\u201386, today the headquarters of Handelsbanken, and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB), then the Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden Stockholm metro station.\nOn the western side are the Royal Swedish Opera with the Opera Bar, Saint James's church, Ivar Kreuger's Matchstick Palace designed by Ivar Tengbom, and Sverigehuset (home to a tourist information centre) designed by Sven Markelius, 1961\u201369.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThough the royal kitchen garden is known to date back to the Middle Ages, it is first mentioned in historical records as konungens k\u00e5lg\u00e5rd (\"king's cabbage garden\") in 1430.  (See also Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rdsgatan.)  The royal property in the area was considerably enlarged through an acquisition in 1454 and further expanded throughout the following century.  This utilitarian garden was gradually transformed into an enclosed royal Baroque pleasure garden and accordingly referred to as \"King's Garden\" throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.  The garden was a symmetrical composition centred on a fountain and separated from the waterfront by the Makal\u00f6s Palace (\"Peerless\").However, the demolition of the walls began in the early 19th century, and for the inauguration of the statue of Charles XIII in 1821, his successor Charles XIV John had most of the garden replaced by a gravelled open space ordered to be named \"Square of Charles XIII\".  When Makal\u00f6s was destroyed by fire in 1825 the park was extended south down to the waterfront.  Notwithstanding the area became a popular spot for bourgeois social life and military drilling, Charles XIV's initiative never was appreciated, and in the 1860s the space was subsequently furnished with the tree-lined avenues still giving the park its character and through which the old name prevailed.  In addition, the park's showpiece, the tall and elaborate Molin's Fountain, was cast in bronze and given a space in the park.The following century saw several proposals to have the northern section of the park replaced by various buildings, but during WWII a contract determined the area should remain a park and in 1970 it finally became the property of the city.In the 1970s, construction of the metro station caused much controversy since the plans called for the old elms to be cut down, which led to violent protests and a tree-hugger campaign on May 12-May 13, 1971 with people chaining themselves to the trees, the so-called Battle of the Elms.  Eventually these protests not only saved the trees and caused the station entrances to be located east and west of the park, but they also marked the end of a period when many old buildings in central Stockholm were demolished.The park had a reputation for rioting youth, prostitution, and drug dealing in the 1980s.  Extreme-right demonstrations in the 1990s by the statue of Charles XII altered its reputation.  It was redesigned in the late 1990s to it present shape.  In 2004, 285 new linden trees were planted to replace the sick elms (of which some dated back to the 17th century) and new pavilions with caf\u00e9s were added.\n\n\n== Squares of both Charles ==\n\nThe southern third of the park. called Karl XII:s torg (\"Charles XII's Square\") is centred on the statue of Charles XII by Johan Peter Molin, inaugurated for the 150th anniversary of the king's death on November 30, 1868.  The square, until then forming a section of the levelled park carrying the name of Charles XIII, was subsequently renamed after Charles XII and transformed into more of a park than a square.The park is centred on the statue of Charles XIII, King of Sweden from 1809 until his death in 1818, commissioned by his successor Charles XIV John.  The Neoclassicist composition of Gustaf G\u00f6the (1779\u20131838), inaugurated in 1821, is escorted by four lions sculpted by Bengt Erland Fogelberg (1786\u20131854), added in 1824, and each of which are holding a ball carrying the Norwegian and Swedish coat of arms alluding the Swedish-Norwegian Union initiated by the king.\nThe anchor under the king's right arm reminds us of his great naval victories during the Russo-Swedish War 1788-1790.Now, Stockholmers were widely displeased with Charles XIII and therefore referred to the statue as \"a gardener without a garden just as a king without honour\" and, as Charles XII is surrounded by four backs from mortars, in Swedish called kruka (\"pot\") and Charles XIII is flanked by four lions, again popular humour used the opportunity to throw some dirt at the latter by referring to both statues as \"a lion among pots and a pot among lions\".\nOn the location for the statue of Charles XII was the palace Makal\u00f6s (\"Peerless\"), owned by the Constable of the Realm and Count of L\u00e4ck\u00f6 Jakob De la Gardie and completed in 1642.  The palace was transferred to the Crown under King Charles XI and rebuilt into an armoury in 1690.  Following the death of Gustav III in 1792 the palace was rebuilt into an opera house.  The opera house burned to the ground during a performance in 1825, fragments from it today exhibited in the nearby metro station.  Since the exposition of 1866, the western part of the square, named Lagerlunden (\"The Laurel Grove\"), is renowned for the exclusive dining-rooms of the rebuilt opera house.In the early 1970s, this was the location for the Battle of the Elms (Slaget om almarna), protests which ended the demolition of central portions of Stockholm.  In the 1990s, the square was made a popular gathering spot for right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis usually holding parades on November 30 every year. Occasionally, this has resulted in clashes with left wing protesters and real battles have taken place in Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden.  Today it is mostly known for the so-called Tehuset (\"Tea House\") offering coffee, sandwiches, and other refreshing things.\n\n\n== Fountain of Molin ==\nThe fountain of Johan Peter Molin, originally carved in plaster, was the centrepiece of a Scandinavian art and industry exposition in 1866.  While the exposition's main building, stretching 200 metres across the park and crowned by a dome 30 metres wide, was over-crowded with objects, it failed to attract an audience.  The fountain was, however, appreciated to the extent a subscription was raised to have it cast in bronze, and was subsequently inaugurated in 1873 on the same location.The mythological characters inhabiting the fountain are the ocean god \u00c6gir and his wife R\u00e1n with their nine daughters, all listening to the river spirit Nix playing his harp.  It symbolizes Stockholm located between the upper bowl, Lake M\u00e4laren, and the lower basin, the Baltic Sea.  The six swans, still offering fresh water to passers-by, were late additions, the artist condescending the audience's apprehension of the sculpture as mere luxuriousness.\nFor the inauguration of the fountain, willow trees were planted in the park.  These are a hybrid of the willow species Peking Willow (Salix babylonica), in English known as Thurlow Weeping Willow (Salix pendulina elegantissima) but in Swedish given the name font\u00e4npil (\"fountain willow\") in recognition to still the admired artwork.\nAs one of thirteen objects selected for a project 1999\u20132006 to decorate prominent buildings and milieus in Stockholm with fiber optics, the fountain was furnished with a score of light sources accentuating the sculptures and cascades of water, toppled by a laterally emitting cable in the upper bowl.\n\n\n== Fountain of Wolodarski ==\n\nIn August 1998, a total number of 63 Sakura trees (\"Japanese cherry\") were planted; each spring when they all blossom is an experience of beauty and scent in the park.  Additionally, city architect Alexander Wolodarski commissioned artist Sivert Lindblom to design the large bronze urns now lined up along the new rectangular fountain.  Lindblom has also furnished the small square Blasieholmstorg just east of the park with Byzantine horses.\nWolodarski's renewal of the park has been met with protest focusing on the \"Baroque\" scale and geometry of his design.  Others have been critical about the park being \"handed over\" to an entrepreneur \u2013 for example, the head of the city's garden department was upset nothing much remains of the park, notwithstanding the park was even reshaped into a golf course to suite a Mercedez-Benz campaign.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Stockholm\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nM\u00e5rtelius, Johan (1999). \"Norra Innerstaden\".

          "This is a beautiful park filled with flowers, trees & people - with the equally beautiful St. Jakob's Church looming over it. Every day I was in Stockholm, I always would find myself here, walking around. It was almost like the streets were funneling me to it.",
          "Beautiful view during the autumn. Lots of leaves and beautiful trees even though the fountain was off and empty this time of the year. Still a nice place to seat during the afternoon weekend and have a cup of coffee",
          "Peaceful walk on its own island. Take a break without a cinnamon bun and literally stop and smell the flowers.",

          "We wanted out trip to Sweden to be more than running from one tourist attraction to the next. A stop at the garden was the perfect fit. We enjoyed a simple hotdog lunch by the fountain and then walked a little further down to listen to a lively band in the concert area. A",
          "I felt this park was a good place to take a minute to rest and people watch. There was some cool sculpture of the three lions. I was in Stockholm during the election, so the park had many solicitors. Overall it was nice, but I thought the TGIF's located at the north end was",
          "It is not much of a park, but a very nice area with a lot of people and trees and small kiosks with drinks. Too many electric kickbikes to make it pleasant and safe. But it is car free. We tried some ice cream just north east of TGIF. Apart from rediculus expensive, it was",

          "The park is pretty nice, not sure that I'd recommend eating here though. The plantings were nice, and the surroundings we picturesque as well. Worth walking through here on your way to somewhere else (but wouldn't necessarily go far out of my way to visit).",

          "I was in Stockholm the week during the food festival in this park area. Although the event was good I could not see the park to its full potential. It is ideally located whether you arrive on foot or by the ferry boats. Like the majority of Stockholm it is worth a visit",

          "We came here to as a part of the City Tour, where we learned about the \"battle of the elms,\" then we returned for the open food fair, which was delicious. I would highly recommend this, especially now that the park is friendlier toward open containers.",

          "There are a lot of sakura / cherry blossom trees in the middle part of the garden. We were so lucky when we visited the park in mid-April as we got to see all those lovely flowers blossoming! It's such a lovely view! We thought we would only see sakura in Asia so we totally",
          "I visited the park the park during cherry blossom time in the end of April. The park was so full of people that we only took a few photos and walked through it to the waterfront. The park itself was beautiful with the beautiful trees and fountais but I recommend you to go there",

          "Now if I was a striking blonde Swede in a white turtleneck, I'm sure I'd want to be seen here. It definitely felt like a congregation point for locals and tourists in the middle of the city. The NYC park that it reminds me the most of is neither Central Park nor Washington",
          "A place that brings life to this part of Stockholm. A bit dead the day we visited due to bad weather but this park has a lot to offer during the year. Both at winter as well as summer. The closeness to the central railway station, metro, busses and trams makes it easy to reach",

          "I happened to accidentally find Kungstradgarten park when looking for a tram to take me over to another part of Stockholm, but stopped there as there was a lively Oktoberfest celebration going on. It's a quaint park, even without Stockholm's frequent events, and there is so much",

          "I visited in November and it has already snowed a little, the weather was cold and ice skating is a great entertainment. Although it was plenty of people by the time I went, it's free if you have your skates, renting is worth it, but be aware they are going to be extremely",

          "Outdoor cafes and fountains are only some of the attractions in the wonderful city centre park. Extensively to the waterside it is a lovely green area to stroll through. A landmark is the great fountain, featuring the creation by Molin in the 1860s. It is laden with mythology",

          "Was tired from walking the whole day. Lots of space to choose from to sit. Had various groups of people around without feeling unsafe. Bought an ice cream and enjoyed the surroundings and then read a book. Pleasant experience.",
          "First of all, a few centuries ago this used to be the King's private garden. That's why it still bears that name. Much has changed since then. Gardenwise I can strongly recommend the cherry blossom during the spring. Many trees and just gorgeous to rest the eyes on. There are",

          "As a tourist you will pass Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden daily. So you don't have to explore it further. Apart from some trees and Molins fountain there is nothing to it. Avoid the coffeehouses and restaurants.",
          "The trees were in blossom when I was there and it looked so beautiful. There was also a lot of work going on in the park which I think might have got to do with the Eurovision song contest that will be happening here in a few weeks time. Loads of people milling around taking",

          "My family and I visited Stockholm for New Year. The city is beyond beautiful on a winter day with the sun shining. Especially visiting Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden and the outdoor ice skating facilities made a lasting impression. You may rent ice skates and skate for one hour - regardless",

          "The place is pretty crowded with all kind of skaters - as usual, the most annoying are the \"good\" ones constantly showing off, spinning and dancing around the normal people, often creating pointless danger (expecially for the younger kids). Seriously guys, if you're so good, go",

          "Admittedly, they were preparing for the Stockholm half marathon when we left yesterday :-). It's a great place where you can eat or relax and just people watch. Shops at your doorstep when you feel the need to move on. In Winter, the fountain ices up and they have ice skaters",
          "The \"kungsan\" is more happening during mild summer evenings than it is in early September. Still, a nice place for a walk to get away from the hustle and bustle of the nearby shops and shopping centres. There are some coffee places along the edges of the park worth exploring.",

        "wiki": "Gr\u00f6na Lund (Swedish pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0261r\u00f8\u0302\u02d0na \u02c8l\u0275n\u02d0d]; lit. \"Green Grove\"), or colloquially Gr\u00f6nan (Swedish pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0261r\u00f8\u0302\u02d0nan]), is an amusement park in Stockholm, Sweden. Located on the seaward side of Djurg\u00e5rden Island, it is relatively small compared to other amusement parks, mainly because of its central location, which limits expansion. The 3.8 ha (9.4 acres) amusement park has over 30 attractions and is a popular venue for concerts in the summer. It was founded in 1883 by James Schultheiss.\n\n\n== History ==\nGr\u00f6na Lund's roots are in the 1880s, making it Sweden's oldest amusement park. However the area has been used for similar purposes since the early 18th century. In 1883, a German by the name of Jacob Schultheiss rented the area to erect \"carousels and other amusements\". Until 2001, descendants of Schultheiss ran Gr\u00f6na Lund. Before the amusement park came into being, Gr\u00f6na Lund was the name of a small park.\nThe park's location is unique in the sense that most of the buildings are old residential and commercial structures from the 19th century. The buildings were not built for the park; instead, the park was built around the buildings. The park has three different entertainment venues: Dansbanan (Lilla Scenen), Gr\u00f6na Lundsteatern and Stora Scenen.\nGr\u00f6na Lund features most attractions common to amusement parks, such as a tunnel of love, a funhouse and seven roller coasters. Gr\u00f6na Lund is also known for its rock and pop music concerts; the capacity record is held by Bob Marley, who attracted 32,000 people in 1980; it was his third performance at the venue, after stints in 1977 and 1978. The record is unbeatable since new regulations prevent such large audiences at Gr\u00f6na Lund. American rapper Nas performed with almost 22,000 people in 2010.\nThe park is easily accessible by tram #7, bus #67 and by ferry from the city centre. Its central location allows visitors to view large parts of Stockholm from the taller attractions.\nSince 2006, the park is owned by Parks & Resorts Scandinavia AB, which is wholly owned by the Tidstrand family, which also owns Kolm\u00e5rden Zoo and Skara Sommarland.\n\n\n== Rides ==\n\n\n=== Roller coasters ===\n\n\n=== Other rides ===\nEclipse - 121.9 m tall swing ride, opened in 2013, height limit 1.2 m.

          "We stopped here the first day we were in Stockholm, which also happened to be the second-to-last day of their regular season. We really enjoyed our time here. My boys (ages 7 and 8) talked about the park for the rest of our trip. There was plenty to do, especially for younger",
          "Visited the park recently whilst on half term for a family break in Stockholm. We went passed the park many times on the ferry, so thought we should visit. Our 6 year old loves rides and this park left her very happy - she went on the eclipse, 'wild mouse' and the red hanging",
          "Partner and I (both 22 years old) though we'd visit here while in stockholm as we hadn't even heard of it but saw it over the water from our hostel. You pay for both entry and rides, but we thought we'd make a day of it and bought unlimited rides so we wouldn't have to worry",
          "It was a nice tivoli, but tre area for the small children was too small. The teenagers enjoyed themselves very much and loved the big attractions. The price for the tickets were a little to expensive for my taste. There are several restaurants at the site, with good food, but",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Gr\u00f6na Lund. Whilst I am confused as to why you pay an entrance fee and then pay for the rides as well, we used the Stockholm Pass to gain entry and then purchased coupons. The rides are a mix of basic, old school and thrill rides. It\u2019s amazing",

          "The attractions are very good. The issue is that you have to wait a lot for everything, this is very disappointing. The whole area is very crowded and you have to wait around 30-40 minutes for every attraction. And then the attraction itself goes for 2-3 minutes. So, I'm not",
          "Oh it was so much fun! We stayed one more day in Stockholm so we can spend another day at the Grona Lund. And we listened to 2 concerts there - Bastille and Hozier. Wow. The new ride called snake is fantastic, I yelled my lungs out and probably my brains. Magic carpet is",
          "There are a lot of great rides here for youngsters. It is a confusing set up where you are pay for entry to the park and then for the rides separately. Most kids seem to have wristbands but you can buy individual tickets at the dark green terminals inside the park - no queues",
          "We spent the day there with the children and they all had a great time. We however had an unpleasant experience with one of the park staff. One of the younger kids needed to use the bathroom during a long wait and had to leave the line leaving behind her siblings for a quick",

          "The park needs to check the safety of the rides, the straps and mechanisms on the rides don\u2019t hold the person in place that well. On many rides the person\u2019s head goes all over the place. The Tovoli Garden in Copenhagen is much safer and more exciting.",
          "I went here with my nine year old daughter, who is just under 140cm. That said there were so many rides we could do together. We went towards the end of August on a wet weekday. As a result there were virtually no queues and we went on more rides than I can count. Favourites",

          "We were two families with 5 teenagers. Not having been to Grona Lund before we weren't sure what to expect and bought \u20ac36 'bracelets' for unlimited rides. However when we entered, we saw that most of the rides were of the extreme variety, with most people screaming their heads",
          "Very nice amusement park with lots of rides appropriate for children of various ages. I\u2019m ducking one point for a very long queue that got built up at the hamburger stand. One employee working alone for almost 30 minutes. In any case, would be happy to come back next year.",
          "My daughter insisted on going to Grona Lunds and boy, did she have fun! There are a number of rollercoasters which are great fun for kids. The park is easily reached with the Djurgarden Ferry, and the entrance is right next to the place where the ferry docks. On a hot summer",

The space is quite small so one has to wonder how they managed to fit all those rides and coasters. We",

          "This compact park is located close to the city Centre on Djurg\u00e5rden. We took a ferry at Slussen, which docked right in front of the park. The park opened at 1500 on the day of our visit. We arrived at 1630. It's a weekday and it wasn't crowded at all but people came flocking",
          "The real time of being on any of the rides is almost nothing comparing to 20-40 min. queues. It really annoying for grown-ups and almost impossible to manage with kids. So first you stay to get ticket to get in (possibly can be avoided via internet) and then stay another line",
          "I walked through this classic fun park. Many high-flying rides I have long-past given up. Carnival atmosphere, food, fun music to lighten your day. Great family fun. This would be an amazing movie set for a John Le Carre thriller. I can also see James Bond running through the",

          "Nice and small with superb rides!! Great vibe as well.\nAlthough, they sold us tickets to House of Nightmares knowing it's closed for a concert. Was a bit disappointed by that. So just make sure if there is any concert happening",
          "You find here a lot of different rides for all ages. Nice foodplaces as well. And very often, there a famous artists from all over the world.",
          "Great amusement park! Too crowded from time to time. Might inform even better of height restrictions, so you wouldn't figure them out after queueing for 30 minutes. This has improved a bit, but could still do better.",
          "Pretty good organization for such a big concert. I felt safe and guided all the way through, and the entrance was very fast. It goes better when you buy the ticket online before you get in the park - the line to buy tickets is always a bummer.",
          "Great theme park in the centre of Stockholm. The entrance fee is low however you have to pay for each ride. They do have ticket options for complete access but depending on the queue times it might or might not be worth it. It can get very busy. Good blend of tame and not so tame rides, so something for everyone here.",
          "It was so great we went twice!!! They have fantastic rides and all the theme park food that will give you lots of nostalgia! One of my favorite places ever!",
          "It's a great place to go to if you want to have a great deal of fun. Perfect it you have kids, there are awesome rides for young ones. Also live music (not sure if it's daily or on specific days) in both Swedish and English. If you're \u2026",
          "We went on Sunday - wait time in lines max 10 minutes. Worth (cost efficient) buying unlimited pass after 7 pm. Loved this place!",
          "Nice place to hang out with family, specifically with young children. There are so many rides. We just loved it. Also the House of Nightmares was truly an outstanding experience. Don't get scared inside it.",
          "Good food, clean, can be a little crowded at times. Wait times for rides can be long during peak times. Go after 7 pm 1900 if you can it's cheaper and ride lines are shorter. Probably one of THE best small amusement parks I have every been to. If you get a chance to go do so.",
          "What a lovely theme park. Thank you for the wonderful experience there!",
          "Very disappointing!! After paying for the entrance of the park we thought we were up for a fun day for 150 SEK p.p. After that, whilst climbing over other people to walk through the park, we were confronted by the fact that you also had to \u2026",
          "Fun place to bring the kids for the day or afternoon. It was a bit confusing that you have to pay for an entrance ticket and then when you get in you pay for ride tickets. We just got a booklet of 20 coupons and then paid for rides \u2026",
          "I am in Gr\u00f6na Lund first time but i will be back again in Summer time . The best time to spend all day there",
          "A place eagerly awaited to viste by our four daughters. For years and years they wanted to visit it and do all crazy rides. However, we had to wait until the youngest was tall enough to join, namely 140 cm. This year she reached it and they \u2026",
          "To compare with other amusement parks I've been to, is boring \ud83d\ude15 you don't really get the feeling of excitement that you should get at such a place. Rides are very short (2 min approx) and not really any special at all! Most of rides need 3 \u2026",
          "Amazing park! Went on a Friday to see Millencolin at night and they sounded great. Didn\u2019t have to wait much to ride the games, and the staff was really polite :). If you want to ride multiple games I\u2019d advise to get a ride pass since it\u2019s gonna be cheeper than buying single tickets.",
          "Great rides specially roller-coaster but waiting time was long 50-60 minute",
          "Our soccer team came here after a tournament and had a blast.  The natural setting with water and forest at the park is wonderful and it was nice to experience.  I hope to go back some day.",
          "Spending money on rides wasn't a bad idea at all. It was fun an exciting. Great place to spend time with family and friends.",
          "The park is quite compact, but has enough rides for every taste, including very fast rollercoasters, free fall and catapult rides. Entrance is 12 \u20ac, all rides cost separately once inside, suggest getting a day pass for 35 \u20ac.",
          "Great amusement park but be wary of queues, some can be 90+ minutes long. There's a website that keeps track of them for you. My advice is to come earlier in the day or on a weekday. Also, some attractions are not plus size friendly. I'm \u2026",
          "They have fun and exciting attractions, lots of nice toilets but the ques are a bit long (like any other tivoli). Overall a very nice place to take your family or just by yourself.",
          "It's so good, like, OMG I do not understand how it is so good here! Like, when it's night you can just walk on in a ride. Love it. Just so you know, if you have kids or plan on riding very much, then buy the amusement park wristband because buying tickets for the rides can become expensive REAL quick.",
          "Very nice halloween decorations, but one must spend the whole day to get value for money",
          "We came shortly after 18:00 and had been told that they can't sell us normal tickets because of ongoing concert. So, be able to view it only from outside, I would say: That could be wonderful experience, but - unluckily for us - it wasn't.",
          "Great place with a variety of rides and events, hosts conserts and entertaining for all ages. It is a bit small and gets extremely packed at times. Pricing is relatively reasonable though.",
          "Kids would rate this higher, but as a parent, it is too crowded and too expensive. The entrance fee and rides are not to expensive, but be aware of the other \"attractions\" and food. Prepare to stand in lines. Nice and fun attractions.",
          "It was very cute but small. Ended up getting in the kiddie rides because all the adult rides had up to an hour wait or more. Smh and the tickets you buy aren't for the games you have to pay separately.",
          "A Must Visit when travelling in Stockholm. They have everything here. During summer they also occasionally also have concerts. There is something for all ages, and it is fun for adults as well!",
          "Such a great place for young and old. Lots to do, although compact it boasts as many rides as most regional European theme parks.",
          "There are some great concerts. The limited space means that is cramped and can feel quite unpleasant when it is busy. The service is decent but don't expect any smiles from anyone there.",
          "Fun amusement park in a great location. There are also many rides for smaller children. A roller coaster called 'Insane' is something I can describe as a vertical coaster. I never saw anything like that before. Plan at least half a day, and consider to combine with Skansen.",
          "A good little spot smack dab in the middle of the city. Rides are fun and exciting, but don't expect anything extreme. Lots fo food choices and great views of the city.",
          "Really amazing place especially during the summer time. So many fun things to do. You can spend a wonderful day over there strongly recommended",
          "Long queues, many rides were too scary for my taste. The food (pizza) was quite bad. Nevertheless, there still were some rides that were ok for me and my kid. We had a good time.\n\nI would recommend a visit before lunch.",
          "It was fine pretty fun for even those who are scared to ride, but a lot of people no skip the line pass avaliable. But fun\ud83d\ude09",
          "I hope that everything will open soon",
          "Overall good park, many options for children and adults. Only problem is that the lines are too long and at some rides you had to wait at least 1 hour.",
          "Beautiful day on the water. Highly recommend, even if you\u2019re not into rides.",
          "Lovely theme park in the wonderful Djurg\u00e5rden. Be here early to skip the lines, In afternoon wait will be long for most popular rides. Around 40 min on our last ride of the day at around 2:30 pm for the twister  Rollercoaster",
          "Fun place, haven't been for quite some years. Cool attractions, and nicely situated right on the waterfront. Ok good selection for an amusement park. Very limited indoor seating - not sure how you'd survive a rainy day here with kids \ud83d\ude42",
          "It's a great cozy amusement park with something for everyone, the halloween theme was awesome and the park in November is beautiful, though as with most things, the price was painfull, especially with less (medium scare?) rollercoasters and \u2026",
          "If you wanna see the nature then it is the perfect place in Stockholm....",
          "Great place, good concerts, but a bit to small especially if there's a concert. There are no places to sit and wait for it to start and sometimes it's so crowded that you can't even walk around for a \"femkamp\".",
          "A cool place to attend a summer concert or to enjoy the rollercoasters in the middle of Stockholm. When the weather is nice, I highly recommend walking there or back to the city center. It is just lovely",
          "Gr\u00f6na Lund was an absolute hit with all of the family. Loved the rides, especially the Jet Stream and Mouse Trap and the Fun House and the witch ride. So much going on in such a compact space, yet didn't feel overly crowded. The food stalls \u2026",
          "One big scam, don\u2019t visit this place. You pay 150,- SEK for an entrance ticket, afterwards we found out you had to buy tickets for every ride! Some rides cost 75 SEK. The problem is they didn\u2019t communicate anything about this before entering the park.",
          "A nice playground for all the ages. The lines are not too long. Only downside is the working hours.",
          "One of the best amusement parks out there!",
          "Phenomenal theme park in the middle of Stockholm!  We were incredibly surprised how charming and perfect Grona Lund was during our recent visit.  It\u2019s an incredibly compact park built right on the water with very scenic views for many of \u2026",
          "Great amusement park near the very center of Stockholm. Many rides on a small area amd they each offer something new. I would recommend!",
          "- You have to pay to enter the land and also pay for the rides. I didn\u2019t like this policy. If they want us to pay to enter them at least can we get one coupon for each person?\n+ They have good rides for adventure seekers! \n+ Coupons offers \u2026",
          "Fun and entertaining for the whole family. Compact park. Beautiful surrounding. Slightly on the expensive side but still worth it.",
          "Fun day for the Halloween season. Beautiful decorations",
          "Has an amazing time with my family and husband during our summer trip to Sweden!!!!! U should differently visit and note parking around can be a little expensive. Try using the bus instead .",
          "Nice smallish amusement park. Saw a concert there, the sound was excellent, and the show was great. Very easy to see. Would go again",
          "Wohooo! Very entertaining rides, as well as a great selection of restaurants and snacks.",
          "I did not like it and my 7 years old son didn't enjoy himself. We went there on Wednesday to celebrate birthday but it was not enjoyable experience. First, prices are not worth the experience as the lines were super long, some up to 50 min, \u2026",
          "Awesome place to hang out with friends and to watch concerts. The sound from the stage is amazing and the rides are awesome. Just wish there were more rollercoasters.",
          "Great food, laid back atmosphere.. really nice and enthusiastic staff. Definitely will eat there again when I'm in Stockholm",
          "Cuz i was high af i give it a five star",
          "It is on the seaward side of Djurg\u00e5rden Island. It is relatively small compared to other amusement parks, mainly because of its central location, which limits expansion. For small kids, there are just a few things. Every ride had a long waiting line. All rides need to be paid for separately!",
          "Was there on a saturday,it was crowded but still i could play many games, the longest line to play was 50 minutes waiting on the line for one game otherwise its mostly 15 to 30 minutes for most of them..\nEnjoyed the food and the games \ud83d\ude07",
          "Colorful and vivid amusement park.\nParadise for kids.",
          "Really fun, and if you go on some rides you get a great view of stockholm.",
          "For being an amusement park it\u2019s really small, and there isn\u2019t a lot to do there to be honest, you can easily walk through the whole place in a few hours. Beautiful location though.",
          "Trivoli amusement park. Awesome is the only word to describe it. If you are a adrenaline junkie then just get the ride band and enjoy all the rides(32\u20ac approx). You can get Max. Value return by adding other bands. Entry is separate (120sek) after 6 pm they charge 290sek for entry.",
          "Yes, of course, this is the most joyful and fun filled amusement park to enjoy a whole day.",
          "Personally hate this.. But all my friends love it and I get why they love it so much. No other experience like this in Stockholm so you better go here to see if it's something for you",

          "Twas lively with activity. Liked the fika they serve too",
          "Really convenient that the place is located in the city and that it is not too far away easy to get here also, but it was quite pricey - both food and the ticket. But nice rides!",
          "Some pretty rickety rides and somewhat under-staffed. When lining up for the rides, they let on one group at a time and fail to fill up the individual seats. Say a ride has 4 seats, but only a group of 3 is next in line, they only seat 3 \u2026",
          "Theme park with good view and good food",
          "Fun for kids. Often alot of people there. Great vegan options.",
          "Really fun, especially during the concert sessions, but when it is full of people I don\u2019t want to imagine what will happen in a case of emergency.",
          "To tell the truth, I do not quite understand why people come to this amusement park, where waiting times are 30 to 60 minutes per attraction. One pays en entrance fee just to enter the place and then another high fee for rides - the price \u2026",
          "There are many attractions, the queues are not to long and the food is not a complete ripoff (Although it could be good to bring your own, if you want anything other than slightly overpriced fast-food).\n\nThe biggest minus is that the place \u2026",

          "Probably not a fair comparison but we enjoyed Tivoli I'm Copenhagen more. Gr\u00f6ba Lund is quite dense and busy. Food selection and cafes seem good though.",
          "Great amusement park for a day of fun. Can be quite crowded at times with long queues but there is an app to show waiting times but not sure if it is accurate but i think the whole estimated queue time is a bit flawed. Prices are on the \u2026",

          "Lots of lines but great fun",
          "As it is the only amusement park in its genre in Stockholm, and one of the very few in all of Sweden, there's not much to compare to. But the park is very cramped, expensive and the lines are long. Some of the newer attractions are pretty \u2026",
          "Gr\u00f6na Lund (Green Grove) is Stockholms amusment park #1- well there is only one :D. This is a really fun place for all ages.  It's kind of cramped in to one place, but it only nakes it more cozy. Gr\u00f6nan have at least one new attraction \u2026",

          "This place gets 5 stars solely for its cheap concerts during the summer season.  You can see a ton of Wold Class bands for one cheap summer pass.  Outside of that it is a small amusement park on the water.  The roller coasters are dated and \u2026",
          "It is a thrilling experience but you will definitely be disappointed because of the long cues. You should launch \"express passes\" ( -skip the queue- tickets ) ASAP.",
          "a pretty fun place for kids, be careful because you do have to pay an admission fee and then buy tickets once you are inside, but there is a good assortment of rides both easy ones for small kids and much more scary ones for bigger kids.",

          "3-4 attractions are definitely worth a visit, but I wouldn\u2019t spend my time queuing up for the other ones. I predominately go here to see concerts. The sound is usually not great but the concert tickets are really cheap - only a couple of hundred sek. Make sure to be there in time if the artist is popular.",
          "Great place to visit. Lots of great rides.\nA definite stop when in Stockholm!",

          "Great amusement park in the centre of Stockholm and not too expensive.\n\nRides vary from \"mellow\", \"scary\" to \"accident in your drawers scary\"!!! (The Insane ride is literally insane and the Free Fall is a good prelude to the nasty Ikarus \u2026",

          "It's a small amusement park but has some nice rides, worth trying once.",
          "A lot of rides in a small area. Really nice. Liseberg is much better though",
          "A beautiful parc with a lot of different attraction and a really romantic place. The parc is easily accessible by bus or ferry and there are a lot of shop for food. Just don't go there on the weekend when it's overcrowded. Go there during \u2026",
          "This park is the biggest park in Stockholm i like it. There are a lot of games. If you don't like a game you can change it. I'ts really wonderful place just visit it",
          "Ridiculous. You have to pay to set foot on their grounds, but you can't do anything for your money. You simply pay for the right to enter! Except to see a concert that might be on. All rides need to be paid for separately. You can do games \u2026",
          "Fun park for adults and childerns. Good selection of rides but nothing special. Summer organise usually concert, which are for free! I saw Europe!"

        "wiki": "ABBA The Museum is a Swedish interactive exhibition about the pop band ABBA that opened in Stockholm, Sweden in May 2013. ABBA's collected works are showcased in a contemporary, interactive setting at Djurg\u00e5rden, Stockholm.\nABBA The Museum is, despite its name, not a museum because it has no collections, does not conduct research and is for-profit. It is not a member of either Swedish ICOM or Riksf\u00f6rbundet Sveriges museer.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPlans for a dedicated to an ABBA exhibition in Stockholm, inspired by the Beatles museum in Liverpool, England, were first announced by founders Ulf Westman and Ewa Wigenheim-Westman in 2006. The exhibition was expected to open in 2008. Organizers estimated it would draw half a million visitors annually. The exhibition was to be located in the former main customs building in Stockholm harbor. After several years of financial issues the project was abandoned in 2009, and the building was instead set to hold a new contemporary photography exhibition, called Fotografiska.New plans for a permanent ABBA exhibition were announced on 3 October 2012. The exhibition in Stockholm, called \"ABBA The Museum\", is the permanent home for the traveling ABBAWORLD exhibit that toured Europe and Australia in 2009-2011, and houses stage costumes donated by the band members. There are also several interactive audio and video stations that allow visitors to perform the band's music. The exhibition is located in a building near the Gr\u00f6na Lund theme park on the island of Djurg\u00e5rden.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nThe following exhibits include:\n\nBenny's Piano - A self-playing piano which is linked to Benny's own piano in his home, so plays when he does.\nWaterloo - A section, made out to look like Brighton in at the time of the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest has a collection of many items from that fateful event.\nThe Polar Studio - A recreation of the studio in which ABBA recorded most of their later music, you can see many items used in the studio.\nThe Folkpark - The recreation of the site ABBA first met.\nAudio Guides - An Audio Guided tour, written by Catherine Johnson, the writer of the screenplay for Mamma Mia!\nRing Ring - A special phone that only the four members of ABBA know the number to.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of music museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nABBA The Museum",

          "If you are or were an ABBA fan, you must go and see this museum with the stories behind the band members: before, during, and after their succesfull period. Lots of displays of stuff and pictures. And you actually participate in their songs...\ud83d\ude0f",

          "I expected this to be one of the best days of my life I love ABBA - always will but my friends, who are much younger loved it too, they loved the interactive singing experiences. We sang on stage with the holograms, I am no singer but I sang my heart out on Monday. I sobbed with",

          "Even if you're not a FAN-fan, ABBA's music starts everyone's toes tapping and you'll know some of the words. That Stockholm has honored this group with its own museum speaks to ABBA's history in music. I by-passed a lot sign-reading (something I don't normally do) because it",
          "This was a fantastic tour . You could even do karaoke on stage with 3d ABBA.. and u can record it as well. They have all the collections of LP and the clothes and instruments ...it was just fantastic ..we ended up spending over 2 hours here",
          "Definitely worth a visit if in Stockholm. Fun interactive things to do if you don't mind making a fool of yourself. Best tip is to take the commuter ferry from Gamla Stan. It costs 370 sek and you have terrific views all the way.",
          "Good fun location for two or three hours of pop nostalgia, learning all about the rise and phenomenal world-wide success of the glitzy, sequined Swedish hit factory that was ABBA. Loads to see and do, hundreds of exhibits including films, costumes, old photos, clips from",

          "If you like any of ABBA's music then you'll enjoy this museum. The opening video is worth the admission price alone, but the rest of the museum is also great. Very interactive, loads to see and we'd recommend the audio guide for personal snippets from band members and those",
          "I was quickly swept up into the excitement of Abba music, impossible to resist. I had expected to quickly spin through the attraction for a superficial look, but ended up spending nearly two hours there. I enjoyed it much more than the David Bowie exhibition at the V&A, it was",

          "interesting even if you\u2019re not a huge ABBA fan. Has costumes from old days & more recent from Mamma Mia the movie. Some interactive parts where you can sing & dance on stage with holographic models. Pose for lots of pics amongst models from film",
          "Had heard some mixed reviews on The ABBA Museum but we thought, why not while we were in Stockholm and I must say it was really worth it. The exhibition takes you right back to how the band started and gives a marvellous insight and makes you appreciate their music so much",

I have an abysmal voice, so I\u2019m positive that I\u2019ll never see the inside of a recording studio again.",

          "Worth a visit. Not as impressive as you would think. Lots of ABBA exhibits and costumes and stuff. The sing along with the band in holograms is fun to see. Gift shop tees and stuff way too high priced. Worth a visit for ABBA fan if in Stockholm.",
          "If you like ABBA, you'll have fun here. There is a lot of memorabilia and also many fun interactive activities in the museum. It's a kitschy place and also expensive, but we had a good time touring it.",

          "Loved this place where you can be active, try things. Everything displayed nicely. Easy to orientate. Lovely staff.",
          "We ended up singing Abba songs for the next 24h - very good interactive activities. And the museum was interesting and well maintained. Would recommend",
          "A must for any ABBA fan. Less fascinating for people who are not acquainted with their music, if such people exist.",
          "The first museum we visited upon arrival in Stockholm. Of course they milk every photo, guitar and mic that has anything to do with the famous 4, but you can do some karaoke, dancing, sound mixing, and in total spend 2 hours having a lot of fun. For some it is a walk past memory",

          "No need to buy skip the queue tickets (if they do offer it) - I have been 3 times at different times of the year and there has never been a queue. You would really enjoy if it if you are an ABBA fan. The history, their childhood, the career to being world famous, they are all",
          "Interesting museum for a change. The interactive displays are fun and keeps the visit interesting for everyone.",
          "Exhibits the whole career progression of ABBA. Love it all! When u enter, you will brought to the Mammia Mia set! And i love it! They have this small karaoke booth that you u have to sing and get points based on your chosen ABBA's song. They also have this hologram thing (i",
          "it is a real event to enter the modern history of a generation and of a phenomena, a woderful interactive presentation, nice souvenirs shop!",
          "Amazing, money well spent. Well thought out, not one bit tacky. Just fantastic! Some of the recorded stuff on our tickets didn\u2019t come through but have emailed to get access via our ticket number",
          "Cozy and colorful museum taking us to ABBA's golden times. You can even find some surprising activities in here. Located not in a very center of the city, but easy to find. Great staff in the museum shop!",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Abba museum and they also had a Mamma Mai the movie exhibition there as well which was superb. The museum is very interactive and packed with memorabilia. We had great fun and would definitely recommend a visit.",
          "I was so impressed with the artivacts and the activites available. Everything tied together to tell the story of one of the most successful and well known groups of the '70s. Their music continues to be popular today, and this museum is perfect for all ages.",
          "This museum includes many interactive displays narrated by original band members. Very interesting glimpse into the rise of this awesome band and the things they had to deal with. Also some displays showing what they've all done since ABBA. Plan on 2 or more hours!",
          "Great museum. Packed with all things connected to ABBA. Museum is educational and very interactive. It's different and gives opportunity to ba a part of band history.",
          "Overall it did not meet our expectations. We had looked forward to this, and thought it would be the highlight of our trip. If you have extra time in Stockholm and like ABBA, give it a visit. Otherwise, you can spend the 250 SEK on something else. (290 SEK with VR experience).",
          "Not the cheapest attraction in Stockholm, but an absolute must for anyone who loves ABBA. You get everything. Original items, interviews, a chance to test your singing abilities and also your stage fright whilst performing with holograms of the ABBA singers. The only downside is",
          "This place is awesome! It\u2019s a very interactive museum and I think a great tribute to ABBA! You can scan your ticket and record you singing karaoke with ABBA, dance along with ABBA holograms and many more. Makes you really appreciate the talents of this Swedish band. Definitely",
          "A beautiful museum full of activities and history. A must go when you in one of Europe\u2019s most surprising capitals of culture and modern well being.",
          "Visiting ABBA The Museum was one of the best things to do whilst visiting Stockholm! At the beginning of the tour, there is a small biography about each ABBA member and how they met each other, which I absolutely love. There was so much information to read about on ABBA, sharing",
          "Not being a great ABBA fan but I was blown away by this museum to them. A not to be missed attraction in this beautiful city.",
          "For those of you who are ABBA fans, YOU MUST GO TO THIS MUSEUM! They not only had a part specifically for the members and their backgrounds, but also real props and costumes from the musical Mamma Mia! And the 2 films! It is such an amazing experience to see actual movie/play",
          "My first time in Stockholm was reserved for a visit to this museum. Such a rollercoaster of emotions if you are at all an ABBA fan. A historical approach and lots of fun activities \u2014- you can perform a song or record it in a studio. Such a great concept and lots of interesting",
          "It was really interesting and it has a lot of activities where you can participate, it's great how a museum can engage people and make them feel like an abba member. It was just amazing!",
          "This place is absolutely great to see. It is nostalgic memory of one of the best bands. This museum provides the tour of Abba's life and lives of Abba's members. There is a show of costumes from concerts and a set of LPs. This exhibition is very interactive, it is possible to",
          "This was a main attraction in Stockholm. There is a small cafe associated and a gift shop. Do the tour first. There is an elevator that takes you down the main floor of exhibitions. Easy walking. Be careful of backing into people as you are listening to the stories and",
          "This is a fantastic Museum. It is based in the basement of a hotel. On the outside it dosent look like much but when you go in its a different story. Lots of their music,outfits award, all their records. A lot of interactive things to do such as been on stage with Abba",
          "The ABBA museum is under a hotel, and its not widely publicised around the rest of Stockholm, you have to know where it is. Almost felt like Stockholm was a bit ashamed of ABBA from the lack of mention of it around the city. Its a cosy place, in a great entertainment area,",
          "I had an absolutely fabulous time at the ABBA Museum on my solo journey in Stockholm!! I was lucky enough to get to go during the Mama Mia exhibit too! Lots of fun, lots of music, lots of information, and quite interactive too! The shop and caf\u00e9 are nice too! As posted there,",
          "You don\u2019t have to be a big fan to enjoy ABBA music. In English it works out \u00a320 for a ticket and another \u00a32 for the audio tour. Sweden being expensive \u00a322 ain\u2019t going to break the bank. They have a part of the museum dedicated to the mama Mia movie with the costumes and other",
          "You don't need to be a superfan to really enjoy a visit here. A wealth of really good and personal to the band members material here well laid out with good background notes etc. Terrific interactive opportunities too. 11 out of 10 in anyone's money.",
          "Obviously, if you're a fan of ABBA, you'll have a great time. The music, the stories, the memorabilia ... everything. But it also is fascinating for anyone interested in the musical industry, to know what it is like to work your way up. But besides that, the interactive parts",
          "The museum is very interactive en even my husband, who is a metalfan, found it very entertaining. The restaurant is also very good.",
          "I'll put my hand up to being a bit of an ABBA fan, but there's plenty for everybody. Sure, it's a bit kitsch, but that's part of the fun. I really enjoyed seeing the analogue mixing desk and while I didn't really learn anything new about the band, that's probably because I knew",
          "We loved the Abba museum. It has brilliant items in it, including lots from the film Mamma Mia, as well as loads of Abba memorabilia. It has amazing interactive stuff including a bit where you join Abba on stage while they're in hologram, and sing a song with them. There's",
          "I didn't think I was huge on Abba, but I got all nostalgic! After all their heyday was over 40 years ago! They really were a phenomenon, and did a massive service to Sweden as well as popular culture. Famously they were a bigger export than Volvo. All the glitter and the hit",
          "We arrived at the abba museum. Went in paid the entrance fee not to be told we should of had the ear phones to listen to things. First as we went in was all about mama Mia Off inside we discovered many different things from recordings to us singing in a sound booth. Wish there",
          "Having been an ABBA fan over the years I really enjoyed visiting here. Well out together and bought back lots of memories. A fun place to stop by and learn more about the group. The staff here were all really friendly and helpful and spoke excellent english.",
          "A must see for any ABBA fan; absolutely brilliant. The museum is full of interactive parts - including the VR helicopter ride you take over the Stockholm coastline and the chance to dance and sing with holograms. The temporary area dedicated to the two Mamma Mia films was a",
          "I was very emotional coming here, as ABBA were my earliest memories at ages 2. To visit was a dream come true. It was amazing, everything for the ABBA fan and more. Singing, dancing, recording too of your favourite songs. Original exhibits and you almost felt their story. What",
          "A must see when in Stockholm. You can easily spend 3 hours going back memory lane, listening to great music and watching all the great ABBA moments. Super excited",
          "Definitely take a good few hours out to visit the ABBA Museum. Buy your tickets in advance to save any ques. Enjoy a sing a long on stage or watch ABBA the movie in their cinema. Great day out. We went with our daughter for her 30th Birthday. It will be a day she will never",
          "When you are in stokholm why wouldnt you visit this museum!!Very informative and great fun while you visit this place, if you are in city sightseeing tour bus then this place is within the route.This place look small from outside but i was surprise after visiting this place.",
          "Can't help but be a secret fan of ABBA. Wasn't top of my list but the museum is well done and the whole group enjoyed it in particular the ladies. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Fine place to visit But i Think there was to much from Mama Mia - great movie But the story of ABBA is told And its A fantastic story Great pictures along",
          "during my teenager times I started listening to music with ABBA and with BEATLES. therefore, as soon as I left my luggages I rushed to this museum. right in the beginning, there is a small Eurovision section where you can watch clips and see or\u0131ginal clothes of Celine Dion,",
          "So worth the visit when ABBA were your favourite band during teenage years. Lovely to see all the memorabilia. Was really happy to find the bench from the cover of greatest hits album 5 minutes away.",
          "The minute I pulled up to this place- a surge of real excitement surrounded me. Iconic music blaring- I had arrived. I am a bit of an ABBA fan & the museum didn\u2019t disappoint me - loved every bit of it and the interactive experience was great fun.",
          "Love Abba but the museum was very busy and was shuffled from one small room to another. Worth a visit but wasn't wowed. The costumes were good and the album memrobelia.",
          "When in Stockholm why wouldn't you visit this museum. Whether you are an ABBA fan or not this is just an hour or two of great fun. Very informative and well worth the entrance fee. Very well laid out. Directly on the bus tour so give it a whirl",
          "Honestly I\u2019m not a true ABBA fan coz I only know some of their songs, but this museum is good! We had an amazing time! The place is big n we didn\u2019t expect to see lots... We could do karaoke some of their songs, n even do some kind of stage singing experience as one of the ABBA",
          "Very disappointing. It was \"tacky\". Not worth the entrance price. I would be surprised if ABBA really do endorse this museum.",
          "In terms of a collection of ABBA artifacts and detailed history on the performers, this place is the King of everything ABBA. Rabid fans, or those interested in the going-ons behind the scenes in the music industry, then this is an amazing place. If you simply enjoy their",
          "Great meseum, had the chance to take a seat in the chopper of the Arrival album. Nice with all the interactive stuff with teh sigalong as a highlight",
          "If you liked ABBA it is a very good museum. gives the life of each of them from the beginning all the way through their lives. Shows various outfits and video clips. takes about 2 hours to get through it.",
          "The museum covers the history of ABBA and then the post ABBA period (Chess, Mamma Mia, etc). Excellent commentary by all of the four members. Good to see that there is a lot on the support musicians, management, equipment, designers etc. The phone costsan additional SEK 20 to",
          "Don't miss this place if you're an ABBA fan. CDs, instruments, and other memorabilia belong to ABBA can be seen here. As a fan of ABBA, this place is definitely a heaven for me. But since it's one of the main attractions in the city, buy ticket in advance would be recommended.",
          "I'm not particularly an ABBA fan, but this museum engaged us for about 3 hours. It is informative and interactive and naturally one is encouraged to sing and dance .... It's okay, making an idiot of oneself is not compulsory. To be up close to the myriad of brightly colored",
          "After beeing a hardcore fan since 1972 I have waited to visit the museum until the first waves of fans had done their visits, and went off course outside the main season- I have seen pictures and read reviews from summer visits. A rainy November Saturday was better. We stayed",
          "Filled with ABBA memorabilia and displays about everything they have done. Loads of interactive content - you can even sing and dance on stage with a holographic ABBA and then view it on-line, just remember to scan your ticket at every interactive site. It's best to pre-pay for",
          "Loved all the interactive sections. The history was fascinating. All the costumes gave a true feeling of the ABBA times.Also enjoyed seeing what they are all doing now.",
          "Compare to others museum this one is not chip one, but it is is really one of it's type. Surprisingly large collection of ABBA artifacts from newspapers to the costumes, prizes and interactive attractions. If you like ABBA you must to visit this place.",
          "My parter (not an ABBA fan) and me (an ABBA fan) really enjoyed the museum. It is very interactive, and you can learn about the group\u2019s history from start to end. Their history is presented in a nice way, all four members equally displayed, as well as their managers and video",
          "Great tour! Lots of info, photos, music and fun! Highly recommendable, I\u2019d say a must-see when in Stockholm!",
          "Spent a good few hours here, we did a double ticket with the Mamma Mia party. Good value to do both. Lots to look at in the museum and lots of interactive things to do, song booths, being on (virtual) stage and best of all loysbif ABBA music. It\u2019s well organised and a highlight",
          "As a massive ABBA fan from Brighton (I was there in 1974!) I saved this trip until our last day in the city. I have never been so disappointed in any museum in my life! The main exhibit (the 5th member) was out of action, the exhibits uninspiring, and the cost was stupidly",
          "Went here as part of a birthday celebration. Friendly welcome from the multilingual staff an the exhibition is a mixture of state of the art technology and traditional collections of memorabilia. Do make sure you get the audio guide...ABBA themselves direct you around the museum",
          "At first I wasn't sure about going to the Abba museum but all the reviews I read said it was great and truly it was. It makes you appreciate even more how clever Abba were and what perfect pop songs they wrote. It's wonderful to see the process of writing and recording and all",
          "Went on a friend's recommendation and, apart from the expensive admission cost (card payment only) we enjoyed the museum which had lots of memorabilia, clothes, gold discs, film footage, sets, etc. covering the group's career.",
          "A million times better than I expected. I was entertained with facts and dates for at least an hour and a half.",
          "This museum is brilliant. Interactive opportunities for everyone, lots to see and do and scenes from Mamma Mia will get you dancing in the aisles. I struggled to leave because the choice of music in the bar is soooooo good, I just wanted to sit and listen all day (and probably",
          "We loved the museum and had a lot of fun - especially the karaoke, singing in the studio and on stage. It can be a bit a weird because you do it in front of complete strangers. \ud83e\udd28\ud83d\ude01 However, I didn't like the feeling that they would like to squeeze as much money out of tourists",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the ABBA museum very authentic original exhibits very enjoyable to relive the great ABBA gourmet thoroughly recommend a visit if you are in Stockholm .",
          "There is so much to see and do in this museum that you could easily spend 3 hours or more wandering around. Really well done. The initial exhibit is for the Mama Mia exhibit and you think - is this it? But go down a floor and the main exhibit just goes on and on and on.",
          "It was enjoyable, colorful and well designed Abba Museum, not so attractive but can be seen, I liked it.",
          "Everything you could expect. A chance to read the history, read their stories, participate in a good singalong and see lots of costumes and memorabilia. Also nice to read the recent history, see what they\u2019re up to and see the Mama Mia filmmakers exhibition. As an ABBA fan I",
          "It was a fun experiance, beeing abel to see the history of ABBA and some interactive items to test your knowlege af ABBA. a nice museum",

          "You somehow get nostalgic even if you (like me) weren't even born then. Fun interactive booths, amazing audio tour a tap away (literally), and beautifully preserved pop history and memorabilia, it's definitely not one to miss. The highlight of the visit was the online access of",
          "I am a huge ABBA fan and spent many hours at this museum but could easily have spent many more. Great value museum and if you\u2019re an ABBA fan you will have an amazing experience.",
          "Lots of fun reliving the ABBA story. Interactive museum with audio guidance bij ABBA members themselves. Great museum if you love ABBA or want to know more about them! Lots of original items, albums, gold records, costumes and instruments etc.",
          "Nice museum, even for someone who did not grow up listening to ABBA. I probably spent a couple hours here. The cost was around $25, which is a bit expensive. It probably helps to see the movie or musical Mama Mia first, which I did not do, since a lot of space is devoted to it.",
          "This is an amazing place if you are a fan. Of course, it's also a good space for music lovers in general. The guitars exhibition on the entrances is really cool and all the sections into the museum are a tribute to the whole ABBA members history.",
          "What better way to spend your last couple of hours in Stockholm that a visit to the museum of pop icons ABBA? A fun museum, full of memorabilia and interactive displays. Can be seen in less than 2 hours. Buy tickets in advance and avoid the lines at the door...",
          "Great idea from Benny. Fabulous museum, full of clothes, pictures and Abba momento's 4hours well spent reliving my musical youth.",
          "It was a very fun, entertaining and overall great museum experience! Even if you aren\u2019t a fan of ABBA, you can still have a great time there. They have a discount for students, so don\u2019t forget your student ID ;)",
          "I highly recommend a trip to see this if you are in Stockholm, we didn\u2019t expect to spend longer than an hour but there was loads to do and with the Mama Mia things on display it was good for young and oldies like me! I\u2019m a typical Brit but chucked my stiff exterior away and had",
          "Mix of texts, video clips and some interactive activities. For a such a famous and amazing group could have been done much better. Real ABBA fans know these facts anyway. Found a mispelling in the text and overall a disappointment. And they do not accept money - only cards! Is",
          "We hadn\u2019t intended on visiting the museum but saw it in passing and decided we would. Glad we did as it was very enjoyable. Lots of interactive activities, lots of information and great layout. Not huge ABBA fans in particular but fans of Mamma Mia but nonetheless a good time",
          "We enjoyed the ABBA museum; there was lots of interesting information. We didn\u2019t like the fact they allowed big tour groups in - their guides were talking loudly, which meant we couldn\u2019t hear the commentary via our audio guides. Didn\u2019t feel like doing the interactive activities",
          "If you are truely an Abba fan then this museum will probably be for you. Especially if you want to dance and sing in front of a load of strangers. The museum tells you the stories about the 4 ABBA members, prior to, during and after the ABBA period. It has loads of pictures and",
          "What a great tour... highly recommended. Buy the tickets and get there early! We didn't have to wait as we had the tickets. Opened 1000 by 1100 others arriving and getting crowded. Was brilliant day",
          "We had the best time here. So much to see and do, totally interactive. You can get up on a stage and perform with the holographic ABBAs. Leave at least 2 hours.",
          "Just fantastic - make sure you do all the interactive components and sing a lot. ABBA\u2019s history and sense of fun ar the perfectly captured - and the clothes are mating irl.",
          "I LOVED the ABBA museum - I've been a fan since I was 16. I spent at least 3 hours in the museum, tons of interactive activities as well as an exhibit dedicated to the Mama Mia movies. Have fun!",
          "Fascinating insight into their career. Multi media well done. Treasure for ABBA fans. They have a stage set up where you can sing with them and see yourself on a monitor. Check your moves.",
          "Let me start with the disclaimer that I adore ABBA. I would recommend purchasing the audio support for the tour. It is recorded by the members and provides a personal perspective. Once you have paid, you go down one floor. Here you will find Mama Mia memorabilia; the",
          "We had lots of fun in this museeum. The exhibition has a lot of original costumes and interactive stations. Our personal highlight was the holographic Karaoke :-)",
          "The museum itself is interactive and somewhat fun. Especially if you like ABBA music. But they made me give up my stroller! Why? No reason. I asked. And I had to make do without it. It is hard if you have a one year old who needs to sleep. They offered a baby carrier but my son",
          "Very much enjoyed the ABBA Museum. If you are someone who remembers listening to ABBA and enjoyed their music you will love this place",
          "We are not big ABBA fans however decided a trip to the ABBA museum was a must whilst visiting stockholm. Excellent lots of information and i would imagine for a fan a very exciting worthwhile visit. Good value",
          "So many precious memorable historical items on display I got to know each member more after visiting the museum Highly recommended!!",
          "Although I like ABBA I\u2019m not a fan. The day I visited in October the place was heaving with people and quite noisy. Some of the things there were interesting but overall it was average. However, if your an ABBA fan you probably should go.",
          "Combination of interesting history with very modern hologram and other interactive exhibits. But I appreciated the entry fee included all the extras. So many more museums charge for each interactive exhibit. Fun and you can\u2019t help but leave with the songs in your head",
          "Something you must do while here. Unique, informative, fun. Get the audio guide, it gives you info from each of the band members. There are so many things to do in this museum, I almost can\u2019t list them all.",
          "If you are an Abba fan, this place has to be the mecca! It's not cheap but the displays and interactive activities are simply outstanding. The cabinet displays of the costumes were as you would expect amazing. There is a hotel and restaurant and if we had had more time we",
          "Must do! Great time and very interesting and entertaining! Went with three young adult children. Definitely do the photo shoot and participate in the activities. I got the audio headset and thought it was worth it! I love hearing the stories and history.",
          "To expensive! You have to be a hard core super fan for this.. Many other places you can visit in Stockholm for less.. Just go to the restaurant, enjoy the ambiance and food and drinks instead.",
          "For Abba fans this place would be great. For those of us who like them, but not love them, it was just ok. Has some interactive things to do - karaoke, trivia, which was fun. Was about $50 to enter for two people.",
          "Touring this museum opened the door to the ABBA experience of who they are today besides their journey as astounding singers. The Mama Mia movies and theater productions plus the beautiful clothing was a sight to see. I encourage anyone who treasures their music to visit this",
          "We loved the audio guide spoken by the actual ABBA members. A wonderful journey through the band\u2019s history.",
          "The attraction is amazing , every gold and platinum record they made and recording studio is available to look at. Their entire costume collection is on display along with too many artifacts to mention. I think the most incredible attraction was to watch children singing on",
          "Very fun day in the ABBA museum! Be prepared to sing, dance, and laugh a lot! It can be quite busy, especially at the start of the museum, but it got better as we walked through. I also recommend to book online!",
          "While we were on line waiting to get it, the woman handling online reservations actually came out and told everyone to order tickets online to get through faster. No one budged. Out came my phone and a few clicks later, we had our mobile tickets and were inside. I wish I had",
          "A brilliant museum especially for ABBA fans, well laid out with really fun interactive areas. It was great to see all the costumes & learn more about the making of the songs following the band from the early days until now.",
          "We all really enjoyed the museum, so much fun and loved knowing more about them all. We went to The Party! afterwards (absolutely brilliant! that gets 5 stars out of 5) We will definitely go again when it's in London. For the museum, we think a couple of things would make it",
          "Wonderful Museum with lots of interactive fun things to do. Learned more about the group. Museum was fantastic. They say you walk in and dance out and that is true. Good bar and restaurant to finish off the day.",
          "It\u2019s Stockholm so I guess this had to be on the list of things to do ! This is a really fun attraction, naturally loads of ABBA memorabilia on display but also lots of interactive stuff to participate in. The hologram ABBA where visitors can get up on stage with what looks like",
          "This is a totally biased review since I've loved ABBA since they first appeared in the 70s........so this was like visiting ABBA Mecca for me. The costumes, history of the band and its' members, interactive quizzes, singing, games, and dance were a blast for me. My husband",
          "Museum coupled with a gift shop,restaurant ,and hotel. A lot of trinkets and even old 33 1/3 albums. 250sek admission. So if you really want to go.",
          "I was dubious about paying so much to see this museum, and my fears were not dispelled when the first part was about the Mama Mia movie, which was only mildly interesting at best. However, the rest of the tour around the museum was well worth seeing and gave a good history of",
          "Yes, this is a fabulous museum. Many great photo opportunities, and inter-active components as well. The 'cardboard cutout' display outside the front entrance, for you to poke your heads through and become ABBA members, was a great way to start the museum experience. If you",
          "If you were a HUGE ABBA fan, you might enjoy it, otherwise, it is a silly event and not worth the money or time.",
          "We love abba and we strongly dislike participating in karaoke. Therefore the visit did not meet our expectations. The atmosphere was very noisy, with a lot of karaoke singing people.",
          "We are old folks and were kind of past the whole music thing during ABBA's heyday, so we were not expecting much. But this is a very entertaining museum and you could not help but become fans after seeing the displays. It is kind of a sad ending, but I think pretty normal for",
          "This was a fun museum. Pay the extra money for the listening device so you can hear the band members themselves explain the various exhibits. It is a bit tight in the museum, so be prepared for pottentially crowded rooms.",
          "If you like ABBA and/or Mamma Mia, you have to come here. I LOVED the exhibit about Mamma Mia 2, with costumes and memorabilia from the movies, and learned a lot about how they were made! The general exhibit about how ABBA was formed is also very detailed and interesting. There",
          "If you enjoyed the music of ABBA then this is a must see on your trip to Stockholm. I had purchased a ticket in advance so then you can proceed directly to ticket pick up and I had purchased the audio guide as well. I recommend the audio guide. Your ticket allows you to do a",
          "Loved it. The interactive features were great like the quizzes and painting the Donna's house. The karaoke sections were great and loved the 5th member part. Parts of the visit were saved onto the website with access for 30 days.",
          "Without the ABBA museum. I danced the whole time. It interactive and the costumes are really something to see. We had tickets included in the hop off/on bus. That was a wonderful surprise because its approx $25 USD for entrance. There is even a special ABBA dala horse !!",
          "As an ABBA fan, this was on my list to see while my husband and son did something else. It was fun and informative; would have been even more fun with some girlfriends. There are several interactive opportunities - you can record a ABBA song and/or become the fifth member of",

          "First up, I need to admit that I am not a massive ABBA fan. I remember hearing many of their tunes throughout my childhood and as an Aussie, one of our iconic movies was set based on the main character\u2019s love of ABBA. So I know a little, but not a lot. However, going to Sweden",
          "A great museum experience, but be sure to book in advance. Those who do get in ahead of those showing up on the day. Especially if the weather is inclement, you want to get in as soon as possible. One of the best aspects of the museum is the many opportunities to become a part",
          "Even without being a huge Abba fan, I really enjoyed the museum. There was so much to see AND to do including singing karaoke and \"dancing and singing\" with the avatars of the group. Lots of interactive things to do. I guess we timed it right by going in the mid afternoon as",
          "My student daughter got me 2 tickets for the Museum as present for my birthday to the for a student very heavy price tag of 50 Euros. Due to really bad weather we could not travel to Stockholm on the day the ticket was bought for. We have therefore contacted the Museum for the",
          "If you are ABBA fan at all. Take audio service, expands the experience. Funny is that it is additional service in a first place.",

          "If you come ready to play you will have the most fun ! There is a concert stage to perform on, a place to sing , and a place to conduct. Close up of all costumes and memorabilia. I learned way more about the individual artists, too. But mostly this is a fun tribute to a great",
          "The best way to get to ABBA Museum is to get there using hop on hop off ferry. I tried to walk from central Stockholm to ABBA Musrum. It took me 1 hr and 30 minutes and I still could not get there because it is on a separate island. The entrance fee is not cheap 250 Swedish",
          "A nice interactive museum. It does tell the story of Abba, but I think you have to be a hardcore fan to enjoy it. I don't know if it's a must.",
          "I was so excited to see the Museum because I really like ABBA, but it wasn't quite as thrilling as I had hoped. It's about $25 to enter, they don't take cash so you need to use a credit card. The entry hall is where they have all the biography info for each of the group. The",
          "This is a great fun place to visit. Some attractions are interactive and kept online for viewing. The amount of details is a bit much but still I would do it again!",
          "What a great museum to honour the lives and music of the band that defined an era. Film, memorabilia, photos, interactive exhibits and stands with very affordable audio guide. 2 hours spent here but could have stayed longer no problem.",
          "Spent 3 hrs of singing dancing and learning so much we didn\u2019t know about Abba! Price of ticket was great value and we also recommend the audio guide. FANTASTICO loved it and too come home and relive it with the videos and pics you download by using your ticket number, cannot",
          "Some poor reviews almost put us off this, especially the ones suggesting it was all a bit tacky. Not so! I'm glad we took the risk. This gets the adrenalin going right away, with a surround sound film montage on the way in. But that just sets the scene. The exhibition is",
          "The museum is a living show of all the hits and music that ABBA sang. The was more than I remembered so it was great to relive the past. It\u2019s going by too fast. All of the wardrobe s were on display along with more videos than you can imagine. I think the most entertaining site",
          "You don't have to be an ABBA fan to have a great time here. Great museum, great music, great activities like 3D karoke with ABBA. (That sound weird but it is really cool.) One of those places packed with memorbilia, activities, displays, and movie theaters. Go early, before",
          "You could easily miss this museum the outside of the building is not what I was expecting. There are few signs which helped us find it and of course it is a stop on the Hop-on-off bus. There is an interactive section which is really Karaoke for those who what to preform infant",
          "I like ABBA music, and really enjoyed singing in the Karaoke and the stage, but the rest of the museum tell us the history and biography of the band\u00b4s members. Finally, is a bit boring, and expensive, in my opini\u00f3n.",
          "Let me start by saying that I'm not a particular fan of ABBA (that would be my wife) although I do recognise the quality of their musicianship. Having said that, I found the ABBA museum to be interesting purely from the point of view of seeing how a band becomes famous, from",
          "So i am not a big fan of music myself. And i didn't even know who ABBA where before i went to Stockholm. The place is great and they have games inside the museum where one can sing with them and it is actually great to just enjoy it. nobody knows you anyways.. hah! Whoever knows",
          "Have to admit this wasn\u2019t high on my list but my partner made it clear there wasn\u2019t an option to miss it. In the end I quite enjoyed the visit. Whilst many of the exhibits left me underwhelmed there was a lot I didn\u2019t know about ABBA that was well presented and made me",
          "On a recent cruise around the Baltic we ported in Stockholm, there was only one attraction for Joanne ABBA. first a couple of small negatives, they recommended 2 hours (personally it wasn't long enough), the rooms were not overly large and it felt a little claustrophobic (but",
          "A friend wanted to use her last morning in Stockholm at the ABBA museum. I wasn\u2019t sure but wow was I wrong. It was great. The interactive displays had me singing along. Making videos and really getting into it. If you know the songs. Take a visit. It is great.",
          "Great interactive museum. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. Easy to get to on scooter or tram from centre.",

          "A must must not only for ABBA fans. Forget about the very unfriendly service at the entrance. The moment you step in, your moods will change for the better. Very informative and plenty of still unknown facts and interviews. Don't be afraid to make a fool of yourself and just",

          "This museum provides a detailed breakdown of the complete history of ABBA in a fun, engaging and informative way. I would say it's relatively expensive (double any other Museum in the area) and if timed poorly, can get very busy/cramped, forcing you to move with the flow of",
          "If you are an ABBA fan and are visiting Stockholm, you probably should not miss visiting the only ABBA Museum in existence. The entry fee is about $26 U.S. and the audio tour is about another $2 U.S. The Stockholm Pass does NOT include entry to this museum. The museum is located",
          "This was a fun place to visit while we were in Stockholm. Must admit, we were not huge fans of ABBA but the were some interesting costume displays, interactive exhibits, and videos. The museum is mostly underground and we found it claustrophobic after awhile so did not stay too",

          "ABBA museum is one of the coolest places I have ever been to! The museum is very interesting and fun! There are a lot of things you can do inside; be on stage with ABBA, karaoke, photo booth, quizzes about ABBA and much more! Definitely worth the visit if you\u2019re an ABBA fan ;)",
          "Must admit, I know the songs, but I'm not a raging ABBA fan. This place was fun to walk through. Would I go again? No. My husband was bored and just walked behind me and couldn't wait to leave. We were told that this museum gets very busy and we needed to buy the skip the line",
          "My wife was sooooo happy with this museum!!!!! She sang to 2 of their songs and sang and danced with the holograms. I like ABBA myself and both movies. They have done a spectacular job telling the story of ABBA!!!! It's a must see.",
          "I am a fan of Abba, but evem if you're not, you will most certainly enjoy the visit to this museum. It is fun all around, it has tons of interactive games, and the music playing everywhere. From the recording studio to the clothes worn by the actors in \"Mama Mia!\", from the gold",
          "It's fun if you are a fan, and if you're not you deserve to have to be subjected to it! Recently enhanced with a lot of tacky props from the two films - mainly outrageous costumes. Nostalgia seeing a video of the late Katie Boyle on the screen from Brighton, whwre ABBA won the",
          "Never a doubt my daughter and I were going to this when in Sweden. Great fun for anyone who loves Abba ( the boys chose to visit the Viking museum instead). Great place to pick up gift for fellow fans at home at a less than outrageous cost. Join the mailing list to receive",

          "This museum was not included in the Stockholm pass, but as a fan I still enjoyed it. Everything is interactive, inside. There are karaoke, shooting sessions and an on-stage singing session, which are very funny to try. You stroll along the different memorabilia of the band,",

          "My wife and I spent a pleasant afternoon at this museum, which is easily accessible for the Red Hop-On, Hop-Off boat. The museum contains a collection of ABBA memorabilia - from costumes, to their gold and platinum records and other awards. There are many videos and interactive",
          "I know what you are thinking... why? But honestly, this was one of the best ways I have spend $17 and 2 hrs. Completely an interactive experience (including hologram singing music video, kareoke, trivia questions) and you will be surrounded by other die-hard fans! All that was",
          "What's not to love? An immersive experience into all things ABBA. Not only is the museum interesting in telling the story of the band from start to present day, they have added interactive experiences such as singing/auditioning to be the 5th member, a stage where you sing",
          "The ticket price was high but reliving the memories of so many swaggering hit songs was truly an experience. While the paraphernalia was interesting, the real hit was the songs aired across the museum. The flow of the exhibits could have been better laid out though.",
          "Took the trip to Stockholm specifically to visit the ABBA museum and so pleased we did! A fabulous museum with so much to see. Particularly liked seeing the outfits worn when ABBA won Eurovision! Spent so much time at the museum and also in the shop which is stocked with so many",
          "A bit cheesy in terms of activities, but that's literally all of what ABBA is about. I'm a huge fan and it was an unforgettable experience... interactive as heck!",
          "This museum is a must if you have heard of ABBA (like my husband) or you grew up with ABBA (like me). This is a very informative, interactive museum regarding all things ABBA, including their costumes, their makeup, their record albums etc etc. I thoroughly enjoyed it, a lot of",
          "We visited Stockholm this past June and, although we were not all ABBA fans, we all enjoyed our walk through the museum. It shows the history of the group and also each one's personal lives. The music plays throughout and you can view many of their costumes and other items. It's",
          "WOW! What an amazing interactive museum We loved every minute of our visit & would go back It was not on our agenda so we did not pre book tickets to save on the entrance fee, which is expensive but worth every penny! Be warned that it is credit / debit cards only no cash!",
          "A must for any ABBA fan and fun even if you aren't. So many exhibits and interactive things to do. You can make a video with the holograms of ABBA, record a song and even have pictures of you dressed in their stage outfits.I would recommend spending about 2-3 hours there to get",

          "Well worth a visit to the abba museum during our trip to Stockholm, located just on the outskirts of the city but easily accessible by tram or bus. Lots of facts, videos, costumes and plenty of interactive displays to keep your informed and busy",
          "Excellant museum that will satisfy any Abba fan. Very well laid out, plenty of interactive stuff to have a go at with or without the kids! Excellant exhibition of some of the stage costumes. A must see if your in Stockholm. Easy to get to as on hop on off bus route.",
          "You're in Stockholm, honestly, why wouldn't you go?! Nothing to add to the other reviews EXCEPT why not take the free water ferry to get there - makes it all more of an event plus helps offset the cost of entry! (SEK270 including audio guide)",
          "We took a Stromma boat over to the Vasa Museum and then walked a short way to the ABBA Museum. This museum is quite close to Stockholm\u2019s famous amusement park, Grona Lund. Unfortunately, the Abba museum does not accept the Stockholm card. It is bit pricy to enter. If you go",
          "Great time just as expected , if you are a fan of ABBA and the music you will love this, it's a must see\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude03",
          "Found it light, entertaining and surprisingly emotional. What a life they had and how talented the 4 of them were. Interesting to see how ABBA evolved and what the members have achieved since",
          "This is a 'must visit' venue for every Abba fan visiting Stockholm. It has it all. Will you get emotional when watching the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest when Abba famously won with Waterloo? Plenty to see and do including getting your personal copy of your Abba karaoke attempt.",
          "Disappointed that audio guides were unavailable, having been reserved apparently for cruise groups expected. But was still interesting to someone who enjoyed their music but not truly engaged fans. Could have stayed and seen/listened to even more performances than the few",
          "Wasn't sure about what to expect, but this is a surprisingly good and inclusive look at a band that had a profound effect on the music industry and the history of their country. Well worth the visit if not for the music, then the historical information.",
          "This small museum goes into great detail about the history and lives of ABBA. All ABBA fans should be sure to visit. The first floor has exhibits about the Mama Mia movies. Go downstairs for the ABBA stuff. There are sections about how each member met the others and what",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to the Abba museum. It's small but very interesting with lots of information and exhibits. Highlight is being able to dance on stage with hologram images of Abba. There's also a few opportunities to practice your singing etc.",
          "A very interactive and informative museum! It wasn't too busy considering we went in August. Would recommend!",
          "Great fun, very interactive - I enjoyed the karaoke and the hologram experience- lots of interesting memorabilia - highly recommend this place!!",
          "Visited on a Saturday so assumed it would be busy, but it was very very busy. Being pushed around by other visitors (not the places fault if people are rude but too many people in the small spaces) some of the interactive games didn't work. It was great to learn even more about",
          "After seeing many churches and historical museums for the past few weeks , this was a welcomed very fun day. A must do for any fan or even if you just like their music. The museum is very well curated and has interactive things to do. Much larger than it looks from the",
          "I was very surprised as to how. I have I enjoyed walking through the museum. I even went on stage an sang with the Hologram ABBA. It was all educational and entertaining. Learning about each member was valued to understand them better. The music was with you walking from the",

          "Some interesting memorabilia, but as others have said, it really feels like it was done on the cheap. The hologram singing opportunity is fun to watch though... I would not wait in a long line to see this.",
          "Absolutely loved it. What a collection of all things interesting about this wonderful group. Makes you love them all the more.",
          "I\u2019ve wanted to visit the Abba museum for a good few years and it didn\u2019t disappoint! Although the entry fee was more then the other museums in Stockholm I felt the price was justified. The only down side was the museum is cashless which we were not used to! I\u2019d recommend booking",
          "I had been dragged to all the ship museums so this was my choice but we both enjoyed it. Quite expensive to get in but it is very well done, fun and interesting.",
          "If you are a fan of ABBA you just have to visit the museum. You\u2019ll come out singing. I loved it. Every single part of it.",
          "We visited the ABBA Museum and were pleasantly surprised with the breadth and depth of the collection. It covers every aspect of the band\u2019s rise to fame from their early beginnings to their solo careers post their halcyon years. Costumes, memorabilia, photos, gold records and",
          "I went to this museum as someone interested in pop music history, and I can definitely say I know a lot about ABBA now. I preferred the standard history and memorabilia parts to the interactive singing/dancing parts. I think the audio guide is optional, because it tended to",
          "You don't have to be a huge fan of ABBA to enjoy this museum. It's full of not only history of the band, and memorabilia, but also interactive spots where you can dance with the band or record your own rendition of Mamma Mia (and then listen to it too...!) I particularly liked",
          "We had 2 hours here as part of a trip. It flew by and we only saw 60% of the museum. A fantastic tribute to one of he iconic bands of the 70s. Do much to see with lots of interactive things too. Lots about their upbringing and how they formed, hot married, worked etc. Highly",
          "Ok - so I\u2019m not a huge ABBA fan but being in Sweden and all that... From the time we bought the ticket it was brilliant - the staff are so engaging and the museum itself is highly interactive. Probably one of the best museums I\u2019ve been to and definitely have never had so much",
          "Highly interactive museum that even the casual ABBA fan can enjoy. You can perform on stage with ABBA via laser projection, sing one of ABBA's hits in karayoke & show off your mixing skills. We did the tour without the audio guide & were more than satisfied with the details &",
          "I expected more but my partner was so impressed. There is a lot about the movie, Mama Mia, but enough about ABBA the group to make it worthwhile. I found the memorabilia to be pricey.",
          "I spent my teenage years in my bedroom with my sister and best friend singing along to each and every ABBA song released. We knew every line, drum beat and harmony off by heart. I was usually Agnetha, my sister Anna-Frid and my best friend doubled up as Benny and Bjorn - which",
          "What fun we had. The only reason it doesn\u2019t get five stars from me is because it is so popular that it needs some maintenance. A few of the interactive experiences, like a singalong with the guitarist, weren\u2019t working properly. Make sure you give everything a go! It is brilliant.",
          "We booked in advance for this thinking, like many from the UK, it would be a bit of a highlight of our short stay in Stockholm. Not quite. As many have observed, the whole thing feels like it\u2019s been done a bit on the cheap, from the nondescript location and venue (in part of a",
          "A nice place to spend some time Spare some time, but tickets in advance A stroll through time knowing the group When not in a rush, one is able to see two full featured movies If you are in a good mood, take part in the show Scan your ticket while doing activities, later",
          "One of the highlights of coming to Stockholm was seeing the ABBA Museum Staying at the Pop House hotel which is in the same building, the ABBA theme is cleverly woven through the hotel with books in each room you can buy at the shop. The museum itself is wonderful with lots",
          "I really thought this was going to be cheesy, but it was a fun and interesting tribute to the iconic band. There are plenty of items that would be interesting to everyone,",
          "Fantastic fun. So many interesting stories about the band before they became the Abba we know and love.",
          "Just loved it as we were back into the ABBA's days and glory. You can take photos and sing (karaoke) and have a great fun time.",
          "The ABBA museum was on our \u2018must see\u2019 list. We booked online to skip the line. Getting there with our tram ticket on the short ferry crossing was straightforward and arriving early meant we avoided the crowds. It got quite busy but it was still pleasant. There\u2019s a great",
          "It's one of those things that has got to be done. The museum is fully accessible for wheelchair users and can be easily reached by public transport, ferry, tram, or bus. It is interactive, with lots of original props. Throw away your inhibitions and sing. All in all a great",
          "Went with teen age kids with only a vague idea who ABBA were, and only a minor passing interest in Mama Mia. Nice thing about the museum is that you get a good appreciation of what the group did before Eurovision & Waterloo, and trace their story from much further back into",
          "A must for ABBA fans and even for those who aren\u2019t humming dancing queen in their dreams. I dragged a very reluctant husband and 3 teenage children and even they enjoyed the very interactive displays (although their amusement did start to wane as I spent 3 hours reading",
          "Expensive and not particularly well made; many interactive displays did not work. Some of the personal details were interesting, old pictures are fun, but these don't warrant the cost.",
          "Yes the museum is expensive but if you like ABBA it's so much fun. We got there shortly after opening and once we got away from a tour group we had no problems with crowds and could take our turn with little waiting for all the interactive exhibits. When we left around 11 the",
          "This was a must do on our visit to Stockholm. Slightly out of the way from the Old Town but worth to trip. Lots of memorabilia on show and the chance to interact with some of the exhibits. Quite expensive, but worth it if you are an Abba fan.",
          "I arrived early in the morning, when there was no crowd. I spent a great couple of hours wandering around, looking at the displays and generally enjoying the experience. Highly recommended",
          "We had such a great time here. The music is so familiar but it was really interesting to see how the band got together and to see the development of their careers all with a backdrop of great songs.",
          "My family (age range from 12 - 78) visited The ABBA Museum on a day trip to Stockholm from our Baltic Cruise. This really had something of interest for all ages - nostalgia for the older members of our family and interactive fun for the younger members! We arrived not long after",
          "This museum was great because there were like 4 or 5 interactive areas where you could sing/and or dance or mix instruments with ABBA or others associated with ABBA. Beautiful costumes they wore along with the videos or pictures showing when they were worn",
          "Loved it! Tons of costumes and interactive areas. Lots of fun singing on a real stage. The actual holograms are rather creepy looking but it's still a blast. If you are a true ABBA fan then you can easily spend more than 3 hours, otherwise, you can get through in about an hour.",
          "A greta attractions for ABBA fans or who is interested in music. Then you can read a lot about them, see their beautiful costumes and sing along at the interactive stations including a real stage where you can dance and sing following their holograms :)",
          "I think its fare price for Abba Museum entrance ticket. I bought mine thru Viator website for $26. It was worth every penny. Lots of ABBA memorabilia to see.",
          "This museum is awesome for everyone who loves ABBA. I grew up listening to their songs and being at that museum brought back a lot of memories. This place has also a lot of interactive things for visitors to imerse themselves, like quiz games, recording booths and original ABBA",
          "A must visit for ABBA fans. Huge amounts of memorabilia to be seen including discs, clothing and instruments amongst others. We would also recommend using the handset guides as a lot of additional information is available. The interactive opportunities are also good especially",
          "We visited ABBA the museum in late July. The museum if chocked full of ABBA memorabilia and information. There is plenty of interactive exhibits such as a singalong with ABBA and an on stage interactive display where you are live with ABBA. We spent a couple of hours there and",
          "A great interactive museum that is perfect for the hard core ABBA fan in your life! This museum traces the history of ABBA, all of its members and even touches on many of their side projects. Many of the exhibits are interactive and I love that the ones that record you don\u2019t",
          "Who knew there was so much to know about ABBA. We did the audio tour. Very interesting. Good use of the controls by tapping your audio stick against the designated audio points. ABBA walk you through the museum! The museum is Very well laid out and very intuitive. So much to",
          "This is a must seen for all ABBA funs. There is a lot of information about the artists and a great selection of costumes and albums. The Mamma Mia temporary exhibition that was also very interesting! The interactive activities such as the song mixing, singing auditions, photo",

          "Enjoyed this interactive museum and following ABBA from their early days to now. It was fun being a 5th member and so cool how you can save your visit at different points to go back and look at after you leave. A fun and interesting museum for all ages!",
          "What a let down! I expected this attraction to be much better than it is. With so much material at the disposal of the organisers much more could have been done. I think the problem with it is that the rooms that it is in are too small. It is a very busy place and there should",
          "The Abba museums content is very good. It is really interesting to see the real costumes that were used. One can be on a stage and sing as if you were with Abba. We had bought pre paid tickets. The queue was still the same for people paying on the door. I found it interesting",
          "There is a feel good aspect to this museum. It is quite interactive in that you can do lots of stuff from dancing, singing to just watching and reading. The displays on the post ABBA years were kind of interesting but I think made too much of the musicians' involvement. Nor was",
          "Really enjoyed going through this comprehensive museum on the famous band. Particularly enjoyed the hologram of ABBA performing.",
          "If you are truly a fan you will love this interactive experience. The museum covers both films, outfits and props etc. It also offers the history of each member along with their history as a group. I learned so much about these talented artists! On my next visit, I will be doing",
          "I like ABBA but this museum visit was a whim and something my local hosts thought would be fun at the lats minute since they had not been either. We all loved it and had a lot of fun on the visit. Seeing all the artifacts and learning more details about the ABBA story was great,",
          "Even though I lived through ABBA\u2019s success I was amazed at the amount of information I didn\u2019t know about the individuals or the group. The displays where well done, the interactive bits were really entertaining and even if you aren\u2019t a fan its still worth a visit although entry",
          "If you're an ABBA fan, you'll want to visit. Sure it's a little bit campy, but it's also very interactive. You can sing along karaoke style in one of the recording booths and \"audition\" to be a fifth member of the band in a music video. All of the interactive bits are saved",
          "Found this very interesting and enjoyable. Lots of information and great things to look at and do. Audion guide was great",
          "The ABBA museums is located a bit down the road from Stockholms #1 attraction, the Vaasa exhibit. Located in a hotel building, you must go below ground to visit the exhibit. There's a bit of a line but you can pre-purchase or, if you ride the Hop-on, Hop-off bus, you get in with",
          "I loved the museum, music and costumes - fun part was to go back in time and felt like a teenager again",
          "Being an ABBA fan over the years I really enjoyed this and so did my teenage son. The audio tour was very informative, listening to the members of the group narrate their own story. Costumes, instruments, equipment, film and pictures- and a Mamma Mia temporary exhibition- very",
          "An afternoon to kill. What to do? Oh, there's an ABBA Museum? Great! So, off we went - two senior citizens. What a fabulous surprise. Seeing all the costumes, reading the histories, enjoying the Mamma Mia props - all fun. BUT, once you get to the interactive part of the",
          "Was an Abba fan in my formative years so it was very cool to go to this museum and learn about the real history. The museum has personal audio devices and the actual singers narrate your trip through the museum! It was very well done and the level of detail and number of",
          "We were really looking forward to this tour as it is highly recommended by the visit Stockholm sites and lists. Unfortunately we both felt it was quite a let down. We visited the museum at about 10.30am mid-week and it was already rather crowded. Would not like to have seen how",
          "Obviously from my trip advisor name I am a lifelong fan of ABBA. This museum is my spiritual home! I love seeing those iconic costumes and every time I visit there is something new to see. This time it was the Mamma Mia exhibition that is new along with a section about after",
          "Went around as a group of ABBA fans and were pleasantly surprised. There was a perfect mixture of interactivity and information. We couldn\u2019t figure out the website so queued for tickets. While the queue was long it was worth it and the museum worked really well so we weren\u2019t",
          "I was never an Abba fan but seeing we were in Stockholm we decided the Museum was worth a visit. I loved it! The band was very well documented. Loved all of the exhibits and their costumes. We ended up spending quiet some time here looking at and reading all of the memorabilia.",
          "Went there on a Sunday, but it was very, very crowded. The museum is in the basement of a hotel, and so there are a no windows. Combined with the crowds it can feel pretty claustrophobic. There are very few places to have a break (due to crowds and design) and so our parents had",
          "The ABBA Museum was lots of fun. There were many interactive activities. The costume displays were very cool. Plenty of multimedia presentations. You can explore at your own pace.",
          "Oh boy was this fun, even my ABBA hating teenaged son loved it! Book in advance and try to turn up early as you miss the crowds. It was brilliant!",
          "Obviously, don\u2019t go if you have no interest in ABBA (cannot understand why people go here if they don\u2019t even like them...), but if you do, what\u2019s not to love? The first room is about Mamma Mia the movie, the rest is about ABBA; the origins, the route to fame, the break-up. The",
          "I don\u2019t claim to be a massive ABBA fan, but this museum is still worth a visit if you are in Stockholm. This is the second time I have visited it, the first was back in 2016. My visit this time was the middle of July the height of season in Stockholm and turning up on Sunday",
          "Located in the basement of a hotel and certainly highly popular with young and old fans of the group. But outdated displays, low ceilings, and not even the chance to hear one full track from the group's early days, makes the entire effort not worth the high price or the trip",
          "Was a great place to visit from our cruise ship. brought back lots of memories and lots of information i did not know about the people involved. Was great to see all the old clothes and the gold records.The museum is very near the entrance to the theme park that can be seen from",
          "If you are an ABBA fan, or even just interested in music and how a disparate group of Swedish folk singers took over the world of pop, then this museum is an absolute must. It is brilliant! HOWEVER...it appears clear to me from reading other reviews that the vital thing to",
          "Big Abba fans, really looked forward to this one and wanted to love it. I can see that it would be fantastic if not crowded, so I'd avoid any time in the summer. It was WAY too crowded, shoulder-to-shoulder misery. They really should do timed tickets. We got some cute",
          "My son and myself went to Stockholm during the last weekend of July. Whilst there, we visited the Abba Museum. What an amazing place. We spent just under three hours in there. We saw all the costumes, listened throughout to audio, (spoken by Abba themselves). Danced on the stage",
          "A must in Stockholm! Even if you a mild Abba fan...you will enjoy looking at the costumes and ready their story. Lots of fun things to do there, like being in a sound booth and record yourself singing along with them! Dont act like your too cool!!.....just go! Its fun!",
          "We were looking forward to seeing the abba museum. It was nice but much to crowded to fully enjoy the whole experience",
          "The museum is everything you\u2019d expect. A lot of love and thought has been put into it. It\u2019s well themed and interactive.... and popular, rightly so. But the museum becomes crowded to an unsafe degree. It\u2019s essentially a thick crowd of people shoulder to shoulder fighting to read",
          "I had read some reviews that it was a lot of money for this event but we has a great visit. Even husband and 19yr old son ( neither particularly big Abba fans) enjoyed it. Several interactive bits to do. Can easily spend a couple of hrs there so have a drink b4 you go in. Bought",
          "Great fun and interactive experience where you can sing, dance and get a chance to get on stage with ABBA. Before each interactive activity you scan your ticket, you then record your score/voice/dance moves and later you get to download the experience from the museum website.",
          "Fans of ABBA or anyone who grew up with their music should add this to their Stockholm itinerary. The hop on hop off buses and boats have stops nearby, so it\u2019s very accessible. Lots to see and the audio guide is great. Have a singalong or two, and purchase a souvenir or two.",
          "We sang, danced , laughed and cried brilliant Museum the audio recommended with abba members speaking so informative and interesting and the inter active singing and dancing so much fun.",
          "Very nice museum. The audio headset was great but not always necessary to view the exhibits. If you want to hear the whole story the audio headset is better. We really enjoyed the movie. Had the Mama Mia song stuck in my head for days!!",
          "We were really excited to visit the ABBA Museum. Having \u201cskip the line\u2019 tickets we chuckled as we worked past all the \u201cpay now\u201d visitors only to get stuck behind a large tour group who had no idea of what was going on. We asked the staff member if we good go around them but",
          "A significant portion of this museum is dedicated to the Mama Mia movies. If you\u2019re a big fan of the movies and ABBA, you will be in heaven. It was cool experiencing some of the ABBA history and the outfits were neat to see. However, I felt the museum didn\u2019t fully discuss the",
          "A great museum for all things ABBA- loved the interactive activities and it was lovely to be whisked back to the 70\u2019s as well as seeing the Mammamia movie exhibits.",
          "I bought the tickets online 4 weeks before our trip. It was only possible to buy tickets for 9 am ... , no matter what day..? So we had to start very early (with children) from our hotel to be in time at the museum :( When we were there, we saw that was not necessary, there was",
          "Was looking forward to this museum but was a little underwhelming. I feel it needs all updates. I know ABBA were big in the 70s but I felt the museum was stuck in the 70s. The newer mama Mia section was more updated.",
          "Great to see all the memorabilia, archive footage, etc. of the group but was not sure it was worth the entry price when comparing the attraction to other similar attractions around the world or in Stockholm.",
          "This museum is fun and my 12 year old loved the Mamma Mia! exhibit. I would recommend to anyone who is familiar with ABBA's music or the Mamma Mia movie/broadway show. I will say, we really wanted to buy something in the gift shop at the end but nothing seemed of good quality",
          "This is a different activity but mostly for those who know ABBA's music. We had some younger people who were not familiar with their music so had no interest in going in. There is a huge banner of ABBA so you can take pictures in front of it. The staff was very friendly and",
          "If you are not a hardcore fan, it is not bad, some interesting facts and interactions, but in my opinion not wothe the price.",
          "I visited with friends. The museum is interactive and great fun. The audio guide is the band themselves speaking and was really good. The activities are fun and well thought out. I would recommend arriving early though.",
          "We had two 16-year-olds with us and since they didn\u2019t have a student license, they costed full adult price. That being said we had a good time. A lot to read and the further you got inside the exhibition, the more interactive the possibilities was. In the end we figured out,",
          "This is a great museum if you are an ABBA fan. That\u2019s my husband! We were on a cruise ship and we caught the ferry over from our port and the museum was close by. We spent a couple of hours in there as there\u2019s quite a lot to see and do. There\u2019s interactive stuff too. You can",
          "The museum has lots of commentary on the songs and the singers who were ABBA. The most interesting part of the exhibit for me, and the shortest with the least info, is what the four ABBA musicians are doing now. The two men have composed two successful musicals since then. The",
          "A magnificent museum of ABBA one of the leading worldwide bands of a recent bygone era The displays are designed to bring back to life all the god times we shared with this very talented group Not to be missed!",
          "First off, I happen to have been an ABBA fan back in the day, but even my friends, who were not big fans, thought the museum was interesting. In this museum, you'll learn about the backgrounds of the group members, their time together as a group, and what they have moved on to",
          "Must go, for people who love ABBA. A little overpriced to be honest. 25\u20ac are too much in my opinion.",
          "Although I well remember \"Waterloo\" I am not an admirer of Abba. However' the museum is well planned' provide a lot of information and give opportunities to try your own performance.",
          "I had big expectations for this museum; I even chose a Monday because I thought it would be less busy than the weekend. Turned out I was mistaken. Now don't get me wrong; I expect crowds to popular museums like this. However, it was so unbelievably crowded in every room that I",
          "I did not know much about ABBA before I entered this first room, about MaMaMia just caught me cold...where am I going? Luckily the rest of the museum is much better and actually quite interesting. There is a lot to read and understand if you want to, it will take quite a",
          "A couple of friends had recommended visiting the museum so my son and I stopped in one morning. It\u2019s great if you are a big ABBA fan but if you are just familiar with the group it\u2019s probably not worth going. We went on a Monday in the summer and it was quite crowded and hot. The",
          "This has been updated since our visit in 2014, but it looses no sparkle! There is a greater feature on Mama Mia - but looking at the ages of the people going in, this is probably how they have been introduced to ABBA, and if it keeps the music alive - great! Our 17 year old",
          "Sweden may be heading towards a cashless society but that does not mean its visitors feel the same way. I may now be in my 60\u2019s but I far prefer a pocketful of kronor, reserving the drastic plastic for emergencies only. This was the only place I visited in my short trip that",
          "The fact that they play money, money, money as you are in line sums it up. It works out roughly \u00a322 per person and it was very busy so you are released into the museum in time slots to help with crowding. This would be best visited out of season then you could see the exhibits",
          "I have been giving myself an upper cut since leaving Stockholm. Fancy missing our favourite ABBA Museum, bugger!",
          "Took my 11 year old daughter, she\u2019s been a fan since seeing Mamma Mia. From the moment we stepped inside we were excited. The first part of the museum was devoted to the Mamma Mia film; costumes, set, props etc. Great to look at. The rest of the museum was about ABBA",
          "Awesome place. Lots of info and entertainment. Also easy food in cafeteria. Eg- a big margarita pizza slice and a glass of wine - 140k",
          "The Abba Museum is an extraordinary place in Stockholm, where you can experience a variety of emotions. It is not only for die-hard ABBA fans ( i am a fan and i cried when i entered the exhibition), but for people who just want to see something different. It offers different",
          "I am an ABBA fan and love the music and it took me back to the years when ABBA was so popular. A must see if you are an ABBA Fan. Love the shoes on the roof!!!!!",
          "If you are a ABBA fan like I am, this is a must see when in Stockholm. It takes the customer through the early years, the personal trials they had to overcome and more. It give you a chance to \"dance\" with the group via a holograph. Many of their outfits are on display as",
          "Ok the ABBA the museum was little bit of a disappointment. I\u2019m visually impaired, I don\u2019t see well in the dark and my visual fields are very poor. It was really dark inside and narrow walkways. Although there were interesting things there I couldn\u2019t really see them. I just don\u2019t",
          "Wasn\u2019t sure what to expect and it wasn\u2019t good. Long queue, took an age to buy ticket with just 2 serving (tip, prebook and collect on entry, this q was also 10 deep). We waited around 20 mins to get in. Visit somewhat spoilt as far too many people in the museum meant it was",
          "While not elaborate and a bit pricey a couple glasses of champagne will get you into the kitschy mood to enjoy. You\u2019ll enjoy the story of romance gone bad and music darn good.",
          "This is definitely a must for any ABBA fan, and remembering their breakthrough Waterloo performance back on Eurovision however long ago, this was the first place to visit during our 1 day in Stockholm. It lived up to expectations, and was a great way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "An extensive exhibition of the career of one of the greatest music group ever. A lot of video material included in the exhibition.",
          "One of many nice museums in Stockholm Fees for entrance and discounts for groups Restaurants and transportstion available Near Gr\u00f6na Lund where kids enjoy most Green and water surroundings",
          "We decided to go on a whim. We are glad we did. The museum was full of interesting information about the band. If you are an ABBA fan, this is a must. If you have a passing curiosity, you will enjoy yourself here. My tip is to go to the abba museum website and book online. We",
          "If you are an ABBA fan, this place is a must. You can not just only read their stories but also take a picture with them and of yourself being a singer, record your own ABBA songs, and be on stage for your ABBA performance. There's also a collection of their outfits and albums,",
          "It was so much fun, all the interactive activities that you can do and then use your ticket when you leave to access all your rockstar moments. What a hoot, You will love it!",
          "Very good 250 krona for two and headset brings back good songs and a very good tour takes about two hours",
          "The ABBA Museum is just a short walk away from the Vasa and the Nordic Museum. If you are a fan of ABBA, you'll enjoy it here. Spend at least a couple of hours inside, listening to the music that makes you want to dance and watching videos. You'll get to know the personal",
          "The museum has loads of fantastic exhibits and provides lots of interesting information about the history of ABBA. There is also a number of interactive experiences which are great fun. This is worth a 4 or 5 star review rating. However, the route through the various parts of",
          "Absolutely terrible and lacking in any organisation. Just download their albums, it will be much more enjoyable.",
          "Not even ashamed to say it was one of the best museums I've ever been to. Such a laugh, probably not for people with a too stiff upper lip since this was probably attributed to the parts where you got involved and make a bit of a fool out of yourselved - I just found the whole",
          "By far the most \u2018fun museum\u2019 I have ever visited. Very interactive and encourages visitors to interact. Fun facts about a fantastic group of musicians",
          "We love ABBA. We have seen all versions of Mama Mia. It is a little pricey. However, it was a lot of fun. You can sing karaoke. There are several other interactive activities. Lots of memorabilia, pictures, interviews, etc.",
          "We took the Hop On Off boat from our ship to the ABBA MUSEUM. Growing up with music from ABBA, was so wonderful. The museum was not crowded early in the morning and excitement was in the air from the moment we entered. The group's biography was well told in music and with",
          "You would think that with the popularity of Abba and the amount of visitors they get to the museum that a more visitor friendly experience would be given. We had prepaid for our ticket on line and we when arrived we bypassed the queue and went to a separate desk where we were",
          "We visited the ABBA museum just after a Baltic cruise. It's definitely a different vibe than all the churches, museums, and old buildings one tends to see on a Baltic cruise. It's a relatively small museum, and was quite crowded the day we visited. Almost everyone had the",
          "It's a bit of disappointment. Not too many interesting exhibits. Small space with lots of tourists. Not worthy of spending money and time",
          "They have done quite a lot to make the exhibition interesting. All the expected memorabilia plus videos. Just a little dated looking, but still good. The stage show where you could stand along side and act/sing was fun. Having costumes to wear would have made it even better.",
          "After days of visiting (fabulous) historic sites and monuments, this museum was a really fun change of pace. My parents, my daughter, and I all enjoyed it. The exhibits are interesting, fun, and interactive--but it was a bit hard to do some of the interactive things because",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our Abba Museum experiencet especially the Mamma Mia section at the beginning. Make sure you get early and advance tickets to avoid the lines. You will hum your way through the entire exhibit. You can even be on stage and sing with ABBA. No one in our group",
          "Part 1. THE LOCATION We were on a cruise and docked across the water from a fun fair. That's basically the location of ABBA THE MUSEUM. Just around the corner. It is actually sited at the Pop House Hotel, a large dark yellow building. We took the cruise shuttle bus to the",
          "For any ABBA or Mama Mia aficionado this Museum is a must. There is a small section dedicated to the two recent movies and then the rest of the museum is dedicated to ABBA, the musicians, and their stories. We chose to get the interactive radio. You could do it without,",
          "For someone who remembers the Eurovision contest of 1974 and the subsequent AABA phenomena this is a must. Great fun reminiscing and reading all about the ABBA story from the early beginnings. The movie paraphernalia from the 2 films is interesting, but the real gems are the",
          "With the travel card tool the tram there and the ferry back. Both good ways to get there. It is a time trip to the 1970s packed with Ab a memorabilia and some replicate rooms. Well done with some great displays and lots of authentic things in display. Very enjoyable but a bit",
          "The staff here at the museum are so welcoming and they speak English! The museum is really modern and it\u2019s so good to look at all of the ABBA memorabilia and I actually learnt a lot here! Lucky it was quiet when we went here but we stayed for about an hour and a half. Would go",
          "I must say I normally agree with most trip advisor reviews, but the ABBA museum was a big disappointment. Too much clutter, every prop from every show was on display it seemed. The on stage interactive singing was good, sing to either \u2018Dancing Queen\u2019 or \u2018Mama Mia\u2019 but the rest",
          "A wonderful afternoon at the ABBA Museum. Highlighted that my wife and I are fans. Fabulously interactive experience and the opportunity to see memorabilia from this classic era of pop music. Word to the wise, make sure you don't lose your ticket that you use to scan to",
          "Phenomenal museum! Highly recommend to any Abba and Mamma Mia fans. Even if you just enjoyed the Mamma Mia movie/musical you will enjoy this museum! It is so well thought out and interactive! They have so many props from the band and movie and the whole museum is extremely",
          "A must do when in Stockholm, even when you're not a fan! Walk through museum and interactive games!!",
          "A must see for visitors in Stockholm. Wonderfully done museum, lots of memorabilia, history and interactive exhibits. Kids and adults loved it.",
          "Booked for entrance when the museum opened. Very few people there so could visit in peace and enjoy the experience. Tried the interactive displays It was wonderful, would go back again. Sat listening to ABBA as I write this",
          "Enjoyed this museum very much! Very entertaining. Good for all ages. We were quite early otherwise there will be a crowd.",
          "Good fun, well presented, reasonably priced, very interesting. What more can you ask of a visitor attraction.",
          "This is a must see museum if you are into music. There\u2019s an odd start to the visit as you go through the Mumma Mia exhibit first, there are props and costumes from the films, video excerpts etc. Moving on you get into the hard core ABBA section which is bigger than I expected.",
          "A good way to spend a rainy afternoon even though we are not die-hard ABBA fans. The museum was logically ordered and had some fun bits (karaoke etc). The exhibits were really interesting and there were some good sections about other aspects of the ABBA story, including the",
          "A great Compilation of ABBA artifacts. Many interactive exhibits like singalong and photos with the young abba.",
          "We really enjoyed our time there, so much of interest and lots to make you smile and sing. A lot of their fantastic costumes on display and a film of how they grew up and met as a foursome, also they are on film separately as they are now. The land rover from the film is there",
          "We visited the museum in a group of 5 and we had a blast. There were lots of replicas and memorabilia from both the set of the movie and the members of the band. There are many interactive activities such as karaoke and dancing that are suitable for children as well. The museum",
          "I went on a guided tour here which was very well organised. We arrived and were immediately shown through into the museum. We were given an interactive listening device which we could touch screens etc and then listen to the story about a paritcular event or spot. Unfortunately",
          "Had a great morning here. If you are an ABBA fan it is an absolute must. Lovely to see the costumes and there are lots of interactive bits. Highly recommended.",
          "We weren't big Abba fans, but his museum was a fun way to experience one of Sweden's most famous exports.",
          "It was pretty fun with the interactive elements included - singing along in the sound studio and then downloading that recording when you get home to see how bad you actually sound! haha - but the video of you with the band behind the virtual reality screen is the best -",
          "Enjoyed the experience of reliving ABBA and their music. Learned a lot about the group and the individual members. Great display of the clothes, albums and other pieces from the musicians. You can sing with the group. Special display of Mama Mia movie pieces including the jeep",
          "Worthwhile for both avid fans and pop/rock roll listeners of 70s and 80s or new Mama Mia fans. It was a lot more extensive than I expected with the displays and interactive singing opportunities. Learned a lot about the group and it was fun to relive the music and the fashions.",
          "We were in Stockholm for a day on a cruise and although this was offered as a shore excursion on the ship we had decided weeks earlier to order tickets once and get a cab to and from the port shuttle bus stop. Taxi's were easy to get and the museum is a 15-10 min trip from the",
          "Spend the money on the audio tour, it greatly enhanced the exhibits. Momma Mia fans will enjoy all the props from the movies. Alot packed into a small area, so it is best to go at low volume times.",
          "Best museum to visit, dance and sing. The visit was a party itself. My kids and i had a blast. The museum is on the museum island in Stockholm. It tells the story of Abba with all the band's glory days.",
          "It was very crowded the rainy day we visited. One tip book ahead online to avoid the long queues. I\u2019m sure ABBA fans will love this museum which is interactive and absolutely crammed full of memorabilia. I feel it needs a much larger space to allow a more thoughtful display of",
          "If you followed Abba during the day, this is a must stop on Museum Island. The displays and layout are very well done, with some interesting interactive features. Having been to the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, it would serve as a \"nice part\" of that marvellous",
          "Nice place to visit but definitely not a must do. It is good to know the group more but needs more music and songs. Interactive touches are good.",
          "This was an absolute hoot . I recommend getting your tix before cuz long line. It\u2019s informative , fun and digital surprises around every corner. The staff is having fun too. As the tag line says , \u201cwalk in, dance out\u201d...the perfect anecdote museums and castle overload",

          "I paid an extra SEK 20 for the use of an audioguide which I found it provided more insight to the displays in the museum. Museum was well organized with displays on each member before ABBA, times during ABBA, and after ABBA. There were interactive displays and quizzes. You",
          "A rare museum where visitors get interaction with certain exhibits. This is not only a must-go trip for Abba & MammaMia fans, it is memorable for Stockholm visitors. It takes at least 1-2 hours to complete the tour.",
          "a very small museum with plenty of memorabilia, took me back to the seventies but the whole thing took half an hour to visit and at the end 25 dollars get a little too much",
          "Somewhere between a 3 and a 4. But if you're a fan of ABBA, you should go. And if not, I'm not sure why you'd like it. I'm comparing it to the Beatles Experience in Liverpool which I thought told the story better (each room was a chapter in the band's journey). Maybe it's an",
          "If you love ABBA then this is a must see. It was not crowded and exhibits were great. Easy access from Hop On Hop Off system. Lots of memorabilia and interactive exhibits. Be sure to do the stage performance. Super fun!",
          "I loved the Group and the movie Mamma Mia, but this goes way beyond being a fan. You could almost spend three hours going through all the exhibits. It was overwhelming. I found the audio guided tour distractingly and seemed to repeat itself. The ABBA museum fits well into a",
          "Located close to the Vasa Museum - I am so glad we make the walk. We had a great time! Lost of ability for hand-on interaction and you can even take the stage and become a member of the band. We had a great time.",
          "If in Stockholm for a couple of days or more you must put this on your list. It is full of ABBA memorabilia and facts. There are hologram models that you can join on stage. You can sing along to your ABBA favourite and get a score for your performance. Young and old mingled",
          "all the life of ABBA group is show in the museum, with many details and accessories,clothes and so on ...which have been given by each member from the group. a good possibility to come back in the 80's years . thierry and laurence",
          "This is a great happy museum to visit! There are lots of interactive activities and many costumes, record jackets, exhibits to view. Even if you are not a big fan of ABBA you are guaranteed to have a good time! I also found the staff to be helpful and pleasant. As a solo",
          "We are a little younger than the abba band but we loved them through the 70s this is a good re-enactment of there exciting career Well set up and it\u2019s worth the visit",
          "Very crowded but good fun. Well worth a visit Think they could make more out of it in the future. It seems a little disorganised but probably due to sheer number of visitors",
          "I like some of ABBA's popular music, but didn't know much about them as a band. The museum was fun in some ways, like that you could go on stage and sing with what looked like the other band members. There was alot on Mama Mia! if you like that, but I hadn't seen it. Honestly",
          "This a must if you are an ABBA fun but it also a fun trip down memory lane if you were alive in the 70s. There its a ton of memorabilia including costumes, instruments, set pieces from Mama Mia!, their gold records and all sorts of history and trivia and a couple of interactive",
          "While the 'museum' looks non-descript from the outside, it packs in everything you could possibly think of in relation to ABBA....every base is covered and well laid out in story-tell fashion. The memorabilia brought back great memories even though I was more the rocker in them",
          "For ABBA fans or anyone who was dancing in the 70\u2019s - Brilliant . All the ABBA paraphernalia plus a chance to record a song!!!",
          "Easily booked our tickets online on the day. Museum was busy, but not that busy you couldn't see everything. Took part in the experiences, and brilliant that you could link it to your entrance ticket and play back at home (although they not all worked, but that could have",
          "In the city and had to visit as Abba have been part of my life for so long. I was not disappointed. The costumes on show are so iconic, took me straight back in time. The continuous music feed makes it difficult not to dance as you view the exhibits. Loved the Mamma Mia film",
          "We caught the ferry across to the Island where the ABBA Museum is. It was worth the trip. The museum full of costumes and film clips and heaps of other interesting things. All the records they made line a long wall and we surprised at how many there were. We got to watch a",
          "It's an iconic Swedish experience. Learn about the original Abba band and experience their 10 year journey as well as the musical and movie. Very fun but wouldn't spend more than a couple of hours.",
          "If you are an ABBA fan, this is a must see. I love rock and roll but ABBA isn't one of my favorites. I somewhat expected that loving rock, I would love the museum, but you really need to like the band. Even if you aren't a big fan but love Mamma Mia, I would say go for sure.",
          "If you\u2019re a fan of the band, or the Mamma Mia movies, this is a \u201cshrine\u201d you cannot miss and must explore! The first floor is related to the movie, while the second, much larger level is devoted to the four band members and their back stories. It pays homage to the other",
          "We took our 3 teenage kids there. There really had no idea who ABBA was but learning more about their backgrounds and lives was very interesting. Plus the museum is right next to an amusement park.",
          "Just like your ticket states, Walk In, Dance Out. What an amazing collection of ABBA memorabilia. We could not believe the gold and platinum records that ABBA was awarded. The wardrobe including big boots was a flash back memory to the 70's. Take the audio guide. Amazing stage",
          "The ABBA museum shows you how this Swedish group rose to dominate the pop charts with reproductions of their recording studio and the room where many of their hits were written. You can also go into a sound booth and try your hand at ABBA karaoke! Also on display are the",
          "Excellent story telling from the beginning of the group to them becoming famous. Good behind the scenes discussions and presentations. Try your hand at the Karioke :-)",
          "My wife is the ABBA fan, so I went along for the ride. I learned a lot about the band and that particular time in Swedish rock history. It was very enjoyable.",
          "I wasn't much of an ABBA fan before visiting, but I sure left the museum as one! You get a really nice insight into the members' lives, their time and muses, also great if you are a fan of karaoke and impersonation. Great for 2 or bigger groups.",
          "I am not an ABBA fan and the entrance fee is high. But it is nice to take a picture as a part of ABBA",
          "Easiest way to get to the museum ois on the tram number 7. Lots of information and videos with members of Abba speaking. The restaurant attached to the museum is good",
          "I visited the ABBA museum with my best friend - what fun we had. Lots of interactive exhibits where you can sing ABBA songs or even perform on stage with their holograms. We got fully involved with all of that, which is of course voluntary! There are also so many original",
          "So much going on here - you can sing and dance watch videos of the group performing in their heyday take part in trivia tests. You are given an audio piece like an old hand held phone when you enter and at lots of places around the museum you can touch the phone to tune it to",
          "This was my 3rd Stockholm trip for work and I wanted to do this. My daughter (18) joined me for the weekend and we went for it. It is so interactive! We could have stayed for hours!! I mean it is a smiling singing dancing fun fun experience! There is also a restaurant attached",
          "Found this overpriced & underwhelming. Had to push our way through the crowd to see room after room of fairly boring memorabilia. Would have been better looking at YouTube videos!",
          "Well interpreted, good to have the interactive activities, tho it took a while to figure out how it all worked. Was a quiet time when we were there, with a lot of people - like middle of summer- it could be chaotic.",
          "We were singing and dancing through the museum. Brought back good old memories. Well done museum. I'd recommend it.",
          "Most likely ABBA is one of Sweden\u2019s most successful exports and as a fan, it is very worthwhile to visit.",
          "The ABBA museum had been on my list for the last few trips to Stockholm and finally made it. It is a pricey admission over $26 per person. The rooms are extremely small and get overcrowded very quickly. It is quite difficult to get close to some objects to read the description",
          "A must when you are in Stockholm. You can see all about history of the band. They used modern tecnology in such a clever way to make many interactive games which make you feel like you are part of the ABBA band, even if you are not a hardcore fan. Also, the staff in the gift",
          "Very interesting and informative! The additional audio guide was inexpensive and made it even better. Awesome gift shop with lots of unique ABBA items!",
          "Great museum if you\u2019re an ABBA fan. Come early because it gets full quickly due to continuous tour buses, and it\u2019s not a big space by any means",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the museum. There is a lot of information and a lot of reading to be done and the two hours we had were just not enough. Lots of pictures and artifacts about ABBA and some fun interactive activities; I really enjoyed going on stage. There is always music",
          "A must for ABBA fans. Costumes, videos, music, everything ABBA. Only draw back for us was fee, about $25 apiece seems a bit steep.",
          "Split across three floors, the top (street level) floor consists of a shop will all sorts of Abba branded merchandise for sale, whilst the next floor down is used for temporary exhibitions and on our visit was related to the two Mamma Mia films. This is included various costumes",
          "Yes, it\u2019s expensive (and no cash accepted) so unless you are a fan, you might not appreciate all the curated and interactive displays have to offer. There\u2019s a section dedicated to the Mamma Mia movie series at the start. The highlight for me was getting on stage and singing",
          "This was expensive but well worth it.. The interactive exhibits were great. Get there early as it very quickly becomes quite crowded",
          "I wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about going but on a rainy day an inside activity was needed. It exceeded our expectations. Lots to see and do. Also a good behind the scenes film which gave us a chance to sit. Wasn\u2019t very crowded which was great. Pricey at 250 SEK but worth it.",
          "A place where you really do come out singing! The exhibits were really good and told the story of ABBA and what happened after they split up. Amazing was also how the politicians at the time controlled the radio and TV wanting to have more alternative left-wing music and not",
          "Lovely to learn more about the group before formation of ABBA. Suggested time is 1 to 2 hours but barely long enough as their is so much to see and do.Staff were really lovely especially Jonathon who helped us with our tickets.Cost was very reasonab!e especially as you have the",
          "If you're an Abba lover and are interested in the history and the 'behind the scenes stories of the band, then you'll really enjoy the museum. There's a lot of interactive displays and people were really enjoying themselves. I didnt spend a lot of time there, but enjoyed it",
          "WE wanted to see this Museum after many good reports and had a great time but went around lunchtime and it was very busy. So busy that we ended up missing some of the interactive elements of the museum as the queues were too long. There is such a lot to see and hear and it was",
          "This ended up being a lot of fun! If you love ABBA music, then you should check out this museum. Give yourself a couple hours. It's interactive so it takes some time. Time flies in this museum though. We had kids with us - youngest being 11 and he loved it too.",
          "The ABBA Museum is more like an interactive exhibition than a museum. Visitors can perform the band's music at several interactive audio and video stations, which may have long lines during busy hours. To avoid the crowd, get to this place early in the morning. Admission fee",
          "I like abba a lot but wasn\u2019t so familiar with their history, was a great experience. We were lucky and went towards to need of the day when it wasn\u2019t crowded.",
          "I'm not a massive Abba fan but still found this museum really interesting and fun. If you are an Abba fan and brave enough there's some really good interactive singing activities. It's surprising how many of the songs you remember even if you're not a super fan and the songs",
          "I love the group ABBA , so visiting their museum while we were in Stockholm was a must! Interesting building - the museum is in the lower/basement floors. Wonderful history of each band member - most began performing at very young ages. Then on to the highlights of their most",
          "Must start with a big negative the price. The amazing Vasa museum is very nearby took millions and millions to set up and has an entry price of 300kr or 2 people.The ABBA museum in a far inferior building with relatively tiny set up costs charges 500 kr for 2 adults. They are",
          "From the outside the museum looks small, but inside is you can spent a half day to see the history of ABBA and you have the option to be active even to a great singer.d",
          "Took my husband to Stockholm for a surprise 60th birthday present. I've lived the last 30 years as 2nd fiddle to Agnetha so I had to take him to the museum. Die hard fans need at least 4 hours here, everyone else - you can't fail to be impressed and you need at least 2.5 hours.",
          "Visit here with my family (my wife, daugther, son). My wife and I enjoyed it very much, but it was a little bit too tiredsome for my kids (but they enjoyed the interactive parts of the exhbit).",
          "This was one of my \u2018have\u2019 to\u2019s. We had less than 24 hours in Stockholm and this didn\u2019t disappoint. I loved everything about it, so much fun, and loads of information about the members of the band. I loved everything about it. Just wished I had more time.",
          "Even you dont know ABBA you will fall in Love with when you See this and feel the Spirit of this Popband.",
          "Very nice museum including movies, documents, LPs... As they say - you walk in but dance out:) A part of it is dedicated to Mamma Mia.",
          "I went with a diehard ABBA fan because his wife didn't want to. I told him that if I were in charge of putting together an ABBA museum, the first thing I would do is commission wax figures of each member. The interactive opportunities were absolutely amazing - I have not seen",
          "I'm a big ABBA fan from way back - so I couldn't go to Stockholm and not visit the museum. It was fab, I loved it! I went in the morning and by the time I was leaving it was really crowed, so if at all possible go as early as you can. It cost about \u20ac25 entrance fee which I",
          "This was honestly so much fun! You can\u2019t not come to this museum! The first section was so interesting as it had an entire Mamma Mia section and showed you some of the behind the scenes videos on what goes on behind the film set and loads of the costumes! You then go in to learn",
          "The first part with all of the Mamma Mia stuff was ok, but the rest of the museum was super! Loved being able to get up on stage and sing with the band!!!",
          "Sad to say but this museum was a disappointment For the number of people going through the gates it could be half the price and as ABBA have been around for a long time the memorabilia is well known to most people I would leave it as a last option during a visit to Stockholm",
          "This museum is a must to visit, from start to finish it offers good music and fashion from the 70/80s with great interaction for all ages. Very informative with an insight to to their history, life and success over the years which keeps you entertained the whole time, brilliant",
          "A museum set up by the members of ABBA and reflects the 1970s. Lots of the Mamma Mia films in the first rooms. Great interactive pieces. Loved the stage where you were able to dance and sign along with ABBA. Really revealing trying to sing along to the lyrics or the mix the",

          "Loved all things ABBA, like reliving my youth. All that ABBA memorabilia. Loved the interactive experiences & the real costumes & photo opportunities. We got there early (before 10) easy to move about & didn\u2019t queue for anything. Lovely little gift shop attached too.",
          "Highly recommend a visit of all baby boomers! Everyone was singing all the favorite hits by auditioning, on stage signing w/group, & learning about the group from how they met through the divorces.",
          "Got to know the group better after the tour but the story telling can be more dynamic with more multimedia and new tools. Entrance fees is pricey.",
          "I really enjoyed my visit, but it would have been better if they had more places you could sing along with the music without being on display singing by yourself. Really, the only place to sing along is if you are on stage by yourself. The new Mama Mia exhibit is fun. The",

          "The museum is a must visit when in Stockholm. Along with lots of memorabilia and information, there's a whole lot of interactive stuff one can do! And that just amps up the fun quotient....dancing and singing with holographic ABBA team on stage, karaoke, mixing a song, recording",
          "We were in early 20s during the hey days of ABBA and we were great fans. I listen to ABBA even today. So it is a nostalgic experience visiting the museum. Every thing of the artists - full collection of music, the outfits they wore etc were there. The interactive part of the",
          "We visited with two people who grew up with ABBA songs, one familiar with the songs through Mama Mia and one with only limited familiarity. Every one of us enjoyed the museum tremendously. The museum is very well executed. It tells a very thorough story of the band, how they",

          "Everybody who was young in the 70's and 80's cannot go here and feel nothing. I am not a fan but still it is a well set-up history of facts around the four band members as well as a lot of memoralia plus information on their careers afterwards. Many interactive things such as"

A lot of information which was unknown for me, like past-ABBA musicals and other projects. Nice souvenir shop, where I get some memorabilia items.",

Thank you for all you gave and continue to give. Arohanui",

If you are visiting Stockholm you should be sure to include this museum in you plans.",

          "More ABBA stuff than you will know what to do with. Really good interactive elements you can download later as well to add to the fun.  Be aware, it will be busy.  Buy tickets in advance to avoid some of the queueing.",
          "Fourth time here. Always something new to find. Loved the Mamma Mia movie costumes and props which is a recent addition. Well laid out. Nice mix of interactive fun stuff and informative displays.  I'm a massive fan of ABBA but I think most people would enjoy this museum.",
          "We absolutely loved it here.  My daughter had so much fun with the recordings.  Loved all the outfits and old footage of the group.  I suggest going early to avoid crowds and lineups.  Pretty tickets online.",
          "Brilliant fun. Good music with a lot of interactive sections. Well worth a visit!",
          "Lovely details, everything you wanted to know about ABBA is here. From their past even until the latest Mamma mia! movie. Also very nice and friendly staff, and a good souvenir shop. I can only recommend.",
          "Cool, fun and interactive museum.  Hang on to your tickets to replay your embarrassing moments on line after your visit.",
          "The museum is great, there are tons of stuff about ABBA, even the whole rooms from the house on the Greek island from Mamma Mia. There are also nice interactive elements of the exposition, you can listen to the music, even perform some songs. I would recommend to have at least an hour to fully explore it.",
          "One of the best attractions in Stockholm. I am not a big ABBA fan and we went with two teenagers. We loved it. Singing and many fun activities",
          "It was ok... I wish there was more to see.\nFelt like a tourist trap.",
          "A great interactive museum that is perfect for the hard core ABBA fan in your life!  This museum traces the history of ABBA, all of its members and even touches on many of their side projects.  Many of the exhibits are interactive and I \u2026",
          "If you have been an ABBA fan, then you should visit this place. It is all about the history of the band and their lives after getting separated. The top attraction is the Stage hall, where you can sing and dance next to the band members. \u2026",
          "Worth a visit. It is nice cosy and interactive.",
          "Absolut toppen. This is the best museum!",
          "A nice museum where you can have lots of fun. A bit pricy!",
          "I loved it. Lots of projections you will never see on youtube. Customs, golden records, transcriptions, interviews. I\u2019d recommend to get a headset for further information on the exposition. The English version is made by the Abba group itself.",
          "Fun museum with costumes, karaoke bars and music \ud83e\udd70",
          "Not recommended for the next generation.\n\nApologies if i offend anyone.. but kpop is way better: with girls looking like beautiful women, guys looking like beautiful girls. Yep kpop is way better.",
          "Good museum very interactive :) and you can learn a lot about ABBA past and present life.",
          "Amazing museum for all Abba's funs, very complete and funny. Also visitors can participate to many interactive sessions (sing, dance, photoshoots). Very very enjoinable!",
          "It's a shrine to ABBA and let me tell you it's worth making the pilgrimage.  The ABBA museum should be on any ones to visit list.",
          "Wish I were with my friends. Learnt a lot from Frida, Agnetha, Benny and Bjorn.I.tried to sing and dance too!!! FANTASTIC AND FUN interactive museum ..You should spend 3 hours there",
          "It was interesting and informative. I recommend anyone who likes ABBA and would like to know more about their background.",
          "The museum is great and lots to see and read! I was so nostalgic by the end of it that I nearly teared up!",
          "Nice museum, even for someone who did not grow up listening to ABBA. I probably spent a couple hours here. The cost was around $25, which is a bit expensive. It probably helps to see the movie or musical Mama Mia first, which I did not do, since a lot of space is devoted to it.",
          "Of course I loved it as an ABBA tragic. Well put together exhibition with lots of interactive fun. Not cheap but hey you only do this ones",
          "The museum is not large, but has a great set of intera tice activities and you have tons of fun!",
          "Fantastic museum! Very complete and with a nice variety, really love this place the entrance was very cheap, it was a nice walk in there!",
          "Oh! I love it. HINT! It's located near skansen, so you can visit 2 sights within 5-6 hours, if you come to Abba museum early :)",
          "It's very hard not to sing here. I learnt more interesting stuff about ABBA than i ever did. They sure are a legendary group. Well worth the visit and easily one of the highlights of my trip to Stockholm.",
          "Unbelievable fun. Think as much fun as you can and then double it",
          "Totally ABBA-tastic. Mama Mia it was good.",
          "If you want you can sing and dance along. Very interesting stories and good video and audio material. The Mama Mia film information is quite extensive.",
          "The Seventies rang (Ring Ring) and said Thank you for the music. There were some interesting exhibits and information about the careers of ABBA members. There was also a lot (too much, IMHO) of stuff from the two movies. Too much, in my humble opinion. But still worth the experience.",
          "As a really long time ABBA fan, I enjoyed learning more about the band and how they made their magic happen. There were a lot of great hands on activities as well. However, I feel the museum is really over priced for what it delivers. Lots \u2026",
          "ABBA is truly the best band ever,the museum make it last",
          "Smaller than expected, but still absolutely worth a visit for every ABBA fan. Went there at 10am to be the firsts to enter, which was really worth it. Had enough time to do all the fun activities at the museum, like singing and dancing and \u2026",
          "We really like Abba music and films. The Abba museum however was a waste of money. It was very expensive for what you get and very expensive compared to other museums (see Vasa Museum - amazing). It looked like the 4 Abba members did a spring clean and dumped everything at the museum. I wouldn't bother.",
          "Delve deep into the bands history. The museum is interactive with a merch store and open for longer durations on some days (check Google maps).\nWhile the merch store is understandable expensive, the band members' rise to cult figures and their individual endeavours in music in their later lives is phenomenally captured.",
          "crazy interactive museum that gives you the chance to prove your knowledge by singing, dancing and performing",
          "Went with my daughter she loves ABBA. This is a cute museum for Abba fans.",
          "You can't miss the ABBA Museum when your in town. To my knowledge all four band members have been in the water and none of them sank. Take that Vassa Museum!",
          "May be the best museum I have ever seen for the last time. Good audio guides, clear understanding of routes, audio, video content. Lot of history and even small details, which is also important. Very impressed.",
          "This is an absolutely \"must see\" destination for all ABBA lovers.  If you're in Stockholm then it's a no brainer, if not  then make the trip. Wallow in nostalgia as the ABBA story is brought to life in front of your eyes and ears.\n\nAdvance \u2026",
          "Nice museum simple  n cozy ...ABBA stories pop musican",
          "Wonderful museum. A must see for all major Abba fans and definitely still a worthwhile visit for less hardcore fans. It has a very varied display, ranging from short informative video's, compilation video's, performance video's, karaoke, picture and film sessions, and ofcourse all their suits, records and plenty instruments.",
          "Best place for ABBA fans with a lot of interesting exhibitions about their time as a band and the time after. My favourite part is the recreation of the Polar Music Studios. The offical shop is also worth its visit.",
          "ABBA and I have our age in common.I remember them back in in the '70s. Seeing their costumes and the story behind the groups huge success,and the movies.Swedes consider them a national treasure.With good reason.",
          "A very invested museum, lots of interactive representations that make the experience better.  All interactive activity is saved on the museum's website and you can re-download the videos and recordings for your personal computer at home with the museum entrance ticket.  Highly recommended.",
          "Surprisingly entertaining.  Went in expecting a cheesy experience and left impressed.  I knew of ABBA listening to it as a kid, but never realized how many hits they made or how they started/ended.  Great chronological story and logically laid out museum.",
          "If you are a ABBA fan Jag must visit this amazing museum.",
          "Just OK, nothing more. I left the place disappointed, as I was expecting much more. Crowds, queues to all interactive attractions that do not allow you to enjoy all features... In my opinion there should be a limitation of people allowed at \u2026",
          "Loved visiting this place. Stayed at the hotel and experienced the museum. Well put together with a lot of ABBA\u2019s history.",
          "Fantastic museum and exhibits.  You need about 3 hours to get around it.",
          "Great history of ABBA, learned a lot new things. There also was a Mamma Mia exhibition",
          "A must see for any ABBA fan. Great exhibition, lots of interactive activities.",
          "You can't really come to Stockholm without visiting the ABBA museum, but it is a bit over-priced.\nInteresting to learn about the band members earlier lives, before they became famous, and how the group came together. Lots of memorabilia; \u2026",
          "More of an Abba exhibition than an actual museum. Three floors filled with Abba nostalgia and interactive challenges such as karaoke. Admission is somewhat pricey but it's worth the visit. Audio guide costs an extra SEK 20,- but it's \u2026",
          "Great day out. Interactive fun.",
          "Really interesting museum with all audio guides by the band members themselves. Interactive things to do like sing a long or even perform on stage. Well worth the visit.",
          "Abba the museum is a must for Abba fans! I saw the temporary Mammi Mia! film exhibition which was amazing. The rest of the museum is interactive and your ticket gives you access to review and download your activities. My favourite part was singing Mamma Mia on stage 'with the band'. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",
          "An incredibly detailed and fully functional exhibition on one of Sweden's greatest exports.\n\nPlenty of opportunities for a bit of karaoke, dancing and testing your ABBA knowledge and see the snazzy costumes in all their glory!\n\nStrongly \u2026",
          "The museum itself was pretty good. Enjoyed the interactive experiences. Let down by the terrible customer service when my audio guide didn't work and there was nobody from the museum around to assist until you exited, and they then refused \u2026",
          "Fully interactive... And all working devices. Auto upload to your own page on the website. We spent 3 hours here and had an absolutely fabulous time. Highly recommended.",
          "It was ok - had a good time with co-workers, but honestly feel the place is a bit overpriced. 250 SEK is a bit overpriced for what you get here - the Vasa Museum just down the street is a much more interesting experience and is half the cost.",
          "Great fun, brings back memories. Lots to do and see. Best with a bunch of mates.",
          "It was such a fun experience! It has been several years ago since I have been here, but I still remember it vividly! I would even like to go again someday! The ABBA Museum had a lot of history about the group, such as how they got together, \u2026",
          "As someone who's not an incredible fan of Abba it was still fun and interesting.",
          "What can I say, if you like music or fashion and everything  ABBA this is a must see. This was my second visit and they have a whole new section on Mama Mia .",
          "Brings back so many memories. Learned alot I did not know about ABBA. Fantastic a must visit.",
          "Who does not know at least one song from the mythic swedish band ABBA ? Fan or not, this museum dedicated to the band and its members worth a visit.\nInteractive animations who will make you feel that you are a ABBA member, fun facts, \u2026",
          "Great fun to visit for an hour or two. Can sing along or dance to the music. Can see costumes, instruments,  gold discs etc. Make sure you take a debit or credit card aw as cash is  not accepted.  Worth booking on line in advance to avoid the long lines to get in.",
          "I didn't go in myself. But my wife did and said it was amazing. 250 sek to get in but if you are an ABBA fan it is a must . You can sing and dance with holograms of the band on a stage. Get there early for maximum fun. By 1pm its busy.",
          "I have a better understanding of the history of the group.",
          "The museum is very good for people that feel emotionally connected to ABBA and its history. It has several interactive attractions such as recording your own audition in a karaoke like fashion, taking your photo as one of the ABBA members \u2026",
          "a very unique museum. so many things to learn in a fun way. 10/10 recommend",
          "Oh it was an absolute delight ! The museum has so so very many things ..their original and a few originals recreated...stuff... I was  totally impressed  !! One could be on stage swinging with ABBA... Or sing karaoke... Sit in the car they \u2026",
          "I'm not into ABBA, but this was an interesting museum and it was enjoyable to learn and interact with the exhibits.",
          "Lots of fun and very interactive!",
          "A great insight into one of the world\u2019s favourite bands, from their humble beginnings to their stardom. Biographies of each band member, costumes and records, together with sets and props from Mama Mia... You can listen to an audible \u2026",
          "So much bigger than I expected. Great Mamma Mia (movies) section as you enter. Lots of information and pieces of history. Loved it.",
          "Very expensive admission. Nothing special to see. To us, it was a waste of money, even though we love ABBA.",
          "We had fun and enjoyed our tour, walking in, singing along and dancing out.",
          "Awesome museum! Great interactive displays! Plan to spend 1.5 to 3 hours to completely do and see everything! Well worth the price!",
          "Amazing, lots of info on displays, videos, movies, the studio, gold discs,etc, etc. Also interactive experience ( you can dance, sing, take photos or ask quizs, just to name a few)I spent there 2 hours and I would have spent another 2h!",
          "Great ABBA experience. I was born in the 70's and I loved it, my daughter in 2000's and she enjoyed it a lot as well. Worth visiting.",
          "It was an interesting one since ABBA was one of important parts of my life.\nIt was combined with Mamamia movie and high tech such as hologram n other interesting techniques. Some of Swedish museum is not that  attractive to compared with \u2026",
          "Fun place with some neat interactive sets, but I realized that although I grew up in the ABBA era, I really didn't know all of their songs.  Thus, it wasn't as entertaining and fulfilling as we originally expecting.  Oh well...  nicely put together though!",
          "Wonderful museum filled with tons of stuff. There's a trove of outfits, props, a recording studio, and albums to look at. But, there's also phone booth-style areas to record yourself signing along with the band and a stage where you can do \u2026",
          "How fun!  I used to watch my sisters practice their dance moves to Dancing Queen.  Good to hear their story.",
          "The best experience for any ABBA fan, the museum is interactive and there is so much fun to be had",
          "Brillant fun and you can record yourself sing. But some issues with their online app to hear those recordings. Have  sent them email.on issue so will update once replied.",
          "It is a cool place to visit.They have many interactive fun activities. I enjoyed it very much.",
          "It was a good experience",
          "Recommended specially for ABBA fans and music lovers. In here you can enjoy the ABBA songs and know many things about this famous group",
          "The museum is quite expensive but absolutely worth it! There is a lot to see but also a lot to do which was so much fun! There's karaoke and dancing and mixing your own music and some other stuff but you will have to go yourself to find \u2026",
          "Excellent,informative exhibition about the band including the members' post ABBA career. A good place to put yourself ibto a sunger's shoes.",
          "Completely underwhelmed by my experience. At 250SEK it was way overpriced. I found that it was full of reading material that I could have read online for free. As for the displays, there were a lot of mock ups and not the real deal. If you \u2026",
          "It was an interesting experience, however, I would recommend visiting this museum only once:) A bit too expensive. Still, I love amusements there which are unique, to my mind. I\u2019ve never seen such before. Thanks for welcoming me!:)",
          "Loved it. ABBA fans should definitely not miss it. The fun factor is huge due to activities and games all around your favourite band! ;)",
          "I must say that for this price, I was quite disappointed. Rather small, filled with history of ABBA members, but nothing that cannot be found on the Internet. Definitely do not go on your own. If you want to enjoy it, take a group of crazy friends who are not afraid to sing and behave in a silly way, or else you will waste your time.",
          "An amazing visit for all the family. Highly recommend going, we had quite a laugh and also sang a bit too.",
          "Okay, but a bit disappointing.\nGiven the 250SEK plus more for audio, we expected more. The museum is good as far as it goes, but a bit on the small side giving the status ABBA has internationally. The history of their records, albums, tours wasnt  really covered. The group members individual projects post ABBA had greater billing...",
          "It was such a fun experience, plenty of opportunities to interact with props and experiences - like dancing on stage! I had a great morning here. If you visited each exhibit - it I think you could cover everything in 3 hours. I highly recommend it!",
          "This is now one of my most favourite places in Stockholm. You dont have to be a massive fan of ABBA to enjoy this place! You will learn about their beginnings, the Eurovision win that propelled them to the stardom, and their projects post the split. A truly incredible place!",
          "ABBAMAZING!!  I am a huge fan and have all their songs and seen all their videos and documentaries. When I decided to travel from Toronto to Sweden for a conference, I decided to stay a few extra day to take in a cruise and, of course, \u2026",
          "Great info and great music and interactive activities. Liked it a lot :-)",
          "Place seemed too commercialized and not offered as a part of city card, otherwise good content.",
          "For those who are ABBA fans...really this place brings back memories of their hit songs.",
          "I was expecting a tiny museum  with memorabilia and not very exciting. I was wrong, it was an incredible experience. The whole family loved it, it's full of rock history from the 70's which makes for a fascinating read. There are many \u2026",
          "Sweet memories of my childhood with Abba",
          "Fantastic place whether you are am ABBA fan or not but beware no change accepted only cards",
          "Nicer than I expected. We were insite vor a long time.",
          "Great history of the band. Takes you pre band, band and post band. Lots of interactive displays.  Many real artifacts.  Super fun for everyone in our group. Only a few were ABBA fans before, but now we all are!",
          "Great not only for Abba fans. All about the artists, their innovative ideas, way of working, their networks and partners, and also the time after their 10 year career as a band. Great stage costumes to see, and amazing lifelike figures! Sweden at its best!",
          "Ouuu no words can describe!\nJust go and have fun!",
          "Absolutely fabulous. Can sing with hologram ABBA and read all about them. It is wonderful",
          "Very cool and interactive. Loved it.",
          "It's a must, one of my favourite places, it's amazing to have a tour with the voice of the real band. And the 3D thing is AMAZING!!!",
          "If you love ABBA you will have a lot of fun at the Abba Museum!! Recomended!",
          "Great museum and highly interactive. Learn the history of ABBA and original costumes from Momma Mia (the musical)",
          "Entertaining, good fun",
          "It is ok, but I  found it a little disappointing.",
          "A great experience for adults and kids alike.  Visitors walk through a highly interactive ABBA experience as they progress from room to room.  The more you interact with the experiences the more fun it is! Highly recommended.",
          "A must see story of the band that wrote a history in the world music.",
          "Ok but crowded and costly. Reserve at least an hour or two to really go into it. We did not have that much time. Lots of information and very well implemented. My daughter gives five stars but she is an ABBA fan ;)",
          "I give 5 star's because i like Abba, and they made a good job here, in the museum. You find so much information about this band, and many other people behind the scene, who work for the band Abba. In this museum, you feel like Abba live again.\nThe shop it is a little bit expensive, but for one time, it's okey.",
          "Insightful and worthwhile experience for any ABBA fan! Only downside were parts of the museum being awkward to navigate when crowded.",
          "Really nice. A lot of old memorabilia. Also much about Mama Mia. Not cheap. Several interactive parts (video, singing, dancing)",
          "Lots of emphasis on the Mamma Mia films. Some interactive elements weren't working but they were often a bit tenuous like a series of Wii games, (conduct Chess orchestra, superimposed your face on a cartoon Sprite etc.) The costumes and history of the group bits were excellent.",
          "Very nice to visit and experience the Abba story.",
          "Absolutely loved it!!! It was amazing, very detailed. There are so many different activities to do, which is worth the low ticket price (especially for students).",
          "A lot of info, fun things to try out. Pretty expensive. Well made and good use of technology.",
          "I love their music",
          "A lot bigger than I thought.  A looter of history and momma mia",
          "So much fun. It's interactive and worth the trip there.",
          "Not a big abba fan but really enjoyed it. Lots of fun interactive stuff to do.",
          "For ABBA lovers... Beautiful place with interesting stories \u263a\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
          "Very nice little museum. Buy onlinetickets & take also audioguide.",
          "A must do if you're a die-hard ABBA fan. It is indeed nice, but really pricey for what it is (~260 SEK) and the entrance ain't objectively worth that price. Inside you'll come across all sorts of memorabilia, with clear and detailed \u2026",
          "Yep, I went and it was a blast.  Sweden is so proud of the band and the exhibit was a lot of fun to view.  A lot of people spent a long time there whereas I went for nostalgia. It was nice to learn more about the band, see the wax figures, tons of gold records, and the interactive stage.",
          "Lovely fun activities. Would highly recommend going and doing everything!",
          "Really like this museum, have been there twice in the last year. It's very interactive (sing an ABBA song, dance on stage with their holograms) with good museum flow explaining the story of the ABBA band. \nOnly 4 stars since it is a bit small and compared to other museums slightly pricy. But totally worth it.",
          "Great place, lots of videos, and quite a few cool costumes. Goes into some detail on the whole band, as well as the music they played. Friendly, get tickets online.",
          "Daughter and I loved it. Interactive. Remember to keep your ticket with you so you can take full advantage of the interactive exhibits.",
          "The Abba museum is a fully interactive Abba experience that is definitely worth visiting when you're in Stockholm.\n\nYou can make your way round in 90 minutes to 180 minutes depending on how much you read or how much you get involved in.\n\nIt tells the story of before, during and after Abba and I learnt so much and had a wonderful time.",
          "Absolutely great.\nIt's a wonderful tribute to ABBA.\nAnd aside of this, is an enjoyable interactive museum.\nYou will dance, sing and discover curious and interesting details about ABBA history and its members.\nI'd like to repeat in the near future.",
          "This is definitely a location for ABBA extrodinare fans. There is so much history and interactive displays. You can sing on stage or in a booth.. so many interesting facts about the before, during, and afrer of ABBA. My father loved it! It was okay for me.",
          "Excellent museum with numerous static & engaging exhibits, all the album's fashions, including sets etc from Mama Mia. Takes 2 hours to get through & a must for any ABBA fan!",
          "Abba fans will love this place, full of memorabilia, their history and with the chance to be 'the fifth member' on a stage! I've been twice and will definitely go again!!",
          "If you are an ABBA fan then this is your Mecca!\n\nEverything you want yo see and know is located here under the one location \n\nEasy to get to by car or public transport this place has it all\n\nWhilst no prior booking is required I would \u2026",
          "Excellent couple of hours in there - sing with them, be in an ABBA hologram singing again - we walked in and danced out.",
          "Okay, I absolutely LOVED the ABBA museum. It has extensive exhibits, interactive parts, a really fantastic audio guide, so much to see and do, and even the gift shop is super well done. Definitely don't miss this one if you're in Stockholm!",
          "Very entertaining for the lovers of this group obviously, the museum does not have much to offer, but there are very fun activities like singing with the group",
          "Very nice place and friendly staff",
          "I say thank you for the visit and all the joy they're bringing. What would life be.... \ud83d\ude09",
          "It was great. I was just leaving high school in 1975 and their songs were hitting the tops of charts. They have a lot of memoriabelia both from 70's, 80's and the Momma Mia movies. Lots of their clothes and record awards. Lots of stuff from their earlier days before the began ABBA. The 3D Hologram Karoke was most amazing.",
          "Really interesting and detailed celebration of ABBA. Best approached with enthusiasm",
          "Whether you\u2019re a huge ABBA fan or not, you\u2019ll have a great time at this museum. It is very interactive, making it fun for all ages. The audio tour is given by the members of ABBA, which makes the museum experience feel so much more \u2026",
          "Great experience to see how your kid can sing and dance",
          "Great place where time just flies! \ud83e\udd70",
          "For any ABBA fan this is a must!! So nicely done with history and interactive things to do. Could recommend it!",
          "It's pretty nice place however some interactive stuff is not kept as it should be",
          "Swedish DNA - makes you happier!",
          "Who doesn't like ABBA? This museum is a must when in Stockholm. Enjoyed every minute of it. Bring your plastic, they do not accept cash - pretty much the norm in  Stockholm these days.",
          "Interactive and very comprehensive. You feel immersed in the story of the band and the life of each member including life after ABBA.\n\nThe audio tour is well worth it for the small extra fee (just do it you won't regret it!)",
          "I have enjoyed my time thier learning about the ABBA history. I could had the same experience from seeing a documenty. But I have enjoyed the interactive programs. The entrance fee is a little bit expensive for the experience.",
          "Really well organized and fun to participate in the dancing and singing activities! Really interactive loved it!",
          "Really great museum, even if you aren't an Abba fan (like me) its still really engaging if you pay attention. Gives a very good insight into their lives not only on stage but personally. There are a lot of interactive games/puzzles as well, which are fun even if they don't have anything to do with Abba specifically.",
          "Great place for ABBA lovers",
          "I like ABBA (I'm in my 50s) but this place is overpriced and a little disappointing. Some nice background info, but much of it is on Wikipedia. Interactive displays often didn't function (ticket scan malfunction, etc); many customers frustrated.",
          "Love the Place. Enjoyed,  Historic",
          "One of the best museum in Sweden. Highly recomended for all ABBA and Mamma Mia lovers!!",
          "small museum but fun for ABBA fans.",
          "Very nice museum",
          "A place full of beautiful memories. Priceless",
          "A really interactive museum where you\u2019ll learn about the history of ABBA (and what the members were up to after ABBA) in addition to the opportunity to conduct a song, sing along, and more. Overall, the museum was well done albeit expensive - more expensive than the Louvre and other incredible, world renowned museums.",
          "ABBA museum is very nice, interactive and somewhat melancholic. Very clever use of technology and recommend as one of things to do when in Stockholm. Book on line to avoid the queues.",
          "A lot more fun than I expected \ud83d\udc4d",
          "If you like Abba, you have to visit. Buy your ticket in advance and skip the long, long line outside! Tons of Abba memorabilia and very interactive - mix your own sing, audition for Abba - fun stuff to do. With I went there was a Mamma Mia \u2026",
          "So much fun and interesting history of the group.  Spent 2 hours there.",
          "The ABBA museum was an interactive experience through the lives and work of these fantastic four. You dance, sing, laugh and have a wonderful time. It is a must go place in Stockholm.",
          "You can't go to Stockholm without visiting this interactive museum. It's a fun place for all ages. You can sing along ABBA's popular songs, perform on a stage and record a music video amongst other activities. It takes around 1.5 hours to 2 hours to complete the visit.",
          "Amazing place. If you love Abba band you will definitly love this place.",
          "Not really what I thought it would have been, less entertaining and more \"serious\" if that makes sense. There's some fun stuff to do, actually, but less than what I expected. \nThe real problem is that it's sooooo expensive you could kind of \u2026",
          "The place was hopping. Had a great time. Take the guided tour and you'll get so much more out of it. Very interactive at times \ud83d\ude00",
          "Really extensive look at Abba in terms of the music, the characters involved and the total pop phenomenon. Also great to have interactive displays and exhibits. Expensive though, and gift shop prices eye wateringly high.",
          "The museum is interactive which means that you can take videos, be on stage, work on music and get this recorded and watch and listen later. All with an ABBA theme of course. There are also lots of photo opportunities. This is nice if you \u2026",
          "Way more fun than what I thought it would be!",
          "So much fun coming here. The interactive stuff was awesome!",
          "Amazing,just enjoyed every moment there,being an Abba fan.",
          "Even if your aren't a big fan it's interactive and fun, definitely worth a visit",
          "If you are in Stockholm, you really need to go to Abba Museum \ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f it's my second time here,  love it! You can sing on a stage, do quiz and the shop is amazing with great prices \ud83d\udc4c",
          "Unexpectedly a good experience! I expected it\u2019d be just about watching the exhibitions about ABBA or their history.. but not at all! I loved how the museum is designed for visitors to interact with the exhibitions. Well designed throughout. \u2026",
          "Really interesting and interactive, good for kids",
          "Fantastic place.  Interactive museum, one can have fun recording himself, performing on the stage with ABBA and more",
          "Loved it! Great experience and not over priced. Lots to do and fun to be had. Interactive and clean",
          "Everything you'd want to see and know!  \nWell! Whether you're already a fan or just curious about the ABBA phenomenon, the museum established on Djurg\u00e5rden island in Stockholm in 2013 has it all! And it's fun! I loved the way the whole \u2026",
          "Absolutely amazing! It's interactive and you really feel you're part of the story. Strongly recommended to visit if you are in Stockholm. It's best to buy online the tickets, so you will avoid the long queue :)",
          "Yo get what you expect : ABBA. It is a wonderful experience for any true fan. The only dissappointing issue is The Shop: the items they sell on line are not for sale in the Shop, so I made all the way from M\u00e1laga to find out I have to order on line.",
          "Loved everything about it! Interactive attractions are great fun. Very friendly and helpful staff. Recommend 100%",
          "I don't like ABBA and I enjoyed the visit very much. A lot of fun stuff to do there: you can sing and dance to the abba songs.",
          "great for ABBA fans.  lots of fun memorabilias.",
          "My brother who hardly even knew who Abba was and I who only really knew them from the songs in Mamma Mia both really loved the museum. The whole thing is very engaging and you can do karaoke and dance with hologram members of the band and \u2026",
          "Great way to kill a few hours. Lots of interactive things to do and loads of clothing and props from the early days. A must for any ABBA fan.",
          "A must visit when you are in Stockholm. A very busy place. Well worth money to hire the commentary ear piece",
          "SO GOOD, worth a trip completely!",
          "Stongly recommendet. Amazing museum, a lot of interesting pieces and activites.",
          "Absolute ust to visit for anny ABBA fan thoroughly enjoyed the visit and experience",
          "Visited today interesting but should be limited to number of people allowed in. \nWe had prepurchased tickets easy access.",
          "We had fun, but wanted a little more.",
          "Whether you are an ABBA fan or not you will smile when you listen to the music. Unfortunately it can get a bit crowded even out of season.",
          "Must see if you are a fan of ABBA, but needs to be a bit reorganized - the passages are very narrow so gets a bit crowded especially when there people standing and listening to the audio guides. By the way the audio guides are recorded by the members of the band themselves! Worth paying for.",
          "It awesome place. Maybe it's expensive but it's worth it. Why? It's super cool place, you can sing, dance. You can use a audio guide in your language. And if you finish you can buy a suvenires.",
          "Too crowded and overpriced.  Went there on a Tuesday before lunchtime, and it was packed to the point of being unenjoyable -- either you spend hours there to squeeze in between people to see things or you just rush through.  The \"exhibits\" \u2026",
          "Great museum for all ABBA fans. 2 floors of exhibits - newspaper clippings, magazines, tv footage, plenty of audio, gold and platinum discs, memorabilia and many other items including part of their original recording studio.\n\nThere us an \u2026",
          "Fun to hear the old hits but a bit too crowded when we were there",
          "Brilliant, not much they haven't got on show here!",
          "Well worth a visit brings one back in time loved it",
          "It was really cool you can see behind scenes and old concert videos that you can find on YouTube. Totally worth going it.",
          "Great museum if you are into ABBA but if not there is no point visiting",
          "A very informative museum about ABBA plus interactive and fun too. Very worth it.",
          "Nice place to learn about the history of ABBA and a good trip down memory lane\ud83d\ude00",
          "Very cute museum! Fast to visit and nice to be able to interact in different occasions. Like for example \"recording\" your own ABBA songs! Very fun and interesting! A very nice way to pay tribute to this amazing music group that changed the international music!",
          "Very nice interactive museum. Lot of activities plus awesome overview of Abba. Book tickets advance for seperate entrance. Walk in, dance out :)",
          "Quite expensive but had a good time overall, quite interactive exhibition. Maybe better experience for true fans.",
          "I'm not a huge fan of abba but my friend is. We both loved the interactivity of the museum and had a great time. The gift shop was moderately priced and had a wide range, the museum is also conveniently located and has a tram stop right outside",
          "Must See in Stockholm, better you buy an ticket online... a bit overpriced. Take time for  the nice shop.",
          "You can dance you can jive. It was a time of our lives",
          "In this era of manufactured pop groups, it was good to see the background that each member had before ABBA. The photograph and singing booth were  good fun but the results were poor. Overall, well worth the visit@",
          "Not big fan of ABBA, but enjoyed every moment. Especially interactive parts with singing. Place with good energy.",
          "Every ABBA fan should visit. Great artifacts, but a better narrative of the ABBA experience and history would have been appreciated.",
          "Worth it for a true ABBA fan. Not that interesting if you're not",
          "Fantastic museum showcasing ABBA. Great info and a lot of fun interactive exhibits! Definitely worth your time if you enjoy ABBA's music",
          "It\u2019s expensive but in the end you end up enjoying yourself so much that you forget how much you paid. There is loads of info about the band, before, during and after, there are games to play, sing, dance... You can even get recorded if you \u2026",
          "Brilliant if you get a chance get the ferry and go",
          "To crowded and the place is to small for all of the exhibitions they have shoehorned in to the place. Would have been nice, if there was more space between each of the exhibitions.",
          "If you love ABBA you MUST go.",
          "2hours of my life that was spent having incredibly amounts of fun. I went to the ABBA museum by myself and enjoyed every moment of it. It's a very interactive museum, you can feel like a real ABBA star yourself. Obviously it helps of you're \u2026",
          "Wonderful experience I loved the museum. To avoid queueing buy ticket online.",
          "Too crowded to be thuroughly enjoyed. Otherwise it can be quite interesting!",

          "Incredible, fun, interactive, loved the homage to the Mamma Mia! movies",
          "I only went there because the Teenage Engineering page said they sell their products there. But it was old news and they actually don't. The store is fine if you like Abba I guess.",
          "Honestly I was afraid this was going to be gimmicky. I was so wrong. This is wonderful!!  I was on a business trip so I went by myself and had a blast and learned a thing or two as well. It is fun interactive and uses many different ways to \u2026",
          "One of the best museum experiences in the world",
          "Must-go place for music lovers. Not into ABBA personally. However my kids enjoyed singing along to evergreens, watching short concert movies.",
          "Many activities, which are really entertaining. Felt like the 5th member of ABBA.",
          "Well done museum, worth the visit!",
          "It was so cool place! Totally awesome \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\u2764\ufe0f",
          "Great if you are an ABBA fan. If you are not... what are you doing reading an ABBA museum review???",
          "Very good, but too many people let in at once making it hard to see & hear everything on the device given to you for the tour",
          "Very interesting place with  Interactive activities. Reserve 3 hours for the tour and enjoy singing and dancing and taking the photos.",
          "So much to see and there are lots of interactive activities! Great for all ages and a truly incredible experience! You have the chance to sing and dance on stage, make a mini music video, \u201caudition\u201d to be the 5th member. \nWell worth the money.\nCan\u2019t recommend it enough.",
          "A great place to see, what was the real music when I was young. I do remember ABBA forever \u2764\ufe0f",
          "I\u00b4ve been to many museums around the world. I\u00b4ve also been to the Beatles Museum in the Docks of Liverpool, but people, the ABBA museum is the most fun museum of all. The ticket says \"Walk in, dance out\", well it\u00b4s absolutely true. Full of \u2026",
          "Must visit this place if you like the ABBA and the music of those times. Really nice was an option to sing with ABBA and you can download the recording later on. That sure was fun.",
          "Loved it. Must see for ABBA fans.",
          "You love music? You love ABBA? Than this museum is a devinitive must. \n\nIt is a bit like a time machine back to the 70s/80s, made with a lot of love and passion.\n\nA lot to see you haven't seen before and plenty of stuff to participate (Karaoke, wohoo).\n\nHave fun :-)",
          "It's a super, very well-assembled museum. It gives an insight into the band's life outside of the stage, with a wealth of interactive music, their dresses and suitcases. I was listening to the Abba 2 months later on a plane :) The generation who has lived in the '70s and loved the Abba band is compulsory.",
          "Amazing! If you like abba and dancing/singing, this will probably be the most fun you will have in Stockholm. Indeed pricey but well worth it!",
          "Excelent museum fir the fans of ABBA  and 70's and 80's music lovers",
          "If you love Abba....you definitely have to go here",
          "Worth going to if you enjoyed ABBA in the past. Very well done. We caught the tram there and it stops directly outside the museum. We hired the audio and that gave us additional information in addition to the displays. You should allocate 2 hours easily.",
          "Loved the interactive displays. Really enjoyed our visit.",
          "The museum spans the 2 basement levels. First section is dedicated to the Mamma Mia movie, then to ABBA. We got the audio guide but that went on too long and we gave up listening after the 6th clip (each clip is 5 to 10 minutes long).  Best \u2026",
          "Wouldn't go to this. Saw the prices and skipped it. This should be free if its so important to Swedish culture. Instead it looked like somebody converted a hotel to make a few bob. Just go to Grona Lund or the Vasa instead. This couldn't be worth it. Money making rubbish.",
          "You love it. Also for those 3 people whom do not know their music",
          "Learned a lot of the individual members, but was expecting to see and hear more of the group. Especially their music. A bit disappointing for me",
          "We love this place!If you love Abba you will live this palce.So great idea\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Nice place for ABBA Fans!",
          "It was my second visit to the ABBA Museum. I had an amazing time and could revive a time that\u2019s no longer there. It\u2019s truly worth a visit!!!",
          "Simply fantastic.  Well done",
          "Was not enthousiastic to visit, thinking it was only to take tourists' money: ok, but interactivity makes the visit interesting and funny",
          "I'm not even a huge ABBA fan and still think the museum is a must do in Stockholm... what a fun place to be...\nNot only does it showcase Sweden's most famous band, but it is also very engaging and interactive and an overall fun place to \u2026",
          "Definitely worth seeing, the audio guided tour takes about 1,5h. There are also some interactive features such as karaoke or mixing music.",
          "Brings back all the magic of Abba",
          "I was a little sceptical but my teenage daughter and I loved it",
          "Indeed a nice experience. Be prepared with some lyrics for a karaoke",
          "This museum made me an Abba fan. Was great to learn about their music and their story. Was hugely interactive and lots of fun. Also showed a lot about what Abba did after they stopped singing together, which was very interesting. What was \u2026",
          "Great place to visit with family. Lots of information and fun activities. Small museum however quite a bit packed into it. Visited with my family including two teenage daughters who thoroughly enjoyed the experience, we did not realize that we spent close to three hours at the museum. Super if you are an ABBA fan.",
          "Was pretty intense. Only come if you worship ABBA. A lot of passion put into the museum though, well organised",
          "Excellent. Leave plenty of time to look around as there is so much to see.",
          "Definitely a must see, the museum will have you dancing out and the activities are real nice.",
          "Very nice, was fun to relive the ABBA history. Am so old that i can remember their eurovision win.",
          "Get the audio walking tour. Totally worth it. Take a chance on me.",
          "The museum is much bigger than it might seem from the outside, because it's mostly inside a basement. It has some interactive entertainment, like singing karaoke in a booth.\nNotable mention: I have seen many wax figures before, but the figures of the band displayed here just blew my mind.",
          "Very Interesting experience. Do it it was brilliant.",
          "A much more entertaing museum than expected. Am enjoyable blast from the past.",
          "So fun you could do activaties",
          "Came here more for my parents than for me; but it was a great laugh. Very interactive, and I'm sure much more interesting for true ABBA fans!",
          "The official Abba museum. On this location there is Also a hotel, cafe/restaurant and souvenir Shop. A must See place if you are a Abba fan. All costumes are original and almost Everything there is from that they used.   My wife loved this place.",
          "Dont even know this group. Too expensive prices",
          "It's nice that it has a lot of interactivity. I can't really say that I'm a real fan of ABBA, but I could enjoy it anyway.",
          "Walk in. Dancing out. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Super interactive!! Awesome experience!",
          "Kind of expensive but still a nice option in Stockholm",
          "Not quite your average tourist trap... It has some interesting and (extremely) interactive features such as the option to perform 'live' on stage with ABBA in 3D.",
          "Too expensive for what it offers in any opinion. Go there if you are die hard ABBA fan",
          "A trip down memory lane. Awsome!",
          "Hi me and me and my family didnt  \nget to see abba museum because no cash accepting it was our dream",
          "Must go. Fun place. Needs at least 2,5 hours (minimum). Gift store is a MUST. Gifts are clever. You can sing and dance along with ABBA's holograms. Long line after lunch.",
          "Great museum",
          "Lidicrously expensive, feeds you fan content, but not much of what you can't find online.",
          "Amazing. Better than the Beatles museum",
          "It's Nice a bit too expensive though",
          "Much better than expected... good fun if you interact wirh sing alongs and games and get the audio devices also",
          "I went there in the middle of summer, so it was quite full but not as much that you wouldn't be able to move or anything. The staff was super nice and the interactive games were so much fun too! When your English is good, you also don't need an audio guide, since there is enough information to read.",
          "It really a magic. Highly recommended \ud83d\udc4d",
          "The Abba museum was awesome!\nThere were lots of cool exhibits and you could sing and dance up onstage!\n\nThe gift shop was a bit expensive,\nBut the rest was fine.\n\nAlso the staff is really friendly!\ud83d\ude00\n\nI loved my visit and recommend that you go there too! I\u2764Abba the museum!",
          "A really good place if you want to know almost everything about ABBA",
          "If you are ABBA's fans then is a must visit Many fancy clothings",
          "This was maybe the highlight of our trip to Sweden. Best breakfast I've ever had, museum and its intrerior was beautifully made, the room with all the old guitars was breathtaking and the actual Abba museum paid tribute very well. The \u2026",
          "Really fun experience, very well designed and detailed display... But the best are the interactive experiences!",
          "Good interesting place, but expensive. The most expensive museum I've ever been (almost 25 Euro and audio guide is 2 more)",
          "Worth a visit if you are around!",
          "If you like Abba, this museum is a must in Stockholm!",
          "Water leakage during morning made a lot of people come in the afternoon all at the same time and they were still selling tickets during afternoon. Half of the museum was closed until 1h later after was open, so we were not able to see \u2026",
          "One of the better museums I have been in, the story part was great",
          "I\u2019m not a huge fan of ABBA like my parents are but I really enjoyed his museum. The guitar collection at the beginning was fantastic for those of us who are more rock fans with guitars owned and signed by some of the masters of all time. \u2026",
          "Excellent day out. Very interactive, lots of fun",
          "Fun but quite expensive.",
          "Excellent displays well shown and easy to walk around the museum.",
          "The best museum ever! Worth every penny, and great student discount too",
          "More Abba than museum. Attempts to entertain you with options to sing, to dance, to listen to short stories about Abba. Good for 75 to 90 minutes tour. Easily accessible by tram from Stockholm sentral station.",
          "Fantastic day also got the audio guide which was good if a little long winded in places loved the stage as well",
          "Staying in the Pop House hotel would highly recommend both",
          "One of the best museums I've ever been at. So interactive, so fun, so heart-warming (if you are an ABBA fan). Great job, Sweden!",
          "If you like ABBA, you'll have a good time. If you're an ABBA fan, you'll LOVE this museum!",
          "My wife loved it!!!",
          "Good museum. Definitely one of the more interesting ones. There's interactive parts of the tour which is good. Staff were friendly. The shop at the end is filled with all the ABBA stock you could ever imagine.",
          "Interesting information, a bit disappointing on souvenirs. Interactive spots were rather crowded.",
          "Great museum experience for me! Love the audio with their own voices telling their stories. Avoid the long lines and buy your tickets online.",
          "Love it or loathe it - there is no middle ground! Does an excellent job of providing a rounded story of the band pre, during and post-ABBA.",
          "I love everything about ABBA. As simple as that!",
          "It's a wonderful place and lots of things to see and take part in. We were there as part of an organised group. I felt we needed a little longer to appreciate everything. Also a few people in the group would have liked more time in the shop. However, we all loved the experience.",
          "The Museum is located on the island of Djurg\u00e5rden. Opened in May 2013, it displays everything and anything ABBA. \nThe museum collections includes outfits worn by the group including their boots, Musical instruments, posters, recording \u2026",
          "It was ok. It is a small museum in a basement and attracts a large crowd so makes it quite cramped. If you are an Abba fan I am sure you will love it. I was Abba'd out about half way round though!",
          "Beautiful museum with nice musical experience and lots of great information about Abba! Highly recommended for everyone!",
          "Amazing place!!! Had such a nice time. Entrance fee is 250 SEK. Audioguide is recorded with help of ABBA members, so cool to listen to their voices. And activities there is beyond something. Karaoke booth, being a member of the group is the \u2026",
          "It was fun. Some of the interactive stuff could use an update as it looked a bit off and not very realistic",
          "A must if you've been touched by ABBA's music it's full of costumes and interactive games where you can sing along to the hits and feel like a member of ABBA. Highly recommended.",
          "It's Abba. It rocks, and its fun to explore. Be sure to get the audio guide. The audio guide makes it even better. This museum is rich in media and experiences. Very original exhibit. Give yourself a few hours here.",
          "Fun and interactive museum but at around 23\u20ac a ticket it's pretty expensive for what it is",
          "This place is so much overrated. The price for entrance is crazy - like 25\u20ac. This museum is only about this band and there is nothing more to do. In case you just wanna have fun - you can go, but I think there is a lot of better places to visit in Stockholm.",
          "If you're an ABBA fan, this is the place to be! Brings back joyous and fond memories of your teenage years and leaves you feeling nostalgic.",
          "Better than expected, a LOT of information provided by ABBA themselves. Well worth a visit",
          "Must see if you like ABBA songs.",
          "Because you just have to!",
          "This was a very fun place to visit! There are a lot of interactive attractions and the staff was very friendly!",
          "Excellent if you like ABBA, great if you do not.",
          "Great fun.",
          "I thought the 250 SEK price a little bit expensive but it's actually a good price for what you get. It's a bit of a tardis. You just keep going deeper. The staff couldn't be more helpful and enthusiastic.",
          "Overall great! My parents loved it! People who have gowned up up with their music will love it. I, personally,  liked it but did not felt so enthusiastic as the older generation. It was fun to get to know the stars behind the big name ABBA, \u2026",
          "I loved it!",
          "Klasse. Come in and dance out!",
          "Nice place for abba fans. Doesnt look like much when you enter but the whole basement is full of abba stuff..",
          "Very nice and priceworthy museum, one of the best features is the ability to save your activities in the museum attractions and then look back at them at home using your ticket!",
          "Highly enjoyable with lots of original items and videos from ABBA. Plan on 2 to 3 hours!",
          "Excellent fun...well worth it...Check out abba party at night time show..",
          "Very busy but enjoyable. A must to visit",
          "If you are in Stockholm near the Abba Museum it is worth a look.  The costumes and history of the group is presented.  If you are an Abba fan it is a must see.  If not an Abba it is still interesting and worth visiting.",
          "Fantastic museum. well organised, super exhibition with a very good audio guide.",
          "Whether you are an ABBA fan or not, this museum is one of the best museums to visit in Stockholm.  We allowed 2 hours for the visit, realistically you need a day. If you're a fan you might need even more. Entertaining, fact filled and interactive. Recommended.",
          "It was so much fun. Melancholy magic. I never thought I'd be in Sweden, much less the ABBA museum. The costumes are stunning in person. Enjoy it!",
          "Go, go, go! For an Australian, this is virtually a pilgrimage",
          "We did not go in.",
          "Good fun, very interactive.",
          "So much fun!!! Interesting and very entertaining.",
          "A very interesting experience that provided tons of information. The current guitar exhibition was also really good. It made me rediscover some of the music that ABBA created and gave you an insight not only in how it came to be but also in \u2026",
          "Not as big as expected, but you can easily spend hours inside. Many great things to do, like dance and sing or take a picture with the ABBAs. Great information and the audiotour was terrific (at least the Dutch one with the voice of Kees \u2026",
          "Really good museum",
          "Great.  However there was so much packed into a comparatively small space",
          "Disaster of a museum. Cramped, no flow to exhibition. Entrance and exit are the same. Have to struggle past incoming guests to get out. A rip off at 250kr compared to 150kr Vasa museum experience.",
          "Great museum. Horrible staff. Very rude at the shop. The shop closes at the same time as the museum. I wanted to Max my time at the museum itself and figured I'd buy something after. I was at the shop at 7 exactly and they rudely told me to go away because it was closed.",
          "Great museum, especially if you love ABBA. They somehow managed to put the Icelandic flag on a picture from Norway, which was strange.",
          "So many interactive things to enjoy.",
          "I don't know much about ABBA so hard to ruminate memory about them but also would like to recommend this place for people share the same age with those musicians +fans if Mamma Mia(Meryl Stripps especially)",
          "We went using P&O crusing ABBA tour, the coach & guide was great but parking was a pain due to some even the 80's singer Sting was appearing, so we trekked through the crowds. The guide did our passes and handed us what looked like a surf \u2026",
          "MUST to see with your own eyes,  ABBA !",
          "Soooo Awsome",
          "So nice and funny museum",
          "A must do, if you like even a single ABBA song. It's a lot of fun and you can't help but find yourself humming away as you look around.",
          "Great place, Very fun with lots to do. Buy  your ticket as an add on to the Hop on Hop off bus and boat the discount is worth while. Enjoyed the museum very much.",
          "A must-see for any ABBA fan.",
          "Amazing interactive museum. Complete collection of the band from start to end. If you don't like Abba music then still fun to visit. Must visit when you come to Stockholm.",
          "Awesome cheesy fun! Go with friends and participate and you'll get some great photo ops! Does not take very long to go through it, but you could spend more time if you read every single thing. Warning: You WILL have Dancing Queen stuck in your head for 3 days after.",
          "Very hot as in a cellar, found the signage very poor and seemed to lack staff as you went around. But a must do even for me not an Abba fan.",
          "Mamma Mia..teenage at 70's",
          "GREAT,just and simply GREAT...a throw back when I was child, a fun for everyone \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Abba surprisingly enthusiastic review suddenly emerged from my head after visiting the museum of ABBA. It was fun.",
          "Very interesting, but a bit pricey to get in - $25",
          "If you like ABBA it's the place to go!",
          "Not such an Abba fan, but I really enjoyed the museum. Fun and interesting. Great collection of guitars, too, belonging to all sorts of great guitarists, such as BB King, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Hendrix",
          "It s nice but I espected more music",
          "I had fun in the museum, there are interactive exhibits so it's not just walking around and looking; plenty of media installations. I learned a lot about their lives, and it was especially interesting to look into post-ABBA years. As a dressmaker, I especially enjoyed seeing the costumes up close.",
          "This place was incredible fun and absolute laugh I would highly recommend it it\u2019s a bit costly though but it\u2019s really good fun absolutely hilariously fun",
          "Good Museum, but very overcrowded and hot in there. No aircon, and a fire hazzard I'm sure",
          "Oh ABBA, what a great museum, at first I thought it was just going to be the guitars of famous musicians but luckily that was just a preview of other things at the museum. One thing I will say is that it is card only, apparently they do not \u2026",
          "We were told it would take a hour and half to complete the tour but we spent three hour's there. It was \u20ac30 Well sent .It also has a restaurant and bar where we got a bit to eat and was only fabulous",
          "Awesome interaktive tests and games. Nice venue and easy to find. A lot of knowledce simply got",
          "A must visit for all Abba fans or even not !\nIt's a travel back in time of the world of golden records and stage life , costumes and glamour and outstanding success !\nYou can enjoy singing and being on stage , guess and play games all around Abba,  its fun and interactive . \nFind out what you know about Abba and have fun !",
          "Good but very busy even at 1800 hrs !!",
          "If you are an ABBA fan, this is the place to be. There is something for everyone and of all ages: Whether  singing, dancing, studio production or choreography are your fortes then you will find it all there for your enjoyment. \n\nThis museum \u2026",
          "Going back in time .... great nostalgia",
          "If you miss them... Go there",
          "Lots of history and side ventures like the musicals as well as ABBA through the years",
          "I was lucky to have seen the Queen Silvia, the \"dancing queen\" in the museum. The museum is definitely a great fun and full of memorabilia. It's a must visit place!",
          "It's lovely. I liked interactive things a lot :) Recommend everybody who loves fun and ABBA!",
          "A must for ABBA fans, and also for those who are fans of Gibson and Fender guitars as there's a section at the start of the museum dedicated to them. Everything is covered here from humble beginnings to the current and beyond. Interactive \u2026",
          "V good",
          "Entrance fee is 250 krona per head. Consider quite expensive as the scale of the museum is not big.  Instead, we went to the gift shop next door.  Products and not a lot so as the CDs.  We didn't buy anything even though my husband is a fan of ABBA.",
          "Whether you are a dancing queen, closet queen, or just a queen, you will love this museum. Ignore the negative reviews. There are some very personal and emotional accounts from the ABBA quartet, detailing their experiences in the non-stop ABBA juggernaut that took place in the 70\u2019s. If you are visiting Stockholm, this is a must see!",
          "Great interactive museum with information for all kinds of visitors, from new Abba lovers to real fans. 100% fun and learn... perfect combination!",
          "Great... Give 2 hours to see it all",
          "Great mmusicians. Great Museum.",

          "Amazing place. We had a lot of fun \ud83e\udd70",
          "Takes you back in time. Recommended",
          "Even for non-ABBA fans a visit is worthwile. Just watching the diehard fans made my day.",
          "Worth it! I really had a great time dancing and singing and afterwards watching how bad I did it.\nDancing queen! :)",
          "Loved it. Thank you for the music. Need 2-3 hours easy to do your visit justice. Loved being chosen as the fifth member \ud83d\ude01",
          "May be a little bit too pricy, but a good trip 5o the history of ABBA",
          "ABBA-solutely with it. I had my doubts but walked out signing any and every ABBA song I knew! Lots of media footage, the interactive features were fun, and all together very informative.  \u201cThank for the music\u201d",
          "Prepare yourself for 2(ish) hours of ABBA fun. Very detailed accounts, wonderful costumes and the interactive sections of the museum are amazing. I would encourage anyone attending to muster up the courage to get on stage and sing as part \u2026",
          "Very expensiv ticket",
          "So nice a d also you can see the style of that band and songs",
          "For all Abba fans ... enjoy",
          "I,'d rather not comment!",
          "High entrance price but worth it. If you are a real ABBA fan then this is a must see.  Funny interactives and a lot of information.",
          "Very interesting place, bit too much to see for one visit. Many of the technical gadgets didn't work which was very disappointing and spent lot of time with things not working. For the price would expect more quality. Even with the problems, can recommend this as one of the top sights in Stockholm.",
          "Very nice place. You have to visit it.",
          "Close to the amusement park and a nice ferry ride to get here.  Only of real interest to Abba fans but well worth a visit if you are one of the millions who appreciate their music",
          "Quite cool and interactive museum. The mamma mia exhibition is nothing special.\n\nBut it\u2019s quite expensive (250sek).\nWhen i was there there was a water leak, and i think the situation was poorly handled by the staff. It ruined completely the \u2026",
          "The entry fee is 250 Kronors. Felt a little expensive considering the The Abba Museum had mostly Mamma Mia memorablia , and Songs videos of the group and records on the hall. Was expecting some memorablia which the group has used but did not find any.\nIf you visit the Mamma Mia movie costumes are worth seeing as it is very gorgeous.",
          "A fun museum and really interactive museum. You not only learn about the history of ABBA, you can also dance with ABBA, do quizzes about ABBA and karaoke sing ABBA songs! It's recommended to purchase your tickets online so you can skip the enormous que.",
          "Amazing place, we spent great time there",
          "Intresting and more info for ABBA",
          "You should definitely get the audio guide ( in English to hear ABBA themselves)",
          "It was okay but very expensive for what it is.",
          "We loved the museum. Was a bit small but we still enjoyed the \"classics\" and interactive games.",
          "I wouldn't recommend this to someone who isn't at least somewhat interested in modern pop culture history, but almost. There is a wealth of fantastic exhibits at this museum detailing the group's career and the impact they had on contemporary music and culture. Excellent!",
          "Excellent. Contains all things ABBA, Lovely interactive activities.",
          "Super! One of the best museum of the world!",
          "Over than 5 stars....4 hours big Party",
          "Abba entusiuasts, this is the place!! And for all others that want to have a good experience to get to know the band better. There is a lot of interactive activeties to do. Try your bedt to sing, dance and pose like the stars themselves. \u2026",
          "ABBA Museum. Take a chance on this! It\u2019s actually a quite cool place. If you are an ABBA fan, your set. But if you also have a taste of Swedish music and even television, the cellar have a surprice for you. This is a MUST when visiting Stockholm as a tourist. Especially if you have your Britney Spears kids with you. \uf04a",
          "I grew up listening to ABBA because of my parents and I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this museum! They have several fun interactive activities to keep you entertained and your ticket gains online access to those things for 30 days. It also \u2026",
          "Fantastic definitely worth a vsit",
          "The cost of this museum is quite high, however, the experience is worth a lot!, I recommend you to go if you visit Stockholm",
          "Great to follow the story of Sweden's famous band",
          "Well worth visiting. Far larger than it looks on the outside.",
          "Really not too tacky at all. Despite some reservations at being taken long by my better half, I enjoyed it and it was a great reminder of the music of my earlier years.  Well worth the visit if you're in Stockholm",
          "What a hoot. Who knew ABBA had done such a great body of work. The interactive parts where a great laugh. Who doesn't want to join in dancing to Dancing Queen. Well probably not me.",
          "Amazing history of an amazing music group!",
          "Funny place for all!",
          "If you like ABBA, this museum is a must!",
          "Loved it! Exceptionally well done."

          "Great exposition! Well made, makes you re-think certain things in life. Would definitely recommend to go.",
          "The museum contains several themed exhibits which rotate so you should be able to find one or two of interest. The museum is well laid out and lighting is very good. Not sure if it was permitted but some people were taking pictures of the display photographs and no-body seemed",
          "A great photography experience, it was a calming yet somewhat thoughtful-provoking part of my day in Stockholm. Was a pleasant surprise to come across Mandy Barker\u2019s plastic soups.",
          "This was one of the best photo-exhibition that I have seen in my life. The main theme of burned animal, really presided of what have happened two months later in Australia. I think that the location in Sodemalem in the general atmosphere really contributed to the general",
          "Very interesting museum except that there was a lot of construction to get there, had to walk quite a distance from the hop on hop off bus and it was raining heavily. Worth the visit and you should go and return by boat not bus.",
          "The location of the Fotografiska museum is the best. Take some pictures from the cafeteria, cafeteria quality is very poor but if you buy just a coffe and enjoy the view it's worth it! and the museum itself will depend if who is exposing, they change often but quality is always",
          "Two of the four temporary exibitions were photoshoped... Interesting but not my scene. I rather have more photos and ate least some mention to Hasselblad...",
          "This museum changes enough that we did not know what we were going to see before we arrived. We loved that one of the featured photographers was Scandinavian. We also enjoyed the interactive parts of the exhibit we included short films and videos.",
          "The major Slussen construction annoyance and entrance fee put Fotografiska further down on the must-do list. So glad we made it! It far outshone any expectations and turned out to be a great value. When your eyes have had enough, head up to the rooftop restaurant and bar. Sit",
          "... or you do not have a specific interest in photography. It was nice, but not a must-see. It could be more or less interesting depending on the current exhibitions. The walk there from Gamla Stan and the sidewalk near the see is awesome. Also, the coffee trows tables and seats",
          "The exhibitions are very interesting. We especially like the Erik Johansson Places Beyond and, Hassan Hajjaj the Arab Issue. We had the 3-course lunch in the restaurant and we just love it. Service is good and attentive. The view is beautiful and the atmosphere is good.",
          "Very cool and thoughtfully curated \u2014 I went with my husband and a friend, neither of which are particularly interested in photography, and we all had a great time and stayed much longer than we expected because there was so much to see. Absolutely worth a visit.",
          "This is a great place to see very interesting photos and have a drink or eat something in front of an amazing view.",
          "Fotografiska is open until 11pm during the week, so we decided to give this a try one night and we weren\u2019t disappointed. The exhibitions were all amazing. Don\u2019t miss it!",
          "Beautiful views from the cafe and some great photos to look at too. Well worth a visit. Roadworks going on when we went caused a slight diversion.",
          "Modern, and interactive. Don't forget to have your phone charged! New exhibitions every couple of months. Also, don't skip the restaurant! Great plantbased food (meat can be included for an additional fee)",
          "It was not an easy place to get to while walking but it was definitely worthwhile. Many photographers with a variety of topics.",
          "If you love art and photography then you will love it here! Really great exhibitions and very nice setup. Museum has a restaurant, a bar and a big shop with many art books, games and many other items.",
          "Saw a mind blowing show on plastics and ocean pollution and another on conflict photography. Both were raw and powerful.",
          "3 generations of us all enjoyed going to this Gallery which had a good range of very different photographic exhibits. Beautifully composed black and white photos, surrealist and filmic posed pictures and people of the world in disappearing cultures",
          "First of all, if you're a tourist walk til the museum, so you'll enjoy the harbour and some city views. The price is quite similar to other prices in Stockholm, not cheap but worthy if you like what you're going to see. I went there for the Erik Johannson exhibition and I liked",
          "I'm sure the Fotografiska stop varies depending on who's art they've got on-show, but it was a wonderful place to spend the morning!",
          "Fotografiska is about 10 min walk from the metro station, there are banners and sights which navigates you easily. I really appreciate long opening hours, up to 1am. There is a great caf\u00e9 and bar with cocktails and chilling zone. Exhibitions are fascinating, there also are",
          "This is my favourite museum in Stockholm, I try to go at least twice a year. There are always really cool exhibitions, and the view from the cafe is stunning. The entry is slightly pricy, however it is worth it! They also do student discount. In the summer there is a nice bar",
          "Of course, it would be desirable for the price tag to be slightly lower. But besides prio one the artistic form of photo exhibitions you will find an excellent restaurant, shop with focus on quality and fine premises along the inner harbor in Stockholm.",
          "Fotografiska is a bit away from the city centre and you need to walk ca 800 meters from Slussen metro station but this is a must-visit place if you are interested in art. I have seen a number of great exhibitions of highly recognised photographers there (like David Lachapelle,",
          "This is a good museum, in a good location with some nice touches. It has some great views and a well above average restaurant and bar (Where you get reduced admission if you eat). It also opens late into the evening so you can be flexible with your visit. When we visited there",
          "Erik Johansson\u2019s photo works was on when I was there. I have no particular interest in photo but it was really amazing experience and I enjoyed it a lot. Other exhibitions there were also very interesting so there must be something nice all the time. You also have great view",

          "Really original and exiting museum of photography from classical to modern items. You can't even take your eyes from many pictures and step away for a long time, finding something mysterious and intimate. Everyone, who visits Stockholm should come to Fotografiska!",

          "A very nice museum, with very interesting and accessible expositions. At the time I visited, it was very crowded which made me feel a bit annoyed and uncomfortable. So my point of advice: don't visit during peak hours. Definitely don't forget to visit the restaurant, at the top",
          "We visited in December and there had been a mix up regarding a poster we wished to purchase. Ida was so kind and helpful offering to find the poster for us and ship it to our home country (the web shop doesn't ship internationally). We really appreciated this kindness. The shop",

The displays rotate, but the artists featured on our visit were all stunningly displayed, each being true to the",

          "A museum is only as good as its curation, but based on my experience, Fotografiska has that down. The exhibitions that I experienced here ranged from \"pleasing\" to \"I have to think about the world and my life for a moment please\". Obviously, James Nachtwey falls into the latter",

          "So many emotions raised by the exhibitions today. Initially I thought the \u201cconflict\u201d exhibition by James Nachtwey was so descriptive of modern day problems that this would be the most graphic as it covered the war in the Balkans, Afghanistan & Iraq, humanitarian crises around",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you are in the Sodermalm area. We saw two photo exhibits (I think one was temporary and the other permanent), which were very different from one another - one more journalistic and the other more creative - but both artistic and very well done. We",
          "I have visited Fotografiska several times over the past years and I've really enjoyed each temporary exhibition I've been to. I especially enjoy a cup of coffee or a glass of wine on the top floor. The view from up there is exceptional.",
          "Stunning exibitions, one of stockholms best locations and views and a above good restaurant - recipe for success. Its a must if in stockholm and have half a day to kill. Have friends who always take second dates here sundays - suits couples best, or families with older children.",
          "Fotografiska in Stockholm is a very interesting place, the picture show is really well done and the lights are fantastic. The landscape from the restaurant is wonderful. I will come back.",
          "I like this place out of most of the tourist attractions visited in Stockholm. Photos exhibited here tell stories & so does the photographers. A worthy place to spend a couple of hours in.",
          "Unfortunately we were on a time schedule and we got caught up in the massive construction project and ended up having to walk about a mile to get from the top of the cliff to the bottom. Definitely look into the best way to get there. The exhibits were fantastic. James",
          "Fotografiska will stay in our memories for a long time to come. It is an incredible, contemporary art museum. We saw three fantastic, moving exhibitions during our visit. The James Nachtwey and Mandy Barker exhibitions had us in tears. Go before they close. You will not regret",
          "The Fotografiska is a must-do when in Stockholm. First, the place itself and the location is great. You walk along the water, passing the cruise ship docks.. nice scenery. You can basically walk from the city and Gamla Stan. I was in July 2019 when they had a very interesting",
          "One of the best photographic museums in the world. Of course, as everything in Stockholm, it's a bit expensive. Still worth it, IMHO.",
          "A bit hard to get to due to massive road works in the area. Be sure to gr from Sussen station and walk along the water. The photographers on display for our visit were phenomenal. One covers conflicts and various human tragedies and fortunately that was set off by lighter and",
          "Dropped in here on recommendation of a local resident. Got there on the free hop on hop off sightseeing boat courtesy of the excellent Stockholm Pass. The exhibitions are particularly well curated. And there\u2019s a top quality restaurant on the top floor with excellent views across",
          "In addition to the powerful and moving exhibitions about plastic in the ocean and crimes agains humanity (gut wrenching) we had an amazing four course dinner at the restaurant. The museum was open until 1:00 am and we were there until closing.",
          "Mandy Baker\u2019s exhibit of articles from the sea was an eye opener. Loved all the exhibits but hers hit home. Also James Nachtwey\u2019s work was heartbreaking and moving Please go see this fabulous museum.",
          "Wonderful visit to Fotografiska. We took the tour boat and got off at the museum. Whilst my wife isn't as much of a fan of art as I am. It was an enjoyable time visiting the exhibits and marvelously presented. Great atmosphere and friendly staff.",
          "The photo-exhibitions are of high class but to be honest, their restaurant is even of a higher class. Make sure you have a dinner being there.",
          "I have been to this gallery before and with friends visiting from Singapore I thought u just bring them to this venue. We had a great viewing of all 3 floors and the exhibitions were either thought provoking or great photography. At the end we wandered upstairs and had a wine",
          "As I am interested in photography I took the chance to visit Fotografiska Stockholm - it is a little difficult to get to but you can use the hop on/off boat or local buses. Once there you can find a nice little cafe with great big picture windows if you fancy a snack. The",
          "A trip to Stockholm without visiting fotografiska is a wasted trip. The exhibitions vary, but I've always left, feeling an experience richer. Plus, they have a lovely caf\u00e9 and restaurant if you want to take it easy and recharge between exhibitions.",
          "Our last morning before flying home and we headed here from Slussen station. Very good indeed - several displays which are well presented and thought provoking - I have started following one photographer on Instagram as a result. Some can be a bit upsetting (war photography)",
          "Most interesting set of works in an interesting setting. Easy to reach and find right in the waterfront.",
          "A featured group of photos included the plastic polluting the oceans arranged as artistic images. Museum has nice restaurant, bakery on top level overlooking water. Very nice and extensive museum shop including posters and books of photographers.",
          "Immediately taken by the place, space and setting. Great exhibitions from worldfamous photographers. One of the places I enjoyed most during my visit. Restaurant looked very nice as well.",
          "I still cannot get this visit out of my mind. The exhibit about the horrors of war was both beautiful and heartbreaking. There was another about plastic in oceans that was informative, provocative, and told the real story. The building itself is quite handsome, the view from the",
          "If art and photography are what your into this is the stop for you. We check regularly if an exhibition we like is coming through then it is worth it. Some aren't but art is subjective. The fact that this is an option in Stockholm makes it something worth taking advantage of.",
          "It\u2019s a relatively small gallery and not all photos were to my taste but it was well organized with some interesting exhibits. It took me about an hour to walk through the gallery. There is a restaurant and a gift shop. The building is located near the cruise ship terminals",
          "For some of my friends Fotografiska was the only reason to visit Stockholm. So I was sure I must see it during my stay in Stockholm. We visited Fotografiska at late night - about 11 p.m. and it was a great opportunity as there were just few visitors and we could completely enjoy",
          "On the ground floor, there is an exhibition on wars and violence. The exhibition is very big, but after the first 10 pictures - one more cruel then the other - I simply couldn't stand it anymore. And then We went upstairs. Nice but empty pictures. How could one put these",
          "Very impressive photographic work for art and photography lovers -not to be missed. moderate walk from gamla stan.",
          "We caught the huge display of James Nachtwey's images at the end of June, 2019. If you go now you can expect to see a huge display of scathingly brilliant photographs from a lifetime of a wartime photographer who also covered many of the world's natural and man-made disasters.",
          "beautifully laid out well planned gallery for photography exhibits. lovely cafe overlooking the view of the ocean....must enjoy a coffee with local sweets after a stroll of the exhibits.",
          "Nice smaller museum that hosts a few interesting exhibits. Good to be combined with the visit to the cafes for lunch/ dinner or just Fika to enjoy the great view.",
          "The location adds to the drama of the photos on display. But of course not all photos qualify and we all have our view, but still the location in my opinion is a factor that adds to the feeling and experience when visiting Fotografiska. I am going to purchase a one year",
          "The location comes into its own at night, and good too that you can usually visit it into the early morning. Didn't get to sample the caf\u00e9, which sounds worth a trip in itself...maybe next time. Not sure how appealing the material may be if you're not into photography as it's",
          "Despite even having a screen on side of building saying it was open til 01.00 it was closed. Midsummers eve? But nothing on website, Google etc which was disappointing after negotiating our way across the building site to get there. Please communicate with your would-be",
          "This was my 2nd time visiting and was as interesting as the first one. Exibitions are well curated and after heart wrenching exibition of photojournalist James Nachtwey you enter beautiful photography of Vincent Peters, then through interesting world of Scarlet Hooft Graafland",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed this museum. Really interesting exhibits and although there were people there (visited on a Saturday morning in early June) it was easy walking/viewing - never felt crowded. I had lunch in the cafe sitting at the window enjoying the gorgeous views.",
          "A really good photographic collection, especially the portraits of the famous and not so famous. Well worth a visit.",
          "We enjoyed the three featured exhibits of May this year and would recommend you take the time to enjoy the photography. The try lunch at the restaurant up stairs as it is very good and a nice way to relax for a bit after touring the exhibits.",
          "More than 16\u20ac for one ticket when there are just three small exhibitions is definitely overpriced. Also, it's ridiculous that a student's ticket is still 12\u20ac! Lots of stockholm's museums offer free entry for young people under 20.. here it's just free for children under 12. Not",
          "We so enjoyed our visit here. It's a wonderful exhibition of photographic art and a super venue. Tips - the cafe provides fantastic views of the city and is great for a coffee. Note payment by card only. The nearest station is Slussen with the area under major reconstruction.",
          "Visited during Jessica Silversaga\u2019s exhibition, which was perfect. I also loved the whole building. You can sense the ability to make great photograph exhibition packets. This was my first time here and really enjoyed the whole packet. The place is easy to find. I highly",
          "We saw a nice exposition of photo there and then we eat at the roof top. The food was good and very different that usual. But not very very good only average.( sorry I am French so maybe too picky) The view is amazing and the service excellent!!!",
          "Intense and original experience among pieces of modern photography. It offers an amazing view on the city.",
          "Very nice exhibitions, area and a restaurant with a beautiful view. A must for every photographer when in Stockholm",
          "Nicely located in Stockholm harbour, this I a good place to visit! Exhibitions are usually good, there is a shop for photography-related books, posters and other items. There are restaurants/caf\u00e9s in pleasant facilities with great views over the harbour inlet and Djurg\u00e5rden",
          "I didn\u2019t really enjoy the exhibits that were on display and there didn\u2019t seem to be much of a permanent collection. So that was disappointing but the cafe on the top floor was excellent with gorgeous views so overall a nice experience!",
          "A large museum with different exhibitions, some more interesting than others. Resaurant also worth a visit. If you forgot to book a table, at least take a cofee and enjoy the view.",
          "Is it a long and stretched building near the waterfront. The exposition Floor is quite dark as it should be, so the exposed photos get the best attention with the beamed lights. There is a complete restaurant on top, with lots of good food, where you can have a excellent lunch",
          "I really don't find this place interesting in anyway and the entrance is way too expensive for a little gallery. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb",
          "I didn't get much out of visiting this museum. A little too abstract for me maybe or just uninteresting. I did like the small special Made in Bangladesh exhibit. My girlfriend liked it. We had a Stockholm Pass so at least it was included with that. I would have been disappointed",
          "The photography here was interesting. The museum is located near the cruise terminals which is a walk from the Gamla Stan area. It is worth the trek out there. Very nice views from the top of the museum where they have a cafe and restaurant.",
          "Myself & a friend are great fans of photography exhibitions and regularly go to exhibitions in London at the Barbican and Photographers Gallery. However, this gallery did not live up to our expectations. I think the curator made an error in choosing very similar types of shows",
          "Absolutely loved this place - exhibitions were thought-provoking, each exhibition had the perfect feeling of ambience about it with the lighting / sound used and to top things off, incredible views over Stockholm from the restaurant (and a great fika spot!) though in busy times",
          "We saw lots of great photos advertising Fotografiska and so were excited to see them and others like them. We were disappointed as the Fotografiska only shows short term shows. There is no permanent collection and the collections being shown were nothing like the pictures",
          "Engaging photographic exhibits by Swedish and international artists. The museum restaurant/bistro is one of the finest dining experiences in the City.",
          "The exhibits were great. Really liked the exhibit that focused on parodies of celebrities. Very creative gift shop. Included as an attraction with the Stockholm pass. Walking distance from Gamla Stan with some benches nearby to take in the nice river views.",
          "Excellent exhibit, not too big but really interesting. Go hungry as there is a lovely cafe at the top with awesome views!",
          "Really well laid out exhibits in a beautiful building. Some of the material may not be suitable for young children or sensitive visitors so it\u2019s best to learn about what exhibits they have going on before actually going to see them. Also loved the gift shop. Absolutely stop at",
          "A well laid out modern museum on the waterfront. There are some very interesting exhibits but the historical ones are a little more difficult to understand because the wording is in Swedish. I think more could have been made of the museum, perhaps with a section on photographic",
          "Spent about an hour here cause we didn\u2019t have much time. Great museum and great fun part up stairs. Would recommend going if in Stockholm. Right beside the hop on hop off boat.",
          "Very interesting exhibits with a great atmosphere. The views from the top over the water are gorgeous at night. Cool museum store. No real service in the bar unless you pursue it yourself - so we just enjoyed the view and the great location.",
          "Ok so we had a bit of a trek to get here due to roadworks meaning pavements were closed and we got directed all over the place, but once there we really enjoyed the exhibitions. We came to a later at night opening and it was moderately busy, could\u2019ve done with a bit more",
          "My husband and I visited Fotografiska primarily for the Swedish House Mafia exhibition, which coincided with their gigs, however we spent ages going around the other exhibitions too and loved it!",
          "Fridays they close one o'clock in the young night. So you have plenty of time to eat somewhere else, visit the exihibitions and after that enjoy the view with a glass of wine.",
          "We went there yesterday for the Swedish House Maffia exhibition, but there were many more beautiful exhibitions! Was really happy to see all of them. + a fun extra is the cocktailbar at the topfloor :-)",
          "I am impressed with museums in Sweden - so beautiful, interactive, clean and designed with people in mind. But I was simply blown away by Fotografiska - the exhibitions (Made in Bangladesh, All Over, Truth is Dead); the layout, how exhibitions are not just pictures, the location",
          "Fotografiska is probably the best museum of Stockholm. Inspiring exhibitions, amazing restaurant with mainly vegetarian cuisine, excellent view and a well sorted bookstore. You are in danger here is there are so many great books wanting to go home with you \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Fotografiska can easily be reached by walking from the city center. It is situated in an old custom house - showing an excellent example of how an old building has been renovated for modern purposes, instead of just destroying it Scenery from the restaurant accross the bay are",
          "I visited this museum twice. I must say the quality really depends on the kind of exhibitions. First time I went it was really interesting and fascinating, last time one of the exhibition was not that interesting for me and the other two were ok. Definitely check the website to",
          "2 very different exhibitions when we visited and both well worth seeing. Loved the museum! Just a shame the gift shop was so bloody expensive! Lovely venue though and great views from the cafe and restaurant.",
          "I think we were maybe unlucky with the exhibitions that were on when we visited, as they were all a bit weird for our taste. The building is lovely yes, the location by the water, (although getting to it is a pain with the current works disruption). The cafe was also half closed",
          "Excellent quality museum. Great cafe with wonderful views. But make sure the displays are of interest to you. We expected some old Stockholm black &white/sepia photos. But there wasn\u2019t. A level of look-a-like photos was amusing, but the weird stuff on the next level was both",
          "Best photography museum, and one of the best museums, I\u2019ve explored anywhere. Location and building are wonderful, views of water and light from 3rd floor cafe are wonderful, and the food at cafe (and from what I\u2019ve read the restaurant) are alone worth the visit.",
          "Fotografiska might be a little off the beaten path but I would not recommend another museum as much as this one as a must see in Stockholm. If you love art or photography this is a must see. But it is also a wonderful glimpse into the minds of local artists. Each exhibit is",
          "The exhibitions are always changing so it depends on your interests. It just so happens that I went during an artsy/dreamy phase which wasn't for me. I went through the four exhibitions in under 2 hours then I just chilled at the cafe. Food is ok and the view is nice. Too bad",
          "I visited on April 12 and saw the Jessica Silversaga, Alison Jackson and Jesper Waldersten exhibitions. The balance and range of themes, approaches and subjects was striking. Some very challenging images and probably not suitable for young children. What all the exhibits had in",
          "Nice, but small exhibition. Restaurant / coffee place offers a great view to the city. Not all of the showed content is for ages under 16...",
          "Very cool, even hip museum. The exhibitions during my visit were really interesting, I was especially taken with the current main exhibit, by Jesper Waldersten. As others mentioned, be aware that there's no option to pay in cash.",
          "It can be a bit hit or miss whether they have something on that is to your liking, but the space itself makes it worth a visit. The opening hours are also unique, open late almost every single day. Accessible art! Check out the great bar on the top floor for killer views of",
          "Twice a year ! I live in Stockholm so therefore it is easy to visit. Usually go when having visitors in town.",
          "This was such a lovely find in Stockholm. The food was AMAZING and the service was really top notch. It is also attached to a museum of photography - so make sure you arrive early to enjoy that as well.",
          "They showcase really interesting pieces of photography, I really liked the 3 current exhibitions. Furthermore there is a bar & restaurant with a great view & gift shop with lovely gadgets!",
          "The museum was okay. There were a lot od funny pictures from famous persons. After that we were eating in the restaurant. The location is really cool but then the food: there are only env. 4 menus. I orderet pasta. I get only 5 pices of noodles and the portion was really small",
          "The Alison Jackson exhibition was amazing. Definitely worth the short trip to sodermalm, very accessible on the hop on hop off tour bus.",
          "Fotografiska ranked highly on things to-do in Stockholm, but I think it's overrated. Maybe it depends on what exhibitions are on, but that depends on your luck when you visit. The bar/cafe/restaurant upstairs was so busy, we couldn't find a seat. Wasn't worth the 165 SEK",
          "We are art lovers anyway and saw good reviews. We hiked round from Gamla Stan but I think there are closer metro stations. Some great installations in particular Jesper Waldersten and Rahul Talukder. Great space and nice vibe in the upstairs cafe with a view. Good gift shop too.",
          "Despite being quite tricky to get to, this gallery is incredible with a vast range of exhibitions. The kind of photography gallery that I wish existed in London! Well worth the ticket price as each exhibition is so interesting and there is a lot of fantastic photography to get",
          "Visited here for the first time this year and we were not disappointed. Wonderful, varied exhibits in a great space.",
          "We went there saturday evening and place was not crowded. In the top there is a nice restaurant. Positive is that museum have extended opening hours, also saturday evening. Fantastic!",
          "Great exhibition space and remarkable restaurant and cafe upstairs including a marvelous view of Stockholm.",
          "We were many colleagues that wanted to do something together so we went for a guided tour at Fotografiska mus\u00e9et. They had Alison Jackson at the time and that was something we all could relate to. This is an interesting museum with great exhibitions and a very good",
          "We visited here after reading a booklet on visiting Stockholm in our hotel. It mentioned having lunch here. We were hungry earlier than our visit but held out to eat lunch here. The food was below average and service was definitely not with a smile. Food aside we ventured",
          "Always a couple of interesting photoexhibitions. Worth a visit, also for the cafe with beautiful view. In the weekend they also often have club nights with music...",
          "Very interesting place to visit, a little costly entrace, even the food upstair is very expensive but very Nice view..",
          "A very nice, and known, museum of photography. Try to go outside rushhours as it can be crowded. Entry fee is also quite high and a must for visiting the caf\u00e9/restaurant.",
          "Great exhibitions, coffee bar and restaurant on the top floor with great food made with consideration got planet. Beautiful view at the harbour.",
          "We were in the middle of the winter of February, for our Stockholm pass, it has included all variety of museums and this is one of them. Would highly recommend to anyone whose interested in photography, you will be so inspired by this place. Most importantly, it closes late!",
          "The exhibitions change every few months. Sometimes I've been underwhelmed, sometimes --yesterday for instance-- I find the show fantastic. Right now, until early May, one may see the work of Alison Jackson. She finds people who are \"doubles\" of known individuals (e.g.",
          "I was unimpressed by the selections honestly. More of an abstract art gallery than a photography exhibit. Jesper Walderson\u2019s material was like a 15 year on an acid trip\u2014lacked talent, and was frankly uncreative. Thoroughly unimpressed. Alison Jackson\u2019s was interesting, but",
          "Fotografiska changes its exhibitions regularly, so every visit is worthwhile. It exhibits interesting and new photography, and I find myself getting immersed into the art due to its matching atmosphere. It's a museum that would be interesting to all, nor only art lovers. It is a",
          "We had an opportunity to see the famous \"truth is Dead\" exhibition wich was awesome - really recommend it. You will be admired and laughing at the same time. The museum is not that big, but we saw 3 different exhibitions. You can only pay by card for the ticket.",
          "It\u2019s a bit out of the way if you stay in \u00d6stermalm but don\u2019t get discouraged by the journey! If you like modern art you\u2019ll love this place! Have fun with decadent artists work and learn from their passion.",
          "- The museum is housed in a repurposed customs house and located right on the waterfront with wonderful views of Gamla Stan, Djurgarden and Skeppsholmen. - It\u2019s on the expensive side at 165K pp, so we were glad that we used our Stockholm Pass. Also, they do not take cash. -",
          "When you are in Stockholm, you must visit this Museum, even if you are not quite a fan of Photography. The Museum is housed in a large art nouveau building at the Waterside of S\u00f6dermalm. The museum has different areas on three to four levels of the building. We saw an",
          "Getting to the museum was a bit complicated due to all the nearby building works but when I made it I was very pleased. There were a couple of floors of exhibits. I particularly enjoyed Truth is Dead. Entry fee was reasonable and the shop was very good. The best part is at the",

          "This is my favourite museum/gallery in Stockholm, and I still get max value out of my annual visitor card even after >5 years here. The mix of exhibitions always has something impressive, something challenging, something lighthearted \u2013 and of course something old and something",
          "Take the metro -- getting there was half the fun by walking thru the Kungstradgarden metro exchange, deep underground! Exit, and walk the distance, following the clever, amusing signs that Fotografiska has set up to help people find them. Cafe was excellent for a 4pm fika",
          "The Fotografiska is a must see / do in Stockholm! The exhibits are first rate and they change frequently. Don't miss the opportunity to have lunch or dinner there, very fresh and well prepared food.",
          "A visit here had been recommended but we were disappointed and probably just unlucky. None of the three exhibitions really interested us and we were expecting a permanent collection of photographs which would tell us something about Sweden.",
          "Fotografjska, from my perspective, is a museum to visit if you are passionate about photography, art, poetry, for when you arrive in Stockholm.",
          "We went in the first week of March and were lucky enough to catch the last day of Kristy Mitchell\u2019s amazing exhibit, as well as the other exhibit some other recent reviews have been complaining about. My advice would be to check ahead of time whose exhibitions are on when you",
          "Fotografiska is a real success story, combining often very interesting and sometimes provocative photo exhibitions with good food. It is quite expensive, but it is worth it (depending on your interest in the exhibition that is on when you visit, of course). Try to get a table",
          "This is not a museum you will enjoy if you are old-fashioned in you lifestyle. There are many photographs of private body parts; there are others that are satirical in a very mean-spirited way. I expected to see beautiful photographs and saw none.",
          "The museum is located by the port for the cruise ships, with stunning view of the bay. Museum offers free lockers to store your belongings (however was unable to open at the end of our visit and the staff helped us to open). Exhibition was well laid on 2 full floors. Restaurant",
          "Nice museum. Change artist. We were lucky with exhibition of Alison Jacksons. She makes fun of famous people, putting them in akward positions. Very funny!",
          "We heard good things about Fotografiska and wanted to pay a visit but they would not sell tickets for cash. Really bad.",
          "If you only have one museum in your plan choose this one. Great photo exibitions, in a trendy environmemt and with a great view of the City. What\u2019s more? An excelent restaurant at the top. If it is a sunny Day you Will enjoy the best light in the City. A must go!",
          "As a \"museum\" Fotografiska leaves much to be desired. The cost is quite high, especially since many (most?) other museums in Stockholm are free. The exhibit space is small and very limited in scope. I had hoped for a broad range of artists or subjects but they only had three.",
          "Our fotografiska visit was so not worth it - paid 175kr ($24) for our entrance fee only to see a single floor of the place, as the other exhibition was closed. The exhibition we did see - Alison Jackson\u2019s - was probably one of the worst exhibitions I\u2019ve ever experienced in my",
          "There seems to be 3 different artists in different areas that rotate. They have tons of pictures from each artists and a video about their work. I loved the one where the photographer faked famous people, very funny pictures. Also, great bar/diner up top.",
          "Came here on our last day in Stockholm, and so happy we didn't miss this place! Although it was packed, the exhibits were fantastic, and I really appreciated all of the work that was shown. We stopped at the restaurant upstairs for a bite to eat and the food was great.",
          "What a fantastic way to make use of an old warehouse building. The stunning views across Stockholm harbor from the museum\u2019s cafeteria are truly breathtaking. Obviously the exhibitions are constantly changing but as there are around three any given time, you are almost guaranteed",
          "My first visit, has been on my bucket list about 10yrs. Finally ticked, done. I came for the amazing Kirsty Mitchell exhibition and was lost in fantasies of Wonderland. Fotografiska is by far the best photography exhibition space I visited. The exhibition was perfectly",

          "Not only are the exhibitions here always of superb quality, but the cafe and restaurant is so lovely. Fantastic views and great food, although I must say a bit pricey in the cafe.",
          "We visited the museum on a Saturday around 2 pm. About the exhibition, I personally did not find it interesting or worth it. There were some very beautiful photographs, but a vast majority were normal. One can definitely expect more from a museum. Beauty is, however, in the eye",
          "On a busy few days exploring Stockholm I was so thankful Fotografiska stays open late at night. I finally got there on my last night and I was glad I did. A great variety of excellent exhibitions beautifully installed and with loads of bilingual info if you want it. Being",
          "If you only have time to visit one museum, make it this! I enjoyed my time here tremendously! The exhibitions are interesting, the most recent one being about \u201cWonderland\u201d, beautiful photographs taken by Kristy Mitchell, which speaks to the whimsical and fantastical feel of the",
          "I\u2019ve visited Fotografiska several times and I\u2019ve never been disappointed. Alway great exhibitions with relevant, unforgettable art. Don\u2019t miss out on the top floor restaurant \u2014 it\u2019s perfect for a drink after your visit and also serves delicious food and the view is amazing.",
          "The place is well signed (need to pass some works at the harbor to find it). The place is not big. Depends of the exhibits if you would like it or not. Lighting was very good as information too. Both entrance and restaurant are expensive.",
          "The walk to the museum was interesting, the museum was very nice, the installations were interesting, there is a restaurant and bar that is very pleasing. I would recommend this.",
          "It\u2019s a museum with expositions of various authors: I think it depends of the author if you will like it or not. I liked the expositions on February 2019; especially the Wonderland!",
          "The museum for photography has new exhibitions each time. You can visit it again and again and it will each time be new.",
          "I try and go every other month to cover as many exhibitions as possible in a year. The best sight in stockholm to visit",
          "We took a nice long nice walk to reach the Fotografiska Museum of Photography. There were three exhibits on when we visited. The thing is that the first one, an exhibit by Anja Niemi, was SOOOOO great the we felt that was enough in itself. It would have been an anticlimax to see",
          "Kirsty Mitchell's Wonderland photo exhibition is truly amazing. I wouldn't have chosen to go, but a friend took me- I'm usually more of a Magnum/WPPA kinda guy- but it is absolutely moving and a thing of true beauty, and beautifully presented at Fotografiska. Anyhow, best thing",
          "Best Photography museum ever. Why? Becasue. Lighting amazing on the walls. Evert detail so perfect. Must the visit Fotografiska",
          "Even though the walk there is a bit inconvenient due to construction is absolutely worth a visit. The view from the last part of the walk is fantastic. Fotografiska has photo exhibitions with great variance and don\u2019t miss out the restaurant!",
          "This is definitely one of my favourite places in Stockholm. Not only is the location amazing, close to the Old Town, right by the water and offering wonderful views of the city, but they also offer fantastic exhibitions and photography courses at all levels. Great restaurant",
          "You like arts / adventure or outdoors photography, then don't miss this activity. Contemporary mixed with older stories, world renowned photographers showing their newest additions. Nicely arranged, topic-based floors. At the top floor equipped with bar and caf\u00e9. Worth the walk",
          "If you love photographs, you should definitely visit this place. I enjoyed all the exhibitions. The only minus point for me was the long walk from the station. It was a windy evening. Maybe it wouldn't be that bad if it was a sunny afternoon. The walkway was next to the river.",
          "I go here every time I'm in Sthlm. The exhibits are without fail *fantastic* and I'm not even a huge photography fan in general. Cafe has a stunning view and the shop is excellent. As a bonus, it opens at 9 and closes between 11 PM and 1 in the morning--I recommend visiting",
          "Fotografiska is a must see for everyone who is interested in photography. The exhibitions are beautifully curated and it is very interesting and a lot of fun to visit this museum. The caf\u00e9 offers beautiful views so make sure to take a break there after visiting the exhibitions!",
          "I've visited the museum several times and newer been disapointed. The exhibitions change under the year and is very exciting to see. We visited with another couple and had a great lunch afterwards at the restaurant. Walk from slussen or park the car near the ferryterminal.",
          "It definitely work to go if you are art lover! Is open until late, so it might be a last stop on a busy traveling day, having a drink at the bar on the top floor, is also a worth experience, nice music, nice environment!",
          "Went with my partner who has a much better idea about art than I. Spent two hours totally immersed in another world. First exhibition, wonderland theme is not to be missed",
          "This is a world class exhibition site, in a fantastic building in a great location. Current site works at Slussen make the overall appeal of the area less that ideal, but that is progress! The exhibits themselves were fantastic, as was the restaurant and bar, worth a visit on",
          "If you are into any kind of photography exhibitions this is the place to be. Always something going on, interesting. Great location on the harbour.",
          "I was at Fotografiska when they had the Kirsty Mitchell \u2018Wonderland\u2019 exhibition on display. I guess your experience would differ, based on what exhibition they are currently showing, but without a doubt they are fully committed to bringing you the best display of photos. The",
          "The PR around the city really promoted this museum on the harbour front as a fantastic place, but sadly quite a small building with limited space and exhibitions. Too expensive for the fee and felt very disappointed, I have been to many more photo exhibitions that are better",
          "Especially Kirsty Mitchell Wonderland was worth visit and STHLM Forever was also interesting. Building itself is magnificent. On spring we go to London and see what they have to offer in their Fotografiska.",
          "Fotografiska has earned is reputation as an excellent museum. Current exhibition with Kirsty Mitchell is both touching and beautiful at the same time. In fact we were almost too exhausted to immerse ourselves in the other very fine exhibitions. Therefore, having a coffee in the",
          "Really great place to go and easy to commute from city center and back. Of course it depends from style of art you like and what\u2019s at that time is available. It\u2019s crowded and that\u2019s the only thing you might dislike, hard to enjoy it in silence or calm way. It\u2019s not expensive and",
          "I expected a museum, but it turned out to be more like a gallery. There was an amazing exhibition about the work of Kirsty Mitchell. The others one (\"The Last Testament\", \"Smile\",...) were pretty great too! Easy to access from Slussen. Really worth the visit!",
          "Museum is nice but for sure not worth the price that you need to pay to get in. Very clean bathroom and lockers area but definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend.",
          "I enjoyed every individual exhibition. But what most impressed me is they show the entire possibility of photography to us by choosing the theme of each exhibition, such as aesthetically creative, journalistic, social issues and so on.",
          "The exhibitions were great to see, particularly \u2018wonderland\u2019. However the restaurant was very expensive considering you have already paid quite a cost to get in. The view from the restaurant is lovely however their are limited seats near the windows. Very good gift shop.",
          "This was just OK, I don\u2019t know that I would go out of my way to visit here again unless there was a really interesting exhibit going on.",
          "Their brunch is fantastic with amazing views. In the brunch you can have the museum included, making it a great experience when visiting Stockholm! Make sure to book in advance as spots get booked very quickly.",
          "It takes 5 minutes to walk in Good shoes from slussen but it is worth it. You have to go see the scenery from the restaurant!",
          "Sometimes it happens that you have an experience which in every sence seems to fit and be correct. But after a short while it leaves you quite indifferent and cold. This was one of those experiences.",
          "We were in Stockholm during Christmas and were thrilled that the photo museum was open on Christmas Eve. This museum is gorgeous! It is the best photo museum we have ever visited. We spent several hours there and enjoyed eating lunch in their cafe. I highly recommend",
          "We were curious why this museum was open until 1am so we went in the evening, we were lucky there was an amazing exhibition on, Kirsty Mitchell - wonderland. The top floor opens on to a cafe, restaurant and fabulous cocktail bar. Staff were friendly and helpful when trying to",
          "If you are planning to tour Sodermalm for the day make time to visit Fotografiska. The current Wonderland exhibition of Kirsty Mitchell is pure fantasy and not to be missed. Even with different exhibits the cafe/cocktail bar on the top floor has great Fika and amazing views.",
          "Its a wonderful museum with at least 3 different exposition at the same time. I just loved it. And outside you get a perfect view around the city.",
          "We visited the fotografiska. The museum is ok but not outstanding (like some other fotografic musea in other countries).",
          "Expensive visit and the exchibitions was not that interesting for us - maybe a hit & miss depending on the artists.",
          "It's a little off the beaten path but it was worth the visit. The audio photographic recordings are moving. There were some touching stories about the water situation in India. Won't complain ever again after seeing this. On the top floor there is a restaurant with a picture",
          "I wouldn't call it a museum, rather an exhibition centre, but the whole experience is amazing. Photos were amazing and well exhibited. All four exhibitions weren't related to each other, but it's even better because you can see the world from different perspectives. Also, each",
          "Pas de sens de visite. You are allowed to go forth and back, wjhenever to top floor for a break (coffee lounge and restaurant with a fantastic view over the city). The exhibition \"Stockholm for Ever\" shew remarkable black and white photos shot during the construction of",
          "Be aware,this is NOT a museum but an Exhibition centre for Photography. We felt very let-down and mislead as we believed it was a Museum of Photography and after paying around \u00a315 each as an entrance fee were hugely disappointed. We complained and received free tickets for the",
          "Great attraction in Stockholm, with great exhibitions of both well known photographers as well as more emerging one. Usually 3 running at a given time, but not connected to each others.",
          "If you like photography, this is your museum. The exhibitions are changed very often. From the restaurant you have a great view and the chance to relax.",
          "Beautifully laid out however it is a little lean on exhibits. The feature exhibit we saw was excellent, the lighting and information attached was well thought out and interesting. After that though there are only a couple additional small exhibits. No real substantial permanent",
          "Very well designed and curated photography museum. We saw the Wonderland exhibit by Kirsty Mitchell, which was amazing. Well worth the effort and cost to visit. And the cafe/bar/restaurant on the top has great views.",
          "Its the guy from the hotel that suggest me To go. Wasn't really into it at first, but i really had a great time. Th\u00e9 exhibits when i got there was about war refugees in Afghanistan and a photos collection from an english photograph call 'wonderland' who was dedicated To Her late",
          "It is befitting that in cool (scandi-cool) and arty S\u00f6dermalm the main attraction should be a museum dedicated to contemporary photography. Besides a good permanent collection there are several temporary exhibitions to be seen at the same time, usually lasting 2-3 months. When I",
          "We loved it now and we have loved it always. The building is nice ,the restaurant and cafe are excellent and the exhibitions are always so good. For the moment to go there take a taxi...there is huge constructionsite on the way there....",
          "Our group had a very enjoyable dinner there on a recent week night. The atmosphere is casual. The menu is a really interesting with a range of small plates available. Each plate is beautifully presented and explained. The museum exhibit is interesting and diverse. The pictures",
          "The photos on display and the history behind them all was really interesting and informative . Really allowed you to get in touch and feel the emotions and all. Was disappointing that the restaurant didn't advertise you need to book for it.",
          "I like this musem very much. Always interesting artist and the museum shop is also full of books of photography. Upstairs is a nice coffee/lunch restaurant. There are no public transport very near so you must walk a bit to get there.",
          "The gallery is big and beautiful! Even if you are not a big fan of photography (we are not) I am sure that you will enjoy it! At the top is a restaurant and bar with a great views of the city!!",
          "This museum is amazing and the upstairs cafe and restaurant makes for a wonderful experience. The museum has several exhibitions They also have an App.",
          "I went earlier this year with my Swedish boyfriend, who has been many times and still hasn't tired of it. Beautiful exhibits. Will be returning in December/January. Carve out a proper few hours as the building is massive and to really enjoy all the art, you need a few hours.",
          "One pretty good museum with high quality exehibitions. But do check who they exehibit in beforehand. Friendly personell and good selection of books and posters in the shop. The restaurant is something hou shouldn\u2019t miss it.",
          "I do not recommend to walk here, even though you can enjoy some nice views and closely admire some big ships... Once here you'll be offered a ever-changing calendar of exhibits of good quality (from my experience of two visits spaced a few months). I still need to check out the",
          "Phptography, whatever your style is, has a very good chance to be accomodated here with a wide selection of human scores. After you can hit the fine resturant/eatery and take in some magic views of the harbour city.",
          "What an amazing space.. the exhibit is just stunning..beautifully played out and easy to navigate. And the bar/restaurant upstairs is just amazing and super yummy. Great place to spend the rest of your night....",
          "Great selection of photographers, different styles, distributed in 3 levels. Do a pit stop at the bar at the last floor. Amazing view!",
          "A short walk from train station was definitely worth it as this exhibition and restaurant (with view of harbour) is wonderful. We loved the political exhibition just before Sweden\u2019s election...each party presented 5 photos to tell their story and explain their main",
          "Its not very cheap. But worth it.. many exhibitions and sometimes they hold events and talks in the weekends. The restaurant is huge with a lovely view of the sea.",
          "I really enjoyed the Fotografiska in Stockholm. The main exhibition was of Lars Tunbjork and his photography was so interesting. He documented Sweden during different times, offices (the crazy places we lock ourselves all day), his childhood home and winter. A great mix of",
          "One of my favourite museums in the world! I didn\u00b4t even know photography art could inspire, move me and bring me so much joy! I have been here twice and all of the exhibitions have been excellent. The location is a little off the beaten track and require a lot of walking, but",
          "An excellent museum with beautifully presented photography. Plenty to see to keep you busy with a lovely resturant on the top floor. Can get crowded but was worth the visit to reflect on each exhibition.",
          "Any artist would luv this place and would dream of their photo hanging here. No wonder they were open so late ; just can't get enough of Fotografika. A MUST visit! !! If you do not have a few days in Stockholm try to stop here last, cause their open until 20h00 and some days",
          "We walked about 20 minutes from Gamla Stan to this location. It was a decent walk and were there when it opened at 10. The facility is nice. They have a lounge and restaurant on the top floor. We stopped in after the exhibit and looked at the club lounge and have coffee and",
          "This is a really cool building right next to the river with a huge fancy restaurant/bistro/bar at the top with great views. It\u2019s not bad value to get in (around \u00a312 each I think) and features some really cool photos and collections. Take an hour or so to wander about and go",
          "It\u2019s a special museum. It makes me feel relaxing and the exhibition is touching. The view from the cafe is incredible. I wish to have spend all day there!",
          "This museum is always worth a visit, the exhibitions are really good. At he moment there is one featuring photos by Lars Tunbj\u00f6rk which is great. A lot of photos of ordinary people in ordinary situations but still fascinating. Easily accessible, take the underground to Slussen",
          "Outstanding view of Stockholm from the restaurant of Fotografiska. Nice taste of swedish photograpy culture.",
          "The exhibits change often so every experience is different but if you are even a little interested in photography you should try it.",
          "Smaller than we anticipated but very well presented and some intriguing exhibits in. modern building. The Lars Tunbj\u00f6rk exhibition was marvellous. The whole of the top floor is a restaurant and we had tea there while enjoying a lovely view of the harbour. Worth a visit if you",
          "Plus: - great photographic exhibition that are also well combined so that everyone, not only photo-nerds, can find something interesting most of the time - great shop with photo books, books about photography, learning books, posters and more - just amazing view from the",
          "Being 'Palaced Out' this was a great change, a representation of Swedish photographic art, you will either like it of hate it, I loved it so if you have that interest it is a must see. The cafe gets very busy at the weekend with sizeable queues, the Swedish have a plan worth",
          "We entrred as the first guests this Saturday morning. We started with fika and then walked through all exhibitions and finished with some shopping in the store. As good as always.",
          "This was a great photo museum, lots of variety and culture. This museum had a great variety of photos by all different photographers. The cafe at the top also has a great view of the old city and the amusement park!",
          "I thought it was a museum of photography, a sort of technology museum. It is most definitely not! It is a place where there are exhibits of photos taken by supposedly famous photographers, many of a political nature. Some were depressing (at best), and confronting (at worst).",
          "This place is a 10 min walk from Slussen heaps of pictures taken from different artist. I did a misstake not looking wich ones so I got a bit of panic watching things I did not like. So next time I will plan. The shop downstairs is amazing with books and fun things, entrance is",
          "Really liked the exhibitions and the way they were arranged. There is an explanation and a story for each section. Only, would have liked them to be a bit less biased and less politically activist (as any art exhibition should be).",
          "Just loved it. Idea of the museum is different and the concept is interesting. Viewed some amazing photos. Enjoyed snake and cup of coffee at the cafe upstairs. One of best view points in Stockholm.",
          "When you want to combine art (photography) and having a great meal, a snack or just a drink overlooking Stockholm by the sea - go to Fotografiska. Always interesting exhibitions and very generous opening hours. Good shop too.",
          "When we were there we enjoyed amongst others, a Linda McCartney exhibition. Reasonable entrance fee and a must for photography enthusiasts visiting Stockholm. Eating lunch at the caf\u00e9 provided us with a truly magnificent view of the city, the menu was however rather limited.",
          "If you really like photography, you must visit this place. You should pay the entrance ticket with your card, they do not accept the cash. In my opinion the photos in the second floor were really interesting, it is about humanity with each story they put beside the photos. So",
          "Firstly I loved how late you can visit this museum, 1am some days! Came here with friends (bare in mind it's card only to pay for entrance). Really liked how the museum was across the entire building and not just in one room. Found it really interesting and inspiring, definitely",
          "Different photo exhibitions during the year. Great atmosphere, good Swedish Fika and a Restaurant with a sustainable focus and good somewhat pricey food. Sometimes hard to find parking but only a short walk from Stockholms Old Town and subway station Slussen. Maybe not a place",
          "Fotografiska is definitely worth a visit! We didn\u2019t know the photographer in focus in the main exhibition before we went, but we certainly did afterwards. Every exhibition is put up beautifully with lights, sound, color and backdrop!",
          "I had never been to Stockholm, and Fotografiska was in my to do list as soon as I would visit the city. I loved it, it exceeded my expectations by far! I spent a great amount of time walking around, exploring all the exhibitions, and I wish I could go there more often! :) I",
          "I really love good photographs but had never been to a photography museum. It was like being in a National Geographic or in an art piece, depending on the exhibit. Plenty of space to read information on each photo and take in the art for a long time. I won't soon forget the",
          "Had an enjoyable visit to Fotgrafiska recently on a chilly, blustery, showery morning. It is situated along the waterfront and is a beautiful building set in a stunning location. We took the metro to Slussen and walked the 5 mins along to get to it. Note that at the time of",
          "Whether you're a photographer or not, this gallery has something for everyone. I was blown away by the diversity of the works... From thought provoking and joyous, to laughter and then darkness! Don't miss it. This place is really special!",
          "Fotografiska is really well done and different from the other museums we visited in Stockholm. It's open late so we went one night after dinner, which was perfect. They had a variety of exhibits from nature, to fashion, to music.",
          "A lovely water front location, and a great experience. I was taken aback as the cafe and small shop is cashless (so you can\u2019t pay in Krone, even if you want to buy one postcard) so be aware. The cafe is upstairs with a great view over the water and the museum was split into",
          "All of the staff at our hotel told us to go here, so we went, not knowing what to expect. We were very pleasantly surprised. This was one of the best museum experiences we have ever had. I don't want to give away the punch line. Just do it!",
          "Located on Sodermalm this museum has fabulous photos and stunning rooftop cafe. Friendly people helped make this visit a success",
          "Not sure what the fuss is all about. Some parts were worthwhile but in the main, this exhibit leaves you in no mans land. Disappointing",
          "You you love photography you will really enjoy this museum. Much of the exhibits are contemporary. Well worth the time. Must be on your Stockholm museum list.",
          "Its always inspiring to stroll around the alley of Fotografiska. The curator of the Museum offer a variety of artists throughout the year. Amazing view form the roof bar.",
          "Lovely museum to browse in however a bit difficult to walk to. The photos inside certainly made it all worthwhile and the views from the fabulous dining area were stunning.",
          "By far the best museum in stockholm. The exhibits are always changing, so it's new and exciting to go back a few times a year. The restaurant, at the top, is very nice for a coffee at the end of your visit.",
          "Nice museum, bit small but great building and exhibits and views. Pity the cafe upstairs is not managed by friendly staff, impossible to get a coffee again.",
          "High class museum with very interesting exhibitions. also a very good restaurant with lots of ecological and vegetarian choices. Popular as its open late in the evenings.",
          "The displays were truly awesome. There was a Paul Nicklan exhibition on at the time of my visit with massive wall size video clips and comfy cussions to sit and watch. Great looking restaurant overlooking the bay. A must visit!",
          "I visited this museum in a rainy windy Saturday when the others museums were closed. It\u2019s open until late night. I was really impressed by the choice of photographs. It was amazing also the 1st floor dedicated to poor war countries. I suggest also to go upstairs and see the",
          "In less than a decade since it opened in Stockholm Fotografiska has established itself as a preeminent museum of photography. Not only in Sweden, but I'd daresay the world. Their curation is diverse, inclusive and often provocative (in the best sense of that word). And the",
          "We spent a couple of hours wondering around this place and thoroughly enjoyed it. The downstairs gallery was exclusively focused on the work of a famous Swedish photographer and his work really was excellent. The floor upstairs had a mix of photographers from all over. The top",
          "Spent our first afternoon at the photography museum (saw 2 excellent displays and one which was just not my taste) which displayed the work of 3 Swedish photographers. Conveniently located near the bridge between Stamla Gan (the old city) and Sodermalm, the museum also offers",
          "We visited the museum on a Saturday morning to avoid too many people. Impressive contemporary setup with a huge restaurant on the top floor. As I be a foodie have a look on the photo....",
          "We visited Fotografiska on late afternoon during our recent visit to Stockholm. It\u2019s a great place to go when the afternoon is sliding into evening and other places are closing up. I am a big photography fan and was excited to visit. There were 4 temporary exhibits going on",
          "The museum does not seem to have a permanent collection so the exhibits vary. We saw four and really enjoyed two, but all were worth seeing. Very close to the cruise ship terminals.",
          "Beautiful building by the water and cruise ships. Couple of floors. Easy to get around without too much sensory overload. Has one of the best restaurants I have seen in a museum. Fantastic views over the water! Even if you don't stay to eat - take a look. It is a stop on",
          "We were very fortunate all the exhibits were excellent. Even the fashion ones which we would not necessarily go to were memorable. Building is interesting with excellent views. We had the Sunday brunch- a bit pricey with small selection.",
          "A lot will depend on what exhibits they happen to have on display, but the ones that were present when we visited (Jun 18) were fascinating. It's not a huge place, but big enough to carry several exhibitions of individual photographers' art - well displayed, with nice explainers",
          "The highlight here for me was the exhibition of the work of Swedish photographer Lars Tunbjork, who I hadn't come across before. The museum/gallery is housed in a beautiful old building with a very pleasant top-floor cafe with good views. The exhibitions were very",
          "This is not only a gallery but a museum on the history of photography. Expect to spend a few hours. The gallery is a marvelous display of Swedish Photographers and their photos. I was astounded at the talent, what a gift to be able to capture these amazing images. Many people",
          "if you like photographic art - this museum is a must see. Added bonus is the fact that it stays open late at night. You can have your dinner and then go to the museum. They do rotate shows in and out - but the quality is excellent and i cant imagine anything other than",
          "If you are into photography, or just appreciate it as art, it is a must visit museum. Amazing exhibits, great location close to the center and there is a restaurant on the top floor with a view towards the sea. Wonderful experience!",
          "Spent a perfect afternoon at fotoografiska museum. The exhibits were varied and far- ranging. At the time we went there was an exhibit by a young American woman who had photo documented her experience at a US summer weight loss clinic/camp ( this is an over simplification of",
          "the museum was kind of cool but small and can be done in 1 hour. we got there by the hop on/hop off boat. the restaurant on the 3rd floor has magnificent views of the harbor and incredible food that is served by the most beautiful women in Stockholm!",
          "A few years back they were caught booking artists just to drop them 2 days prior with no pay, because they found someone \"better\". I'd like to attach links to this but I am not allowed to do so, sadly. You as a visitor will not be greeted or receive any kind of service when you",
          "We arrived there, we had Swedish krona, the museum did not take cash so we could not enter. That's very not customer friendly. Anyway, we left and spent our krona elsewhere.",
          "I wouldn\u2019t say that this is a must see site but if you\u2019ve already visited the top Stockholm attractions then this is definitely worth a look next. It\u2019s a large exhibition site for photography so you obviously need to acknowledge that it\u2019s pot luck as to what is on display when",
          "Was very interesting, I\u2019d recommend it to everyone. Bar/cafe on top floor with great views. Well worth the entrance fee \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "Some very enjoyable exhibits. Time well spent enjoying the art. The upstairs bar however is exceptional with spectacular views!",
          "This is an excellent museum showing photographs from several artists. The museum is well laid out showing the photographs in the best possible way. There are two floors of exhibits. On the third floor there is a dining restaurant area with some of the best views of the old town.",

          "Really enjoyed visiting Fotografiska during my stay in Stockholm... Photos can definitely translate so much about art and its different points of view... I recommend it specially on a rainy day",
          "We had a good time wandering around this museum and really enjoyed two of the three exhibitions on. By chance we were there on the opening day of the Tunbj\u00f6rk exhibition, and I'm glad we were as it was fascinating. My wife preferred Simen Johan's surreal works. It's difficult to",
          "Several different exhibitions going on. The one with Linda McCartney's photos drew the crowd. For real photo buffs. A tough walk to get to around all the construction.",
          "Exhibitions were okay - some more interesting than others! To be honest, I expected more exhibitions than there were but the entry was included in our Stockholm pass so worthwhile going for a visit. The cafe was excellent. Lovely big open space, lots of fresh looking food -",
          "Stopped in for lunch after a visit to Grona Lund theme park - the caf\u00e9 has a great view of Stockholm, and the food was tasty. Enjoyed a wander around the exhibitions too. The gift shop was very well stocked, with plenty of gifts and souvenirs.",
          "Very poor museum and over priced for what they offer. During my visit only three halls were opened and they charge you a fortune to get in. No high levels photographers are there. Absolutely not value for money.",
          "The quality of the art in all of the exhibits is excellent. The rooms are spacious and the pieces are well displayed.The bar/restaurant may serve as the best place in the city to get a view of the beautiful harbor.",
          "Only 3 exhibitions open (plus one outside open to anyone) for 145sek. Don't get me wrong the exhibitions are interesting but the cafe is bigger than the exhibitions combined.",
          "The museum is extremely inspiring. The three floor museum has alot of offer. The ground floor is where you can buy souvenirs or anything related to photography, books, notebooks etc very educational in a way. Depends when you go but you will find alot of inspiring artists",
          "I really enjoyed my visit here - the beautiful fashion photography and loved the animal photography also. Not too much to see though and some of it was a bit on the pretentious side for me but if you\u2019re into the arts and photography it\u2019s well worth a wonder around",
          "Only visited because we could get in with Stockholm pass but turned out to be a great gallery. Photographs are well displayed. Not too busy so a nice place to be in the quiet with your own thoughts.",
          "Fotografiska was recommended to me by local tour guide and it did not disappoint! It is perfect destination for late night visit due to venue late close times (usually 11pm). The venue is of high standard, rooms are well prepared catering for each gallery with themes and quality",
          "Combination of in & out display and of social and artistic issues , top productions, opened long hours.",
          "With an interest in photography this was on our hoped to visit list. It wasn\u2019t anywhere near as far out of town as it looked on the map and worth the five minute stroll. The museum with its exhibits was fascinating (fashion and nature photography predominantly when we visited),",
          "It\u2019s a really nice setting for fotografic exhibitions. Different artists showing up on different days! Their fotos are hanging for like a month or so! Check the agenda on their website. They have a bar with desent price and a ridiculously expensive restaurant (food isn\u2019t that",
          "When going to this museum, I was sceptical as I'm not the biggest fan of art galleries. However, I was pleasantly surprised! There are some great exhibits with things to most people's taste, from animals to celebs",
          "Very interesting museum. Although it is called photography museum and all exposition is technically photos, it is really more of an art museum than photography. All photos are setup, most of them are heavy edited with Photoshop or alike. Worth to see.",
          "There are many reasons to visit Fotografiska. One, the exhibitions are varied, nicely displayed and well curated. Any fan of photography will enjoy it, and even those who are not are likely to enjoy some of the images. Two, the location is cool. It's a bit of a trek through",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to Fotografiska. The photo art on display was fantastic and the layout of the gallery made it easy to relax and take my time to absorb all that was on offer. I will definitely revisit if I am in the area again and would recommend others do so too.",
          "Fotografiska Museet is a very good modern museum of photography in Stockholm, where you can see some temporal expositions. It is a very interesting place, which open until 1h at night, so it is possible see it almost always. Very recommendable.",
          "This museum presents photographers works in small groups. The museum is huge and each photographer's work is displayed with lots of room and many of their prints. We were very lucky to see Linda and Mary McCartney's work due to the celebrity subjects like Paul McCartney and",
          "Good, not great. For me. Had a nice collection of photographs but the large majority of it didn\u2019t appeal to me. The McCartney exhibit was nice but that was about it. I was hoping it would have some photography history or something along those lines but it wasn\u2019t that. Fun,",
          "There are 2 main reasons for going to Fotografiska: 1. The exhibitions are always very interesting and inspiring. 2. The view of the inlet to Stockholm from the restaurant at the top floor is amazing A third reason is to have something to eat at the restaurant.",
          "We booked online and were sent a pdf ticket, which meant we just scanned the code at the barrier. The loos and free lockers are all good, and I know this sounds daft but because they are after you have entered, if you want to go to the loo whilst wandering around all the",

          "The place gives a walkthrough that is nice. Small rooms for the exhibits.. and a great caffe on the top floor with great views. The Mc Carrey ( mother and daughter) was great. Some Local artists ( lost the name) also very interesting and we do not see them much ( unfortunately)",
          "Great location and interesting exhibitions. Restaurant offers a healthy lunch option with exceptional views Restaurant is at the top floor. Friendly stuff, industrial deco in the eating area. Enjoying a glass of wine from the comfy couches is a treat for the soul",
          "There are too few galleries dedicated exclusively to photography so we were very keen to visit Fotografiska while in Stockholm. We had expected that there would be a permanent collection to view and were aware that masters like Sebastio Salgado had exhibited here. Sadly there is",
          "If you're a fan of photography, then you won't want to miss this museum. Very nice collection in a beautiful location on the water. We actually took the hop on, hop off bus to get there, which was fun. I especially appreciated the SeaLegacy exhibit. One room included bean bag",
          "The expo is well designed but the highlight for me was to have lunch at the top in the cafe. The food is fresh and very tasty",
          "I love the Fotografiska! Great photograph artists and well curated. They change the exibitions quite often. There is also a great restaurant there!",
          "Very nice museum that is a pleasant walk along the quays from the old town. Lovely exhibition of Cathleen Naundorf's photographic work for top designers. There was a wonderful exhibit by Sealegacy.org while I was there as well, which was very informative and well presented. Top",
          "Although it\u2019s kind of distant from the old town where I was hosted it was really worth the long walk. The temporary exposition was just perfect, a must-see. Everything else was great as well. Also the staff selling the tickets were really nice and helpful and let me buy a",
          "Great place to go and enjoy photo art. But it\u2019s always going to be crowded and it takes away a bit of intimacy and privacy. It offers different options of exhibition at once so it would definitely satisfy people who like/love great photo art. You will also get a nice view to old",
          "This waterside gallery is open late (9am - 23.00 and even later at the weekend). The 4 galleries are regularly refreshed with new exhibitions - it won;t take too long to go round them as they are relatively small and not all the photos have explanatory captions. Afterwards go up",
          "Always love to visit Fotografiska when I spend time in Stockholm. Usually they have two larger exhibitions and two smaller ones with different themes and photographers, so you will most likely find something that will bring some reflections and afterthought. Don\u2019t forget to",
          "We loved this place. They host several different photographic exhibitions at any time. The admission price was high with a small discount for students. Don't miss this place!",
          "This is a superb experience for photographic lovers. There is a constantly changing series of exhibits together with a permanent collection. The current exhibits featuring fashion photography and the fight to save our oceans are both spectacular. the restaurant is gorgeous",
          "Great exhibition with photos of famous pictures, kind of easy art but that is very interesting to see. Not too big either so 1-2 hours is enough. They have a excellent restaurant with a great view over Old Town and Djurgarden, really recommend something to eat at the restaurant.",
          "Very nicely situated this museum has a large exhibition area that is often well used. Well known photographers and At many occasions more exciting stuff. The restaurant is excellent.",
          "It's a large warehouse with photos spread out between two floors. It's nice; I just didn't find too many of them very appealing. The McCartney photos don't label the photographer (mother or daughter) even though many are not obvious. Also, I remember when it was cool for a",
          "What an expeerience ! Great art, great food and great view of Stockholm. My new go-to place in Stockholm.",
          "I enjoyed wandering around admiring all the different exhibitions. I came here mainly to see the photos of Paul & Linda McCarthy's daughter. Unfortunately I thought her work was way below the quality of work of the other exhibitors.",
          "Fotografiska is a lovely showcase for photography. There's plenty of space for the revolving cast of exhibitions to be laid out and an interesting variety of work, at least when we visited, from high fashion to wildlife. And, as an added bonus, there's a nice cafe with fab views",
          "List of viewed exhibits when we visited, the first two were both excellent and must sees. The others had interesting parts but needed less time fortunately as we were on a restricted time schedule. Exhibitions today 09:00 - 23:00 Paul Nicklen and Cristina Mittermeier \u27f6",

          "Great place to recollect some old rock or pop band, animals or other. But afterwards you might have planned a company dinner? In that case, unless all are millenals from the developing world, note the food we had was to 90% vegetarian! Everyone around me asked if I wanted the",
          "This was a last minute decision to tour this in Sweden. I thought it was very interesting. If you have any children under the age of 18, I would not suggest visiting this place. If you have an interest in photography, you should definitely visit. The restaurant upstairs",
          "As I said before.. a visit to Fotografiska will leave you satisfied (only one time I was dussapointed). The exhibitions this time were nice.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed seeing the diverse range of exhibitions at the Fotografiska. A well thought out gallery which is suitable for everyone. It currently has a very powerful exhibition about the crisis faced by our oceans which was really eye-opening. The cafe on the top floor",
          "This museum was fantastic but especially the Sea to Legacy exhibit that features the work of Paul Nicklen and other amazing sea-life photographers. The other rotating galleries were also really cool and it\u2019s clear this is a high end museum. For anyone who likes photographs,",

          "Best herring in Stockholm at a very reasonable price! Exhibition also worth it although a bit of a walk to get there from the bus station. Worth it!",
          "Superb photography exhibits, changing during the year. I enjoyed very much educating my children about composition in images. My only complaint is about the restaurant that was closed for lunch before 17:00, with a caf\u00e9 that was offering scarce food at high prices. The view from",
          "This museum offers a lot about photography and temporary exhibitions are often beautiful and full of meaning (\"I have a dream\" was amazing and we felt really affected by it). Before leaving this beautiful building, go to the coffee to have a break with a perfect view. You'll not",
          "Quite interesting pictures from about 6 different artists. Very varied. Not enough explanation as they mainly let the photos tell the story.",
          "The gallery holds a number of photographic exhibitions in a variety of styles. I liked the Mary and Linda McCartney and the natural history themes displays the most however there is a variety of styles of photography on display. Upstairs there is a cafe with great views across",
          "We don\u2019t know much about photography but having seen so many recommendations for Fotografiska we thought we would give it a go. Such a varied and interesting content, I would definitely visit again if in Stockholm",
          "If you love photography and taking photos you will love it here . Fantastic display depends what exhibits at what time . GreAt large screens with videos of photography , the set up is amazing ! Then cafe a bonus as well ! Worth the visit loved it !",
          "We thought we'd check out this museum and we were not dissapointed. There were several exhibitions on. Some were very interesting and some odd and thought provoking. A good way to spend a few hours. We also enjoyed a drink in the restaurant to revive and enjoy the view.",
          "This is a wonderful museum but the journey to reach it is a hassle involving a long walk from the meo station but do persist as this is an unusual but excellent museum. It is housed in an old building but inside all is modern. The exhibitions are changed at regular intervals",
          "Top museum experience in Stockholm and one of the finest photo museums we have visited. The curation of numerous diverse artists, the physical setting, and the educational experience are all tops. This should be the #1 stop for anyone visiting the city. The museum stays open",
          "A lovely old building remodeled inside to house Photographic Exhibits. There were 3 substantial and excellent exhibits there...all by different famous photographers. The fourth exhibit was less interesting to us, but if you liked off the cuff pics of famous people you would be",

          "If you are going to pick one museum when in Stockholm you should not miss this museum if you are into photography. Great exhibitions and great variety so you can keep coming back. The restaurant is worth a visit by itself. The view is beautiful and the food is amazing,",
          "Very good galleries, nice variety within exhibitions. Beautiful restaurant upstairs with a view and souvenir shop with great selection of books available. Day well spent, enjoy also cocktails on bar outside!",
          "A nice variety of photos, audiovisual media and exhibitions. I particularly liked the photos of marine life and ocean.",
          "For avid photographers this place is a must and should not be missed. The exhibits change often so you can keep coming back. If you get tired there is a restaurant with great food and amazing view of Gamla Stan. Don\u2019t miss this spot when you visit Stockholm.",
          "Really enjoyed looking around this gallery. A very wide selection of different styles was shown in the different exhibitions.",
          "We liked the music along with the photographs. The wildlife conservation photos and videos were good but repetitive - same video in 2 rooms. I still feel it is a gallery and not a museum - there is no photographic history at all such as you might expect and find at the wonderful",
          "We had a couple of individuals on our trip who are avid photographers and this is a must. We learned that they are opening additional museums including one in New York along the same lines.",
          "World class standard on all exhibitions! Well spent time. The restaurant is also of absolute top class with one of Sweden\u2019s most famous chefs running it. A little bit tricky to get there with public transportation. Walk from Slussen and you are there in a whiff.",
          "We have seen several exhibitions at Fotografiska and eaten at the vegetarian based restaurant. Both food and exhibitions are fantastic. Definitely worth a visit any time you are in Stockholm.",
          "This must be one of the best photography exhibition spaces around Europe. Numerous spacious display areas very well laid out. The only drawback is that it is a fair walk from the city centre and public transport not obvious.",
          "They have done a masterful job of restoring this building. It is located on the water and offers three floors of space. The gallery is spread over all three floors. The gift shop is quite adequate. Aside from the galleries, the standout room is their dining hall. There is a",

          "The exhibitions that are on at the moment are all splendid apart from Linda McCartney\u2019s amateurish efforts. It\u2019s a cool building and the restaurant was great and also pretty good value for Stockholm. Very stimulating",
          "If you love art, photography this is the place to be. Multiple small exhibitions with known and promising artists will blow your eyes and mind. Don't forget to have a drink or snack on top level under the roof of an old warehouse."

As a tourist, it is kind of hard to find something to do during the evening between the eating and bar crawling and sleep, but if you come here you can also look at art. This is a good spot to look at interesting photography, and catch a great view of the city at night.",
          "You can think that photography museum could be not interesting but when you visit Fotografiska you will admit that you was wrong.

          "Great little museum. They have a great exhibit going on right now.  Erik Johannson...really cool photos put together in such a creative way. I like the movie they have showing how he does it. You could spend a couple of hours here or if you like to take your time and read everything, 3-4 hours. Nice gift shop too.",
          "This place is a must see when  visiting Stockholm. The cafe on the top floor has great views across the city. It's a bit of a walk to get to it but some good scenery along the way. It has some great opening hours and is open long into the evening too.",

          "A great art museum. They have right now an exhibition of Eric Johansson's work. He takes photos of different things and blends them together in a very creative and funny way. You can even buy he's book were all the same photos are collected. There is a good restaurant whit views on the top floor.",
          "Really worthy place to visit!! No joke, they are opened for that long, and they do have party going on the top floor!\nThe exhibitions are lovely, well-made, but they are also kinda easy to digest, so it is really a nice pick for checking culture late night!!!",
          "They frequently change exhibitions which makes it a museum worth visiting often! Its a little pricy but worth it if you have time to go through all exhibitions. I believe that photography is an art form for most people so anyone could enjoy \u2026",

          "Amazing place! If you don\u2019t love photography, you will after your visit here! And also - extremely helpful and service minded staff, wonderful restaurant!",
          "Well put together, small museum with several levels and a restaurant & bar. Exhibits are well put together and were very interesting.",
          "Very interesting exhibitions. I especially liked Jimmy Nelson's photos that they had there this time. Fotografiska was easily reached and on our way to ferry terminal. They had nice museum shop and there's also nice-looking restaurant on the top floor. Have to visit again.",
          "Very nice photo-art museum. Also enjoy a glass of wine outside by the canal.",
          "Fotography is Art and as always, some people will like it while others will not. Additionally, the exihibitions change after a few month.\n\nIn our case, we enjoyed our visit and stayed for a few hours. The exhibitions had totally different \u2026",
          "There is currently a photo exhibition of Erik Johansson who is a photographer. He has so much imagination which is related to our everyday life and it's challenges. I love each and every piece displayed.",
          "The museum (you might call it a large exhibition as well) is for sure hyped more than it should be. 2 or maybe 3 hours is more than enough. Selection is not very impressive (as of Nov 2019) and the cafe is not what I expected it to be. \u2026",
          "Stockholm. Photo exhibit featuring work of Jimmy Nelson. Beautiful pieces very well chosen displayed and briefly explained. A rare collection of the rare colorful cultures of the world. Riveting.",
          "What an amazing exhibition! Especially Erik Johansson's magical work. Loved it!",
          "I have been here a few times the last year. Fantastic view, good food and pleasant service. Unfortunately the music is often so loud it is hard to have a conversation.",
          "Rotating art museum that was very interesting. When I was there, there was a massive difference in the floors that led to interesting discussion between those of us that went.",
          "One of the best museums I've ever been to - period. 6 exhibits meant a wide diversity of art to appreciate, and the cocktail bar + cafe on the top floor act as a reward at the end. Christian Houge's Residence of Impermanence especially blew us away - phenomenal work with a strong message.",
          "Must see in Stockholm. Exhibits were beyond excellent. Lots of space to move and cool place to go.",
          "Great museum to visit on S\u00f6dermalm, the ground floor with the edited images on exhibition are fantastic, however the upper floor photos were a little disappointing after so much colour and imagination. The restaurant is very nice with \u2026",
          "Very informative and interesting. We really enjoyed it, even though we picked a very busy day. Recommend.",
          "Stockholm's food scene is best exemplified by the restaurant at Fotografiska. Zero food waste and sustainable eating are top priorities of the menu. The views to the old town and Gr\u00f6nalund are wort the visit!",
          "Nice exhibits and it is open late. I especially enjoyed the augmented reality artwork. I walked here, but getting to this place is a bit tricky due to the construction. It is next to the tour boat dock.",
          "Great exhibitions. Polite staff. Enjoyed  it a lot.",
          "I love Fotografiska.. the space is great, I've seen amazing exhibitions which exceeded my expectations as well as sometimes being unexpected as I've been with the focus on seeing another exhibition,  only to find several brilliant ones at \u2026",
          "Really nice museum with awesome cocktail bar and restaurant! Great place for a night out",
          "I come to the Fotografiska Museum a couple of times per year. 4 or 5 exhibitions that rotate through the year and a fine cafeteria and restaurant on the upper floor with a very good view to the city. It is in my Top 5 things to do in Stockholm",
          "We\u2019ve been only to the restaurant and it\u2019s an amazing experience!\nDelicious fine food , made professionally and to perfection. \nSuitable for vegetarians and vegans.\nWine selection is very nice.\nGreat view of the city by the water (go at sunset time!)\nWould definitely visit again!!!",
          "Super cool!!! Very well designed museum, wonderful restaurant, can get a little crowded but the later afternoons are so so nice",
          "A compelling combination of location, view, dining and hanging out, plus a progressive exhibition and engagement programme. Galleries are big enough to hold sizeable shows, yet intimate enough not to be overwhelming or exhausting. The \u2026",
          "A great museum and a wonderful place to explore. The long opening hours and a welcome exception to other museums and one can plan a day or half a day in the museum. The temporary exhibitions are well curated and one can find at least one \u2026",
          "I had read great things about Sweden\u2019s contemporary photography museum and was able to check it out at the tail end of a business trip in May. \n\nStockholm has many amazing museums but Fotografiska far exceeded expectations and is my new \u2026",
          "Couldn't find a better photography gallery in the world if you tried. The exhibitions are always incredible, the layout inside amazing and the top floor cafe offers the best view of Stockholm you'll get. Go go go!",
          "Perfect. This is a wonderful place for photography lovers. I could go there all the time. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "I had a fantastic time here, the photo exhibits were seriously top notch. I liked the variety of photographers they displayed. Loved the whole experience.",
          "One of the best museums I've been in the past years.",
          "Amazing place if are visiting the city don't miss it.",
          "I purchased a one year membership. On the iPhone app it never says its automatically renovated, and I checked it to make sure it wasn\u2019t. After a year Fotografiska, without my consent or any warning, charged me for a second year. I contacted \u2026",
          "Amazing place, great exhibitions and superb restaurant / bar / chill out zone on the top floor with great views on the harbour \n\nThanks to long opening hours (11 pm weekdays, 1 am weekend) I would recommended making it last stop for a day. Dedicate minimum 2h for exhibitions",
          "Worth every penny. Amazing exhibitions and nice atmosphere.",
          "Was here with work and we had booked dinner which apparently didn\u2019t include the galleries... food is special with ups and downs. Great quality but small portions and a clear veggie focus. The mushroom-sandwich was one of the best I had the other dishes didn\u2019t reach the same level.",
          "One of the best galleries I have ever been! Awesome exhibitions, awesome photographers and the curator really know what is doing! If you ever visit Stockholm, you must visit Fotografiska",
          "We initially expected to see nothing special here; however, it turns to amazing and impressive place to us. Highly recommend to visit this place.",
          "Amazing artists. Great place to unwind in the restaurant or the bar.",
          "While the exhibition was very interesting we could hardly see any of the artwork due to the extreme amount of people inside. Alcohol was being served also, meaning the general public's poor behavior was amplified. You'd get pushed \u2026",
          "Super cool exhibits, fun atmosphere, open late",
          "a great museum for people who love creative photos!",
          "Good one for the photography lovers and photoshopped images been seen in the walls was wonderful..",
          "This place is a true gem and my favorite museum in Stockholm. The exhibitions are true snapshots of different aspects of life, from more modern and abstract photography to collection of portraits and personal stories. The cafe/restaurant is the icing on the cake.",
          "Definitely worth to visit. The location, directly at the water front, creates a memorable experience especially the view in the cafe and the restaurant. The exhibitions in October 2019 were impressive and varied. The number of exhibits could have been bigger, in relation to the entrance fee.",
          "One of the best museums in Stockholm with some really cool exhibitions.",
          "If you are interested in the Photo Exhibition then you should visit Fotografiska.  It is a fantastic place and there is a beautiful view to Stockholm City",
          "Great museum. Lot of artworks gave  a true personal experience (reflection, spectacular surprise, amusement). Didnt fancy the menues in the cafe since there were no meals for kids. Restaurant needs to be booked in advance.",
          "Very interesting place and time flied! Awesome lockers to put your stuff in and the collections change every few months or so. Definitely a mustgo if youre in Stockholm!",
          "My partner and I visited the exhibition in January '20. She showed fascinating photographs and captivated us very much.",
          "If you like pointing a camera at things, you gotta see this one:)",
          "Easily one of the top 3 museums/locations one should visit when in Stockholm.\n\nAlso home to one of Stockholms best vegetarian restaurants, albeit quite pricey. \nNew for this year was also the bar out front with plenty seats and some amazing \u2026",
          "The collection is one of the best modern art work. Upstairs there is award winning restaurant as well. Very nice view.",
          "Excellent guided tour of Erik Johansson's fantasy photography with the opportunity to take personal pics of a staged version of his Moon service scene. An extremely popular museum in no small part related to the caf\u00e9/ restaurant with unbeatable views of Stockholm. Very busy as a result.",
          "The museum isn't my best place, but the Caff\u00e8 and restaurant at last floor is amazing with a view on the bay, top top top",
          "Amazing collection of photographs! People who love photography, I think they must visit Fotografiska. Can be made little more interesting but it depends on personal taste! View surrounding the Fotografiska is very good especially in the evening time!",
          "Each floor has different unique exhibitions by different photographers. I highly recommend try the croissant in the cafe on the top floor. This is the best I have ever had. Views from the cafe is also amazing, you can see Galma Stan and islands.",
          "Always an eye-opening experience. Grab a kanel and a capp on the top floor for a perfect view of the harbor.",
          "Been there two times now, exhibitions are are a good mix of different styles of photography. Don't forget to visit the cafeteria or restaurant, good food and amazing view on the city skyline.",
          "The place is like a labyrinth after you pass the tickets stands. Is kind of expensive when you clmpare it with other museums, but the installations worth it. Make the effort you won't be dissapointed.\nThere's a bar/cafe upstairs.",
          "Definitely worth to visit, good for shopping posters to the house",
          "Best concept I have never seen so far. The museum is vibrant, you can go in the evening and have food or a drink at the restaurant and they also have a club. I wish there were more places like that.",
          "Fotografiska\u2018s food philosophy is \u2019Sustainable pleasure\u2019; throwing food away is completely against their philosophy and the team is constantly finding new ways to reuse and up-cycle ingredients to use in the dishes. These pancakes are made \u2026",
          "Contemporary photography art, great restaurant and view of Stockholm makes for a perfect 2-3 hour visit.",
          "For anyone liking photography, or even just art, a very beautiful museum. Their choice of photographers presented is well above the average contemporary photography seen in too many other places. Shame that most people post irrelevant pictures of the view seen from nearby the museum: the museum is really not about the view.",
          "Being a professional photographer, visiting this place was a must-do! I recommend going for the highend but sustainable brunch with views over Stockholm before going on with the visits of the museum. The quality of the artists displayed is \u2026",
          "Interesting place to visit, but pretty small. The choice of the artists... The half of them very really good, but the other one - not interesting at all - but it might be just a matter of taste.",
          "Nice exhibitions. Great food with a great view! Good service! Love this place!",
          "I highly recommend Fotografiska if you love photography. The exhibitions are first class. The restaurant is great and has a beautiful view. There is construction work ongoing around Fotografiska which makes it a bit tricky to reach. If you \u2026",
          "If you are interested in photos this is worth the visit. Check whats on prior. Great view from the cafe and postcards!",
          "Bought the tickets to Fotografiska through Klook which is accepted here as well. The museum is located along the waterfront, a short walk from Slussen Station. There are some works going on around the museum which means the usual routes \u2026",
          "A real mecca for photographers and viewers alike. I've never been disappointed.\n\nAdditionally, the restaurant on the uppermost floor is a gem. It may be pricy, but it serves up some of the finest season-based dining money can buy. Having put real thought into their sustainability model, a great choice for vegans and meat-lovers alike.",
          "This museum is so awesome and cool. It was one of my favorite places when I visited Stockholm. The museum does not close until 11 PM, and he has a very cool outdoor bar with a beautiful view of the water. The exhibitions are gray, and the photographs are beyond pretty. I highly recommend this.",
          "Fotografiska is one of my favourite Museums in Stockholm being a photography enthusiats I always find an exibit I love.",
          "Different exhibition every other regular time, visitor will find and learn different things each time. Picture will make people see in a different view",
          "It used be good when you could go the caf\u00e9 without paying the gallery entrance fee. Now you have to pay 160 kr just to go up there! The gallery is good if you are going for that",
          "Nice museum with nice art and photo collection. The views form the restuarant is really great. The museum store has nice stuff to buy. However, giving 4 stars as I felt the entry cost is a bit high for the small size of the museum.",
          "It is definitely a must visit place to see. It has couple of exhibitions on two floors, and nice restaurant with a view on the city on the third floor. Stuff is nice. They have a discount for students (you have to have some confirmation \u2026",
          "I love this place... Perfect to visit and learn",
          "Always amazed by the shows. Very diverse exhibitions and high quality! One of the best museums in Stockholm!",

          "Amazing museum - beautiful artwork with great lighting",
          "Well designed building and great exhibitions. The view from the bar is amazing.",
          "Great exhibitions with an amazing outfit. And the plus is the bar and restaurant at the top floor, with one of the best viewpoints in Stockholm. Open till late, weekends and weekdays",
          "A wonderful museum for photography lovers.  Also home to a good restaurant with nice views.",
          "Nice compact design makes it an easy visit. We'll worth it!",
          "Exhibitions of ideas, imagination, today's life, world, people their thinking  thru photos clicked, edited and summarised by different very well known photographers around the world are very interesting, and have deep meaning and thoughts. Loved the place.exhibition of photos of  photographers changes periodically in 2-3 months.",
          "Love it, been several times.",
          "Beautiful exhibition of portraits of indigenous people from around the world. Beautiful cafe with an overlook of the water",
          "One of my favorite museums in Stockholm. Every visit has been good. Everytime there has been very nice variations in the expositions. It's also a good museum for someone that doesn't really understand art so much, like me :-)",
          "What an experience! Just a beautiful place with beautiful art! Loved the gift shop in the beginning, lots of interesting little things and books.",
          "A photographic museum which is easily in the top few worldwide. A must-visit if you're in Stockholm and just vaguely interested in photography.\nAlso the store is extremely well sorted.\nNot overcrowded, fair prices.\nLovely place.\n\nBonus, a really weird sculpture in front o it.\nThese are the infos that count!",
          "Nothing special, waste of money.",
          "Very nice exposition, nice bar with view on the water",
          "Very exciting photo exhibition! It work till 12 at night so you can visit it any time.",
          "One of the best museum in Stockholm. It is definitely worth a visit",
          "To go to the restaurant with the amazing view you need to purchase a museum ticket (150 SEK per person). This is NOT a museum. It's a small gallery which in my opinion lacks a message. However all rooms do have themes. Their shop is very \u2026",
          "The museum has interesting selections to see, and a restaurant and cafe to sit and relax. In particular, I truly loved the view of sunset in the cafe, and spend more than an hour there with a beer and sandwich alone. The museum and view are \u2026",
          "Great photography. Artistic. Ferry stops here.",
          "Food and view are great! From current expositions we only liked Erik Johanssons Beyond.",
          "Great art! It's so easy to spend hours in there!",
          "Great experience. Creative meals",
          "One of my favorite spots in Stockholm. Amazing city view from the restaurant, which serves really good food. A bit expensive though if you are traveling on a bit restricted budget, but having a coffee and bun or a glass of wine with that \u2026",
          "Always cool exhibitions that make you think. And new ones all the time.",
          "I was mislead by the word \"museum\" and expected old cameras and lenses. But it's more a gallery showing the photographs of great artists. As such it was very good. Especially the lighting of the photographs was excellent with no distractions or reflections.\n\nIncluding a drink outside in the sun I spent several hours there.",
          "Went to go for a drink. Done that before. This time we had to pay the fee for the museum based on the statement that the bar was full. It was indeed empty. Do love the location.",
          "Amazing!!! Truly inspired and moved by the exhibitions. What's even better is their usually open til 11pm most days and even 1am on others, so definitely worth finishing off your day here. A must go.",
          "Nice exhibitions, friendly staff. A bit of walk from underground station, about 600m",

          "Very nice place. Must visit once in Stockholm",
          "One of the most impressive museums I have ever been to. Efficient and artistic layout and design that accentuates all of the great work displayed inside. Restaurant has great food and amazing views as well. A must see in Stockholm with everything you need to have an incredible 2-3 hours.",
          "You need to go if youre in Stockholm, and then eat at the restaurant with a beautifull view of the city.",
          "I enjoyed this museum but note I like photography in general. I read some words at the entrance: \"Photography is a way to show history\". It's not cheap but in my opinion, it definitely deserves a visit.",
          "Really interesting exhibitions. Free lockers for bags. Clean toilets. Nice view from the pricy Caf\u00e9.",
          "Great museum. It changes constantly. But you should check what photographers they are displaying before going. Take some time at the end to have coffee and/or wine with a  beautiful view of the city.",

          "Always an excellent selection of photographic art!",
          "Not only the museum itself is brilliant, this place has a beautiful cafe too.\n\nWhen I went there, the route from st. wasn't really pleasant because a lot of roadworks had been done. But soon after entered the museum, groomy feelings got disappeared.",
          "This was a very interesting experience. I really liked the exhibition and the restaurant on the top floor is really nice.  it would be nice to be able to go to the restaurant without paying for the exhibition (as a great place to write on the regular bases).",

          "Amazing place, with really wel presented art pieces.",

          "Love this museum, art center exhibition! The coffee shop/ restaurant it\u2019s also nice with a industrial decor",
          "Obviously, the experience would depend on what is exhibited on the day of your visit, but other than that,  it is a good modern museum in a very good location. There are usually several exhibits running, so you have high chances to find something that would suit your taste. There's also a cafe/bar and a decent gift shop.",
          "Very nice museum with good atmosphere and amazing sea view up in the restaurant/cafe.",
          "Awesome museum!",
          "You cannot beat the view from this restaurant. The food is excellent and exceptionally clean tasting. The only reason for the 4 stars is that the food is not cheap but half the time you feel that you could eat double what they give you.",
          "Great place to spend a day at!",
          "Great exhibitions, and a special caf\u00e9 and restaurant on the top top floor with a special view on the harbor.",

          "Amazing restaurant. Only saw limited exhibits but the experience was incredible and memorable",
          "A very good museum for anyone who loves photography. I was totally smashed by the work of James Nachtwey - such a humane and humanitarian look capturing unimaginable human scenarios. Totally worth visiting!",
          "Beautifully curated and displayed. Very nice cafe upstairs. Nice selection of books for sale. Recommend.",
          "Incredible museum!\nThe exhibitions are changing all the time, when I\u2019ve been there, there were 4 amazing exhibitions.\nVery impressive!",
          "This is a pretty excellent museum, also because there's a bar on the roof. Usually fields some excellent photo exhibits!",

          "One of the best museums of photography in the world.",
          "Fotografiska is one of the best photography museums we visited. They had an interesting collection and exhibits. The restaurant and cafe in the museum are also notable, especially with the great view the have. This museum is a definitive must see when yoi visit Stockholm and are interested in photography.",
          "My first google 5 stars\n\nDamn, this is a nice place.\n\nI\u2019ll be short: there\u2019s a rooftop bar with a more than capable expert who will provide you with the good stuff and you can go down and enjoy the art gallery while drinking - check out my Moscow Mule - in the middle of the exhibition.\nF*, this place was amazing... only in stockolm",
          "Cool place to visit.",
          "Amazing art works \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",
          "Great place for photography fans. Different exhibitions are held here throughout the year. It also have a cafe which gives a stunning of of Stockholm skyline. Must go for all photography fans or budding photographers- you\u2019ll be inspired.",
          "My first time here, I would come back even though the current main exhibition is of questionable merit. I'll get to that in a second. The museum itself seems to be of high-quality with room for a different exhibitions. The restaurant and \u2026",
          "Super cool museum about photography, with multiple exhibitions. Beware that it can get crowded on the weekends, but nothing that ruins it. The coffee in the last floor has an amazing view of the city. Everything works fine and it is easy to get around. Helpful staff.",
          "Best photo gallery ever visited! Must for everyone and not just photographers.",
          "A must see for the photography enthusiast! I was so lucky to see an very inspiring exhibition by J. Walderstaen. It is also great that they provided cute and witty posters on the way to the place throughout the construction area. Once you are done, grab a drink on the cafe upstairs to return back to reality.",
          "Great museum with amazing temp exhibitions. I love this place",
          "What a beautiful and interesting museum! The photos are the artists capture your attention! Definitely worth the visit. And the bar on top floor is awesome!",
          "Really great photo exhibits here. And has a bar/eatery at the top. I\u2019d suggest they sell some sort of camera in the gift shop.",
          "The museum itself is a great place in a great location, probably a Stockholm must-see. The exhibitions, however were a mixed bag - some sad, some disturbing, some really entertaining and mind-broadening. But that is part of the concept. For \u2026",
          "Nice museum. Pricy tickets.",

          "One of the best exhibits I have ever been too!",
          "Was lucky to see Vincent Peters\u2019 \u201cLight Within\u201d. Other 3 or 4 exhibits were not impressive yet interesting. I liked the museum displayed some clips on how to beat take photos on mobile phone - a good value from a credible source like a photography museum.",
          "Not really a museum (there is no library for example as a decent museum would have) but great exhibitions with varying content. The cafe is good but quite pricey/ small portions. I notice they make their own kommun but I have  tried it",
          "A very nice museum themed around photography. Nice layout. A beautiful cafe on top floor.",
          "Sometimes they have really cool exhibitions. Worth checking on the webpage before visiting.",
          "Impactful photos. Experimental yet classy!",
          "This is, by far, one of the best photography museums/galleries that we have visited in the past decade.  If you ever visit Stockholm, Sweden, this is the must-see for art/photography lovers - highly recommend!  By the way, they have an excellent cafe too :)",
          "The exhibits are amazing, not to mention the bar and restaurant upstairs! Out of all the museums I saw throughout Europe, this one was by far my favorite. Also, one of the major benefits of this museum was that they are open extremely late, so no need to rush after work on a weekday to get there as you would with a normal museum.",
          "Amazing museum! You can get a student discount, which we did. Some really interesting, beautiful, and harrowing photography exhibits",
          "Enjoyed every bit of it ...the walk to it wasn\u2019t funny as I wasn\u2019t driving or in a cab but every single art was amazing \ud83d\ude42\u2600\ufe0fAlso if you\u2019re a tourist, make sure to go with your debit or credit cards because they don\u2019t accept Cash payments",
          "As always, high quality interesting exibition",
          "The most open museum in the world. If you are into photography this is a must see. Really enjoyed the experience.",
          "Really interesting exhibition, really worth a visit. We ordered the ticket online, worked great!",
          "Great museum. Restaurant serves delicious food at ridiculously high prices, considering the size of the dishes.",
          "The museum is really amazing. It feels like it follows a very modern approach and there are not many places to provide a photography museum. The collections are really well assembled and presented. The gift shop has some really original and funny books which would make unusual souvenirs.",
          "Photograph displayed are awesome",
          "I didn't have much time,  but the little I saw,  it's paradise for photographers... Me too! \nIt has a cafe as well!  Best part,  they are right beside the ship I work\ud83d\ude01",
          "Great exhibitions & open late!  \nOn a busy few days exploring Stockholm I was so thankful Fotografiska stays open late at night. I finally got there on my last night and I was glad I did. A great variety of excellent exhibitions beautifully \u2026",
          "Locating Fotografiska was easy and fun, with all the billboards telling you where to go (from Slussen). The building is picturesque and quite easy to find. Checking in was super fast and the front desk people were very professional and nice \u2026",
          "The requirements to download multiple apps on very slow wifi in order to fully experience the exhibitions was quite annoying. Otherwise it was interesting.",
          "This is not a museum, it is an exhibition gallery and it is comercialy oriented in every aspect of what I have seen. Selling drinks in the middle of the exhibition?! Many people had the drinks so they liked it but that palso shows that \u2026",
          "Fantastic museum with a great cafe/restaurant on the top floor (lake view)",
          "I would call myself a keen (amateur) photographer but this was very (emotionally) hard to see as the day we went most of downstairs was devoted to war, famine, death. The Hollywood portraits were interesting. The sea rubbish collection well was just that rubbish.",
          "This is a great museum if you're interested in photography. I would recommend taking 2 to 3 hours to see the whole museum and then enjoy fika or dinner/lunch in their caf\u00e9 or restaurant. There is usually four different exhibitions going on \u2026",
          "Meticulously curated gallery that engages with the audience from contrasting and intricate layers.",
          "Very nice museum of photography. The museum had a really interesting exhibitions during my visit there. Good photography. There is a really big restaurant / cafe on the upper level with a great view over the harbour. I would risk to say they have the best coffee in Stockholm here.",
          "James Nachtwey's expo is exquisite with prints having an extraordinary quality. Although a small exhibition, it is of great quality.",
          "One of the most beautiful museums I have ever visited! Not to be missed!!!",
          "The expositions change so it's one of those places that must always be on your list. Social aware and implicated. Recommended. Added bonus: great views of the city from the bar/restaurant floor.",
          "The museum is a must-see of Stockholm, it is situated outside the tourist trail and it feels like a very cool modern hub of the city, with a huge cafe on top floor with an amazing view. On the minus side I would say was that we had to pay full entry even though there were 2 collections instead of 3, and yet still the money was worth.",
          "Exhibitions change frequently and they're always mixed so there is always a exhibition that you like. They do not shy away from controversial exhibitions either. As right now there is a exhibition by James Nachtwey which is quite confronting. The view from the cafe is permanent and amaxing.",
          "Great exhibitions, this was my favourite art gallery in Stockholm. Also serves good coffee and lunch. Opens early and stays open late. Great museum shop.",
          "Very deep minded exhibitions with strong emotional pictures. I will come back at any time.",
          "A real hidden gem.  The gallery is open until 11pm.  Really worth the visit.",
          "Amazing contemporary photo gallery with a lovely cafe on the top floor with great views over Stockholm.",
          "Great museum even for people who doesn't like photography! Very eye opening. Definitely worth the visit. even if you been there go back again as the exhibition changes every few weeks. The museum has very good explanations with every \u2026",
          "Greatly organized museum. But I was expecting to see more than just three photographers at the time. Didn't know it's constantly changing and doesn't have permanent exhibition at all. Probably, my bad.",
          "It's a little difficult to get to with all the construction,  but well worth the effort.  Lovely, innovative and thought provoking.",
          "Absolutley fantastic experience. Thought provoking, pure and raw. Must visit place for every photography lover.",
          "Nice photography museum. Currently, there are many renovations that take place around Slussen, where Fotografiska is located, and it really helped that Fotografiska hang many posters indicating the direction of the museum. It is a really \u2026",

          "Good place to visit \ud83d\ude0a",

          "I was looking for something a little different, and this place was just that! Very enjoyable visit. Not crowded, and an intimate experience. Highly recommended.",
          "Great photos simply displayed but not quite as many exhibits as I would have liked for the money",
          "Tasty food, but left me still feeling hungry",

          "Very good exposition last week",
          "Visited this museum during my stay in Stockholm  for Swedish House Mafia - The Reunion.\nWe were lucky enough to arrive 5 minutes before the  visited guide started and it was great explanation about the different exhibitions. The SHM exhibition was nothing special but just some random drawings.",
          "The best photography museum in Scandinavia",
          "Loved the place. Permanent and temporary exhibitions were thoughtfully placed. Spent slightly over an hour there.",
          "Great place with very interesting painting and photo! The exhibition was related to a modern and contemporary art in Stockholm.. same was published in metro station!",
          "Great views, very impressive exhibitions which changes every several months. Recommended to visit",
          "Though a great place .. do not go if you are not a vege ..",
          "Definitely dependent on the exhibits. There were only three when we went. Cafe has great views. Long walk from subway.",
          "Super cool museum with great exhibitions. In the gift shop there are so many original souvenirs, but they are a bit pricey tho.",
          "Really enjoyed the current exhibit of Vincent Peters' work. The other rotating exhibits were interesting as well.",

          "One of the best attractions in Stockholm! Highly recommended",
          "Very cool exhibitions, definitely for those who are into photography",
          "Loved seeing the exhibitions at night. Loved the view from the cafe. It\u2019s one of the best in Stockhom, just like their raspberry macarons.",
          "Quite interesting place. But do not plan to spend here more than 2h. Not possible to park anywhere near and hard to reach by walking too because the continuous construction around the area (what was there 2years ago.  ).\nThe staff is kind \u2026",
          "A very beautiful galery. A lot of arts item to see. A very friendly restaurant and bar. Very impressive. ..You must go there to see it.",
          "Marvellous venue that really let the Photos talk! Only problems: Takes at least two visits to cover all exhibits... And price level a bit steep in general. However; would invest in the annual membership; 'bit costly but worth every \u2026",
          "A bit small but nice!!!!",
          "Obviously, depending on if you like the photographers currently being exhibited, this is a very nice place to go. Located at the waterfront of Stockholm with a fantastic view. Fotografiska has a good restaurant and a museum store where you \u2026",

          "Fantastic exhibition with Jimmy Nelson and Christian Houge!",
          "Enchanting, provocative exhibits. Their weekend hours are unmatched - till 01:00. The restaurant is memorable, albeit pricey - I won't easily forget the compost-baked onion I enjoyed. Though it's a bit of a hike, it's well-worth it.",
          "Nice museum with breathtaking photos.",

          "A great space with amazing photos.",
          "Nice to spend some time in a rainy day",

        "wiki": "The Stockholm City Hall (Swedish: Stockholms stadshus or Stadshuset locally) is the building of the Municipal Council for the City of Stockholm in Sweden. It stands on the eastern tip of Kungsholmen island, next to Riddarfj\u00e4rden's northern shore and facing the islands of Riddarholmen and S\u00f6dermalm. It houses offices and conference rooms as well as ceremonial halls, and the luxury restaurant Stadshusk\u00e4llaren. It is the venue of the Nobel Prize banquet and is one of Stockholm's major tourist attractions.\n\n\n== Site and construction ==\nIn 1907 the city council decided to build a new city hall at the former site of Eldkvarn. An architectural contest was held which in the first stage resulted in the selection of drafts by Ragnar \u00d6stberg, Carl Westman, Ivar Tengbom jointly with Ernst Torulf, and Carl Bergsten. After a further competition between Westman and \u00d6stberg the latter was assigned to the construction of the City Hall, while the former was asked to construct Stockholm Court House. \u00d6stberg modified his original draft using elements of Westman's project, including the tower. During the construction period, \u00d6stberg constantly reworked his plans, resulting in the addition of the lantern on top of the tower, and the abandonment of the blue glazed tiles for the Blue Hall.\nOskar Asker was employed as construction leader and Paul Toll, of the construction company Kreuger & Toll, designed the foundations. Georg Greve also assisted in preparing the plans. The construction took twelve years, from 1911 to 1923. Nearly eight million red bricks were used. The dark red bricks, called \"munktegel\" (monks's brick) because of their traditional use in the construction of monasteries and churches, were provided by Lina brick factory near S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje. Construction was carried out by craftsmen using traditional techniques.\nThe building was inaugurated on 23 June 1923, exactly 400 years after Gustav Vasa's arrival in Stockholm. Verner von Heidenstam and Hjalmar Branting delivered the inaugurational speeches.\n\n\n== Architecture and style ==\nThe site, adjacent to Stadshusbron, being bordered by the streets of Hantverkargatan and Norr M\u00e4larstrand to the north and west, and the shore of Riddarfj\u00e4rden to the south and east, allowed for a spacious layout. The building follows a roughly rectangular ground plan. It is built around two open spaces, a piazza called Borgarg\u00e5rden on the eastern side, and the Blue Hall (Bl\u00e5 hallen) to the west.\nThe Blue Hall, with its straight walls and arcades, incorporates elements of a representative courtyard. Its walls are in fact without blue decorations, but it has kept its name after \u00d6stberg's original design. It is known as the dining hall used for the banquet held after the annual Nobel Prize award ceremony. The organ in the Blue Hall is with its 10,270 pipes the largest in Scandinavia. Above the Blue Hall lies the Golden Hall (Gyllene Salen), named after the decorative mosaics made of more than 18 million tiles. The mosaics make use of motifs from Swedish history. They were executed by the Berlin, Germany, firm of Puhl & Wagner (Gottfried Heinersdorff), after nine years of negotiations by Gottfried Heinersdorff (1883-1941) for the commission.\nThe southeast corner of the building, immediately adjacent to the shore, is marked by a monumental tower crowned by the Three Crowns, an old national symbol for Sweden. The tower is 106 metres high and is accessible by an elevator or by a stair of 365 steps. The eastern side of its base is decorated with a gold-plated cenotaph of 13th century Swedish statesman Birger Jarl.\nStadshuset is considered one of Sweden's foremost examples of national romanticism in architecture. The unique site, overlooking Riddarfj\u00e4rden, inspired a central motif of the construction, namely the juxtaposition of city architecture and water that also represents a central feature of Stockholm's cityscape as a whole. The architectural style is one of refined eclecticism, blending massive, austere, North European brick construction and playful elements reminiscent of oriental and venetian architecture, such as turrets adorned with golden starlets, decorated balconies, wooden masts, and statues.\nStockholm City Hall has been the location of a number of cultural productions, including the 1991 music video Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave) by Swedish pop duo Roxette.\n\n\n== Stadshusparken ==\nThe small park between the building and Lake M\u00e4laren's shore is adorned with several sculptures, among them Carl Eldh's ensemble representing the three artists August Strindberg, Gustaf Fr\u00f6ding and Ernst Josephson, as well as Eldh's bronze sculptures \"S\u00e5ngen\" and \"Dansen\" (\"The Song\" and \"The Dance\"). To the south-east of the City Hall, facing Riddarholmen, is a pillar roughly 20 meters tall with a statue of Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson on top.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Stockholm\nHistory of Stockholm\nList of streets and squares in Gamla stan\nGeography of Stockholm\nStockholm Court House\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Stockholm City Hall at Wikimedia Commons\n\nStockholm City: Official city hall pages\nCityMayors.com: Stockholm City Hall\nStockholm360.net: Virtual Tour of Stockholm City Hall \u2014 with 360 x 180 degree panoramas.",

          "When you walk in, it is difficult to find the ticket office. Beware that there are TWO offices: one for the tower and one for city hall. I wanted to see the city hall but ended up veering to the wrong office and bought a ticket for the tower. The tower was nice, but not worth",

It\u2019s hard to believe, but it was finished only in 1923 and not in the 15th or 16th century, as one may think. We enjoyed our guided tour in English (takes place every hour,",

          "Went there in winter so very slippery and ice underfoot. You can't get into the building in total, but can see the courtyards, gardens and river access. In winter there are people skating on the river",
          "The City hall is special because of the Nobel prize which is world renown. It's a beautiful brick structure itself, but it's association with the Nobel prize makes it worth a visit.",

          "Definitely worth a visit which has to be done through a guided tour which leave on the hour. The architecture is very odd, and gives an impression they just mashed together lots of different styles. It is still worth a visit",

          "Do not miss this visit! Very beautiful building - with an excellent tour. Felt like a Nobel laureate!",
          "This is just the opposite of the parliament building - grand City Hall vs austere Parliament House. Very opulent workplace for the Stockholm city council members. This is also the place for the Nobel Prize ceremony. We loved the interiors and the architecture of the place.",
          "A nice building again with part of the history being given by the tour guide. Only spend about an hour there to marvel at the place",

          "I entered the city hall on a special organized night tour. This is a building with traditions and a symbol of Stockholm. I strongly recommend visiting it. 2-3 hours are enough for the tour and to enjoy the nice garden.",

          "I wasn't expecting the gilt opulence of the Gold Room. Very memorable. You must take a tour to see the inside, which was well worth it. We also went to the top of the tower for a spectacular view of the city. It was a beautiful clear day, so we were able to see in all",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect, but the building is beautiful and the tour gives a good bit of information on the history and functions of the building (Nobel Awards Dinner/Dance, etc.) Take some time to go visit!",

          "Although it looks older, the building is only a bit over 100 years old. Still, it reeks of history and has a lot of interesting design features. It's right near the old town (Gamla Stan) so is worth a visit if you are in that part of the city.",
          "The city hall is the biggest and most beautiful architecture in Stockholm, it has a amazing view from the garden and the top of the tower, but the rooms that you need to have and pay a guided tour for, takes too long and the guides are very boring so I would say that's not worth",
          "We had a local guide for our tour group. City Hall was one of our stops. The outside grounds are gorgeous and right on the river. We went inside and with the guide we were told the story about the Nobel banquet held in the blue room which isn\u2019t blue at all! The Princes Room",

          "Very handsome official building -- not that old - finished in 1923. Distinctive colored/shaped brick used: \"monks brick\" that, is supposed to convey a sense of \"national romanticism\". Special note of the three golden crowns on the top of the steeple - they look small, but",
          "The only way to see City Hall is with a guided tour. Depending on the time of year, they run every half hour or every hour. The building is lovely and the guide very informative.",

          "Very worth the tour given by our guide Maria. She gave us a lot of details about the building, the poltical activities and the other events held such as the Nobel prize's banquet or the Saturday's civil weddings. We arrived at 10:20 and joint with no reservation to the 10:30",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Djurg\u00e5rden (Swedish pronunciation: [\u02c8j\u0289\u030c\u02d0(r)\u0261\u0254\u0273] or [\u02c8j\u0289\u0302\u02d0r\u02cc\u0261o\u02d0\u0256\u025bn] (listen)) or, more officially, Kungliga Djurg\u00e5rden (Swedish for '\"The (Royal) Game Park\"'), is an island in central Stockholm, Sweden. Djurg\u00e5rden is home to historical buildings and monuments, museums, galleries, the amusement park Gr\u00f6na Lund, the open-air museum Skansen, the small residential area Djurg\u00e5rdsstaden, yacht harbours, and extensive stretches of forest and meadows. It is one of the Stockholmers' favorite recreation areas and tourist destinations alike, attracting over 10 million visitors per year, of which some 5 million come to visit the museums and amusement park. The island belongs to the National City park founded in 1995. Since the 15th century the Swedish monarch has owned or held the right of disposition of Royal Djurg\u00e5rden. Today, this right is exercised by the Royal Djurg\u00e5rden Administration which is a part of the Royal Court of Sweden.\nA larger area of the city, separated from Djurg\u00e5rden proper by Djurg\u00e5rdsbrunnsviken is Norra Djurg\u00e5rden (Northern Djurg\u00e5rden), including G\u00e4rdet.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDjurg\u00e5rden was until the 16th century known as Valmunds\u00f6 (spelled \nWalmunz\u00f8 (1286), Walmundz\u00f8 (1288), Walmanz\u00f6 (1349), Wadhmundz\u00f8\u00f8 (1432), Wadhmals\u00f8 (1437), Wadmals\u00f6 (1444), Walmundz\u00f6n (1452), Walmas\u00f6\u00f6n (1511), Walmars\u00f6\u00f6 (1516), Wallmars\u00f6n, Waldemarks\u00f6n (17th century)) and this name is still preserved in locations such as Waldemarsudde. Though several proposals to explain this name have been put forward, no authoritative explanation is generally accepted. While the name of King Valdemar (1239\u20131302) was probably associated with the old name during the 17th century, the separate elements of the original variations of the name might be interpreted as etymologically related to either Walm-und-\u00f6 - if walm is linked to the Anglo-Saxon words wielm, wylm, this would mean the original name should be interpreted as \"The island outside of which the waves grow large\" (an interpretation with no equivalents in other Nordic geographic names) - or Wal-mund-\u00f6 - which could possibly be interpreted as walder (\"embankment\", \"grounds\") and mun (\"mouth\"), i.e. \"the grounds next to the mouth of Lake M\u00e4laren\".The present name, Djurg\u00e5rden, stems from the game park of King John III, which he declared the intention to realize in February 1579 to keep deer, reindeer, and elk. In the 17th century a baiting arena was built at the location.In 1667, a few cottages intended for \"paralysed and crippled seafarers\" were built forming what was to become Djurg\u00e5rdsstaden. The Swedish Navy moved to Karlskrona during the 1680s however, and the neighbourhood was instead populated by a diverse crowd. Plans to demolish the \"insignificant shacks\" in front of the World Fair in 1897, and for a planned expansion of the naval shipyard in 1918, never were accomplished and the area is today protected as a historical monument.During the late 18th century, Djurg\u00e5rden transformed into more of a popular recreational area than a Royal game park; in 1801, the theatre Djurg\u00e5rdsteatern was opened, which was to be one of the most popular establishments there during the 19th century. King Charles XIV John's creation of the Rosendal Palace in the 1820s marked the beginning of Djurg\u00e5rden's development as a stately residential area, paired with the creation of several entertainment establishments in the late 19th century, including Gr\u00f6na Lund 1883, and Skansen 1891. At a caf\u00e9 just south of Skansen, in block Alberget, sports club Djurg\u00e5rdens IF was founded on 12 March 1891.\n\nThe western waterfront of the island was a small scale shipyard during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, after which the Navy erected some 30 sheds for the winter quarters of galleys in the area. The operations expanded during the 1870s when a dry dock was constructed. Plans to relocate the shipyard in the beginning of the 20th century were interrupted by World War II, which meant the activities grew considerably instead, culminating in 1945 when 1,280 people were employed. In 1969, the Navy moved to Musk\u00f6, and in the early 1970s the area was transformed into the recreation area it is today.Many structures on the western part of Djurg\u00e5rden date back to the Stockholm World's Fair of 1897, including Djurg\u00e5rdsbron, the main bridge to the island. One of the most prominent buildings of the exposition, a 16,820 m\u00b2 exposition hall in wood, design by the architect Ferdinand Boberg and featuring a 100 metres tall cupola and 4 minarets, was demolished after the exposition however, together with many other pavilions built in non-permanent materials.In what is today the southern part of the amusement park Gr\u00f6na Lund and east of it, a private shipyard was developed from 1735 by the merchant Efraim Lothsack, who also had several new residential buildings built.

        "wiki": "Stockholm (Swedish pronunciation: [\u02c8st\u0254\u0302k\u02d0(h)\u0254lm] (listen)) is the capital and most populous urban area of Sweden as well as in Scandinavia. 975,904 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.6 million in the urban area, and 2.4 million in the metropolitan area. The city stretches across fourteen islands where Lake M\u00e4laren flows into the Baltic Sea. Outside the city to the east, and along the coast, is the island chain of the Stockholm archipelago. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. It is also the county seat of Stockholm County.\nStockholm is the cultural, media, political, and economic centre of Sweden. The Stockholm region alone accounts for over a third of the country's GDP, and is among the top 10 regions in Europe by GDP per capita. Ranked as an alpha global city, it is the largest in Scandinavia and the main centre for corporate headquarters in the Nordic region. The city is home to some of Europe's top ranking universities, such as the Stockholm School of Economics, Karolinska Institute and KTH Royal Institute of Technology. It hosts the annual Nobel Prize ceremonies and banquet at the Stockholm Concert Hall and Stockholm City Hall. One of the city's most prized museums, the Vasa Museum, is the most visited non-art museum in Scandinavia. The Stockholm metro, opened in 1950, is well known for the decor of its stations; it has been called the longest art gallery in the world. Sweden's national football arena is located north of the city centre, in Solna. Ericsson Globe, the national indoor arena, is in the southern part of the city. The city was the host of the 1912 Summer Olympics, and hosted the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics otherwise held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nStockholm is the seat of the Swedish government and most of its agencies, including the highest courts in the judiciary, and the official residencies of the Swedish monarch and the Prime Minister. The government has its seat in the Rosenbad building, the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) is seated in the Parliament House, and the Prime Minister's residence is adjacent at Sager House. Stockholm Palace is the official residence and principal workplace of the Swedish monarch, while Drottningholm Palace, a World Heritage Site on the outskirts of Stockholm, serves as the Royal Family's private residence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter the Ice Age, around 8,000 BC, there were already many people living in what is today the Stockholm area, but as temperatures dropped, inhabitants moved south. Thousands of years later, as the ground thawed, the climate became tolerable and the lands became fertile, people began to migrate back to the North. At the intersection of the Baltic Sea and lake M\u00e4laren is an archipelago site where the Old Town of Stockholm was first built from about 1000 CE by Vikings. They had a positive trade impact on the area because of the trade routes they created.\nStockholm's location appears in Norse sagas as Agnafit, and in Heimskringla in connection with the legendary king Agne. The earliest written mention of the name Stockholm dates from 1252, by which time the mines in Bergslagen made it an important site in the iron trade. The first part of the name (stock) means log in Swedish, although it may also be connected to an old German word (Stock) meaning fortification. The second part of the name (holm) means islet and is thought to refer to the islet Helgeandsholmen in central Stockholm. According to the Eric Chronicles the city is said to have been founded by Birger Jarl to protect Sweden from sea invasions made by Karelians after the pillage of Sigtuna on Lake M\u00e4laren in the summer of 1187.Stockholm's core, the present Old Town (Gamla Stan) was built on the central island next to Helgeandsholmen from the mid-13th century onward. The city originally rose to prominence as a result of the Baltic trade of the Hanseatic League. Stockholm developed strong economic and cultural linkages with L\u00fcbeck, Hamburg, Gda\u0144sk, Visby, Reval, and Riga during this time. Between 1296 and 1478 Stockholm's City Council was made up of 24 members, half of whom were selected from the town's German-speaking burghers.\nThe strategic and economic importance of the city made Stockholm an important factor in relations between the Danish Kings of the Kalmar Union and the national independence movement in the 15th century. The Danish King Christian II was able to enter the city in 1520. On 8 November 1520, a massacre of opposition figures called the Stockholm Bloodbath took place and set off further uprisings that eventually led to the breakup of the Kalmar Union. With the accession of Gustav Vasa in 1523 and the establishment of royal power, the population of Stockholm began to grow, reaching 10,000 by 1600.\nThe 17th century saw Sweden grow into a major European power, reflected in the development of the city of Stockholm. From 1610 to 1680 the population multiplied sixfold. In 1634, Stockholm became the official capital of the Swedish empire. Trading rules were also created that gave Stockholm an essential monopoly over trade between foreign merchants and other Swedish and Scandinavian territories. In 1697, Tre Kronor (castle) burned and was replaced by Stockholm Palace.\nIn 1710, a plague killed about 20,000 (36 percent) of the population. After the end of the Great Northern War the city stagnated. Population growth halted and economic growth slowed. The city was in shock after having lost its place as the capital of a Great power. However, Stockholm maintained its role as the political center of Sweden and continued to develop culturally under Gustav III.\nBy the second half of the 19th century, Stockholm had regained its leading economic role. New industries emerged and Stockholm was transformed into an important trade and service center as well as a key gateway point within Sweden. The population also grew dramatically during this time, mainly through immigration. At the end of the 19th century, less than 40% of the residents were Stockholm-born. Settlement began to expand outside the city limits. The 19th century saw the establishment of a number of scientific institutes, including the Karolinska Institutet. The General Art and Industrial Exposition was held in 1897. From 1887 to 1953 the Old Stockholm telephone tower was a landmark; originally built to link phone lines, it became redundant after these were buried, and it was latterly used for advertising.\n\nStockholm became a modern, technologically advanced, and ethnically diverse city in the latter half of the 20th century. Many historical buildings were torn down during the modernist era, including substantial parts of the historical district of Klara, and replaced with modern architecture. However, in many other parts of Stockholm (such as in Gamla stan, S\u00f6dermalm, \u00d6stermalm, Kungsholmen and Vasastan), many \"old\" buildings, blocks and streets built before the modernism and functionalism movements took off in Sweden (around 1930\u201335) survived this era of demolition. Throughout the century, many industries shifted away from industrial activities into more high-tech and service industry areas.\nCurrently, Stockholm's metropolitan area is one of the fastest-growing regions in Europe, and its population is expected to number 2.5 million by 2024. As a result of this massive population growth, there has been a proposal to build densely packed high-rise buildings in the city center connected by elevated walkways.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nStockholm is located on Sweden's east coast, where the freshwater Lake M\u00e4laren \u2014 Sweden's third-largest lake \u2014 flows out into the Baltic Sea. The central parts of the city consist of fourteen islands that are continuous with the Stockholm archipelago. The geographical city center is situated on the water, in Riddarfj\u00e4rden bay. Over 30% of the city area is made up of waterways and another 30% is made up of parks and green spaces.\nPositioned at the eastern end of the Central Swedish lowland, the city's location reflect the early orientation of Swedish trade toward the Baltic region.Stockholm belongs to the Temperate deciduous forest biome, which means the climate is very similar to that of the far northeastern area of the United States and coastal Nova Scotia in Canada. The average annual temperature is 7.6 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). The average rainfall is 531 mm (21 in) a year. The deciduous forest has four distinct seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In the autumn the leaves change color. During the winter months, the trees lose their leaves.\nFor details about the other municipalities in the Stockholm area, see the pertinent articles.

South of Stockholm: Huddinge, Nacka, Botkyrka, Haninge, Tyres\u00f6, V\u00e4rmd\u00f6, S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, Salem, Nykvarn and Nyn\u00e4shamn.\n\n\n=== Stockholm Municipality ===\n\nStockholm Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders. The semi-official name for the municipality is City of Stockholm (Stockholms stad in Swedish). As a municipality, the City of Stockholm is subdivided into district councils, which carry responsibility for primary schools, social, leisure and cultural services within their respective areas. The municipality is usually described in terms of its three main parts: Innerstaden (Stockholm City Centre), S\u00f6derort (Southern Stockholm) and V\u00e4sterort (Western Stockholm). The districts of these parts are:\n\n\n==== Stockholm City Centre ====\n\n\n==== S\u00f6derort ====\n\n\n==== V\u00e4sterort ====\n\nThe modern centre Norrmalm (concentrated around the town square Sergels torg) is the largest shopping district in Sweden. It is the most central part of Stockholm in business and shopping.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nStockholm has an oceanic climate in the 0 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) and a humid continental climate (Dfb) in the -3 \u00b0C isotherm. Although winters are cold, average temperatures generally remain above 0 \u00b0C for much of the year. Summers are mild, and precipitation occurs throughout the year.Due to the city's high northerly latitude, the length of the day varies widely from more than 18 hours around midsummer to only around 6 hours in late December. The nights from late May until mid-July are bright even when cloudy. Stockholm has relatively mild weather compared to other locations at a similar latitude, or even farther south. With an average of just over 1800 hours of sunshine per year, it is also one of the sunniest cities in Northern Europe, receiving more sunshine than Paris, London and a few other major European cities of a more southerly latitude. Because of the urban heat island effect and the prevailing wind traveling overland rather than sea during summer months, Stockholm has the warmest July months of the Nordic capitals. Stockholm has an annual average snow cover between 75 and 100 days.In spite of its mild climate, Stockholm is located further north than parts of Canada that are above the Arctic tree line at sea level.Summers average daytime high temperatures of 20\u201325 \u00b0C (68\u201377 \u00b0F) and lows of around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F), but temperatures can reach 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on some days. Days above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) occur on average 1.55 days per year (1992\u20132011). Days between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) are relatively common especially in July and August. Night-time lows of above 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) are rare, and hot summer nights vary from 17 to 18 \u00b0C (63 to 64 \u00b0F). Winters generally bring cloudy weather with the most precipitation falling in December and January (as rain or as snow). The average winter temperatures range from \u22123 to \u22121 \u00b0C (27 to 30 \u00b0F), and occasionally drop below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) in the outskirts. Spring and autumn are generally cool to mild.\nThe climate table below presents weather data from the years 1981\u20132010 although the official K\u00f6ppen reference period was from 1961\u20131990. According to ongoing measurements, the temperature has increased during the years 1991\u20132009 as compared with the last series. This increase averages about 1.0 \u00b0C (1.8 \u00b0F) overall months. Warming is most pronounced during the winter months, with an increase of more than 2.0 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in January. For the 2002\u20132014 measurements some further increases have been found, although some months such as June have been relatively flat.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Stockholm was 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) on 3 July 1811; the lowest was \u221232 \u00b0C (\u221226 \u00b0F) on 20 January 1814. The temperature has not dropped to below \u221225.1 \u00b0C (\u221213.2 \u00b0F) since 10 January 1987.Annual precipitation is 531 mm (20.9 in) with around 170 wet days and light to moderate rainfall throughout the year. The precipitation is not uniformly distributed throughout the year. The second half of the year receives 50% more than the first half. Snowfall occurs mainly from December through March. Snowfall may occasionally occur in late October as well as in April.\nIn Stockholm, the aurora borealis can occasionally be observed.\n\n\n=== Daylight hours ===\nStockholm's location just south of the 60th parallel north means that the number of daylight hours is relatively small during winter \u2013 about six hours \u2013 while in June and the first half of July, the nights are relatively short, with about 18 hours of daylight. Around the summer solstice the sun never reaches further below the horizon than 7.3 degrees. This gives the sky a bright blue colour in summer once the sun has set because it does not get any darker than nautical twilight. Also, when looking straight up towards the zenith, few stars are visible after the sun has gone down. This is not to be confused with the midnight sun, which occurs north of the Arctic Circle, around 7 degrees farther north.\n\n\n== City governance ==\n\nThe Stockholm Municipal Council (Swedish: Stockholms kommunfullm\u00e4ktige) is the name of the local assembly. Its 101 councillors are elected concurrently with general elections, held at the same time as the elections to the Riksdag and county councils. The Council convenes twice every month at Stockholm City Hall, and the meetings are open to the public. The matters on which the councillors decide have generally already been drafted and discussed by various boards and committees. Once decisions are referred for practical implementation, the employees of the City administrations and companies take over.The elected majority has a Mayor and eight Vice Mayors. The Mayor and each majority Vice Mayor is the head of a department, with responsibility for a particular area of operation, such as City Planning. The opposition also has four Vice Mayors, but they hold no executive power. Together the Mayor and the 12 Vice Mayors form the Council of Mayors, and they prepare matters for the City Executive Board. The Mayor holds a special position among the Vice Mayors, chairing both the Council of Mayors and the City Executive Board.The City Executive Board (Swedish: Kommunstyrelsen) is elected by the City Council and is equivalent to a cabinet. The City Executive Board renders an opinion in all matters decided by the council and bears the overall responsibility for follow-up, evaluation and execution of its decisions. The Board is also responsible for financial administration and long-term development. The City Executive Board consists of 13 members, who represent both the majority and the opposition. Its meetings are not open to the public.Following the 2018 Stockholm municipal election a majority of seats in the municipal council is at present held by a center/right-wing majority and the Mayor of Stockholm (Swedish: Finansborgarr\u00e5d) is Anna Konig Jerlmyr from the Moderate Party.\n\nThe vast majority of Stockholm residents work in the service industry, which accounts for roughly 85% of jobs in Stockholm. The almost total absence of heavy industry (and fossil fuel power plants) makes Stockholm one of the world's cleanest metropolises. The last decade has seen a significant number of jobs created in high technology companies. Large employers include IBM, Ericsson, and Electrolux. A major IT centre is located in Kista, in northern Stockholm.\nStockholm is Sweden's financial centre. Major Swedish banks, such as Swedbank, Handelsbanken, and SEB, are headquartered in Stockholm, as are the major insurance companies Skandia, Folksam and Trygg-Hansa. Stockholm is also home to Sweden's foremost stock exchange, the Stockholm Stock Exchange (Stockholmsb\u00f6rsen). Additionally, about 45% of Swedish companies with more than 200 employees are headquartered in Stockholm. Noted clothes retailer H&M is also headquartered in the city. In recent years, tourism has played an important part in the city's economy. Stockholm County is ranked as the 10th largest visitor destination in Europe, with over 10 million commercial overnight stays per year. Among 44 European cities, Stockholm had the 6th highest growth in the number of nights spent in the period 2004\u20132008.The largest companies in Stockholm, by number of employees (2017)\n\n\n== Fibre optic network ==\nThe city-owned company Stokab started in 1994 to build a fiber-optic network throughout the municipality as a level playing field for all operators (City of Stockholm, 2011). Around a decade later, the network was 1.2 million kilometres (0.7 million miles) long making it the longest optic fiber network in the world and now has over 90 operators and 450 enterprises as customers. 2011 was the final year of a three-year project which brought fiber to 100% of public housing, meaning an extra 95,000 houses were added. (City of Stockholm, 2011)\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nResearch and higher education in the sciences started in Stockholm in the 18th century, with education in medicine and various research institutions such as the Stockholm Observatory. The medical education was eventually formalized in 1811 as Karolinska Institutet. KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Swedish: Kungliga Tekniska h\u00f6gskolan) was founded in 1827 and is currently Scandinavia's largest higher education institute of technology with 13,000 students. Stockholm University, founded in 1878 with university status granted in 1960, has 52,000 students as of 2008. It also incorporates many historical institutions, such as the Observatory, the Swedish Museum of Natural History, and the botanical garden Bergianska tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden. The Stockholm School of Economics, founded in 1909, is one of the few private institutions of higher education in Sweden.\nIn the fine arts, educational institutions include the Royal College of Music, which has a history going back to the conservatory founded as part of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 1771, the Royal University College of Fine Arts, which has a similar historical association with the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts and a foundation date of 1735, and the Swedish National Academy of Mime and Acting, which is the continuation of the school of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, once attended by Greta Garbo. Other schools include the design school Konstfack, founded in 1844, the University College of Opera (founded in 1968 but with older roots), the University College of Dance, and the Stockholms Musikpedagogiska Institut (the University College of Music Education).\nThe S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University College was founded in 1995 as a multi-disciplinary institution for southern Metropolitan Stockholm, to balance the many institutions located in the northern part of the region.\nOther institutes of higher education are:\n\nMilitary Academy Karlberg, the world's oldest military academy to remain in its original location, inaugurated in 1792 and housed in Karlberg Palace.\nErsta Sk\u00f6ndal University College\nStockholm School of Theology (Teologiska H\u00f6gskolan, Stockholm)\nSwedish School of Sport and Health Sciences\nSwedish Defence UniversityThe biggest complaint from students of higher education in Stockholm is the lack of student accommodations, the difficulty in finding other accommodations and the high rent.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe Stockholm region is home to around 22% of Sweden's total population, and accounts for about 29% of its gross domestic product. The geographical notion of \"Stockholm\" has changed over time. By the turn of the 19th century, Stockholm largely consisted of the area today known as City Centre, roughly 35 km2 (14 sq mi) or one-fifth of the current municipal area. In the ensuing decades several other areas were incorporated (such as Br\u00e4nnkyrka Municipality in 1913, at which time it had 25,000 inhabitants, and Sp\u00e5nga in 1949). The municipal border was established in 1971; with the exception of Hansta, in 1982 purchased by Stockholm Municipality from Sollentuna Municipality and today a nature reserve.\nOf the population of 935,619 in 2016, 461,677 were men and 473,942 women. The average age is 40 years; 40.1% of the population is between 20 and 44 years. 382,887 people, or 40.9% of the population, over the age 15 were unmarried. 259,153 people, or 27.7% of the population, were married. 99,524 or 10.6% of the population, had been married but divorced. 299,925 people or 32.1% of Stockholm's residents are of an immigrant or non-Swedish background.As of October 2018, there were 201,821 foreign-born people in Stockholm. The largest group of them are the Finns (17,000), followed by Iraqis (16,275), Poles (11,994) and Iranians (11,429).\nResidents of Stockholm are known as Stockholmers (\"stockholmare\"). Languages spoken in Greater Stockholm outside of Swedish include Finnish, one of the official minority languages of Sweden; and English, as well as Albanian, Bosnian, Syriac, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish, Persian, Dutch, Spanish, Serbian and Croatian.\nThe entire Stockholm metropolitan area, consisting of 26 municipalities, has a population of over 2.2 million, making it the most populous city in the Nordic region. The Stockholm urban area, defined only for statistical purposes, had a total population of 1,630,738 in 2015. In the following municipalities some of the districts are contained within the Stockholm urban area, though not all:\n\n\n== Culture ==\nApart from being Sweden's capital, Stockholm houses many national cultural institutions. The Stockholm region is home to three of Sweden's World Heritage Sites \u2013 spots judged as invaluable places that belong to all of humanity: The Drottningholm Palace, Skogskyrkog\u00e5rden (The Woodland Cemetery) and Birka. In 1998, Stockholm was named European Capital of Culture.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nAuthors connected to Stockholm include the poet and songwriter Carl Michael Bellman (1740\u20131795), novelist and dramatist August Strindberg (1849\u20131912), and novelist Hjalmar S\u00f6derberg (1869\u20131941), all of whom made Stockholm part of their works.\nMartin Beck is a fictional Swedish police detective from Stockholm, who is the main character in a series of 10 novels by Maj Sj\u00f6wall and Per Wahl\u00f6\u00f6, collectively titled The Story of a Crime, and often based in Stockholm.\nOther authors with notable heritage in Stockholm were the Nobel Prize laureate Eyvind Johnson (1900\u20131976) and the popular poet and composer Evert Taube (1890\u20131976). The novelist Per Anders Fogelstr\u00f6m (1917\u20131998) wrote a popular series of historical novels depicting life in Stockholm from the mid-18th to the mid-20th century.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe city's oldest section is Gamla stan (Old Town), located on the original small islands of the city's earliest settlements and still featuring the medieval street layout. Some notable buildings of Gamla Stan are the large German Church (Tyska kyrkan) and several mansions and palaces: the Riddarhuset (the House of Nobility), the Bonde Palace, the Tessin Palace and the Oxenstierna Palace.\nThe oldest building in Stockholm is the Riddarholmskyrkan from the late 13th century. After a fire in 1697 when the original medieval castle was destroyed, Stockholm Palace was erected in a baroque style. Storkyrkan Cathedral, the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Stockholm, stands next to the castle. It was founded in the 13th century but is clad in a baroque exterior dating to the 18th century.\nAs early as the 15th century, the city had expanded outside of its original borders. Some pre-industrial, small-scale buildings from this era can still be found in S\u00f6dermalm. During the 19th century and the age of industrialization Stockholm grew rapidly, with plans and architecture inspired by the large cities of the continent such as Berlin and Vienna. Notable works of this time period include public buildings such as the Royal Swedish Opera and private developments such as the luxury housing developments on Strandv\u00e4gen.\nIn the 20th century, a nationalistic push spurred a new architectural style inspired by medieval and renaissance ancestry as well as influences of the Jugend/Art Nouveau style. A key landmark of Stockholm, the Stockholm City Hall, was erected 1911\u20131923 by architect Ragnar \u00d6stberg. Other notable works of these times are the Stockholm Public Library and the World Heritage Site Skogskyrkog\u00e5rden.\n\nIn the 1930s modernism characterized the development of the city as it grew. New residential areas sprang up such as the development on G\u00e4rdet while industrial development added to the growth, such as the KF manufacturing industries on Kvarnholmen located in the Nacka Municipality. In the 1950s, suburban development entered a new phase with the introduction of the Stockholm metro. The modernist developments of V\u00e4llingby and Farsta were internationally praised. In the 1960s this suburban development continued but with the aesthetic of the times, the industrialized and mass-produced blocks of flats received a large amount of criticism.\nAt the same time that this suburban development was taking place, the most central areas of the inner city were being redesigned, known as Norrmalmsregleringen. Sergels Torg, with its five high-rise office towers was created in the 1960s, followed by the total clearance of large areas to make room for new development projects. The most notable buildings from this period include the ensemble of the House of Culture, City Theatre and the Riksbank at Sergels Torg, designed by architect Peter Celsing.\nIn the 1980s, the planning ideas of modernism were starting to be questioned, resulting in suburbs with denser planning, such as Skarpn\u00e4ck. In the 1990s this idea was taken further with the development of an old industrial area close to the inner city, resulting in a sort of mix of modernistic and urban planning in the new area of Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad.\nThe municipality has appointed an official \"board of beauty\" called \"Sk\u00f6nhetsr\u00e5det\" to protect and preserve the beauty of the city.Stockholm's architecture (along with Visby, Gotland) provided the inspiration for Japanese anime director Hayao Miyazaki as he sought to evoke an idealized city untouched by World War. His creation called Koriko, draws directly from what Miyazaki felt was Stockholm's sense of well-established architectural unity, vibrancy, independence, and safety.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nStockholm is one of the most crowded museum-cities in the world with around 100 museums, visited by millions of people every year.The Vasa Museum (Swedish: Vasamuseet) is a maritime museum on Djurg\u00e5rden which displays the only almost fully intact 17th century ship that has ever been salvaged, the 64-gun warship Vasa that sank on her maiden voyage in 1628.\nThe Nationalmuseum houses the largest collection of art in the country: 16,000 paintings and 30,000 objects of art handicraft. The collection dates back to the days of Gustav Vasa in the 16th century, and has since been expanded with works by artists such as Rembrandt, and Antoine Watteau, as well as constituting a main part of Sweden's art heritage, manifested in the works of Alexander Roslin, Anders Zorn, Johan Tobias Sergel, Carl Larsson, Carl Fredrik Hill and Ernst Josephson. From the year 2013 to 2018 the museum was closed due to a restoration of the building.Moderna Museet (Museum of Modern Art) is Sweden's national museum of modern art. It has works by noted modern artists such as Picasso and Salvador Dal\u00ed.\nSkansen (in English: the Sconce) is a combined open-air museum and zoo, located on the island of Djurg\u00e5rden. It was founded in 1891 by Artur Hazelius (1833\u20131901) to show the way of life in the different parts of Sweden before the industrial era.\nOther notable museums (in alphabetical order):\n\nABBA: The Museum, an interactive exhibit about the pop-group ABBA\nFotografiska, museum of photography\nLivrustkammaren, the royal armoury, located at Stockholm Palace\nNobel Museum, devoted to the Nobel Prize, Nobel laureates, and the founder of the prize, Alfred Nobel (1833\u20131896)\nNordic Museum, dedicated to the cultural history and ethnography of Sweden\nRoyal Coin Cabinet, dedicated to the history of money and economic history in general\nStockholm City Museum\nSwedish Museum of Natural History\n\n\n=== Art galleries ===\nStockholm has a vibrant art scene with a number of internationally recognized art centres and commercial galleries. Amongst others, privately sponsored initiatives such as Bonniers Konsthall, Magasin 3, and state-supported institutions such as Tensta Konsthall and Index all show leading international and national artists. In the last few years, a gallery district has emerged around Hudiksvallsgatan where leading galleries such as Andr\u00e9hn-Schiptjenko, Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m & Stene have located. Other important commercial galleries include Nordenhake, Milliken Gallery and Galleri Magnus Karlsson.\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nThe Stockholm suburbs are places with diverse cultural background. Some areas in the inner suburbs, including those of Sk\u00e4rholmen, Tensta, Jordbro, Fittja, Husby, Brandbergen, Rinkeby, Rissne, Kista, Hags\u00e4tra, H\u00e4sselby, Farsta, R\u00e5gsved, Flemingsberg, and the outer suburb of S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, have high percentages of immigrants or second generation immigrants. These mainly come from the Middle East (Assyrians, Syriacs, Turks and Kurds) also Bosnians and Serbs, but there are also immigrants from Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America. Other parts of the inner suburbs, such as T\u00e4by, Danderyd, Liding\u00f6, Flysta and, as well as some of the suburbs mentioned above, have a majority of ethnic Swedes.\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\n\nDistinguished among Stockholm's many theatres are the Royal Dramatic Theatre (Kungliga Dramatiska Teatern), one of Europe's most renowned theatres, and the Royal Swedish Opera, inaugurated in 1773.\nOther notable theatres are the Stockholm City Theatre (Stockholms stadsteater), the Peoples Opera (Folkoperan), the Modern Theatre of Dance (Moderna dansteatern), the China Theatre, the G\u00f6ta Lejon Theatre, the Mosebacke Theatre, and the Oscar Theatre.\n\n\n=== Amusement park ===\nGr\u00f6na Lund is an amusement park located on the island of Djurg\u00e5rden.

The city was granted the 2010 European Green Capital Award by the EU Commission; this was Europe's first \"green capital\". Applicant cities were evaluated in several ways: climate change, local transport, public green areas, air quality, noise, waste, water consumption, waste water treatment, sustainable utilisation of land, biodiversity and environmental management. Out of 35 participant cities, eight finalists were chosen: Stockholm, Amsterdam, Bristol, Copenhagen, Freiburg, Hamburg, M\u00fcnster, and Oslo. Some of the reasons why Stockholm won the 2010 European Green Capital Award were: its integrated administrative system, which ensures that environmental aspects are considered in budgets, operational planning, reporting, and monitoring; its cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 25% per capita in ten years; and its decision towards being fossil fuel free by 2050. Stockholm has long demonstrated concern for the environment. The city's current environmental program is the fifth since the first one was established in the mid-1970s. In 2011, Stockholm passed the title of European Green Capital to Hamburg, Germany.\n\n\n==== Role model ====\nIn the beginning of 2010, Stockholm launched the program Professional Study Visits in order to share the city's green best practices. The program provides visitors with the opportunity to learn how to address issues such as waste management, urban planning, carbon dioxide emissions, and sustainable and efficient transportation system, among others.According to the European Cities Monitor 2010, Stockholm is the best city in terms of freedom from pollution. Surrounded by 219 nature reserves, Stockholm has around 1,000 green spaces, which corresponds to 30% of the city's area. Founded in 1995, the Royal National City Park is the world's first legally protected \"national urban park\". For a description of the formation process, value assets and implementation of the legal protection of The Royal National Urban Park, see Schantz 2006 The water in Stockholm is so clean that people can dive and fish in the centre of the city. The waters of downtown Stockholm serve as spawning grounds for multiple fish species including trout and salmon, though human intervention is needed to keep populations up. Regarding CO2 emissions, the government's target is that Stockholm will be CO2 free before 2050.\n\n\n=== Air quality ===\nStockholm used to have problematic levels of particulates (PM10) due to studded winter tires, but as of 2016 the levels are below limits, after street-specific bans. Instead the current (2016) problem is nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel vehicles. In 2016 the average levels for urban background (roof of Torkel Knutssonsgatan) were: NO2 11 \u03bcg/m3, NOx 14 \u03bcg/m3, PM10 12 \u03bcg/m3, PM2.5 4.9 \u03bcg/m3, soot 0.4 \u03bcg/m3, ultrafine particles 6200/cm3, CO 0.2 mg/m3, SO2 0.4 \u03bcg/m3, ozone 51 \u03bcg/m3. For urban street level (the densely trafficked Hornsgatan) the average levels were: NO2 43 \u03bcg/m3, NOx 104 \u03bcg/m3, PM10 23 \u03bcg/m3, PM2.5 5.9 \u03bcg/m3, soot 1.0 \u03bcg/m3, ultrafine particles 17100/cm3, CO 0.3 mg/m3, ozone 31 \u03bcg/m3.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public Transportation ===\n\nStockholm has an extensive public transport system. It consists of the Stockholm Metro (Swedish: Tunnelbanan), which consist of three color-coded main systems (green, red and blue) with seven lines (10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19); the Stockholm commuter rail (Swedish: Pendelt\u00e5gen) which runs on the state-owned railroads on six lines (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 48); four light rail/tramway lines (7, 12, 21, and 22); the 891 mm narrow-gauge railway Roslagsbanan, on three lines (27, 28, 29) in the northeastern part; the local railway Saltsj\u00f6banan, on two lines (25, 26) in the southeastern part; a large number of bus lines, and the inner-city Djurg\u00e5rden ferry. The overwhelming majority of the land-based public transport in Stockholm County (save for the airport buses/airport express trains and other few commercially viable bus lines) is organized under the common umbrella of Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL), an aktiebolag wholly owned by Stockholm County Council. Since the 1990s, the operation and maintenance of the SL public transport services are contracted out to independent companies bidding for contracts, such as MTR, which currently operate the Metro. The archipelago boat traffic is handled by Waxholmsbolaget, which is also wholly owned by the County Council.\n\nSL has a common ticket system in the entire Stockholm County, which allows for easy travel between different modes of transport. The tickets are of two main types, single ticket and travel cards, both allowing for unlimited travel with SL in the entire Stockholm County for the duration of the ticket validity. On 1 April 2007, a zone system (A, B, C) and price system was introduced. Single tickets were available in forms of cash ticket, individual unit pre-paid tickets, pre-paid ticket slips of 8, sms-ticket and machine ticket. Cash tickets bought at the point of travel were the most expensive and pre-paid tickets slips of 8 are the cheapest. A single ticket costs 32 SEK with the card and 45 SEK without and is valid for 75 minutes. The duration of the travel card validity depended on the exact type; they were available from 24 hours up to a year. As of 2018, a 30-day card costs 860 SEK. Tickets of all these types were available with reduced prices for students and persons under 20 and over 65 years of age. On 9 January 2017, the zone system was removed, and the cost of the tickets was increased.\n\n\n==== The City Line Project ====\n\nWith an estimated cost of SEK 16.8 billion (January 2007 price level), which equals 2.44 billion US dollars, the City Line, an environmentally certified project, comprises a 6 km (3.7 mi)-long commuter train tunnel (in rock and water) beneath Stockholm, with two new stations (Stockholm City and Stockholm Odenplan), and a 1.4 km (0.87 mi)-long railway bridge at \u00c5rsta. The City Line was built by the Swedish Transport Administration in co-operation with the City of Stockholm, Stockholm County Council, and Stockholm Transport, SL. As Stockholm Central Station is overloaded, the purpose of this project was to double the city's track capacity and improve service efficiency. Operations began in July 2017.Between Riddarholmen and S\u00f6der M\u00e4larstrand, the City Line runs through a submerged concrete tunnel. As a green project, the City Line includes the purification of waste water; noise reduction through sound-attenuating tracks; the use of synthetic diesel, which provides users with clean air; and the recycling of excavated rocks.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nStockholm is at the junction of the European routes E4, E18 and E20. A half-completed motorway ring road exists on the south, west and north sides of the City Centre. The northern section of the ring road, Norra L\u00e4nken, opened for traffic in 2015 while the final subsea eastern section is being discussed as a future project. A bypass motorway for traffic between Northern and Southern Sweden, F\u00f6rbifart Stockholm, is currently being built. The many islands and waterways make extensions of the road system both complicated and expensive, and new motorways are often built as systems of tunnels and bridges.\n\n\n==== Congestion charges ====\n\nStockholm has a congestion pricing system, Stockholm congestion tax, in use on a permanent basis since 1 August 2007, after having had a seven-month trial period in the first half of 2006. The City Centre is within the congestion tax zone. All the entrances and exits of this area have unmanned control points operating with automatic number plate recognition. All vehicles entering or exiting the congestion tax affected area, with a few exceptions, have to pay 10\u201320 SEK (1.09\u20132.18 EUR, 1.49\u20132.98 USD) depending on the time of day between 06:30 and 18:29. The maximum tax amount per vehicle per day is 60 SEK (6.53 EUR, ). Payment is done by various means within 14 days after one has passed one of the control points; one cannot pay at the control points.After the trial period was over, consultative referendums were held in Stockholm Municipality and several other municipalities in Stockholm County. The then-reigning government (Persson Cabinet) stated that they would only take into consideration the results of the referendum in Stockholm Municipality. The opposition parties (Alliance for Sweden) stated that if they were to form a cabinet after the general election\u2014which was held the same day as the congestion tax referendums\u2014they would take into consideration the referendums held in several of the other municipalities in Stockholm County as well. The results of the referendums were that the Stockholm Municipality voted for the congestion tax, while the other municipalities voted against it. The opposition parties won the general election and a few days before they formed government (Reinfeldt Cabinet) they announced that the congestion tax would be reintroduced in Stockholm, but that the revenue would go entirely to road construction in and around Stockholm. During the trial period and according to the agenda of the previous government the revenue went entirely to public transport.\n\n\n=== Ferries ===\n\nStockholm has regular ferry lines to Helsinki and Turku in Finland (commonly called \"Finlandsf\u00e4rjan\"); Tallinn, Estonia; Riga, Latvia, \u00c5land islands and to Saint Petersburg. The large Stockholm archipelago is served by the archipelago boats of Waxholmsbolaget (owned and subsidized by Stockholm County Council).\n\n\n=== City bikes ===\nBetween April and October, during the warmer months, it is possible to rent Stockholm City Bikes by purchasing a bike card online or through retailers. Cards allow users to rent bikes from any Stockholm City Bikes stand spread across the city and return them in any stand. There are two types of cards: the Season Card (valid from 1 April to 31 October) and the 3-day card. When their validity runs out they can be reactivated and are therefore reusable. Bikes can be used for up to three hours per loan and can be rented from Monday to Sunday from 6 am to 10 pm.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nInternational and domestic:\nStockholm Arlanda Airport (IATA: ARN, ICAO: ESSA) is the largest and busiest airport in Sweden with 27 million passengers in 2017. It is located about 40 km (25 mi) north of Stockholm and serves as a hub for Scandinavian Airlines.\nStockholm-Bromma Airport (IATA: BMA, ICAO: ESSB) is located about 8 km (5.0 mi) west of Stockholm.\nOnly international:\nStockholm-Skavsta Airport (IATA: NYO, ICAO: ESKN) is located 108 km (67 mi) south of Stockholm. It is located 5 km (3 mi) away from S\u00f6dermanland County capital Nyk\u00f6ping.\nStockholm-V\u00e4ster\u00e5s Airport (IATA: VST, ICAO: ESOW) is located 103 km (64 mi) west of Stockholm, in the city of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s.Arlanda Express airport rail link runs between Arlanda Airport and central Stockholm. With a journey of 20 minutes, the train ride is the fastest way of traveling to the city center. \nArlanda Central Station is also served by commuter, regional and intercity trains.\nAdditionally, there are also bus lines, Flygbussarna, that run between central Stockholm and all the airports.\nAs of 2010 there are no airports specifically for general aviation in the Stockholm area.\n\n\n=== Inter-city trains ===\n\nStockholm Central Station has train connections to many Swedish cities as well as to Oslo, Norway and Copenhagen, Denmark. The popular X 2000 service to Gothenburg takes three hours. Most of the trains are run by SJ AB.\n\n\n== International rankings ==\nStockholm often performs well in international rankings, some of which are mentioned below:\n\nIn the book The Ultimate Guide to International Marathons (1997), written by Dennis Craythorn and Rich Hanna, Stockholm Marathon is ranked as the best marathon in the world.\nIn the 2006 European Innovation Scoreboard, prepared by the Maastricht Economic Research Institute on Innovation and Technology (MERIT) and the Joint Research Centre's Institute for the Protection and the Security of the Citizen of the European Commission, Stockholm was ranked as the most innovative city in Europe.\nIn the 2008 World Knowledge Competitiveness Index, published by the Centre for International Competitiveness, Stockholm was ranked as the sixth most competitive region in the world and the most competitive region outside the United States.\nIn the 2006 European Regional Growth Index (E-REGI), published by Jones Lang LaSalle, Stockholm was ranked fifth on the list of European cities with the strongest GDP growth forecast. Stockholm was ranked first in Scandinavia and second outside Central and Eastern Europe.\nIn the 2007 European Cities Monitor, published by Cushman & Wakefield, Stockholm was ranked as the best Nordic city to locate a business. In the same report, Stockholm was ranked first in Europe in terms of freedom from pollution.\nIn a 2007 survey performed by the environmental economist Matthew Kahn for the Reader's Digest magazine, Stockholm was ranked first on its list of the \"greenest\" and most \"livable\" cities in the world.\nIn a 2008 survey published by Reader's Digest magazine, Stockholm was ranked fourth in the world in its list of the \"world's top ten honest cities\".\nIn a 2008 survey published by the National Geographic Traveler magazine, Gamla stan (the old town) in Stockholm was ranked sixth on its list of rated historic places.\nIn a 2008 survey published by the Foreign Policy magazine, Stockholm was ranked twenty-fourth on its list of the world's most global cities.\nIn 2009 Stockholm was awarded the title as European Green Capital 2010, as the first Green capital ever in the European Green Capital Award scheme.\nIn 2013, Stockholm was named the 8th most competitive city in the world by the Economist Intelligence Unit.\nIn 2016 Stockholm was one of the cities with the most \"unicorns\" in the world.\nIn 2019 Stockholm was awarded the World Smart City Award in the city category for its leadership of the European Smart Cities and Communities project GrowSmarter.\n\n\n== Twin cities and towns ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHolmium \u2013 a chemical element named after Stockholm\nList of people connected to Stockholm\nOutline of Stockholm\nPorts of the Baltic Sea\nStockholm syndrome\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nStockholm\u2014official website\nStockholm Visitors Board\u2014the official visitors' guide",

          "This museum is a museum according to my taste. It is not mainly some broken old pieces behind glass, but the real thing. There is a large part of an old wall in the main room which was found then they dig for a parking garage for the parliament. And pretty well-preserved hull of",

          "This nice museum focuses on Stockholm's medieval period. It is free & was dark & cool - it was refreshing to get out of the hot sun. The museum is under the Parliament, or at least under Parliament's front yard. There is a lovely little park in front of it. I saw a runestone",
          "When one hears \"Medieval Museum,\" a lot of people would think knights in shining armor and all that. But this Medieval museum focuses on LIFE during Stockholm's Medieval period. They do an excellent job of making the museum into more of a walk through the era rather than just",
          "A free museum located close to many other areas to tour. We ended up spending a lot more time in this museum than we expected. It's small but immersive and informative and laid out well. Make it a must see.",

          "This museum can be difficult to find as it is underneath a bridge, but it is well worth looking for. It is free to enter and is so well designed. The displays are interesting for both adults and children.",

          "Even when the Viking and Birks cruise liners are in port, you can count on this museum to be almost bereft of visitors, which really is a shame because it has attempted to accurately create and convey what normal life in a much smaller Stockholm was really like in the middle",
          "This is a free museum that turned out to be a Stockholm highlight for us. It is incredibly well done and fascinating. Certain sections were only in Swedish but much was also in English. It is set up in an engaging way and not just artifacts with descriptions. Takes about 1-2",
          "Situated in the centre of Stockholm is this interesting museam with free entry. It's got some wonderful scenes of medieval Sweden. It's big and airy and cool, it's a great thing to do with children or if it's hot outside. There is a shop in the enterance too.",

          "One of the members of my tour group suggested I go here. It's interesting. I was very impressed with the Vassa Museum so I wanted to find out more about medieval Stockholm and the development of Sweden which also involved its contact with other Scandanavian countries. It it not",
          "The Medieval Museum promised to be one of the best museums we visited in Stockholm. It depicts the history of stockholm with many artefacts presented and models highlighting Stockholm's history. Best to visit on your first day of stay to get a highlight of the history before",
          "This was my 13th visit to Stockholm, and my husband lived in Stockholm for 20 years, yet this was the first visit for both of us to the Medieval Museum. We both wished we\u2019d done it years ago, it\u2019s gorgeous and interactive, with all displays in both Swedish and English. The",
          "Much more here than we had expected, we only had an hour and a half before closing time and it wasn't enough, could have done with 2 hours.",
          "The museum is small but it is free and it offers an interesting view of medieval life in Sweden. It was a bit hard to find the entrance but we asked the guards and they pointed us the right way. You need to go to the east side of the island (where the park is), across a small",
          "Great place with many many interesting exhibits about Sweden the history the people and lifestyle etc ... really interesting . Beautiful building as well ! Could spend several hours here if your interested in history !",
          "Free entry with a small fee for audio tour which is worth getting. Visit took just over an hour. Lots of models that help to tell story of how Stockholm became important city.",
          "We went here almost on a whim in part because it was free. But we were surprised at the quality of the museum! It\u2019s not huge but it\u2019s excellently assembles, a mix of artefacts and recreations of people and places (medieval church, medieval home, etc). It was a great introduction",
          "If you love history - this is the place for you. Learn about old medicine, diseases, food, culture, law... And if you're a child who wants shelter from the sun and want to walk in models of old villages, climb old church towers or play old games, you too will be entertained!",
          "Its free, which is a bonus, but it is a great place that I would have been happy to pay to enter - its covers the medievil history of this fine City. It really is worth a visit.",
          "Being one of the few museums in Stockholm that is free, we were pleasantly surprised with how great this museum was. There\u2019s a recreated medieval village plus the original city wall in the middle of the museum. Highly recommended for people of all ages!",
          "Free! And so informative and well aid out. Almost missed it, glad we didn't . The little park in front a great place to relax after a lot of walking about. Near the palace and red line boats",
          "The Museum - Medieval Museum, it has free entry, so we went in. It was very interesting as it covered a part of the medieval town of Stockholm that was about to be turned into a car park in the 70's. It was saved and is now a re-creation of streets and city walls, all under the",
          "My daughter suggests medieval history is my obsession - so this may be slightly biased. This museum has reconstructions of homes/workplaces from early Stockholm and some actual artefacts from excavations. Definitely worth a visit if you like history (any period)",
          "It was especially interesting to learn that Swedish women were involved in trade labor just like a man. They did the work normally associated with men because they were physically capable",
          "I honestly didn\u2019t have intentions to visit this museum, but was looking for an escape from the heat on a warm July day. (This museum is a very comfortable place to visit in terms of temperature.) It is underground and features many treasures unearthed after being hidden for",
          "Collection is not extremely big, but of high quality and there are many extremely trade items to be amazed over, a good shop, guided tours, info inall languages, my personal favorite and favorite getaway during the harsh snowy winters...remarkable collection!",
          "It shows Stockholm during medieval times Displays some artifacts and dioramas Part of the old city wall is there Ends in obligatory gift shop Helpful clerk helped show me on the map how to get back to my hotel",
          "It will only take you about 1 hour to cover the museum which is underground. The museum is well laid out and gives a nice bit of history about Stockholm. Since it is free you can go and see if it suits you and if it doesn't you are not out anything.",
          "Well hidden under the Swedish Parliament this museum takes you through Stockholm's history. Fun for all as it is a small museum (doesn't take to long to see it all) and very interesting!",
          "Lots of amazing museums pieces to see . Terra cotta pieces are a delight to see all facing one way . Very interesting place to visit . There are some pieces from Eygpt , amazing pieces",
          "Currently this museum is free, but come Sept. 2018, there might be a fee required upon the election results. It is very interesting how the walls had been so close to the water, but the land has risen as the land thawed. It also gives a good perspective of what life was like",
          "This is a small and very manageable museum located right next to the Royal Palace. It's free and definitely worth a visit. I learned a lot about Medieval life in Sweden. Much of what you will see here is reconstructed, the plus side being that you can touch these items or go",
          "Very nice museum under one of the bridges connecting old town to new town. The exhibits are great. One of the workers told us about the tunnel that was used by the king to get from the palace to the stables. The tunnel, wall and cemetery are all in the original spots.",
          "I just happened upon this museum and popped in for a look. It's very informative and well laid out. It was late in the day so I only had about half an hour to look around, but could have gladly spent an hour or more there. And it's free! I'd paid good money for museums in",
          "Our first day in Stockholm and we were just walking around and noticed it so went in. As it was free we weren\u2019t expecting much so we were very impressed by how much there was to see. All the information was in English as well.",
          "The museum opened at noon. Many school children present on field trips. There is no charge for the museum (which was unusual in Stockholm). The exhibits were well documented in English; however, for 20 SEK we rented the English headsets for the audio tours. Money well spent.",
          "really interesting, well worth a visit . English info boards make it a lot easier to understand......",
          "This is a really cool museum, would definitely recommend it to anyone that was visiting the area, Can\u2019t quite remember but i think it was free also",
          "Rather elementary intro to the primitive living conditions 1000 years ago. Nice dioramas. Best item was a \"cottage\" where the farm animals would be sleeping with the owners and guests.Confusing lack of timetable for the exhibits makes for superficial understanding of the time.",
          "Perfect place for kids to learn about the history their city. Very educational for both children and adults.",
          "Great historical pieces in here, fantastic knowledge acquired and definitely worth doing whilst in Stockholm!",
          "While Gamla Stan is chock full of history, the Medieval Museum brings that history alive through educational opportunities and real exhibits of life before Stockholm became what it is today. It is amazing to see how these Stockholmers lived. The city wall running throughout the",
          "I had a lovely time visiting this museum on a cold October afternoon. Especially since it was free! I thought they presented the information in a fun, educational, visual manner and it was interesting to see the little village in the back. Makes you realize how far humans have",
          "This is a very interesting museum, it in underground with some original walls and artifacts of the original city. It is hard to find, but keep looking it is worth it. They have a ton of cool things to see, and they have exhibits that allow you to see in the day and life of",

But hundreds of years before Roger Waters was getting excited about walls The Stockholmians were doing it all with gusto and skill. As modern day Stockholmers prepared to pave part of their own paradise just to put up",
          "The medieval museum is truly fascinating with portions of the original city wall as well as many artifacts and interactive exhibits. You do not need to spend more than an hour or two there and it is right by the royal palace.",
          "Ok, probably the only no cost museum in Stockholm, but this place is truly awesome. There are so many exhibits in this underground museum that showcases the architectural design of the Medieval city of Stockholm. A definite must see while you are here... But beware of the",
          "Entrance to the museum is free. And I must say it is a really great place, definitely worth visiting - it details the history of Stockholm and its surroundings in the medieval age, details daily lives of its inhabitants at the time. There are great exhibits (like an original",
          "Free entrance. Everything there is nice and well planed. They show people a very interesting Swedish history, easy to understand.",
          "Yet another great Swedish museum with free entrance. You can find well preserved parts of the wall from medieval times, different artefacts accompanied by information and lovely scenes depicting different occupations, traditions and institutions from those times.",
          "You can learn a lot about Ye Olde Sweden in this amazing museum. It is free to enter and the staff kindly let me use one of the giant lockers for my hand luggage, with smaller lockers available too. I really enjoyed spending time here with the exhibitions (which contained",
          "It's a great museum about the history of the midevil time in sthlm, and also about the Birka, and history of Sigtuna where Sweden began. Highly recommend for everyone, only to go and stroll by ur self or with friends. Great for kids from age 7 and up. For kids younger ones you",
          "This place really doesn't get the recognition it deserves. It's located just under the bridge near the parliament building (each to walk past it) and it gives a really good insight into the history of Sweden. It's free which is rare in Stockholm and it's a good size museum.",
          "Glad someone recommended this museum to us - it's underground and we might have walked past without knowing it was there! Interesting, varied displays about medieval life in Stockholm, built around actual ruins that were discovered during construction work. Thank goodness they",
          "A great thing about Stockholm is that there are wonders to be found in lots of places, and this museum, just across a bridge from the Royal Palace, was a great find with a diverse collection of artifacts and exemplars. Plus it is in a very park area with its own delights. And",
          "It is free and it is perfect if you have some spare time and want to learn something about the history of Sweden and Stockholm.",
          "Found this whilst out for a run - quirky location near canal. Inside there are many reconstructions and finds from the Medieval era, as the name suggests. Good visit and gave better understanding of Stockholm",
          "Visited the Medieval Museum and it was well worth the visit. We had a 12 and 8 year old and they loved it also. Very interesting items on display.",
          "Small museum with few relevant pieces, but still nicely organized and pleasant. The reconstruction of Medieval Stockholm, with houses and mannequins, is well made. The museum is free. One negative aspect: too many school kids running around with no supervision, try to avoid",
          "Located under the parliament this museum offers a reconstruction of the medieval Stockholm. It really enjoyable even if it is quite small. I found amazing the fact that the access was free to be honest. The museum is well maintained and funny, I think that it would be really",
          "This is a really interesting museum. We ran in here as it was raining, and were delighted to find it was free. It is also nice because it only takes an hour or so to walk around. Definitely recommend.",
          "We are visiting Stockholm for a few days and this museum came up in our search and as it was free we thought we would take a look. The museum is not very big, it took us 45 min to walk around. There is written information giving you a glimpse of how life was in Stockholm during",
          "It always is a bit complicated to go to a museum with kids, and hence when we entered, we were wondering on how long until one of our boys would want to leave. They loved it; it was very didactic and easy to grasp, and it was also very interesting for us. The breadth and depth",
          "My husband and I enjoyed visiting this museum. We got to learn how Swedish people lived before. We also bought a book from the gift shop to read the information provided in the museum in detail.",
          "Incredible history and well-connected museum. They actually found medieval ruins while planning for a car-park! Now there is a museum on the site instead. Very interesting and informative. Even though it is a very small museum, it revived the medieval lives of Swedish people",
          "Our trip to the Medieval Museum was a recommendation from the Stockholm Pass guide. It was an incredible two hours. A fascinating portrayal of Stockholms history. I won't give too much away in my review about all the features in the museum but it was amazing. We were a mother",
          "It was a rainy Wednesday evening (on Wednesday museums and churches in Stockholm work until 19 which is later than the other days) and i was bored in my room so i decided it would be good to visit some museum, and as agreed with my colleague the choice was the Medieval museum of",
          "An hour was plenty of time to walk around the whole museum. It\u2019s family friendly and had a crafting area for children\u2019s. Great that it was free.",
          "And a place with a story to tell you breathes the old medieval tornado back in time. The interior of the museum is so real that it is felt to live in the Middle Ages is a journey through time in the picturesque medieval space a very suggestive place. There remains a must for",
          "It's free, not too busy and family friendly. In an expensive city like Stockholm these things can make a difference at a busy weekend! Slightly hidden around the side of the Parliament Building in a park under an arch it provides a glimpse into the medieval history of the city",
          "The museum is not big but takes you to the medieval times back to history. The interior of museum is so real that it feels you are in that era itself. There is a big old ship and other items found in the excavation. The site is an actual place of excavation. Amazed on how they",
          "The Stockholm Medieval Museum was an excellent way to spend an hour or two. It is not very big, though it is expertly organized and is packed with artifacts, religious art, maps, city models, and various other examples of medieval Swedish life. The best part of the museum is",
          "The medieval museum traces the history of Stockholm with original stone fortifications built in the 1530's through the medieval period, there is enough for the kids to get interested in with models of warships from the 1520's to a churchyard of a medieval house. The museum is",
          "It was very interesting and amazing. I enjoyed it so much. Easy to find and free of costs. It is not so big but full of particulars.",
          "Located under the Swedish Parliament, the Medieval Museum preserves some physical traces of early Stockholm, including part of its stone fortifications. This is a great museum for kids, since there are many reconstructions. Perhaps not a must-see but worthwhile and easily",
          "A must go if you are in Stockholm. Plus it is FREE and really informative. Great way to spend some quality time.",
          "An interesting museum on Gamla Stan with lots of artefacts from medieval times. It was cool how it's built underground within the remains of old building foundations. Not the biggest of museums, but plenty to see, and it's free! Worth stopping by for an hour or two if you're",
          "First thing to say is this museum is free but if you had to pay 150kr for it, it would be well worth it. I went at not such a busy time so the archaeologist/historian there a very nice lady gave me a quick personal tour which was very interesting. The museum contains some",
          "This is a fairly nice museum and it is also free. If you're interested in medieval history, then you will love it. I like to learn about herbal medicine, so that was what I enjoyed most.",
          "Come walk the streets of old with many small exhibits of articles and multi-media of that era. The city has done great to open this site to the public. It free but ftill feels 'first class'. Worth while for young and adults.",
          "This museum is a gem. There is a lot to see. It is well done and we thought very interesting. We have been to the Jorvik Museum in York a number of times and this compares very favourably - especially as it's FREE! I would suggest that people use the audio guide. Only costs \u00a32",
          "Entirely I liked it, but nothing interesting. Feels like this is a museum of another. The lights were so pale, was annoying me.",
          "I would say this place is a must see if you're going to visit the Nobel Museum, which is very close and also great. In the medieval museum you witness many reconstructions of how life was on medieval Stockholm, including some incredible wax statues of fictitious citizens of",
          "Under the Royal Palace, excavations nicely done. Free Really worth at least an hour. Nice restrooms.",
          "This is a great museum that's worth visiting for an hour or so... or longer if you have the time and interest. We really enjoyed the exhibits and learned a lot about medieval life. They have guided tours at certain hours of the day, so check ahead of time. One other note is that",
          "The Medieval Museum in Stockholm is literally built around and within actual excavations of the old town that existed in the middle ages. The displays are almost \"real-life,\" and give you a great view of what life was really like back then. I strongly recommend the audio-tour,",
          "We had some extra time and didn't want to outlay more money. This museum fit the bill. Free and interesting. Not crowded. They recreated some medieval houses and streets. Had the old city wall and an old boat. The four of us were glad we took the time to tour this museum. They",
          "At least it was free! The stuff in there is actually fairly interesting, but the design of the layout is poor, un-engaging and very badly lit - it sort of doesn't move you forward through the halls at all. In all, the shop was the most interesting bit!",
          "With no admission prices this museum is certainly appealing and its exhibition is interesting enough to spare a moment to pop in.",
          "On my first visit to Stockholm, this was the first museum I saw. (yes even before Vasa) This was a great introduction to the city and how it started along with a \"bunch\" of artifacts from the early days. I have been to Stockholm twice and I have visited twice; learning",
          "This museum was full of interesting and interactive information, displays and panels - but the lighting was so terrible I struggled to read a lot of it, and trying to read in the dark was miserable. This museum could be really great, and if you have perfect eyesight, I'd",
          "This was the find of our stay in Stockholm and it's free amazing we stumbled across it ! Compares with Yorvik centre and as mrs M is a primary school teacher she was gob smacked great for children !!! a must visit - Great caf\u00e9 outside too",
          "An interesting look at the excavations found under central Stockholm. The actual museum seems geared to explain to children what life in medieval Sweden was like.",
          "It has a nice architecture with beautiful statues and chandeliers inside. I enjoyed to visit the place.",
          "It is a nice museum and free of charge! The design of the museum makes us going back to medieval time of stockholm in different areas. The museum is not big so you only need about 1 hour for everything.",
          "The museum has a great history of medieval times. The exhibits includes things the kids can climb on and go through with recreations of streets and models of what the city used to look like.",
          "Its worth a quick visit to see how the Swedes lived in olden times . The entry is through an underground tunnel . There you will find some interesting facts",
          "Definitely worth a visit, has many interesting exhibits which are well documented. Big bonus is that it's free.",
          "Largely underground, so easy to miss, this gem of a museum is constructed around a piece of city wall discovered during building work. No, you're right, that doesn't sound very promising, but it's very well designed and does an excellent job of explaining Stockholm's history.",
          "This museum is really nice and is free, so you definitely need to stop by. It's not a really big museum, you might go through it in about an hour, more or less depending on how much you read. The medieval style buildings inside really give you a glimpse of the life at that time.",
          "This is a wonder of an approach of when construction work reveals historical objects and buildings. It was magnificently turned into a museum which describes the area and the way people lived. A free guided tour organzed when we arrived was good.",
          "They mean well, I suppose, but unless you are visiting with young children or really have a lot of time on your hands, there are dozens of better ways to spend your time in Stockholm. The main attraction of the museum is a fragment of the old city wall, but the operative word",
          "Set up recently based on the great excavation carried out on this island! Good time pass and that too free of cost!",
          "I've already been in Europe's greatest museums but this Stockholm's Medieval Museum has to be one of my favorites. Not only because it tells a very interesting and visual story about the city (from how it started, how it was built, what happened there and what people",
          "This cool museum is underground, located in the some of Stockhom's mediveval excavations. The museum features the history of Stockholm and some of the major aspects of medieval life in Stockholm. It has a load of great displays including a longship, lots of artefacts,",
          "I do love museums, and asking about the Medieval Museum to the Swedish friends, nobody knew about it. it is a small museum close to the Royal Palace, tell the history of medieval era, how people were punished in public, some ships, a small replica of a house, but I didnt find",
          "Takes about an hour and tells you about the life of a common in Medieval Stockholm. Has actual artifacts along with modern displays. Various short films shows life in the past.",
          "Discovered during some building excavation the original settlement is recreated and displayed in a most engaging way. A fairly small museum that can show you the past from a commoner's perspective in an hour or two of your time. Located not far from the palace.",
          "We were by the Royal Palace and decided to take a stroll down the steps to a nearby park to take a few photos of the beautiful scenery when we discovered this museum. We were surprised to see that there was no entrance fee and we were impressed with what was on offer when we",
          "This museum is under the Royal Palace. Under??? If our Free Tour guide didn\"t show us we never would have found it. No signage on street level. There is a stairwelll across the street that leads you down to another level. It was worth the time. The museum is well laid out",
          "This is a cool museum if medieval history is your thing although it can be a little hard to find as it's actually underneath the bridge on the map. An interesting exhibition with its own mock medieval village to explore, one that both the adults and kids will enjoy.",
          "If medieval is your thing, then you should enjoy this museum. Some very interesting history about this particular spot, which was once destined to be a parking garage until they began an excavation.",
          "It was a little difficult to find the museum entrance as it is tucked below in a small park in an island like area. To my pleasant surprise the museum was free of charge to everyone. It provides details on initial human settlement in Stockholm all the way up to",
          "gives you stockholms early history and is well done and free. It has good displays. Nice bathrooms as well",
          "This is a museum which has a lot of interesting facts and you get insight how life was really like in the middle ages. There are houses that children can run around in and then there's the dreaded gallows. The only downside is that they have some film clips which are only",
          "This is one the many free museums you can visit in Stockholm. As the name cam imply, they were having an exposition of the history of Cyprus, ancient times, and of Egyptian art. The exposition was amazing, fantastic. From marble figures of gods and goddesses, to ancient",
          "Given the expense of the city, it is refreshing to visit a Free museum that explores the life and times of medieval Stockholm, worth a visit and in good weather a leisurely relax or picnic outside near the fountain",
          "I was recently in Stockholm and I visited the Medieval Museum while wandering around the streets of Gamla Stan. I found it hard to locate at first, but when I found the small park at the Norrbro Bridge and went down the steps towards the water, it is on the right-hand side",
          "The medieval artifacts and way of living is really good represented here. The only worst thing is that the museum is so dark. Except this it is free and there is so much to see and read. I recommend you all.",
          "As you walk the Norrbro Bridge from Norrmalm to Gamla Stan you'll notice a small park to your left - Str\u00f6mparterren Park. Wander down the stairs to the park located on the tiny island of Helgeandsholmen and explore the beautiful views, cafe, fountain, and several statues before",
          "This Museum is located next to a cute little park on the island next to the Royal Palace. Museum entrance is free. They do have audio guides available, however, I do not think they are necessary to learn the history of the excavation. The museum is filled with many artifacts",
          "They've built a museum around a piece of medieval wall surrounding the city at the time. The ancient wall was found during the excavation for a public parking that was cancelled and the Museum was built instead. They've added other evidences of the period and they are explaining",
          "This free museum is very interesting & has exhibits on the medieval history of Stockholm. It is located under the Norrbro bridge just north of the Royal Palace. There is a small sign on the bridge directing you to the entrance. It is well worth a visit.",
          "Fantastic museum Note CLOSED on Mondays, and only opens 12 noon! Easy to find (under the bridge) Lovely garden by the water - bring your own snack /drink there's no cafe Good toilets and lockers Fantastic insight into days gone by, I really liked it here! Great place to cool",
          "While a bit hard to locate the entrance (integrated into the wall under the Norrbro), it is a cozy museum that has enough to be entertaining while not being overbearing. The free admission is also a massive plus.",
          "This is a very interesting little museum showing the medieval history of Stockholm. I especially liked the dioramas which show how Stockholm has changed over the centuries. Plus it is free.",
          "Interesting to see real mumies and old mediteranian stuff. The exhibition is a bit old fashioned with a lot of things in glass monters with just small texts abotu every piece, Very ncie wioth free entrence. Museum shop is very nice. Nice jewellery based on ancient models at very",
          "It is a small museum so we weren't in there for hours - we didn't do the audio tour so it might be longer then. We did read most of the information signs though and they were interesting to understand the whole idea. It was a very visual presentation of what life was like during",
          "The museum looks quite small from outside (entrance is from under a road bridge), but it's easy to spend here an hour or so. The museum is built on former excavation of medieval settlement. Parts of it are historic, while some exhibits are reconstructions; actually the museum is",
          "As some people point out before, it may be better for Children but it is also enjoyable for adults. You can learn some interesting facts about Stockholm life and even experience the way people used to live. It is free which is a plus and it is really close to the parliament, so",
          "This is a well-designed, free museum. It is rather small and the focus is clearly geared more towards children than towards adults. If you are serious about history then it is perhaps worth visiting for the opportunity to see the only standing section of the Stockholm city walls",
          "Of all the museums we saw in Stockholm, this was one of the best--plus it's free. It gives one insight into life in the medieval city. There's plenty to grab a child's attention too.",
          "We walked around the museum for about 2 hours using the 2 euro audio guides they offer. The attention to details in recreating a medieval environment is quite satisfactory. The museum is clearly designed for educational purposes, as it also has a workshop in which kids can",
          "What started out to be a car park became a most valuable archaeological find that then became the Medieval Museum. It's a wonderful interpretation of the life and times of Medieval Stockholm told with diorama and using the actual structures and artifacts that were uncovered",
          "Great museum with a lot of sculptures and things to see. Hidden away under a bridge is where you'll find it, it's free which is great if you're on a budget.",
          "We walked in circles around Parliament until we realized where the entrance was. This is a little gem! Between the life-size dioramas and the tiny recreations, this museum is geared to children and adults alike. At the entrance there are facilities, a locker room and free",
          "Thankfully this site was not lost to the developers as was the original intention. You can exlpore Stockholm through the ages in this free museum. The information is in Swedish and English and the reconstructions make you feel like you're in an old monastery or tavern. Many",
          "Tucked under the Norrbro bridge is the entrance to this very impressive museum. There is a lot to see, we spent a couple of hours walking around looking at all the exhibits that are centred around the old city walls. Definitely worth a look, as an added bonus entry is free.",

        "wiki": "Junibacken is a children\u2019s attraction, founded by Staffan G\u00f6testam, Fredrik Uhrstr\u00f6m and Peder Wallenberg. It is situated on the island of Djurg\u00e5rden in the centre of Stockholm, Sweden.\nIt was officially opened by the Swedish Royal Family on 8 June 1996. It is Stockholm\u2019s 5th most-visited tourist attraction. It is devoted to Swedish children\u2019s literature, but especially Astrid Lindgren. Outside the building is a bronze statue of Lindgren. The art direction and images for the interior design were made by Swedish artist Marit T\u00f6rnqvist, who had previously made illustrations for more recent versions of Lindgren's books.Junibacken contains the largest children\u2019s bookstore in Sweden. The lockers in the entrance hall are unusual in that each is in the form of a giant book-spine, featuring world classics such as Treasure Island and The Jungle Book. Other main attractions include a Storybook Square, a mock public square where each house is devoted to a separate Swedish children\u2019s author (other than Lindgren), from the earliest writers such as Elsa Beskow to recent writers such as Sven Nordqvist. The square ends at a mock Vimmerby railway station. The station also presents framed copies of Lindgren memorabilia, including a glowing letter of praise for Lindgren from then president of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev. From the station visitors then take a theme-train ride through the world of Astrid Lindgren\u2019s books, with one \u201cstage setting\u201d for each of her well-known works, such as Madicken, Karlsson-on-the-Roof, Ronia the Robber's Daughter, Emil i L\u00f6nneberga, and The Brothers Lionheart. The train ride ends at a half-side reconstruction of Villa Villekulla, the home of Lindgren's most well-known character, Pippi Longstocking.\nIt also includes a theatre, restaurant and temporary exhibition space. The temporary exhibition space is usually devoted to a single author or character and normally remains in place for 11 months. Among the most popular of the temporary exhibitions have been Pettson and Findus, and Trazan och Banarne.\nJunibacken is not a museum according to ICOM's definition because it has no collections. It is, however, a member of both Swedish ICOM and Riksf\u00f6rbundet Sveriges museer.\n\n\n== Changes ==\nIn 2006, the dragon scene in the Story Train was modified to become less scary. Originally, the dragon scene featured the guests passing in front of Katla, seeing her from very close. It was changed because it scared many children who rode the Story Train. It broke down the same year it was changed. In the new dragon scene, the guests see Katla at a distance, from Skorpan's and Jonathan's point of view. Another difference is that the old dragon moved a little, roaring as the guests saw her. It was made of Latex. The new dragon does not move and is made of metal.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJunibacken\u2019s own web site\nPanorama from Junibacken at Virtualsweden",

          "Good for kids for a few hours. Cafeteria is so-so. We brought snacks but they got hungry. The storybook ride was a bit dramatic for the young ones.",
          "This is a must for a family with young kids, we really enjoyed the soft play area and the kids loved the train ride which was like being in a fairy tale. Lovely lunch downstairs as well",
          "What a lovely place to be with kids. My kids 3 and 5y they loved the place. The story train is nice, it go through favourite stories with different languages. For the smaller kids, the train might be little bit scary. There is house from Pippi and other play arenas from",
          "This Astrid Lindgren`s Fantasy World is a must for children all ages! All AL characters in a nice fantasy playground. But above all, the train will take you trough a real fantasy and this is great also for adults (with fairytale told in many languages along the ride). It`s a",
          "Kind of death story, not to go to with kids. At that train at the beginning that was kind of fairytale but at the end and the continuation it was kind of the way to death. Do Not Recommend this place for kids. No Ways For Kids.",
          "Probably good for kids less than 7 years old. We are Australian and went with our 8 year old who loves Pippi, so she loved that part but not much else. Pippi leggings would have been nice for older kids.",
          "This place is awesome for children, keeps them out of the cold and entertained for a couple of hours. It\u2019s a short tram ride #7 from the city centre. It start off with a ride on a train where they narrate a story. There are a couple of areas to play and explore and a great",
          "As an adult was impressed by the train journey in the museum, really enjoyed it :) children were just super happy - it looks there is not that big territory, but children can spend a lot of time there playing, being in the magic world of story. Definitely in the list of must",
          "The place is magnificent. The kids will love it. There are lots of rooms with crazy / innovative ways of keeping the children busy and entertained. They also have a restaurant with really good food. Cons: A little bit expensive.",
          "It was the first children museum I\u2019ve ever been that the adults prices were more expensive than the children. It was shocking . Only good thing the train ride , and the pippi langstrumpf show .",
          "Recently visited with our 5 year old. The story train was the best part - even the adults enjoyed. A pleasant day aimed at the youngsters.",
          "It's an amazing place, especially for fans of Astrid Lindgren. It carries a little of everything and I can really remember enjoying it as a child and now for the past years I've been going with my daughters, now 3 and 4, but visiting junibacken regularly since babies basically.",
          "It is expensive literally. It is ok for whoever lives around the area and makes an annual ticket.. but for the visitors or tourist is definately too expensive. The thing which is the main attraction is the Train wagon. This was very carefully made and is top the Kids. Actually",
          "Not sure who enjoyed more - me or my kids... Amazing place. They still remember it and talk about \"The fairy tail train\"... Kids are 5 and 7.",
          "I had read the reviews of this museum saying that it was more geared towards younger children, but with a morning to fill before visiting Gronalund I decided to take my nine year old along. This was a mistake. The museum is located in a lovely area of Stockholm with great views",
          "A bit overpriced ! Generally, a nice and joyful place for children. Mostly appreciated, I suppose, by those children who have read the related children books - the chance is quite big though! Otherwise nice scenery and a short train tour, nothing spectacular, in a global",
          "If you\u2019re in Sweden with kids who have ever read Pippi Longstocking, then you should go to Junibacken. Astrid Lindgren insisted that other writers should be recognised, but this is her place. There\u2019s a sweet play area furnished with buildings from many leading Swedish kids\u2019",
          "The entrance fee is expensive (around \u00a360 for 2 adults and 2 children at the current exchange rate) and the museum isn't large. However, the kids enjoyed it and we did end up spending 3 hours there. The story book ride at the start is well conceived and beautifully done. This",
          "We were warned by other reviews and should have listened. Exuberant prices for the adults. Please listen and only enter with one adult. Small, old, and maybe worth 2 hours of your time. If you have nostalgic memories go by yourself and enjoy. But don't put unnecessary strain on",
          "This museum is really meant only for small kids. The story train is incredible, however, it only takes 10 minutes. And that\u2019s really about all there is to do there. For nearly 60 euros I would have expected a little more. The bookshop was nice, but nothing special. I am glad we",
          "Overall, this is a well laid out play zone for younger kids. Our 9 yr old was on the cusp of being too old for all of the activities. Ages 2-7 seems to be the target age here. If you have kids at age, they will love it.",
          "Going here is money well spent. We had a great afternoon at Junebacken. For those of us familiar with Swedish books and stories it is just great. The story train is amazing and even though I have done it many times before I still enjoy it very much. A must for families with",
          "Place was nice, we had about 25min. To get in. And we were there little after place opened. We did try to visit this place day before but line was so long and wait time to storytrain was 2hours ( it was about 12 o'clock) There was a nice playrooms for kids inside, of course",
          "We paid over 70 euros for 2 adults and 2 children, and it entertained the kids for no more than an hour. The Story Train was nicely done, but overall this was poor value for money. I find it hard to understand how adults are charged an entrance fee when they are merely",
          "This museum is a joke. We have two little daughters and apart form piling up bricks \ud83e\uddf1 there was just a freaking patio with almost two slides and a plane. All for \u20ac64, stay away from this place, nobody cares for children, they just jump over the roofs of the houses and their",
          "Although this is very much for children, I enjoyed it too! The story train is very well done, the cafe is cute with a nice selection of delicious cakes & biscuits, the play areas are imaginative & entertaining, & the exhibits are interesting. Also, it is indoors, so perfect for",
          "As a Finn I thought that I knew everything worth to know about Astrid Lindgren and I also thought that our (almost) 9 years old son would think this place is too childish and boring. Well I was wrong. Junibacken was the best experience we had in two days in Stockholm. The play",
          "Wonderful experience for readers of Pippi Longstocking and other children's book characters. Various rooms with different activities including a story train ride. This is a definite \"do\".",
          "Junibacken is a great place for kids with lots to do themed around the stories of Astrid Lindgren and other children\u2019s authors. The train is what you pay for, but the other areas including the shop and the other rooms at great too.",
          "We have been there with our kids (5 and 8 years). They loved it. They liked the free playing beteween all the story scenes. The ride with the story train is very good. The entrance is quite expensive.",
          "It was raining when we went there and I'm glad we spent the morning there as it was indoors. Really good for kids and the story train was really nice. My kids absolutely loved the place even though they hd no clue who Pippi was before.",
          "Took my 5 year old and her 4 and 3 year old cousins to Junibacken and absolutely loved it. You got instantly sucked into a world of beloved fairytales and the admission ticket pruce did not make you angry nor did the cafeteria prices. The kids spent 6hours playing and we",
          "We read tons of reviews and were very underwhelmed. There were a few play areas the would be great for kids under 4. We went to the Pipi show and it was all in Swedish, but it was entertaining. There was a ride that was the only part that was of any interest. If you have kids",
          "I grew up loving the fairy tales of Astrid Lindgren and visited the Junibacken for the first time with my children about tventy years ago. Now I was there with my grandchildren and they were extatic, thrilled and so happy to experience stories and characters the know so well. We",
          "Inspired by Astrid Lindgren's stories but also including other authors and their stories, including my favourite Pettson & Findus, Junibacken is a delight. They really understand how children want to play, discover and learn. For the under 6's, and for grandfathers too, this",
          "This is a very well thought out kids\u2019 centre. We don\u2019t know much about the relevant stories beyond half memories of Pippi Longstocking but this didn\u2019t get in the way of a lovely day. We started with lunch, and I thoroughly recommend the cafe, and then visited the children\u2019s",
          "Our 4 years old kid really enjoyed the place. Even adults were fascinated by the \"story train\" (I personally was very amazed by engineering of the thing) even though the story itself probably is incomprehensible without prior meeting to Lindgren's production). At least during",
          "Junibacken was really useful and a nice enjoyment for the kids. There are so many things to cover the attention of the children.",
          "Went there with two year old and it was worth every penny. Many places to climb and play. Top attraction was the story train, where you travel through the fairytales, even adults liked it a lot. Also a nice place to eat and prices are reasonable. Big thumbs up.",
          "Our children are 6 and 9 years old. They loved Junibacken. I was concerned due to some of the reviews we read, but I am so glad we went. The story train was an interesting concept that made you wish there were more story trains for all of the classics. The story in the story",
          "All the popuiar Swedish children stories in 10 minutes with great effects, storytelling and set-design. It's not only great for children, but also for adults. The only problem is that there are children from minority languages who aren't priviliged to understand the stories.",
          "We visited when crowds were low (March) and because my 14 year old grew up loving the story of Pippi. Good news is we did not have to wait at all -- not sure I could have done it with crowds! Bad news is that there was very little about Pippi, and really not for kids over the",
          "I only visited this place because the conference I was attending had a banquet here. It is clearly designed for kids but, had I ever heard of the author or read any of her stories when I was a kid it might have been interesting as an adult too. Sadly this person's stories never",
          "My friend an I traveled from Iceland for a long weekend with our 7 y old daughters, they loved adventuring in Junibacken, we had their scooters outside while visiting the museum and they were there when we got outside. Small, well organized and a lot of adventure.",
          "Remember the fun island on Pinnochio where the boys turned into donkeys? Recently binge watched The Good Place? Then recreate that feeling with Junibacken. It looks magical, the detail is incredible, it seems like it ought to be a great spot to spend hours with your kid and",
          "There is a great restaurant and play area for young children and an incredible interactive story telling exhibit.",
          "A must do in Stockholm, especially if you have young children. This place is so well designed to be fun for kids and adults that are kids at heart will also enjoy lots as well. So many different areas for them to play and immerse themselves into different scenes. My 18 month",
          "We have all read the Pippi Langstumpe books - a visit to Junibacken takes you right back to your childhood. We love to take our grand daughter along and join in her delight at the offerings.",
          "I visited Stockholm several times but this year I went there for the first time with my kids. For this reason I went for the first time Junibacken. I was impressed. All the different areas give the visitor a unique experience. The Pippi village shaped playground, the",
          "This is a great (although a bit expensive) attraction for small children and Astrid Lindgren fans. Train ride is magical. Not much else for adults though, wouldn\u2019t recommend without kids.",
          "we were couple without children visiting this museum. lady at the ticket office smiled a lot while we were paying for the tickets. there are mostly parents with little children in the museum. anyway, museum is worth visiting, although it is dedicated to the children. entrance",
          "I went to Junibacken after 4 o'clock and just caught the last train ride! Even though I went with no kids and I am probably too old, I just wanted to see the storytrain. And it was absolutely worth it! You are sitting in this box which will fly through the different stages, the",
          "Junibacken was a great experience for young and old today. There were no lines of people to contend with and our 3 year old grandson really enjoyed the different play areas! As a grand parent I really appreciated the train ride through history even though some parts were a bit",
          "I loved reading Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking and I desperately wanted to visit and see Junibacken when I went to Eurovision in 2016. I was not disappointed and neither was my 7 year old son. We enjoyed the train ride the most, the entire experience was just magical. I",
          "We had heard so muck good about Junibacken, and longed to go there. We had a fantastic train ride listening to Astridscalm and beautiful voice. We recommend this ride for anyone, any age. But the rest is exaggerated, and is not worth visiting.",
          "Junibacken is mostly suitable children under school age. There are several great playground rooms but it's hard to play when kids of all age rush each other and all places. Opposite to playgrounds, story train is suitable for older. Start is easy but going to the end it gets",
          "We took our 2 year old son - it was a great day for him and certainly beat some of the alternatives we would have picked. There is an arts and craft area, a couple of play areas which are really cool, a train story ride which can be played in English and a restaurant. I was",
          "Me and my friend (both early thirties) decided to visit as we both loved Astrid Lindgren in our childhood. Little did we know that we would have an absolut blast! The \"museum\" has been built wonderfully thoughtful and the story train was absolutely adorable! Kids surely do have",
          "We visited with my Pippi loving six year old and I paid the \u20ac65 to get in. We were given no information at the desk aside from the earliest time we could go on the story train. The stories play area is nice but quite limited. The train is delightful but lasts 10 minutes.",
          "This was our first visit to the children\u2019s theme park. If you don\u2019t have children, you probably won\u2019t appreciate it but if you do, it is magical. On entry you are given a time slot for Atrid Lindgren\u2019s Story Train. While you\u2019re waiting (we had a 20min wait on an August",
          "The live Pippi performance was fun even for kids who don\u2019t speak Swedish. The story train was also good. The rest of the place is mostly for kids under 6. I wish there was more about Astrid Lindgren person and life",
          "Went there with a 1and a half years old baby and had a great experience! Lovely place for kids, you can spend a few hours there even a day maybe!",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect when going to Junibacken but it was included with the Stockholm Pass so I thought I would give it a go. Upon entering I was told by the receptionist that it would be a 2 hour 30 minute wait for the Story Train, and being unwilling and unable to wait",
          "We read mix reviews about Junibacken mainly because it\u2019s a relatively small place at a high entrance fees. We decided to give it a go and we had an amazing time with our 3yo. Even though we didn\u2019t know Pippi Longstocking before or any other classic Swedish children stories, we",
          "My wife and I visited Junibacken one afternoon in August after we left the Vasa Museum (amazing, by the way!). As Junibacken is just across through a small park it was logical for us to go there next. And as we both really like the stories of Astrid Lindgren we were really",
          "What an amazing place. The attention to detail is incredible. It's a vey interactive experience for young kids. They get to play with dozens of machines, cars, planes, kitchens - you name it - all of which they know from their storybooks. The train ride (which becomes a gondola",
          "Something new to discover round every corner. Our kids, aged 5 and 2,throughly enjoyed their visit, as did mum and dad. Definitely their highlight of or visit to Stockholm.",
          "Unfortunaly Junibacken was disappointing. We also thought that it was really overpriced. I'm a fan of Astrid Lindgren's work and I guess this didn't meet my expectations. We visited Junibacken in February and I was under the impression that some parts were under construction.",
          "We enjoy and traveling to Junibacken during our trip to Stockholm in June. We have been there during midsummer. So we took a day to visit Junibacken, which we very much enjoyed.",
          "Entrance fees of Junibacken: adults SEK179, 2-15 years old SEK149 Duration: 2-3 hours Entrance fees of Skansen open air museum: adults SEK195, 4-15 years old SEK60 Duration: at least half day With comparison of the above two places, Junibacken is obviously not worth it. It's a",
          "We were here for 2 hours. Junibacken is a children\u2019s attraction, It is situated on the island of Djurg\u00e5rden in the centre of Stockholm, Sweden. Plenty of children themed games are available.Environment is exhilarating.",
          "We bought tickets for Junibacken to please our daughter and our two grandchildren. They just love the Astrid Lindgren stories and the world she created. However, we were disappointed in the attractions. They were dated and the place was overcrowded. The shows put on are all in",
          "We found this interesting for young children but it was quite expensive as Adults had to buy a ticket too! The story train ride was lovely and is worth the wait.",
          "You travel through astrid lindgrens stories with a small train and change the perspective. Explanations are in a lot of languages. Not only for kids great. A must if you know some of her books.",
          "Junibacken is an absolute delight and the amazing story-train is almost worth the price of admission alone! It definitely helps to be familiar with Swedish children's literature before you visit, especially the work of Astrid Lindgren, but even if you do not know any of these",
          "The story train is absolutely amazing and grown ups will enjoy it as well! The other \"rooms \" n Junibacken are also very beautiful and especially if you are travelling with kids you really should visit it! I left the Junibacken with a big smile on my face!",
          "This was fun, especially the train. I don\u2019t know however, if it worked for someone that doesn\u2019t know well the Astrid Lindgren world of characters (I don\u2019t know all of them myself). The food at the restaurant was ordinary but reasonably priced. The view over STOCKHOLM is great,",
          "If anyone can tell a story, the Swedes can. This is an interactive storytelling experience, based on Astrid Lindgren series and of course Pippi Longstocking. I have never seen so many children sit so quietly and in awe during the performance. The story train takes all to another",
          "Although this place definitely has some really nice things to do and see, it was an absolute madhouse during our visit. I mentioned this to one of the young people at the reception, and she shrugged and said that crowds are normal in the summer and it was our mistake for coming",
          "It\u2019s like small fairytale world with nice decoration and creative playrooms especially for small kids. Story train is absolutely fantastic. You\u2019re travelling inside a fairytale by a small cabin and listening story. I hope they will add more languages for story train, especially",
          "We visited junibacken with a three year old who loves Pippi. She spent better part of day there and was unwilling to leave. Loved the theater, even though she doesn't speak Swedish. Was a bit scared in the train especially when the dragon came. Otherwise she loved to be there.",
          "The train thingy is super ebin. It is entertaining not only for children but for adults aswell. The rest of the place is not that interesting.",
          "I wanted to love this museum as I love children's books. But didn't know any of the featured books or characters apart from Pippi. I think that wouldn't matter for younger children who can play in the house etc- but not much of interest here for an 11 year old- apart from the",
          "I love Junibacken. it's a refreshing place amongst all plastic activities and places that are advertised to children. All the details are so well made, the train ride with the stories is wonderful, also the shows in the Pippi room. The only problem is it is way too popular, and",
          "We visited Junibacked with our two daughters (11 and 9), and I would say this is for smaller kids. The best of the museum is the \"tour\" and the room before the shop. Otherwise, it's small and you can finish in less than one hour.",
          "This is a definite must for families with young kids. They have a lovely train ride showing Astrid Lingren stories. Their park outside is cute for kids to play in. Disadvantage is that shows are in Swedish. No English shows available.",
          "I was there without my daughter and it was a pity for me every moment. It is a great, fantastic place, especially the train. And you have to prepare a lot of money for the shop, because you have a lot of interesting things there. I really recommend this place!",
          "This was special. As a Dutchman I'm not familiar with of all the stories of Astrid Lindgren. But some of the things inside of Junibacken brought me back to my childhood. Thank you for this special experience.",
          "This museum is a must see for the family with young children! Our 5-year old had a blast there. Even though we wasn't familiar with half of the stories by Astrid Lindgren that were mentioned there :) There is a full size Pippi's house and you can climb it and look into the",
          "Junibacken is definitely worth a visit, especially if you are with kids. Our 7 years old daughter said that she would travel to Junibacken even from Australia (actually, we travelled from Moscow, Russia). It is a treasure for children, but we also enjoyed it. Can only say that",
          "It's always crowded here and takes forever to get inside. Very sweaty wait, with small impatient children.",
          "A must go for kids if you are in Stockholm with kids. This place has toy train which takes you around telling stores. Very interesting for the kids and adults. A must go.",
          "even if I'm a bit older for Pippi L\u00e5ngstrump and friends, thats a magical place to visit even if you'r not a child! theres a beautiful diorama in which you go with a little train. even the restaurant is wonderful and very well furnished for babies and adults. It's near to the",
          "This was just beautiful for little ones (and big kid mums like me)! The stories were evident throughout of Astrid Lindgren and my little 4.5 year old could have spent the entire day in there! It is great from the moment you walk in where you can leave your coats and bags",
          "Astrid Lindgrens world..not a child or adult that are familiar with Pippi Longstocking Emil I L\u00f6nneberga and s\u00e5 on..will go home sad..it's a lovely place for kids to run around and play..while the adults is relaxing in the coffe-shop looking over the water and all the",
          "Although the story train was a little morbid, our 20 month old really enjoyed the play areas and didn\u2019t want to leave!! Definitely good to kill some time and tire the kids out on a cold snowy day!",
          "we were a bit unsure what to expect and though having heard of the author A. Lindgren and Junibacken, we were a bit taken aback, how sad the key story of the place was. the museum is nicely done. well organized from entrance to exit and the areas where the kids can play are",
          "It was a pleasure seeing my son recognizing the world of the children books characters he like built up in full scale. Though it's not a huge place there are tons of things for the kids to do. Next time we'll try the story train as well.",
          "We went with our two year old to Junibacken shortly after New Years. The good news is that he had a good time, the bad news is that the place was ridiculously crowded, way overpriced and more than a little odd. There are lots of things for little ones to do, unfortunately, the",
          "My first impression was we were going to visit a day care centre...totally wrong! Prams and children everywhere. We took the mini train as I love fairy tails and my children grew up with some of the Swedish writers stories. The train ride is like having a story read to you",
          "Just perfect,regarding my endless love to Astrid Lindgren,I was already full feel with the positive vibes!The place was wonderful,it travels you through the famous stories you have already read,or seen.I would definitely go there again again!!We felt dreamy!!",
          "If you read Pippi Longstocking as a kid, you can't skip a visit to Junibacken when in Stockholm! This museum was part of the 2 day pass we bought, and it was high up on my list of things I wanted to see. We were 2 adults traveling (no kids) and we thoroughly enjoyed",
          "It's a great place for kids (and adults) who grew up with these stories. The story train is the high light.",
          "We been here before christmas, for everyone was comfortable (not too much children's). Very nice atmosphere like you in story from Papy, Karlson and others- I recommend for family to visited it!",
          "A magical place to visit even if you haven\u2019t read any of the Swedish authors\u2019 stories. Don\u2019t miss the train ride! Even our 1,5 year old and our friend\u2019s 6 month old enjoyed it. The end of the ride will take you to the 2nd floor and Pippi Longstocking\u2019s house - everything is made",
          "The tour (very lovely, therefore I gave 2 stars overall) was timed and you only could take it once for the hefty price you paid. The Moominland and the Villa Villekulla were just for playing, there was nothing informative about it. Super-waste of money.",
          "We visited on a wet and cold weekday but that didn\u2019t stop many parents bringing their young children. So clever and inspirational that even our 13 & 10YO wanted to stay longer. The ride was unexpectedly unique with many memorable stories. There were also some great indoor",
          "This is a great day out with lots of sets for imagination play and Pippi Longstockings house on the second floor. The ride is a little strange but overlooking that its a really fun day out",
          "Went here with a private group for a tour and dinner after hours. Totally shocked after our visit. This place has an amazing history and the owner and staff are very hospitable. My first impression was we were going to visit a day care centre...totally wrong! There is an amazing",
          "visited with my wife and 2 children aged 7 and 3. Everyone had a great time the mini world is excellent and the story ride is unbelievable if only we had something like this in the uk. getting to the island via the boat is fun too. if you visit Stockholm make sure you find time",
          "an absolute must when in stockholm and if you travel with kids. Great activity and well organized. Highly recommended",
          "My daughter was extremely excited by this place and she enjoyed every moment there. Don't miss it if you travel with small kids (although mine is 10 years old).",
          "Very nice place when going with small children. Lots of things to do and to discover. A must for families",
          "Junibaken was a fun way for my 5 year old son to play on a rainy afternoon in Stockholm. We weren\u2019t at all familiar with the stories represented but that didn\u2019t stop him from having fin with other kids and enjoying using his imagination. There are three separate areas, one",
          "The museum has a reputation of children's paradise and it's true but it's even for grownups if one is not too much serious and boring grownup. As for me I enjoyed a lot Pippi Longstocking's house.",
          "The display was smaller than I expected. Not all characters are presented. Children know more than they can find in the museum. The journey was very exciting, lots of details but we moved too fast to be able to see and examine everything. The last story presented was The",
          "'Ello chaps! Junibacken is a wonderous playland come to life. This is where the stories of Pippi Longstonging come to life. Junibacken is a children's museum dedicated to the literature of children's author Astrid Lindgren. The attention to detail is impeccable. It is",
          "We took our kids age 12, 9 and 4 here. They absolutely LOVED IT. The story ride is like Peter Pan's disney ride. Captures the imagination. The rest of the rooms with houses and creative slides, playrounds and displays that mirror the stories is simply amazing. We only knew a",
          "This is a very fun filled place, and well worth the trip. We especially enjoyed the train trip, well worth doing. Watching the young children at play and laughing was so good. Not something I though worth my time, but it was a very good hours worth.",
          "Located at the Djurgarden (with tons of other attractions), the Junibacken is the children's museum where you will find the legendary and iconic Astrid Lindgreen and her vision for the park and museum. Prepared to be mesmerized with the story book as much as your child!",
          "I went by myself and was obviously the only one as there were mainly families with small kids. But it was absolutely worth going. They have a train running through the \"museum\" and it was great. Seeing small Emil, the brother lion heart and ronja. Only pipi was kind of missing",
          "My kids were still to young to remember Ronja and the brothers Lionheart but I do. The museum offers plenty do for the little ones. There are several rooms of climb-on, play-in scenes from books I mostly haven't even read. Children can play shopkeeper or aviator, climb through",
          "Being an adult couple we didn't planned a visit to Junibacken. After a disappointing visit to the Nordic Museum we had some extra time and decided to visit Junibacken because it was included in our Stockholm cards. Glad we did. Being almost closing time we headed directly to the",

          "We really enjoyed the visit with my 2 years old child! We arrived at 10, opening time, and I can tell now it was a good idea since after 12 it gets really overcrowded. The house of Pippi and the train experience are impressive . All the live performances were in Swedish so we",
          "I went to Junibacken as I am a Reading Specialist and the literature aspect of it interested me. I also was a fan of Pippi Longstockings as a little girl. I was quite impressed with the little ride that gave you a little bit of a preview diorama of some of Sweden's most",
          "Being a fan of Astrid Lindgren, I couldn't have missed this museum. But it turned out to be quite disappointing. Probably it's going to be nice for the kids, but wasn't interesting for me at all and in addition one (supposedly) quite big part of the museum was closed for",
          "This place is paradise for everyone - adults and kids - the world of Astrid Lindgren . You literally walk throw her great books , enjoy the amazing designs of unique rooms , even the restaurant is styled by Peppy Long Stocking !",

          "We went here with school children age 6-7 years old and we had a lot of fun, all of us! Especially the fairytale train which took us through the stories by Astrid Lindgren.",
          "Just a small play ground. Not worth the price of entrance. Whats really unbelievable is that in one of the rooms kids take thick papers and enveloped And shred them. What a waste of paper. How many trees are chopped for nothing.",
          "A nice place to visit with kids (maybe up to 8-9 yr old not max) The stories are Swedish so some might not be known to international visitors but still kids get to play and have fun. The small train ride i believe is the most fun going through a small story (about 15min)",
          "Junibacken has a nice exibition of Astrid Lindgren's literary worlds and very little else. There's a little Pippi-themed playground and another little playground with a doll house and a few tubes for the children to crawl through, and three shops: cafe, bookstore and ice cream",
          "We went there with our 1.5 year old (which we now also figured out is too young for it) but were disputes of that quite disappointed. It's basically a totally overcrowded indoor playground with few slides and playhouses. The mentioned train is well done (only for older kids",
          "This place is a very nice place to visit when you are with kids. we visited it a few years back (kids are not with us this year). if you have time in Stockholm go visit here.",
          "We didn't have children with us but as we are both teachers we wanted to take this in. Brilliant for families with lots of interactive areas to keep children amuzed. The story train was excellent, a real surprise and worth the entrance fee itself.",

          "I have been waiting for several years to be able to show the Story Train to my children and they absolutely loved it. Read Astrid Lindgren's stories and you will love this place.",
          "Very good and interesting place for children and not only. The story train is entertaining for all ages.",
          "It was relatively crowded when we went and since the museum is made to be cozy, it felt a bit cramped. Cafeteria, terrace and shop are probably just as big as the actual exhibition areas. It is fun for kids, but the fantastic experience comes with the \"train@ that goes into",
          "Make sure to go there early and on working days. Made with idea to be a homey small cosy place, but in reality packed so a bit of spoiler with the cues. Once kid gets o attraction its of course great",
          "Truly worth a visit, especially if you have younger kids in your party. The story train is a very good experience and reveals a lot about Sweden's most prominent children's' story writers. The play area before- and after the train ride is worth it and the shop has a great",
          "We went to this museum because it is so close to the Vasa museum and the Nordic museum and it was on the Stockholm pass. I was glad we went, even though we didn't have any kids with us! It is a fun stop, especially for the young and young at heart.",

          "If you are traveling with small children, Junibacken is totally worth a visit. It\u00b4s no disneyland, but it does give a fun introduction to Swedish children\u00b4s literature, which in itself can be fascinating. The building is divided into several thematic play area which encourage",
          "A great place to visit and I am not sure who enjoyed this more my grandkids or us. Both our grandkids love to read and this museum exhibits are geared to drive home the magic of reading. The story train was outstanding. The kids have a great place to play and have fun. There is",
          "Our first time here, I'm a big fan of Astrid Lindgrens stories. The Story train was so nice and our toddler was totally enthralled. Story like playing areas and ok food. Perfect place to let little kids play, but not much for older kids 7+. Many interesting museums close by and",
          "I was recently visiting Stockholm and, following a lovely visit to the Vasa Museum, decided to pop into Junibacken. As an art educator I am often interested in children's museums for their educational purposes. I was absolutely enchanted by this museum, which is good for kids -",

          "Excellent activity for young kids. Especially those familiar with the works of Astrid Lindgren. Teens would be bored. Parents enjoy the cafeteria.",
          "It is a very unique place. Intentionally for children - fairytales - but for adults who just want to relax and have fun too :-) Very original way of showing/ telling a fair. Very cosy place!",
          "While the place was smaller than I had expected it was packed with a lot of fun! The fairy tale \"train\" ride suprised me and was awesome! What I really like with the place is that they have made everything fairy talish, including the restaurant. Our daughter (almost 3 years)",
          "We are not kids any more but we went there as my childhood was blessed by reading Astrid Lingren tales and she is one of my favourite writers. The place is the most amazing playground for children, also their main aim is to encourage children to read. In their bookshop you can",
          "TLDR: Play and explore areas (Sagotorget and Villa Villekulla) are AMAZING if you are familiar with the stories. Story train (Sagot\u00e5get) however is scary. It's well made and you will be wowed, but at least the kids I've visited there have all been scared. We have visited",
          "We made a short visit to junibacken and for kids at the right ages this can be fun. Check them out online first to make sure you and your kids know about the different stories and characters that can be found there or you may find yourself visiting a place with no interest for",
          "The idea of Junibacken is really great! But it is not. You pay a lot of money and you pretty much get nothing. You get a ride through some of Astrid Lindgren's most known stories. And thats's it.",
          "As an adult i constantly explore places where my children will get inspired and dream. Talk what's possible. This is one of those places they enjoyed enormously, discussing passionately fairy tale characters and admiring the way everything is done. I recommend it to everyone",
          "Not cheap with around \u20ac60 for the family, gives about 3 hours of fun. Storytrain is nice and available in many languages. Pipi's villa is amazing!",
          "Even if you dont love Astrid Lindgren this place is magic! My children loved it, we went there a coppel of times every year. You just dont get tired of th elittle train going through a magic landscape , Villa villerkulla and the other playful exhibitions. Everywhere you can",
          "This indoor amusement park is centered around the universe of Swedish children's book author Astrid Lindgren, possibly the most admired Swede of the 20th century. It offers great fun for kids from 2 to 10 and their parents, with a tunnel tour, a visit of places depicted in",
          "We went there for the first time with our 2 yo boy and he loved it, there are 2 big rooms with lots of small houses, places to discover and hide. There is a restaurant inside (good choice of dishes, meatballs with potatoes pur\u00e9e, soup, salads, pastries etc). You will also find a",
          "Astrid Lindgren's characters are wonderfully represented. The train journey turns into a miracle: you fly over Emil's lawn, and turn round and \"enter\" Karlsson's house... It impresses even those who are not fond of these books. We loved the performance next to Villa Villekulla.",
          "Swedish or not, tourist or from Stockolm you must stop here for a unique experience in a place full of sensations",
          "We stopped in as we were nearby. If you don't have kids with you and or they are not little then no point in going in. If you like gluten free pancakes and gluten free meatballs then jump on the storybook train and head over to the cafe! The little train is sweet and takes you",
          "For all who like Astrid Lindgren books... and all another's too, this place might convince you to start to read them... I really enjoyed.",
          "While the train ride is a great way to get an overview of Astrid Lindgren's stories, the rest of the Junibacken is just an ordinary adventure playground. But definitely a nice day spend for kids. For adults only a nice place to be for big fans of the Lindgren stories.",
          "You will be happy to see your child happy)) Must enjoy 12 minutes trip on a small train( something for people from 3 years old to 99)). Can take something to eat with you as well as buy it at the cafe inside.",
          "We visited here with 2 children aged 12 and 7. They both enjoyed their time and would go back. The restaurant has very nice food and sweets however the lines can be quite long (although they do move relatively fast). Although very busy, finding a table was not too hard! If",
          "my girls love it, 3.5 and 1.5 they never want to come out, they have been renovating it and I think its good. They have shows upstairs and will be lovely if they could do something in english with all the tourist going there",
          "This place is quite expensive, but I do think you get your money's worth for at least one visit. I'm not sure we'll ever go back, though - the best part is the story train and the ticket only includes one ride. We ended up paying for a second, which drove up the price even more.",
          "Astrid Lindgrens world .. Her caracters are here to be expierenced for little kids. Its a sweet and cute distraction from the stress of the real world outside.",
          "Second visit to Junibacken with 4 and 9 year old kids. Both loved the place, specially the \"story train\" which we ended doing twice. I think the kids loved the place even more on the second round as they already \"knew\" the place. Some wear and tear can be seen on some places,",
          "A wonderful museum if you are 40 or 6! It's fantastic, so nice. In the museum you can see all the characters that Astrid Lindgren created. There is a beautiful mini train that makes you flight and she tells you the story of each book at the same time you are watching what she is",
          "It worth seeing! Right at the door, you dive into a wonderland where all fairy tales would be feasible - you can visit Carlson's house, fly over the Stockholm's roofs and see the dragon. It is more appropriate for childrens, but it's an awesome place for adults, who loves fairy",
          "Children loved the story train and didn't wanted to leave unless we took it another round. Visited on a cold snowy winter day and spent almost all day there..",
          "Took a grumpy three year old there and amazing the transformation as soon as he walked in. So much to do for kids and the ride is amazing! Really worth visiting with small kids and perfectly set up for non Swedish speakers.",
          "Junibacken is nice, easy to travel to but small and it gets crowded very fast. When crowded it is very hard to move around and has limited seating",
          "Junibacken is an excellent activity for families with small children. The activities are all based on Swedish children's books, and there's plenty of interactive things to do and little nooks to explore. If you speak Swedish there is also a nice range of programmes, like short",
          "for families and kids this is a fine and nice place to visit. spend a few hours here and you and your kids will have fun",
          "A surprising nice world or children's stories, Swedish ones of course. Children and adults get to step into the worlds of Pettson and Findus, Pelle, Alfons, Pippi Long Stocking and Mummin troll among many others. The rooms are relatively large enough but can get really crowded",
          "For children of every age, the lovely, slow indoor train ride through the writer Astrid Lindgren's fairytales is a must. The whole Junibacken is good fun for the tiny 'uns but the train is worth visiting for adults, too. It takes about 10 minutes but is worth every krona.",
          "Beautiful, exciting place for little people. Hours of fun and play in the surroundings we all know from wonderful Astrid Lindgren story books. A very pleasant visit for an adult as well.",
          "Easily one of the best things I could've taken a three year old to. Hours of entertainment for a small price. Stroller friendly and ok for the kids to run wild.",
          "I've been here many times but this does not get boring even to adult and my kids really love this as Sagotorget is lot of fun things to do but the real fantasy experience is the ride! It's good even if you haven't read your Astrid Lindgrens but the more you know the better it",
          "Went there as a childless couple out of curiosity as had read a few Momin books when we were young. The whole place is reconstructed as a very good play park for children themed around the works of the two Swedish authors of the Momins and Pippy Longstocking. It could",
          "Nice place to visit with kids. Not too big and couple of hours should be enough for the visit. Story train offers varies of languages.",
          "Books are reproduced in 3D dimension, activities are dashed on interaction which is a lot of fun for children. They love it! My husband brought his grandchildren here five years ago and they still remember it even though they were 5 and 2 years old, the 5 year old especially.",
          "Visited with a 2 year old boy and 5 year old girl, neither of which were familiar with the story. They loved it. 2 hours is plenty and the Vasa Museum is next door (we planned both for a day, followed by the excellent science museum). We were first in line when it opened which",
          "It was a short visit to this place, but the kids seemed to have a blast.It is also good if you are in the Vasa Museum area.",
          "We went here with my husband, though he was doubtful about visiting a children's museum:) We were utterly charmed! Went on a story train which was bewitching: the car takes you through different story plots, happy and sad, completely transforming your reality. A Must-go.",
          "We took our 1 year and 2 1/2 year old and they both loved it. So did my husband and I. We were so impressed with the play areas and the train ride. It was absolutely worth the visit!!",
          "I actually got disappointed myself, found the place crowded and limited BUT my kids had a great time, especially my daughter who knew all the characters, so it was worth the visit after all....",
          "I was heartbroken not to see Moomintroll, Moominmamma or Little My. I remember watching an Austrial-Polish animated version of the Moomins in the 80s and really thought they were magical and weird. When we were in Junibacken, there weren't any Moomin's at all. NONE!!!!",
          "this is one of my favorite places in Stockholm. I have grown up with the books of Astride Lindgren and to see a place dedicated to her books was so special for me. I felt like I was Pippi Longstocking. If you are with your child in Stockholm this is a Must see - trust me you",
          "As we have purchased the Stockholm Pass we took the chance to visit Junibacken before the Vasa. Even without having children its very nice here. But for that short journey I would not pay the original entrance when having no kids.",
          "It is so marvelous place to feel yourself like child again. The train was fantastic and the playground for children looks so charming.",
          "A visit to Junibacken was one of the highlights of a 2 week trip around Scandinavia for my two children, a 3 year old boy and 5 year old girl. It is the part of our trip they talk about the most. They loved seeing Pippi Longstocking's house, playing in Moomin land, and riding",
          "This museum is beautifully located on Djurg\u00e5rden and is perfect for younger kids. Its a bonus if they are familiar with the characters in Astrid Lindgrens books but its not a must. Inside the museum is a story train that takes you thorugh some of Astrids best stories, it can be",
          "It was pretty cool to see a children's museum inspired by Astrid Lingren. Our 5-year old son absolutely loved this museum, especially the fairytale land playset. There are three themed play areas in this museum, all were very impressive and well put together. This is not a good",
          "We took our 4 year old on a rainy summer morning and had the best time. The playrooms were very high quality, engaging and stimulating for him and all the children had fun playing and sharing. The highlight was the super well designed train ride - our son wanted to go twice. 2",
          "This was our second visit here - the last was two years ago. It was a wet day so understandably it was very busy, but well organised with hangers for wet coats and lockers for bags. The children loved visiting the Moomin rooms and the Pippi Longstocking house but the highlight",
          "We decided to go here because it's right next to the Vasa. Thought we would see something with Moomin (heard it's from local). But there were not much about this character, nor anything too interesting for adults. The train however is the most interesting part we thought. The",
          "A must visit if you read Astrid Lindgren books as a kid! But you have to be familiar with her stories such as Madicken, Emil, Lionheart Brothers, and Ronya in order to appreciate the place. I'm 27 and I went there alone and I spent a wonderful 2-3 hours there. The food was also",
          "We enjoyed a lot our trip to Stockholm, we went there with a 2 years old and a 8 months baby, and is amazing how they consider kids and family in general in that city... Junibaken was the place my daughter enjoyed the most, we spent a great day there with some many others",
          "If you and your kids know the Astrid Lindgren characters, the mumins and other nordic tales you will love it. It's great fun for kids (and for some grown-ups as well) :)",
          "This will be most enjoyable if you take children and or were brought up on Swedish children's books such as Pippy Longstocking. The \"story train\" is fun but will mean far more if you know something about the characters it visits. I was disappointed that there were very few Pippy",
          "it's a lovely museum for small children, full imersion in the world of Astrid Lindren's Fairytales, my children had great fun (6 and 8 yrs). You can have lunch inside the museum, which is not too expensive.",
          "This is clearly for the very young at heart. If you have children under, let's say 8 years old, then this is a very good place to spend a few hours where there happiness becomes your own. If you lack children under, say, 8 years old, then you really will not appreciate this",
          "The Musuem was great. The Story Train was amazing and they had put so much detail into Astrids stories sets.",
          "The focus of the attraction is the trip around various modelled scenes from the Pippi stories; rather hackneyed and visually banal. Very knowledgeable children might find limited amusement from the trip..otherwise it's just a shop and a large play area. But the cafe is good!",
          "Definitly to do with the kids. They will love it and you will enjoy it to. It is based on Skandinavien stories but doesn't matter really. Well designed and happy place to be with family.",
          "I've given it three stars, because although I had a terrible experience, it was because I misunderstood what it was. I thought it was a children's literature museum, but really it is a themed playground for children. I stopped here on impulse after going to the Nordic Museum,",
          "If you are in Stockholm with children or if you just love the works of Astrid Lindgren then this is a 'must'. It's great for children. There is so much to see and do for such a small place. It is really well done and entertaining for the younger children. Depending on the",
          "But still rate 5 because I'm such an Astrid Lindgren fan and it is just so magical. This is more geared to you get kids but there is a great train that takes you around all the stories of Astrid Lindgren and you can choose from many different languages.",
          "For little kids Junibacken is a marvelous place. The train ride is charming and brings to life Astrid Lindgren's diverse stories. There is also a creative indoor playground and you can visit Pippi Longstocking's house. The book store is wonderful. It is not a large place but it",
          "Great time with younger kids but expected a bigger museum. The younger kids had a good time and a few things to play on. Well made with tiny details. The cafe was well made and great desserts and coffee. A bit boring for older kids and you don't need more than one hour. The",
          "We revisited Junibacken with 2 of our grandkids afetr two years from our last visit, There were not many changes if any and the last part of the sagotrain is not in coherence with the age group for which this attraction is ideal (2-8 to 9). The story of the brothers Lionheart is",
          "If you have children above the age of 3 years this is THE museum for them to spend some wonderful hours.",
          "We arrived there in mid afternoon and almost decided not to get in due to seemingly high entrance fees. We were glad we didn't. The whole place was amazing and had provided great entertainments for our 4 yr old daughter (and me and my husband, especially for the story train",
          "If you don't book online tickets, then go there as early as possible, because around midday, the queue could be pretty long... I don't think that 65 euros for a family ticket is pretty fair, but... Once you enter, you will find 2 rooms with places/persons/animals from the book,",
          "Nice place to go to spend some of kids energy. It's all about the Astrid Lindgrens fairytales so it'd even nicer if you know those stories. The storytrain was cool also, maeby a bit scary for the smallest kids. My 3 and 7 yo kids were holding my arm pretty tightly there. Wanted",
          "We came here with our two young sons, and it was very packed in summer, but lovely and rather perfect in winter! Definitely recommended for families with younger children!",
          "Do you believe in time travel? Even though you are not a sentimental person and don't believe in being brought back to the years of your childhood, it is worth visiting the Unibaken Museum in Stockholm, which is one of the main sights to see not only for the residents of the",
          "This is a great fun filled place I have been going to since I was young :) brilliant atmosphere and loads to do for kids and adults",

          "Very thoughtfully made, went on a quieter day and time (around 1pm) and was pleasantly surprised with the level of detail and facilities available for both parents and kids. The train ride is very well designed given the limited space it uses and its target audience (kids). The",
          "I went there with my 7 & 9 year old kids. We were there for 5 hours and it was a looong hours for me, but excellent for my kids. Children loved it. But SO many people, maybe even too many. Children screaming everywhere. BUT the train was amazing!!! You just have to wait 2 hours",
          "We two (5 and 8) boys that had a great time, our kids had never heard of the author that is behind this place, but still enjoyed. Cafe has good quality and healthy food. Unique place with plenty to capture even an adults eye.",

          "Back by popular demand for the 4th time, this is place just keeps on giving! We were visiting Stockholm for 5 days so I asked my son were he would like to go, He's 12 but I was secretly pleased when he requested Junibacken. He still loves all the things there, the shows, the",
          "Nice to visit Junibacken. Downside - too long queues even early morning around opening time. If your kids don't love all of Lindgren's stories, don't bother. This is for very young children. Food was AWFUL!! Fish dish was so dry!!! They served it without sauce. Instead it",
          "It's a museum for small kids, there is a puppet show as well but which unfortunately for us was in Swedish and not English so my son could not understand at all, otherwise it's a nice informative place for kids,there is a story telling session in which you sit on a slide and it",
          "Great backgrounds for play especially for kids from 2 to 8 years. Older will also enjoy but the visit may be shorter. Lot of details, well done.",
          "The rooms are set up for kids, so great if you have young children. The train is not to be missed by adults who love to read. Great restaurant with quick service and lunch specials.",
          "Lined up for buying tickets to get in but have to wait 2hrs to see main inside. So packed with small infant and children. Recommend for age 3-8. My two boys are 7/9yrs. I think for 9yrs is little too young for that. To take story telling train is great even though we don't know",
          "This place is a heaven for anyone who - like my son - loves Pippi and other Lindgren's characters. We had a difficult time convincing him to leave after a couple of hours. I loved the train ride through Lindgren's various stories (admitedly, that was more apropriate for older",

          "Here you will find the Story Train and Astrid Lindgren's wonderful stories.Even Moomin family has moved in.Lots of fun o mischief that might best suit children up to 8 years. The noise level is high among all children",
          "We visited Junibacken for the first time. It was worth to visit! Many things to see. The Story Train was awesome! All the family loved it. I would recommend Junibacken for the families with children between 2-5 years.",
          "We went there, as for my younger daughter wish, but we all liked it even my mom (she is 78). We all had fun, and liked it so much, that decided to stay for lunch in their caffe, what was quite budget much to a my surprise.",
          "A wonderful indoor playground based on Swedish / Nordic children's books. A fairy tale ride based on Astrid Lindgren's books is included in the ticket, mesmerizing and a little scary at some point if you are 5, so holding hands is recommended. This ride can be given in other",
          "This was one of the highlights of Stockholm! I enjoyed it even though beeing 36 years old at the time, and no, i don't have kids :)",
          "Our kids are a little older, but we wanted to see the Moomin (Mumin) exhibit. The Storybook Train was a very pleasant surprise and all the exhibits were soooooo charming!! Suggest going right at the opening because it does fill up but we were really glad to see it. Seriously",
          "We had a blast at Junibacken. We visited with three kids, 11, 9 and 7 and they all had fun. The story train was lovely. I strongly recommend Junibacken for familys with kids.",
          "This place is fun for kids who know at least some Swedish kids' classics. Indoor playground kind of thing. Fun details, nooks to play in.",
          "For this mass of people and one small room not acceptable. It was a rainy day but it looks like there is no entrance stop.",
          "It's a great place if you have children to entertain... And of course if you still are a child your self \ud83d\ude0a Went there while a friend was visiting Stockholm... For all fairytale fans this place is a must. Entrance price is quite expensive though.. and not included in the SL",

          "Anyone who grew up reading the books of Astrid Lindgren would absolutely adore this place! It was very imaginatively created with so much attention to every detail, it was like a getting inside the books and walking around. The restaurant is decent, toilets clean and a they",
          "The place basically offers a lousy story train ride for its hefty admission price. For the same price you can see the Vasa, a vastly superior exhibit. Total waste of money even if you have kids, IMHO.",
          "Great for kids to run about. The story train was a little scary for my 2yo. The story also touched on death and suicide, which might not be appropriate for very young children. Besides the train, everything else was a big playland.",
          "Bad weather, fractious chidren ? Then Junibacken is a \u201cmust\u201d :-) Even in sunny weather. The problem ? Your children don\u00b4t wanna leave this place. There is So Much to do and see, and also many theatrical performents during a day. The place is called the \u201chouse of fantasy play\u201d",
          "This is an Amazing place for kids between 2 to 12. To organize a museum with the world of Astrid Lindgren in focus is a smart Idea. Do not miss the train guiding you through this magical world! Regularly specific exhibit around one of Astrid's caractere. This is a magic place",
          "We have visited Junibacken with a group of 10 adults. Even though Junibacken is set up for children, for us it was great to see the Swedish countryside in miniature. Everything is built with an eye for detail. It was certainly worthwhile, however I can imagine that during times",
          "Naturally Stockholm has a lot to offer for families, but in my opinion this is a place you should definately visit. The whole place is a wonderland for children and in a different way that most of the new indoor \"playgounds\". Different sections of Junibacken invite the children",
          "If you've ever read Astrid Lindgren's books, this is a good place for you. Or if you have kids. And then you defenately should read those books. This is a house right next to the Wasa museum and it's a great place on a rainy day.",

          "This was the highlight of our daughter's visit to Sweden. Super fun activities in multiple rooms inspired by famous Swedish storybooks. We were not Pippy Longstocking fans prior to this visit, but we are now! Our daughter (6 years old) had a blast. Worth every kroner!",
          "This small world brings you back to your childhood. It is great for kids, because they can try everything what they want. The highlight is definitely the story train. This is available in different languages. You can plunge into the stories of Astrid Lindgren. I was just a bit",

          "Junibacken is an amazing place for families to visit - especially for children of course. I went there the first at the age of 6 and it is still one of my favourite places in Stockholm (at the age of 20) :,) Of course having read the stories by Astrid Lindgren as a child makes",

          "I am crazy Moomin fan so we had to visit during our time in Stockholm. We had Stovkholm Passes so our visit was free otherwise I would have been challenged by the prices charged. As it was we went in as a family with a 16yr and 12yr old. The story train was the stand out moment",
          "Loved the story train - it was impressive for adults as well as children. It was great that there was a good choice of languages on the train ride, so our child could understand the story. The train ride was a bit scary at times, but our 3-year old didn't mind that. It would",

          "Junibacken or the world of Astrid Lindren is a nice place especially for toddlers and children up to 9-10 years old. A world full of fantasy, with children-sized 'doll houses' where they can basically open and play with all the drawers, stoves and furniture. The entry train",
          "Worth of visiting at least once. + There is a lots of things to do over here, our kids loved it! + Also train which guides you through the Swedish stories, actually it was a bit scary :D - It's pretty expensive, since it costs for everyone over 2+ years. - Restaurants are ok,",
          "My husband and I went there thinking it\u00b4s just for children. Yes we are childish. But this was also something for adults that have read Astrid Lindgren as children. Small adventures, like riding a small train and see some built up scenes from her books.",
          "I went with my young nieces and other family members, but still remember my 3rd grade teacher reading Pippi Longstocking so feel a sentimental attachment to this place. This was my second visit. The train ride was actually a bit scary, which I didn't notice the first time",
          "We have stocked up on Scandinavian children's literature before planning the trip to the region. And we fell in love with all Astrid Lindgren's books especially Moomins and Pippi Longstocking! Our 9-year old totally enjoyed the experience more than she did Disneyland! And our",

          "Went here a cold Friday in January after strong recommendation from a neighbor that comes from Stockholm. We were told a couple of hours here would be fun for the kids, however, we ended up staying there for 4 hours (grown up was done, not the kids). For our twins, being 3,5",
          "We went here on a cruise excursion stop. We picked it because my son was with us and he really enjoyed his time here though it was extremely limited. He didn't want to leave but we had to. It was extremely crowded on a sunny day in July unfortunately but if we return to",

          "This attraction is really nice for kids, but a bit pricy I think. The one ride that place offers is supervise and reminiscent of the HC andersen ride on Tivoli in Copenhagen. But you can only go once then you have to pay agin. All in all a good way to kill 2 hours and it is",
          "Kids just love this museum with its model villages and other attractions just perfect for little ones. There are a couple of down sides. Firstly it's a little pricey and secondly the show was in Swedish which we don't speak. I don't know if it was also offered in English. If",

          "Smaller than i thought. The day we visited was really crowded. Too expensive for what it offers. Storytrain is the best on offer, but you can only visit it once. Mumin exhibit is nice. If you haven't read Astrid Lindgren's fairytales for your kids, dont go.",

          "We are visits junibacken 4th time and I have to admit that this is the best place for children in Stockholm. Well organized & really interesting not only for small kids, but for teens as well. Good inspiration for parents how to play with kids. Highly recommended even on 1 day",
          "Spent an incredible few hrs here after a day of sightseeing around Stockholm. Travelled as single parent with 2 children under 9 and one teen. We went towards the end of the day and it was the most expensive thing we did in Stockholm, especially for the very short hrs we were",

          "There is lot to do with kids. The train is great experience alltough it can be even little scary to younger ones as it is so dark and the athmospere is kind of mystic with the storytelling. Stories are told in your own language. It helps if you know stories of Astrid Lindgren in",
          "It you are with a pre-school child - she will be amased by surroundings and opportunities. If you are with a school-age child or with teenager - he or she certainly will be disappointed. Don't go in this case. And the price is really too high to experiment with this attraction :)",

          "This is such a great place for kids 2-7 years old. You can easily spend 3-4 hours here without the kids getting bored. Dont miss the Pippi Longstocking theatrhe with real actors. Or the story train. If you can - try to avoid weekends when the place gets extremely full.",
          "A very wholesome activity. Lovely moving stories and great fun for the children. I love the caf\u00e9 and the shop, it is, however to go there without shopping. Definetly going there again next time we're in Stockholm.",

          "Its a success in Stockholm. We were there with our grandchildren, 3 and 4 years old. They made big eyes when entering. We just looked and was really impressed. Not because of the place but because of the perfekt planned place to make as much money as possible from the visitors.",
          "What a little gem! The children loved it as lots of interactive areas and the little train with the stories was very engaging. Not to miss specially if you are a fan of Pipi Longstocking. If you are not then it is a great chance to know this charming character.",
          "This is showing all the fictional characters of writer Astrid Lindgren. For small children it's great (if they know the stories). However, there was no sign of Pipi Langkous (apart from her house and wooden horse). Very disappointing as most people go to see something of Pipi.",
          "Junibacken is a lovely attraction featuring featuring the fairytale worlds created by Astrid Lindgren. The train ride \"Sagot\u00e5get\" (included in the ticket) is really fantastic! Combine it with a ferry trip from Nybrokajen (during summer) or Slussen (all year round) and this will",

          "My wife was a fan of these books growing up and my 5 year old just loved all the interactive displays and activities. For me it was pretty much my idea of hell. Don't get me wrong heaps of people there enjoying themselves and I love seeing my daughter having a good time but it",
          "This is a great place for all Astrid Lindgren fans to visit, kids as adults. When wandering thru the different rooms one recognizes all different characters and situations from the books. There is a kind of ride to take where one \"flies/moves\" into Astrid's different world's",
          "Went there with my 4 year old. She doesn't know all the Swedish characters and authors but some. She seemed to enjoy it but way too many people and hard to get around and every one virtually standing on top of each other. Theatre shows all in Swedish which makes it hard to enjoy",
          "Wonderful melding of play, imagination and story-telling. Excellent play area highlighting the works of several Swedish authors, plus Villa Villekulla - the house of Astrid Lindgren's most famous character, Pippi Longstocking - but the best of all is the story train. A ride",

          "The train ride is the main attraction and we had about a 2 hour wait before our time to board the train. It was a busy rainy day which made it difficult for our 2 kids to really enjoy all the play areas. I'd highly recommend it during off peak times. If you don't like crowds",
          "its nicely set up and great for kids. but the price is not quite worth it. after all it is kind of like a play ground with different themes. I don't see any reason for them to charge entry for adults.",

          "Arrived in tuesday morning in July. We went straight to Junibacken and there was 40m long queue. After paying over 50\u20ac we were told that a story train for us is available in 2,5 hours. So we went inside and there were about 1000 others divided in three rooms and one souvenir",
          "We visited with 2 kids, ages 5 and 9. It's more suitable for the younger kids, the older ones will not have so much to do at the play area. The carts tour was nice, although we didn't know all the stories...",
          "Junibacken is great for the children. Fantastic playgrounds thematically build and inspired by the books of Astrid Lindgren and other Nordic writers. They have several theatrical shows during the day which the kids love. The negative part is that it's madly expensive and there",
          "Junibacken is really fun for smaller children. It's a big pricey so be prepared. The lift ride is really good and I highly recommend it. The only negative thing I can think of(besides the price), is that when you get to pippies house they could have someone dressed up as Pippi",
          "Wonderful place for children and it is beautifully done. Bring your wallet though, the prices are ridiculous especially for a destination targeting kids. They also don't seem to have a limit to the number of people allowed in at the same time, bathrooms and restaurant is an",
          "Great location to visit with kids around 5-10 years old. Some activities inside (great if the weather is not that great) and the ride to explore the worlds behind the stories was nice too.",
          "It is one of the places in Stockholm that you need to visit if you are there with kids, they will have fun. You can spend there a few hours, there is a restaurant and lots of things to keep kids entertained.",
          "Interesting museum for children but also for olders. You can see scandinawian Trolls, Mummins, Pippi Langstrumpf and many other there.You can see little houses from fairy tailes. Children kan go inside this houses and play inside.They can \"cook\", \"sell wegetables\", \"buildings",
          "a real family experience! an exciting train ride and room to play for children as well as a nice view and location",
          "Unfortunately this is definitely a must-see if you have small children. It's fantastically done and the story train is just amazing. But grit your teeth and try not to pass out when you cough up the eye-wateringly expensive entry fee. Over priced when you think that non-English",
          "Best part is that the kids just loved Everything! Be prepared to wait- there was a large que Before getting in. Enjoy the trainride- you only get one chance.",
          "It's one of those places you have to visit if you grew up with Astrid Lindgren. The story ride (Sagotoget) is really cute and surprisingly good. The play space and area otherwise is a little crammed and completely crowded, even on a weekday.",
          "Very crowded, and long wait just to get inside. Small place so incredibly crowded inside as well. Avoid the weekends when it seem half of Stockholm is here ..... with prams. The kids loved Villa Villekula. The other aspects .... again we went at a time when it was very crowded",
          "Wonderful themed play areas. Alice in Wonderland sort of thing. Check the train isn't sold out. We got there and it was. Still had a good time.",
          "I really liked taking my kids here. It was really fun. There is a variety of things to do and a great restaurant with a tasty menu. The story book train is a a must for all kids. Will go again.",
          "If you have got young kids then Junibacken is a must while in Stockholm. Even if you are not Swedish and do not know the fairytale characters from the books of Astrid Lindgren and the likes, your children will still have endless fun in the play rooms and on the very well done",
          "Junibacken is dedicated to the author Astrid Lindgren. There are lots of houses and other buildings where children can play. The \"train trip\" through Lindgrens fantasy world is specially nice. A bit expensive, but recommend it!",
          "This is part of the world of Pippi L\u00e5ngstrump (Pippi Longlegging) and the author Astrad Lindgren. The Pippi House and theater, good rastaurant and a very nice minitrain that takes you through the world of the different books written by Astraid Lindgren. A very, very nice ride,",
          "Discover the fantasy World of Astrid Lindgren; Pippi Longstocking and her friends. It's a Place where the kids can play, watch a play or take a ride on the fantasy train - a journey through the books of Astrid. It's very Swedish and very nice, also for the grown ups. Food is ok",
          "Its a small museum, or I'd rather say, a playground under the roof suitable for children under 12. There wasn't much for me to do except the train that was fun, but a short ride and half-based on stories I haven't read. The kids houses and activities seemed fun for them with",
          "Karlson-on-the-roof was my favorite book so I was very excited and my kids too.The museum is pretty small but you can't skip it - it is lovely and fun experience. Note the prices in the restaurant are low so there is a good place for family launch.",
          "Visited Junibacken after being tempted by the Moomin exhibition and the rain encouraging us to \"go indoors\" Went with my boyfriend, neither of us have children to accompany us (first mistake) but I quite like Moomins and was interested in Astrid Lingren too. I like children",
          "Very good attraction for kids to experience Astrid Lindgren's stories. The \"Sagotorget\" (story train) is a must. My 1.5 yr old didn't understand much but he looked like he was having a good time! There is also a restaurant/cafe on the premises. Junibacken parking area was",
          "Junibacken is an excellent tribute to Astrid Lindgren and all her wonderful characters. Its's a very interactive museum, and enjoyable for children and grownups alike. Mind you, it's very expensive though, so it may not be for everybody which lower the rate a little.",
          "We didn't even know all the characters (except Pippy Longstocking) but it was still a magical place, the kind of place where you kind of wish you were a kid too! All kind of little kid sized nooks and crankies to explore.........too small for you to follow them into, but don't",
          "Based on the stories of Astrid Lindgren\u2019s this is a very cute \u201cmuseum\u201d for children under 5 years of age. It is very nicely done and there are lots of activities for little people to do. Children will enjoy the experience even if they do not know the stories by Lindgren. We",
          "It had to be a children theater based on stories of Astrid Lindgren, but turned out to be a place to make whatever to entertain kids. Woudnt recommend it unless you have children under 5.",
          "We had the Stockholm card and on the map we got with it was it included but when we entered junibacken they told us we had to pay because it was included in 2014 and not in 2015. We payed 270 SEK and that was a reduced price because there was an attraction that was not going at",
          "We bought the yearly pass while it was on offer for one adult and our 1.5 year old. It was good fun for our son and they change the theme and attractions in the main room once or twice a year. Children will love it even if they are not familiar with all the stories. The theatre",
          "The children loved the Place and so did I. The whole Astrid Lindgren world was presented in the same Place. It is guite expensive to visit the Place with a few children. And I did not like the big shop which you have to pass when going from one Place to another. Difficult for",

          "As with everything in Stockholm, in pretty much all of Scandinavia, North Americans will likely have a shock when come time to pay for pretty much anyting. For what it is, Junibacken isn't cheap but considering that this is part of the Stockholm Card, this is probably one of",
          "Excellent indoor playground for kids until 10 years old, although my 12 year old didn't complain for four or five hours. They provide a few short theater shows every day( in swedish only), a decent cafeteria-like restaurant with free Wi-Fi and a souveneir/book store. The fairy",

          "A great place for kids 2-7. Near the Vasa museum. The story train is lovely (in most languages), taking you on a journey through Astrid Lindgren's stories. Miniature worlds have been constructed in which children can play and explore.",
          "We reached and were told there is a two hour wait for the train ride but there are lots of stuff for the kids to do in the meanwhile. The 'lots of stuff' was a play area... Well the kids did seem to like the play area but that's what it was.. just a play area.. For 2 hours the",
          "Don't expect rides or anything, the sets are made for children to play using their imagination. The sets are made according to the most famous Swedish (some foreign) children's books. It's a great place to take small children for a couple of hours. The restaurant is well priced",
          "This place is very good for children. Not very much to do there for parents. The best thing in Junibacken is the \"Storytrain\"",
          "It is only something for families with small children. There is nothing for adults to do while the kids are playing.",
          "The train journey inside was very well thought out and the models were really effective, a must do if you have little ones in Stockholm.",
          "I just loved Junibacken! Fairytale Train rides you and your kids to Astrid Lindgrens stories, which I knew from my own childhood. The place is very well executed and suites for small children. I suppose that about 3-5 year olds are the target group. There are also places to",
          "I've been to Junibacken with my girls twice. The other time it wasn't quite as much fun, as the place was really crowded for some reason (the kids didn't mind it, but I found it to be quite a task to keep track of three kids, the youngest being only two years old, with so many",
          "You won\u00b4t believe how one can transfer a single building into many small stages and connect them via little train/lift that elevates and turns through the stages while a lovely but sad story is played from the speakers. Your little one will enjoy a great indoor playground at the",
          "We did not have the kids museum included in the program, but it was one of the most funniest and lovly museum in Stockholm. Get ready for lot of kids and their parents waiting and shooting them with each model of the fairy character or the miniature fairy houses and vehicles. I",
          "I loved the story train. The setting is beautiful and the story as well. The ticket is expensive though. Would recommend for everyone who loves Astrid Lindgren and children books :D",
          "I only give this attraction an average feedback as I traveled with my daughter who is 10, a bit too old for this place. But, we did go for a train ride inside the museum that showed different showcases from Astrid Lindgren`s magical world of literature, and it was very good.",
          "We went inside just to be curious, but there are really nice petite buildings and story train which was one of the best experience in Stockholm, I feel like a child again! :) If you have a Stockholm card, really recommend to go there for a while!",
          "We are from Thailand, and knew nothing about Pippi or Swedish local stories, but me and my 7 year-old had a memorable fun time there, especially the train ride where you learn about the stories through the beautiful settings and the audio which you could choose the language. I",
          "I think this venue would make much more sense to local kids who have grown up with the stories and characters that are profiled here. I thought the venue was a bit tired and there wasn't really much to play with. My 3-year old got bored pretty quickly. They have a story train",
          "As a kid growing up in America in the 70's/80's, Pippi Longstocking was a huge deal. I was thrilled when I heard about the Junibacken and made it the #1 thing that I wanted to see in Stockholm. Luckily, I have two small step-children ( 5 & 7) happy to help out. Admittedly, the",
          "This is our 3rd visit and it remains one of my all time favourite places for old and young alike. if you don't know the works of Astrid Lindgren don't be put off, you will learn loads here. The play areas are just exceptional and the ride through the stories of Astrid Lindgren",
          "Kids get crazy in that amazing place! It's also very nice and relaxing for adults too. Make sure you take the train ride that narrates the fairytale. It's very dreamy :)",

          "My husband and I felt a little weird going without a kid, but after I saw pictures I really wanted to go. I'm glad we did. There's a \"train ride,\" which is pretty fantastic. There are a bunch of play areas that tie into the story told during the train ride. I'm sure the kids",

          "This place is for children but we had fun. It is very well made, fairytale decorations a paradise for little children. The train tour is really nice, even for adults.",
          "One of the most wonderful children's museums that I have ever been to, anywhere! Such a beautiful and fun place. I loved it!!!",
          "A truly must-visit for everybody who knows and loves a fairy-taily dreamy world of Astrid Lindgren - You ll travel back to Your childhood! Nevertheless Unibakken has a good canteen and a souvenir shop with plenty of toys and nice items.",
          "You will get most out of this place if you are familiar with Astrid Lindgren children stories and other Swedish children books. So for me, born in Sweden, it is a great nostalgic trip. For my kids, born and raised outside Sweden however, they might not get all the references.",
          "Great place for kids over three , unfortunately you can only enter once with the Stockholm card and it is fairly expensive",
          "We went here to relive a bit of childhood---and the place is fairly impressive! There's a big area for kids to play in, and the storybook train is fun, even as an adult, as it plays out as much as a kids roller coaster as it does a story. This is definitely more worthwhile for",
          "When travelling with children Junibacken is MUST to visit. We have been in Junibacken 4-5 times, and every time we find something new, interesting or fun. It suitable from few years old children to teenagers. There almost all the time standing lines @ entrance, but when you",
          "The kids were very excited about going to 'see' Pippi Longstocking. Unfortunately the summer holidays meant enormous crowds, a wait of over an hour and a half for the key part of the visit - the Story Train. In the meantime, while you wait, you're herded into a play area",
          "Easily accesible by tram or bus (check my skansen opinion for details) a 5 min walk away from the bus and tram stop (first one once you cross the bridge towards Djurg\u00e5rden. It is the museum of Pipi Longstockings author, the remarkable Astrid Lindgren. She wrote many more books",
          "I went to toss place with my niece not having much of an idea what to expect. But I think this is a perfect perfect place for your kids to visit. Not very big but the highlight the fairytale train that tells a magical story about Astrid Lindgrens books. It was very good even for",
          "If so this is The place to go. Sometimes when traveling with kids it's hard to find a place for them to have place. Here you'll find it. The target it's between 4 and 8 and even for a non-swedish kid he will love it without ever heard about that stories",
          "Ok, so if you have children this is non negotiable must see in Stockholm. But also, we went there without kids and felt like kids! Go back in time: before we got so hi-tech! Relive all your childhood stories that is so true to Sweden. Take a trip on the train: wow wow wow!",
          "The kids loved it (as they did the rest of Stockholm). We bought and enjoyed some of Lindgren's books before visiting which added to their understanding and just let them run riot for a few hours. We all enjoyed the story train too. The food and dinning hall are outstanding, as",
          "We've been to Junibacken a few times and each time we go they change things up enough so that it's a new adventure. They keep some of the kids' favorite things the same - the human hamster wheel! The pretend korv stand! Pippi's big horse! - yet the new city scene they created",
          "This place is amazing for kids (and adults). It is one of the few places which is still cute and authentically Swedish. If you love Astrid Lindgren or a nice experience for your kids, come here.",
          "Not very big place - train ride was the best part. I won't be returning - very disappointing. Could have used the entrance fee more productively. No entertainment - Children running wild - and this was mid week. Bring your own lock to lock the pushchair as they are left outside.",
          "Junibacken is an amazing place for the kids, its like taken straight of the traditional swedish story books. Any child aged 2-10 would really enjoy this place. The lunch restaurant has everything that is needed. Can be crowded at peak times.",

          "Here you will be able to live inside the books of Astrid Lindgren, like Pippi Longstocking, Emil in L\u00f6nneberga, Karlsson on the roof, etc. All children must love this kind of museum, where the whole house is made up in childrens size.",
          "The place is tailored for kids, I'd say 3 - 6 years old. It's quite crowded and the best thing there is a historical train, which is rather a gondola flying through different fairy tales scenes. You need to queue for it for a while. One star of for lack of sound during our trip.",
          "This is something great to do with kids. There are displays of Astrid Lindgren's fairy tales. The best part is the story train where you sit in cabin that moves through some beautiful story scenes. Kids can play around on slides etc.",
          "If visiting Stockholm with kids this is a definite \"must visit\" attraction. It's an indoor \"playground\" that looks like the illustrations of a children's book. Amazing bookstore. We were there 4 times in 6 months, but didn't watch any of the plays, since we don't understand",

          "Even if the Junibacken is destined to children I went to visit Junibacken due to my passion about fairy tales. The location is easy to find, just behind the Vasa museum. The entrance fee is affordable so is the food ar the restaurant. The souvenirs are really expensive so are",
          "Smaller than I thought it would be and quite expensive for what you get. My 3 year old loved it, but I think it would be even better for kids who are old enough to know all the Swedish storybook characters. The storybook train can be a bit scary for the small ones, but is the",
          "This is a great place for the small childrens. I belive 3 to 5 is the prime age at this place. My daughter is 5 and this is probably one of the last years this was interesting for her. Fun ride the fairytaletrain and see all of Astrid Lindgrens characters. You better be early if",
          "This was the highlight of our daughter's visit. She is eight, and she loved the Pippi Longstocking exhibit, with lots of little houses to play in and a little train ride that was very creatively done. Highly recommend.",

          "Museum created in cooperation with Astrid Lindgren, mother of Pippi Longstocking and so many other fairy tale favorites. Theatre and sing-a-long for the kids, book and souvenir store etc. Don't miss the train ride and plan on eating or snacking. The circus themed caf\u00e9 serves",
          "Big queue at 11 am so much so I did not get to do the train ride or other activities. But the first room was wonderful - I went from there to the gift store and for me that was very worthwhile. Only wished I had all of my 4 grand kids with me and I know we would have been there",
          "This is a really nice place to bring your kids too. My son is 11 and for sure I was nervous that he didn't liked it. But when we drive around in the \"train\" he saw all the stories from the books that Astrid L have made he also liked it. For sure the best age is around 7 +- 2",

          "We had great time with our kids (5, 7 and 8 years old). It's probably more interesting for Swedish children who know Swedish litterature for children better... But if you know Pippi or the Moomins you will certainly enjoy visiting their houses or sitting on Pippi's horse. There",

          "Best place for kids 3-6",
          "Allways great for a day with kids! No language barrier - all kids love it, regardless of their native tongue. We spend at least 5 hours each time we visit.",
          "Excellent day out with the kids, highly recommend this.  The play area is amazing and the train is good too albeit a little dark for a 2 year old.  Pippylongstockings play as you leave the train was excellent.  The food is reasonably priced for Sweden but it is expensive to get in.",
          "From 2 to 14 - must have! For older people - recommendet.",
          "I loved this place, especially the train ride. Children and also adults will love it. It is a great place and is made for kids. If you visit Sweden this is a go to place, you should definitely visit it.",
          "Specifically for children 2-8 years old, and a bit light-on for children older than that. That said, the \u2018train ride\u2019 is a delight for all ages, and helped make the visit to Junibacken uniquely memorable.",
          "I love Junibacken. My favourite part is the story train.. \nThis time the place was kinda crowded with adults running around with their mobiles and not always watching their steps. \"Carefull people! Don't forget that this is a place for \u2026",

          "One of the most interesting places for kids",
          "This is a playful and imaginative museum for younger kids - my toddler played all day! Staff are wonderful and get right on the same level as the children. The story time train could be a little scary for some kids (they warn you about this), but a really fun treat for most kids (and their grown-ups!)!",
          "Pretty cool!",
          "A few hours easily passed by here. Entrance fee was a little high, but all in all worth it to be able to have lunch with a stunning view of the water.",
          "Pippi \"lives\" here. A must for kids all ages (and adults)",
          "My two sons absolutley loved it here & always want to return. A must if visiting Stockholm with children.",
          "My 5 year old enjoyed it thoroughly and didn't want to leave. Full of nooks and crannies due kids to explore. Loved the story train and mirror illusion set. Lots of people on weekends.",

          "Kids loved this place.",
          "Cool experience for kids. Was relatively crowded and busy when we where there. Don't miss the story train. Ask the reception staff for timings of attractions.",

          "My children loved it!",
          "amazing the best",
          "Good place for kids, story train was short but quite intuitive for kids. They have quite a good way to keep your kids engaged for several hours. Regarding food, they have limited varieties of menu but can fill in kids with lot of desserts and Ice cream",
          "Nice place if u know all the children's stories from Sweden.. There's a train that's take u among the stores and it's wonderful",

          "This place is a magical spell that revives the child inside each of us so often ignores.",
          "A great museum for kids. A lot of things to do and see. If you're kids familiar with Astrid Lindgrens stories you are in the right place to be. The restaurant here is kids friendly and quiet decent price. If you haven't been here I \u2026",
          "Very good overall experience probably aimed at 2 - 7 year-olds. Great caf\u00e9 on the sea (or lake, still  not figured out which) side, with fantastic views. But come on, 53 euro entrance for 2 parents and a 3-year-old?",
          "If you go with kids make sure they are at least 2 to have most fun and prepared to spend 2hours +. It's like story books in real world",

          "Must visit place for your children who live or visit Stockholm",
          "Good for small kids under 6 or so. Our 8 and 6 year old were a bit bored. They enjoyed it few years ago.",
          "To pricey considering that there is not that much to do. Half the entrance price would have been worth it. The food at the cafe is not something I would recommend, unless you want sweets or pastries",
          "A story world of our favourite children's author.",
          "A great story train for children and adults :)",
          "Most kids there were 8 or below although my 9 and 10 years old still enjoy it. Upon entering, you'll get onboard a story train with several languages available for selection. Then there's a short musical performance by a few kids in \u2026",
          "Very good place for kids to play and enjoy some theater.",
          "With Kids better than without",
          "Wonderful. Pippi Longstocking in live action performed by talented child actors. A fantasy train taking you through magic fables sceneries. Unmissable if you have children",
          "Lovely place. The storytrain was amazing!! Maybe not for teenagers but for the younger ones( under 10) lots to see and explore. The show was also great even though i didn't understand anything (swedish language) \ud83d\ude00",
          "Very nice and fun place",
          "A must see if you have kids around age 3-7. They really understand kids there with the most incredible and interesting play areas.",
          "Amazing place good for all family.",
          "Very creative",
          "Nice museum for children. The entrance fare is a bit expensive for my taste",
          "Nice but overpriced",
          "Lovely place but too many people inside so kids also couldn't play and discover things properly.",
          "It has turned into a place for smaller kids. Before it was more for like 4-10 year olds.  Still it is fantastic  with the stories and the train ride. Nice outdoor garden to play in. Wish though that they would have more for the 7-10 year olds.",
          "Fantastic little adventure house & park for children, based on Astrid Lidgren's stories. Perfect attention to detail, can be crowded (especially when the weather is bad).",
          "Its very cool place with childrens any year old",
          "Wonderful place for kids excellent food as well",
          "A must see place for children of all ages. Especially the fairytale train was awesome experience, and there are several languages in which the story is told during the train ride. I spent with my six-year-old more time there than we both expected before hand.",
          "Kids love it!",
          "Loved it but not sure about the ending to the story. Seemed a bit morbid.",
          "My daughter favourite museum. Fantastic place for kids up to around 6 years old. Good restaurant and temporary events",
          "One of a best museums for kids I\u2019ve ever visited! Trully amazing!",
          "Absolutely amasing train going through Astrid fairytales. Worth visiting with kids and without them :)",
          "Junibaken definitely worth its cost. There're a few playgrounds, the story train and even a theater performance about Pippi Longstocking and her friends, which we didn't even expect to see there. All the actors are children and they play on a very high level.",
          "Excellent for boosting children imagination. Small, expensive from my perspective, but worth it. Children could easily spend whole day role playing. Haven't tried the train unfortunately.",
          "Good place to take the kids. Does get ridiculously busy, so good to get there at opening. My 3 year old thought the story train was a little scary (lots of dark areas), but seemed to handle it ok. ",
          "It was fascinating experience, despite the fact that I'm 14",
          "Wonderful for young children",
          "The Story Train ride was just wow! Disney could not have done it better (it feels a bit like the Peter Pan ride in Paris). Luckily we\u2018ve been to Junibacken on a Thursday and it wasn\u2019t crowded at all. At the ticket desk they even told us \u2026",
          "Great playing for the kids but not a getaway from the heat this summer. Don't expect it to be cold.",
          "Magical children experience. No strollers allowed inside but there is a parking outside for strollers.",
          "An excellent place for families.",
          "I went with my six year old son (who speaks only English). It was a sunny day in late May and it was fairly busy but this didn't bother him and he loved it, I reckon he is approaching the top end of the age range however. The story train \u2026",
          "Fantastic! The kids spent four hours exploring, playing, re-exploring, and having a great time. Everyone enjoyed the train ride through the book experiences. Highly recommend.",

          "Great place for kids. Good for kids who havent read the Lingrens books too.",

          "Good for very young kids",
          "Great fun for kids. Loved the story train. One star taken off for the price. \u20ac18 for an adult is too expensive.",
          "Extremely charming and nice. Perfect for all kids between 2-10.",
          "Beautiful place for kids to play and experience the world of Astrid Lindgren. Also features a ride for the whole family. Spend a couple of hours here and end with a coffee and a visit in the toy/souvenir shop!",

          "Fantastic place. A dream for both adults and children.",
          "Good for less than 7 years old children",
          "Awesome spot for kids 2-10",
          "Very nice place!",
          "Very nice place. Not huge, but lots for younger kids to explore. Food in the cafeteria was excellent.",
          "For small kids it is a really fun 2hrs, for adults it's a lesson in paying lots of money. The price of entrance was already steep considering the size of the place. Today there were so many visitors that not everyone got room in the theatre \u2026",
          "Beautiful place especially for younger children! The railway that takes you through the storys of Astrid Lindgren is also a very nice experience for adults. All in all a worthy experience in Stockholm:)",
          "Perfect place for kids. Hard to get them off this place. We, even adults, were really impressed about story train. Also nice, not expensive cafeterria is inside the venue. Must go with kid, definitely! With knowledge of fairytales even better, but thats not a compulsory.",
          "Very nice place for children and for adults too!!!)) Story Train costs 179 sek for adult and has different prices for different numbers of children with parents. \n\ud83d\udea9 MUST TRY: \u00abK\u00f6ttbullar\u00bb (\"Meatballs\") at the restaurant inside. One portion \u2026",

          "If you are traveling with children this is the best option to share time with them",
          "Great place",
          "Absolutely great idea. That is the last master piece of one of the greatest writer of Sweden A. Lindgren. She made those story f\u00f6r the amusement park at the last days of her life. With same passion and genius talent as her books is. Park \u2026",
          "Very well done, especially the story train. Our kids (1 & 4 years old) had a blast on the play areas. No crowds when we were there, sunny mid-week day in August.",
          "Nice place, good food and nice theater for kids.",
          "Brilliant. Even for young kids.",
          "We weren't going to miss it because our whole family loves Astrid Lindgren, but overpriced for what it offers (though the Story Train is well done).",
          "Lots of fun!",
          "Junibacken is heaven for children under 7 and great for all other children (or grownups who still likes to play) as one should expect the gift shop has a impressive selection of books, not only from the featured stories.\nThe place gets \u2026",
          "I love junibaken, I go there super often with the kids and always feels like there is more to discovery. It\u2019s too busy during the weekend and can be chaotic, so try a week day afternoon!",
          "Fantastic children's museum. There is enough to do to spend the whole day there. Sagat\u00e5get was quite scary for my normally brave 3 year old. Play \"Pippi Flyttar In\" was great even though my kids couldn't understand it. Ice cream shop is fun \u2026",
          "When you have kids age 3-8 they will love this!",
          "we were extremely disappointed. \n\nWhat is advertised as giant indoor playground proves to be three small rooms packed with kids and parents. no real time to play as everything is crowded. \nThe one plus is the story train. nicely built and decorated",
          "If in Stockholm with small children you should really gift them with a visit to Junibacken. It won't appeal much to kids over 6 unless they are Pippi Longstocking fans. Take a tram or bus and get there first in the morning, you will be done \u2026",
          "Nice train but to expensive",
          "Nice place for kids but be careful with the non-guarded cloakroom, my winter coat was stolen there. They don't have video surveillance so there is no chance to recover a stolen item.",
          "Wonderful. My 3,4 and 6 yrar olds loved it. Although I'm unsure if it would be as much fun to kids above 10 years. The place feels like a giant playground with many things to look at an explore. We'll surely go there again.",
          "My little girl had a great time !!  So did I \ud83d\ude00",
          "It's a great place - like a work of art based on the books of Swedish children's authors, it includes Pippi Longstocking's house. There's a Pippi show and a story train, sadly not working when we went. The cafe has some Swedish kids' favourites but avoid the weird cola muffins and the tasteless bean Stroganoff...",

          "An incredible attraction, even for adults. The highlight is definitely the train/skylift ride. So many great models and a well narrated tour. If you have kids and live in Stockholm, go for the yearly pass! The playground is worth come back to for the kids. ",
          "My 4 year old had lot of fun here!",
          "Great for kids, still good enough for a quick visit for adults. If you have a Stockholm Pass it is free and you may give it a quick look at least as the stories of Lindgren's books are retold really lovely and heart-warming!",

          "The train with Astrid Lindgrens characters and stories is simply  great!",

          "The place was just ok. Our children were a bit afraid of the story train. Restaurant was ok and there was food and plenty of sweets to buy. We could easily get there by Emelie boat that went from near the Viking Line terminal. I would recommend this place if your children like Astrid Lindgren's stories.",

        "wiki": "Storkyrkan (Swedish: [\u02c8st\u00fb\u02d0r\u02cc\u0255\u028frkan], \"The Great Church\"), officially named Sankt Nikolai kyrka (Church of St. Nicholas) and informally called Stockholms domkyrka (Stockholm Cathedral), is the oldest church in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Originally the main parish church of Stockholm, it currently also serves as the seat of the Lutheran Bishop of Stockholm within the Church of Sweden since the creation of the Diocese of Stockholm in 1942. It is an important example of Swedish Brick Gothic. Situated next to the Royal Palace, it forms the western end of Slottsbacken, the major approach to the Royal Palace, while the streets Storkyrkobrinken, H\u00f6gvaktsterrassen, and Tr\u00e5ngsund passes north and west of it respectively.  South of the church is the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building facing Stortorget and containing the Swedish Academy, Nobel Library, and Nobel Museum.\n\n\n== History ==\nStorkyrkan was first mentioned in a written source dated 1279 and according to tradition was originally built by Birger Jarl, the founder of the city itself.  For nearly four hundred years it was the only parish church in the city, the other churches of comparable antiquity originally being built to serve the spiritual needs of religious communities (e.g., Riddarholm Church).  It became a Lutheran Protestant church in 1527.  The parish church since the Middle Ages of the Nikolai parish, covering the whole island on which the Old Town stands, it has also been the cathedral of Stockholm since the Diocese of Stockholm was created out of the Archdiocese of Uppsala and the Diocese of Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s in 1942.  Because of its convenient size and its proximity to the earlier royal castle and the present royal palace it has frequently been the site of major events in Swedish history, such as coronations, royal wedding and royal funerals.  The last Swedish king to be crowned here was Oscar II in 1873. Crown Princess Victoria, oldest daughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, was married to Daniel Westling on 19 June 2010 at the Storkyrkan, the anniversary of her parents' marriage in Storkyrkan in 1976.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe most famous of its treasures is the dramatic wooden statue of Saint George and the Dragon attributed to Bernt Notke (1489). The statue, commissioned to commemorate the Battle of Brunkeberg (1471), also serves as a reliquary, containing relics supposedly of Saint George and six other saints; Saint Blasius, Saint Germanus, Saint Leo, Saint Martinus, Saint Donatus and Saint Cyriacus. A copy from the early 20th century is found on \u00d6sterl\u00e5nggatan just south of the church. The Saint George is a symbolic representation of Sten Sture, the dragon is the Danish King Christian I, and the Princess is Sweden.\nThe church also contains a copy of the oldest known image of Stockholm, the painting V\u00e4dersolstavlan (\"The Sun Dog Painting\"), a 1632 copy of a lost original from 1535.  The painting was commissioned by the scholar and reformer Olaus Petri, a 19th-century statue of whom is found on the eastern side of the church.  It depicts a halo display, e.g. sun dogs, which gives the painting its name and in the 16th century was interpreted as a presage.\nThe monumental pulpit is the work of Burchard Precht in 1698-1702 and is in a French Baroque style. It became the model for a number of other large pulpits in Sweden.  From the rear of its lofty sounding board issues widely billowing drapery, in front of which hover two large winged genii on either side of a radiant sun bearing the Hebrew letters  \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4.  The relief on the front of the pulpit itself depicts the story of the Canaanite woman (Matthew 15:21-28).  The door of the pulpit is adorned with a relief of Christ's head, while its pediment is crowned by a statue of Hope with putti on either side. Below the memorial are the arms of the Funck family who bore the greater cost of the pulpit.  Beneath the pulpit and surrounded by an iron railing lies the worn gravestone of Olaus Petri.The view down the central aisle of the church is dominated on either side by the Royal Pews, one facing the other on either side of the central aisle.  They were designed by the celebrated architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and made by Butchard Precht. Each consists of a large enclosed box with decorated sides and back.  High above each of the Royal Pews is a large royal crown forming a canopy above it, supported by two genii in flowing mantles, and from which billow sculptured hangings behind the royal seat, while above hover numerous putti.  The royal seats are themselves upholstered in blue velvet with rich applied embroidery.\nThe main altar--\"The Silver Altar\"\u2014is a wooden triptych with an ebony veneer with sculptured reliefs in silver in ascending order of the Last Supper on the predella; a large depiction  of the Crucifixion of Christ between silver statues of Moses and John the Baptist in niches with small silver columns on either side; of the Burial of Christ (between silver statues of the evangelists Matthew and Mark; of Christ's Harrowing of Hell (between statues of the evangelists John and Luke; and on the pediment at top of the triptych, a silver statue of the Risen Christ between two reclining soldiers.\nOn either side of the Silver Altar is a sculpture holding a candle, one of St. Nicholas (the patron of the church) and the other of St. Peter, both designed by G. Torhamn and carved in oak by the sculptor Herbst in 1937. The rose window above and behind the Silver Altar was made in Paris in the 1850s, the first of a series of modern stained windows in the church contributed by various donors.  The Silver Altar and the rose window above it fill the wall space formerly occupied by the apse of the medieval chancel removed by Gustavus Vasa when he expanded the fortifications of the Tre Kronor Castle, while the statue of the Olaus Petri monument at the back exterior of the church stands on the site of the medieval high altar.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Stockholm\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirtual tour of Storkyrkan by Virtualsweden",

          "This is not one of those huge cathedrals covered in gold and marble, with painted ceilings and angels everywhere. This church is, however, breath taking in it's welcoming atmosphere. It's also a WONDERFUL place to listen to a good concert. I visit this church on christmas each",

          "The cathedral has a rather unimpressive exterior but the real joy is the interior, built of brick rather than the usual stone or marble, it seems to give the building a rather warm and welcoming feel. The admission charge is 60kr (June 2018) and you are given an informative",
          "This enormous cathedral church is well worth a visit. Interior columns are brick-built rather than marble as is usual. The stunning altar is silver and topped by a lovely rose window. The royal boxes are huge! I was fortunate to be there when the organist was practising,",

          "This cathedral is quite unusual, as it is made of brick. It is free to admire from the inside. While not a \"must see\" it makes a nice rest stop during your tour of Gamla Stan, as you can sit in the pews and reflect in this quiet environment.",
          "You don't go to Sweden for the Churches unless you are Lutheran and Lutheran chic means plain. The Storkyrkan is not actually a cathedral either but has been the setting for coronations of Swedish royalty who used to hang out just across the way. The interior is quite tasteful",
          "The outside of the building belies the splendour of the interior. Don't forget to stop by on your way to or from the Palace. Everything is incredible close by. Even if you plan to stay only a few minutes, I can guarantee you'll want to stay longer to explore every corner.",
          "The cathedral doesn't look much from the outside- it doesn't look like a typical cathedral. When you go inside it is nothing special. When I visited they had some artifacts from Queen Kristina's coronation in the 1600s which was interesting. To be honest I'd save your money and",

          "Saint Lucia it's a big event here in Sverige and hella \u00e5r so it's in this amazing place where one of the best chorus have a big part on it then also very nice place to have Morzat or another great musician events held in this program .. just the building it's historic with a lot",
          "The cathedral is pretty cool while walking the streets of Old Town Stockholm. Inside is impressive with the Silver Altar and other artifacts. While visiting the Palace came about the backside of the cathedral, at first thought was a different church, but then realize it was",
          "The cathedral itself isn't a very big building like other cathedrals in Europe yet it's interior is just stunning. Everything is expensively decorated with gold painting and the huge golden organ is just impressive. Worth a visit. Sadly most services are in Swedish with only one",
          "this is one of those places that i kept looking up to find the top of the cathedral to get there to find out that is right outside the palace. we went one day and it was closed because of a private event but then went the next day and it was open. one of the places that you",
          "Hearing Bach played on the enormous pipe organ in this Lutheran cathedral was one of the highlights of our trip. Check the notice boards outside the church doors for upcoming concerts.",
          "A wonderful structure located in the heart of old town. One gets a very spiritual and calming feeling being here. It's interesting seeing the difference between the austere northern cathedrals and the southern ones which are more grandiose.",
          "A lot of history in this place and a nice way to get accustomed to old city center before the royal palace museum opens. The church is overwhelming and the St George vs dragon statue was for us the peak.",
          "The church itself is magnificent inside and out. Inside is beautiful with intricate pews, large paintings and statues. We went to see the st George and the Dragon sculpture which has the princess to the side and it is a beautiful piece of gothic work that came from Northern",
          "We stumbled upon the Storkyrkan cathedral door on a quest to find the German church. This beautitful old place of worship is worth a stop to see the giant sculpture of St. George slaying the dragon. Rather simple compared with the grandeur of the cathedrals of the same era in",
          "OK, the cathedral was pretty cool, too. But I had never seen a viewing section in a church for a statue before. It really was necessary, however, to sit on one of the benches for a while to take in all the details displayed in the sculptural ensemble, carved from oak by Berndt",
          "Dating back to the 14th century, this is the place to trace the beginnings of the Christian faith in Sweden, even if much of what you see is Baroque additions rather than the original Gothic form. Highlights include an enormous painting of the Last Judgement and another one of",
          "There is a small fee to enter the facility, but that was totally worth it. What is inside is beautiful and impressive: the royal pews, candle globe, pulpit, altar... Our favorite was Notke's St George and the Dragon. Plan on spending some time enjoying everything this place",
          "Very interesting and informative. You will see items that you can not see anywhere else. In one word - even though I am not religious at all, it is a hidden gem.",
          "The interior of this cathedral is a combination of ornate and \"sturdy.\" It's really breathtaking, and the massive pipe organ is really something to behold.",
          "remembering how interesting this place was and the ornate statues and candles in this place - the magnificent organ and pipes. a very memorable large cool church.",
          "Oldest church and an example of Swedish Brick Gothic. Located in Gamls Stan, next to the Royal Palace, so good to visit both of them.",
          "this is a nice cathedral but it's not grand compared to others in europe......very easy to find near the palace at Gamla Stan......there are lovely decorated royal pews and a lovely organ.....a large statue of St George slaying the dragon......it seems quite a historic place so",
          "An interesting place to visit. Lots of Swedish history and culture. A guide may be needed to fully appreciate the experience.",
          "The old had to make room for the new so they blew out the back wall and built a so-so looking modern church where Mass is held. The old is lovely and worthy of photos. Staff volunteers are in red blazers. This made it easy for me to approach and inquire about Mass times and",
          "Stockholm Cathedral - known as Storykyrkan locally - is located in Gamla Stan right next to the royal palace. It is well worth a visit. The overall style is Gothic and it has several famous art pieces, including a wooden statue of St. George and the ebony altarpiece, as well",
          "This is a great venue to see while in Gamla Stan, but alone worth it for the amazing statue of St. George slaying the dragon. It is fun to think about recent weddings of Swedish Royals in this historic cathedral, which embodies much of Swedish history.",
          "The 60 SEK admission charge seems rather steep, and I wouldn't rank this cathedral among Europe's most beautiful. What made my visit worthwhile was the magnificent wooden statue of St. George slaying the dragon, installed in the late 15th century. To the people of Stockholm,",
          "Our first attempt to get into the cathedral failed as there was a wedding taking place, but as soon as this passed we were allowed in. The cathedrsal is lovely and light with great stained glass and exposed brick work. The highlight for me was the 15th century carving of St.",
          "So many different aspects of this cathedral make it uniquely Swedish although very grand not ostentatious, wonderful carvings and a magnificent silver altar and then there is the carved St George and the dragon which is superb.",
          "A beautiful church that is an essential site in Gamla Stan. The statue of St. George is much larger and much more impressive than I thought it would be (Look for the use of moose antlers on the dragon). The silver altar was also very impressive. I loved the exposed brick which",
          "The carvings on the wall are quite special and different as some of them are skulls. And a lot of things are painted in black. It gives a very strong \"gothic / death\" feeling. Near the middle at the front, the most eye catching sculpture is \"St George and the dragon\"... It looks",
          "I have had the chance to visit many cathedrals. This one is breathtaking. Built around 1200 the interior is remarkable and contains many treasure. It is a museum by itself. Not to be missed",
          "Its a church, you've seen one you've seen them all imho, but its the best one to visit in Stockholm especially with the St George and the Dragon wooden statue. But elsewhere at Gamla Stan there is another at K\u00f6pmanbrinken that's well worth locating.",
          "Some of the interrior is over the top and does not seem in balance with the rest of the church. Still an experiance and worth a visit",
          "It was a wet and windy day so it was nice to be inside. It was a beautiful cathedral, with lots of signs in English.",
          "I love visiting cathedrals, and by this point it usually takes a bit for a new one that I'm visiting to take me by surprise - and this one did. It's just as grand and awe-inspiring as other cathedrals peppered across Europe, but in addition to that, the cathedral itself is",
          "Finally I could visit here at Sat morning. Normally it was closed when I arrived at night. Also sometimes it is closed earlier. It is nice church to see inside. Worth to see inside.",
          "Stockholm cathedral is located right at the royal palace and I nearly missed it. It doesn't look inviting from the outside but quite impressive inside. If you use google map it doesn't lead you there unless you use the Swedish name. But forget about all these, just go to the",
          "In the middle of old town (Gamla stan) you can find this old church. Built in 13th century and with a beautiful altar and a very impressive organ it is a place to see. The entrance is 40SEK a little bit on the very expensive for this kind of objectiv.",
          "Stockholm Cathedral (Storkyrkan), located at the top of Slottsbacken near the Royal Palace in Gamla Stan, features a Baroque exterior with an impressive clock tower (1743 ) and a Gothic interior. Built in 1306, royal ceremonies and burials take place here. This impressive",
          "\u00ddou walk on tomb markers in the floor and some large tombs above ground. Has copy of oldest painting of Stockholm. Very ornate. Concerts almost daily. Easy to get to",
          "The cathedral is very simple on the outside, but beautiful on the inside. We were there right after a service (which all are welcome to attend). Make sure you walk to the fornt to see the Geaorge and the Dragon statue. Well worht a visit.",
          "This is a very attractive old religious structure right in the centre of Gamla Stan. Unfortunately, visiting late on a Friday afternoon on a cold and rainyday, it wasn't open and so I had to be content with viewing the exterior. Impressive, but a shame to have missed the",
          "I am from Stockholm and took my extended family to visit the Cathedral in 2016. Seeing it from a tourist view point, I think the gothic style of architecture and beautiful paintings are worth seeing...even if you have lived in the city for sometime :)",
          "Worth seeing if you enjoy architecture, and it gives a sense of the wealth of Swedish society in years past.",
          "I would not have paid to go in but a donation is asked for (best to use the Stockholm pass for free entry to so many attractions). The inside is really lovely and worth visiting",
          "Amazingly beautiful. Very gothic. If in Stockholm a must see in old town. Statues and paintings are beautiful",
          "Near to the Royal palace is Storkyrkan, it is quite understated from the outside but spare a few minutes and head inside. It is spacious, grand display and colours and a rather surprise design of the alter.",
          "Does not have the ornate grandeur of many other such cathedrals but is worth visiting even just to see the magnificent statue of St George killing the dragon.",
          "I was living by the time where Opera in Stockholm are easy and really invited you to stay, I will appreciate all the great job since the organizations and everything was super nice, Santa Lucia concert it's Amazing how long have this Tradition and how many people were there in",
          "Beautiful cathedral in the Old Town of Stockholm. To sit down for a few minutes and let the impressions work on you is just the right thing after a lot of walking. What I liked best was the sculpture of St George and the dragon which is beautifully crafted.",
          "Its a nice church to look around if you are interested. But not so much outstanding. The only thing I found extra interesting to look at was the big statue of st G\u00f6ran and the drace, all made in oak. Amazing handcraft!",
          "The Cathedral it self is quite nice, however having to pay to go and see St George fighting the Dragon felt quite disappointing.",
          "I'm surprised this is not higher on the list of places to visit in Stockholm. The cathedral dominates nearly every view in Stockholm so no trip is complete without a visit. We visited Notre Dame on the same trip and personally, I think this cathedral is just as lovely.",
          "Very cozy church near By Royal Palace. After Palace nice Place to sit down and take a deep breaths and think history for a while.",
          "Surrounded and filled with beautiful architecture, artistry and history. One of the most beautiful churches I have ever set foot in.",
          "We arrived shortly before closing time, so we unfortunately did not get to stay as long as we might have liked. From what we had the time to see, it is definitely worth a stop to admire all the ornate decorations and furniture throughout. Also a good quiet place to rest up after",
          "The cathedral is so amazing. Full of details and amazing crafts and items. We didn't have the time to attend the service though... would like to come here a second time",
          "This church is located right in Old Town and right off of the main square. When you walk inside, it didn't feel like a typical Cathedral. It was mainly brick and had some amazing statues toward the alter. Definitely worth a 15-20 min visit.",
          "Beautiful and quaint Cathedral, where the King Carl and Queen Silvia got married and also Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel.",
          "This cathedral is free to enter with the Stockholm Card or free with a small donation upon entering. Outside it seems simple, but inside it is breathtaking. There is an amazing statue of St. George and the Dragon made out of wood that is centuries old, with a placard of the",
          "Connected to the history of Stockholm, and home to some of the important event of the Swedish royal family, the Storkyrkan cathedral in Gamla Stan is a mandatory stop in every touristic tour of Stockholm. This 13th century brick Gothic church includes some interesting paintings",
          "Not terribly impressive from the outside but amazing on the inside. All of the plaster has been removed to reveal the beauty of the original brick columns & walls. Great statue of St George & the Dragon ( a bronze replica is also out in the streets of Gamla Stan) lets you",
          "This is not a particularly large Cathedral by general standards although it is interesting and well worth a visit but probably no more than 45 minutes or less. The Cathedral was given its status in 1942 and it is of ancient origins going back to the 13th century. The Royal pews,",
          "Very beautiful cathedral in Gamla Stan. We especially liked the statue with the dragon. Good place to take photos.",
          "First time I see a dragon sculpture in a church. This is a sculpture from 15th century. This is a not a big complex church and certainly not comparable with the ones you can see in other european capitals. Worth a look though while you are visiting Gamla Stan.",
          "This is an amazing old and ornate cathedral. It is the oldest church in Gamla Stan. Originally built as the Catholic Church of Sweden it is now The Church of Sweden. Built in the 13th century it is an incredible documentation of Swedish history. Of the many amazing features it",
          "The exterior is unassuming compared to the glories inside. As I said in another review, I love attending church in other countries. I was lucky enough to attend here and be able to feel God's glory in this magnificent cathedral.",
          "Well, you go to a capital and you go to the main church. Do so in Stockholm as well. Whilst not specacular, it's a shame to miss it. Don't plan a detour or a full day experience...",
          "Stockholm cathedral is a simple religious building ommitting the glamour of many european cities - we found this pleasantly refreshing for a religious building and enjoyed our visit",
          "The Stockholm Cathedral (Storkyrkan) was great to visit - not as massive as many cathedrals you'd see in Europe but still with its own grandeur and unique style",
          "We were privileged to visit when a youth choir was rehearsing a mass - it was beautiful - sung in Latin. Interesting architecture - and history.",
          "The sculpture of St George and the Dragon is magnificent, much bigger than I expected. The church also has many beautiful paintings, including one that takes up an entire wall.",
          "I was lucky enough to go with a Culture Club group and climb the fantastic tower of this cathedral. The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and also had great English skills (which I need). This tour was so interesting. Climbing up into the tower and selling the 3 huge bells",
          "Timed the cathedral for just before the changing of the guard at the royal palace. Just outside there's a great little cafe, where you can have a coffee or a bite to eat.",
          "This medieval cathedral is rather plain compared to cathedral's like Notre Dame in Paris. We enjoyed its simplicity. Especially nice was St. George and the Dragon sculpture; parts made from moose racks. Truly spectacular. Paid admission though.",
          "This is a lovely Scandinavian Church, but relatively simple and even austere compared to cathedrals and churches like Notre Dame, St. Paul's, or cathedrals in Pisa and Florence, to name a few. Compared with other churches in Stockholm, like the palace chapel or the Riddarholmen",
          "The church was closed, and it was during a working day, September 13. Dont know how, dont know why. Yellow note in Swedish at the entrance and a big door closed. A little disappointed as I know the church is more beautiful inside than out.",
          "This beautiful cathedral is a must when visiting Stockholm. The ceilings are amazing . The Swedish people call it Storkyrkan . There are many graves inside the church as well. It is a medieval church built over 700 years ago. You will not be disappointed.",
          "When you are entering Cathedral you are having possibility to see how people was praying long time ago and actually, how they are praying now. Storkyrkan (as it is called in Swedish) is excited and you`re filling like having the look of something special. The place is near Royal",
          "The Stockholm Cathedral - is a Medieval Church \u2013 or Storkyrkan as the Swedish people call it \u2013 was built over 700 years ago. It has been a Lutheran church for just under 500 years. It is situated by the Royal Palace. The church is a beautiful example of Swedish Gothic. A Royal",
          "When you like stone, statues, paintings, and the scenery of religious buildings, this place is a must!",
          "This cathedral was really excited. It was very nicely done by, land was located many graves. Nice and quiet especially history.",
          "The cathedral is worth seeing and very centrally located. It is right by the royal palace. The highlight of the building is the gorgeous statue of St. George slain the dragon. It is very impressive and memorable. It represents the Sweden's defeat over Denmark.",
          "We stopped in right before service was starting, but the inside was incredible. The gold trim and pictures were so beautiful. So cool to see this kind of history and that the cathedral is still used and maintained so well.",
          "absolutely beautiful - free for under 18s but otherwise only a couple of pounds. there are many leaflets providing you with detailed history. it is an amazing cathedral and of traditional Swedish interior",
          "Loved our visit to the cathedral and having quiet time for prayer and reflection inside. Be sure to grab the English explanation guide to help with your self-guided tour.",
          "Located in Gamla Stan near the Royal Palace is the medieval Cathedral of Stockholm. The church as had an evolution beginning in the 14th Century and has seen the addition of the tower, pulpit, furnishings and the medieval interior revealed in a 1909 restoration. The church",
          "The interior of this cathedral is unlike any I have ever seen in Europe. Perhaps it is a Scandinavian influence. It was nearly time for a service to begin, so tourists were not allowed to walk to the front of the church. Definitely worth a look- admission is free. Is in Old",
          "Stockholm\u2019s medieval Cathedral was built in 1279 and provides such unique objects as the St George and the Dragon sculpture. The Cathedral is the venue of major events in Swedish history, like coronations, royal wedding and royal funerals, The historical factors alone demand",
          "Interesting interior, with some delightful touches, but not really awe-inspiring. The Candle Globe beats the usual dull tiers of candles out of sight, and the deeply-cut vault covers are impressive. The statue of St George and the Dragon has a prominent position beside the",
          "This is a beautiful Cathedral in the heart of the old city of Stockholm. Inside is a beautiful oak carved sculpture of St George defeating the Dragon. The organ (at the back of the cathedral) is amazing and so is the ebony and silver front section of the church. It is well worth",
          "In the main the interior of this building is simply finished but it has an absolute beauty which in no way distracts from the main purpose of the building. It has an air of peace and tranquility all of its own and I really enjoyed my visit.",
          "Walking along Slottsbacken the marvellous west facade came into view. Framed by the obelisk and Royal Palace it's a wonderful vista. Inside is to be seen the design of Brick Gothic. Looking along the nave is awe inspiring. The multitudinous brick columns leading to the high",
          "Relatively unadorned, this is a protestant cathedral in the heart of Stockholm and houses a statue of St George killing the dragon, elaborate pews for the royal family and ornate pulpit. Well worth seeing. Of course, the expense of maintaining such a building is huge and this is",
          "Good value. Small entrance fee so you could save this for when your Stockholm pass has expired. This cathedral contained some spectacular stuff: a huge and intricate statue of St George killing the dragon, a vast pulpit and elaborate royal boxes, and an interesting painting",
          "If you are on a budget, It's an attraction that you can pass. The cathedral inside is beautiful. It has some things that are interesting. However, I think it should be cheaper. It is a small place to visit.",
          "Stockholm's oldest church traces to legendary city founder Birger Jarl in the 13th century, it became a Lutheran church in 1527, following the more austere Protestant religious and aesthetic sensibility. Enlarged and modified over the years, with Baroque (e.g. the pulpit) and",
          "If you compare this cathedral with other objectives in Stockholm Lan, then this is a great church to go an visit. It is build in 13th century with a couple of art objects from 15th. If you compare even with the not so nice ones from some other countries and some that have maybe",
          "I loved walking through the cathedrals in Old Town. This one especially took my breath away. Definitely worth a short visit.",
          "A lovely cathedral in a mostly agnostic city. The wooden carved horse and rider (St George) are incredible. On some evenings they host a history night with costumed figures from history telling stories about their lives and interacting with visitors. We had just missed this",
          "Such history in this beautiful cathedral. Just such a magical feeling inside. So very well maintained. A beautiful building for those that like to explore religious buildings and architecture. Intriguing symbolism.",

          "Not so noticeable outside but beautiful inside. Nice paraments and chandeliers. Tombs under the pavement. About 50Kr to enter. Worth a visit",
          "This is where the Swedish King Carl Gustav and the Queen Silvia got married as well as Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel. Newly freshed up. Definetly worth a visit !",
          "A very nice change to see a Cathedral that is made of brick and has so much of it exposed. It makes the cathedral seem so much different from others. The cathedral is not so big that it takes a long time to tour, but if you want to check everything out, there is a lot you can",
          "Worth a walk by just to the the outside of the church, and if you're into paying to see the inside, you can give them 40kr to see the rest. But the outside structure is worth a walk by if youre in gamla stan.",

          "It is a pleasant space. Inwould suggest going in with intent to hunt out the many beautiful objets d'art that fill the space, including on the ceiling. The glittering pews for the Royals are a sight to behold. Go on a scavenger hunt, see what you can find! It's a pretty",
          "Compared to other European cathedrals, the Stockholm Cathedral is an intimate treasure. The Sun Dog painting, the St George sculpture and the Candle Globe make the cathedral a \"not to be missed\" experience.",
          "In the heart of old town, outside was not so attractive, but had wonderful interior. Sculptures, statues was really worth a visit.",
          "When we visited someone was playing the organs. It was warm inside and it's got beautiful chapels and ceiling and a lot of ornaments. I found the George and the dragon sculpture especially splendid",
          "This is the main church in the old town close to the Palace and next to the Nobel museum. It has a 40 SEK entrance fee. It is worth visiting if you are into churches and are in the area. Alternatively there are many other similar churches that you can visit for free in Stockholm.",
          "As far as European capitol city cathedrals go, this one is on the small side. But that doesn't make it any less interesting or welcoming.",
          "Wonderful to see. The Statue of St George killing Danish dragon and saving Swedon from ruin is amazing.",
          "Not to miss if you're in the Old Town. Make sure you see the statue of St. George fighting the dragon, the organ and the ornate altar and pulpit.",
          "Not to big and free for visit. You can pop in the cathedrals while traveling around the old city. I love the spherical candlestick the most for I did not see such kind of candlestick before.",
          "The Cathedral is stunning both outside and within, well worth popping into while walking through the old town.",
          "We were here in mid-winter so it was nice to come into the cathedral to get out of the cold. But the cathedral is well worth visiting.",
          "This is a lovely Cathedral and not too large. It doesn't take very long to see it. It has a beautiful large wooden statue of St. George Slaying the Dragon.",
          "A peace descends on you when you enter this beautiful place. There are some wonderful carvings to view and some fine architecture both inside and out. With or without a faith this is definitely worth a visit",
          "Not very big for a cathedral but very impressive. Inside there are some real hidden gems, my favourites being St George and The Dragon, The Seven-Branched Candlestick and The Candle Globe. The red brick makes it feel modern and fresh as did the colours in the stained glass",
          "The cathedral dated back to the 13th century. At one time, the church was Catholic but Petri talked Gustav Vasa to change it to Protestant. Royal weddings are held here, the last being Princess Victoria in 2010. The large ornate Saint George and the Dragon statue is worth going",
          "Go there and feel like your ancestors! The place make me feel good energy, is not beatiful, but is a great place to learn about how a Christianity try to grow in Sweden!",
          "I have traveled across Europe and one of my favorite thing to do is visit cathedrals. I deem Stockholm Cathedral as one of a kind, since it is so well lit. In comparison with their French or Spanish counterparts, the Stockholm Cathedral feels warm. The statutes are beautiful",
          "The building exterior is quite sober, and the interior is a bit more rich and magnificent, yet, in terms of cathedral standards it is a bit sober. The best highlights of the cathedral are the St. George wooden sculpture, which it is one of a kind, and the two royal cubicles.",
          "Its worth spending time inside. There is a lot of history and the decor etc is well preserved and well maintained.",
          "I actually visited twice on the same day. The second time to hear a concert on the splendid organ (well worth hearing if you get the chance. As others have noted this is not a big cathedral, but I feel really at home in it. The atmosphere is warm and calm. There are many",
          "I loved the feel of the place. It felt very majestic although it was a small cathedral. I don't understand why we had to pay an entrance fee to go to a church",
          "I was surprised by the beauty of this cathedral. I had not read anything about it before I visited, so when I walked in I was quite impressed by the beautiful red brick throughout the building. There are beautiful paintings throughout, but what really stood out to me was the red",
          "Unlike some of the big European churches, I did not leave questioning my [lack of'] faith. There was no one taking money on the day I went to visit for 15 minutes in January, so no harm there either.",
          "The cathedral is enough big and very bright. Among some Baroque works of art, one amused me particularly: a statue of St. George with the dragon, made of... wood and moose horns! 0_0 Very interesting! There's also a modern globe where to put prayer candles... and it makes you",
          "We enjoy visiting places of worship when we travel, no matter what denomination. This beautiful cathedral is absolutely one of the most awesome places we've ever seen. Apparently the Royal Family uses this cathedral for their ceremonies and special events. The art work",
          "when i visiting other cities,towns,small towns i love going to churches ..check how look inside and outside..this one is very special for swedish royal family....",
          "the nativity scene that was displayed prior to Christmas was amazing and the vicar (I presume) who was there spent a long time telling my children about the lady who had crafted the nativity; they were transfixed. She also spent time answering our general queries about the city",
          "A pamphlet is available to explain the various points of interest throughout the Church, some of them being the 7 branched candlestick, the painting of 'The Last Judgement' by David Klocker von Ehrenstrahl, a sculptural ensemble of St. George and the Dragon - that was",
          "It was Christmas time so I was looking for church because I wanted to be connected to Enfant Jesus. I went to this Cathedral and it is beautiful and very peaceful. It was empty and I could take time to stay and enjoy. It is pretty and I really recommend to visit.",
          "It is a gorgeous place. The statue of George and the Dragon was incredible. Check out the pictures on the web and then go - you'll appreciate it even more!",
          "As Catedrals go this is about a 6 out of 10 but still worth a visit. The Church is massive however not beautiful like Notre Dame but still striking as a piece of architecture. Worthy of a visit.",
          "Unlike many Cathedrals this has a warmth about it and some beautiful artefacts. If possible, try to attend one of the concerts held here as we have found Swedish musical events to be of the highest order.",
          "Mixture of Scandavian opulence and practicality. Worth a visit. Could almost miss it from outside but don't!",
          "To say that this cathedral is unique and beautiful is an understatement. It reflects the history of Sweden along with Christian history under one roof. From a figure on a steed, to onyx fixtures to gold plated statues to huge oil murals, it is magnificent. Well worth the visit!",
          "This spacious cathedral seems a bit sparse (not surprising for a Protestant cathedral), but the elaborate statue of St George and the Dragon makes up for this sparseness.",
          "Go there to look at 15th century wooden statue\u201d St George and Dragon \u201c. May be you will see better and more beautiful churches in your life but statue is really special and worth to see.",
          "This cathedral has some interesting things to see as well as being a place of quiet calm to soothe the spirit. The candle sphere is a thing of grace and beauty and there is an aesthetic, as well as a spiritual, pleasure in making an offering. The St George and the Dragon statue",
          "Great Sankt Nikolai kyrka (Church of St. Nicholas), is the oldest church in Gamla Stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. It is an important example of Swedish Brick Gothic and houses a really impressive large wooden statue of George and the Dragon, commissioned in",
          "its not that unique! it is just as beautiful as many other central old churches arround europe at its time, if you were passing through the old town spend a five minutes inside, otherwise save your time to a more other nearby places",
          "That's the most beautiful cathedral in Stockholm. Quite historic. Many royal marriages took place here. Stunning!",
          "This was my first stop in downtown Stockholm. I had only a day while in transit to East Africa, so I wanted to use my time well. Going here was a good choice. It is a beautiful building. Be sure to look up and see the artwork on the ceiling, as well as the artwork more easily",
          "Check out the occasional concerts as a wonderful way to experience the cathedral and music. We went on a Sunday evening and enjoyed a lovely choir and gorgeous candlelit atmosphere. Our hotel concierge helped to make the arrangements since the web site was not in English.",
          "The Cathedral of Stockholm, in Sweden known as Storkyrkan (literally Great Church) or Sankt Nikolai kyrka (St. Nicholas Church) is the oldest church in Stockholm and the headquarters of the diocese of Stockholm. It is in the old town (Gamla Stan) of the city. The church, in one",
          "Really nice cathedral in Stockholm . 40 kr to go in. It is beautifully preserved and the George and dragon sculpture is unique, for me at least.",
          "When we reached the Obelisk, we saw a building which turns out to be the Stockholm Cathedral, also known as Storkyrkan. That one is the back of the cathedral. We walked to the main entrance which is on the opposite side to the side which is facing the Obelisk. We can go in by",
          "Beautiful cathedral in the old town. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit on a snowy Sunday in February! It is truly stunning.",
          "Very unusual brick columns supporting the roof - I've never seen before - make this an interesting visit. The 40kr fee seemed to be putting people off - so it was quiet inside.",
          "a must for every stockhom visitor... special atmosphere and bright... fanatastic monument and place of silence",
          "We rarely miss a chance to visit historical churches; this one is well worth it, with its architecture, artefacts such as the stunning St-George and the Dragon sculpture. Well located on Gamla Stan and near the Royal Palace. You can't miss it !",
          "Its truly beautiful and amazing. The intricate detail and ornamentation. The history dates back so far and our tour guide, Losche, spoke in three languages for our group! Look for the flying angels in the air, that were a gift from the King to his new wife! The pipe organ is",
          "I can see why royalty gets married here. The cathedral's use of stone and brick inside is impressive, as is the wooden carving of St. George and the Dragon. The other religious items on the walls don't disappoint. Don't be deceived by the plain (but nice) exterior; go in to see",
          "I loved this airy, spare cathedral with its amazing 1489 Bernt Notke woodcarving of St George and the Dragon. The much more modern Candle Sphere is also beautiful.",
          "Such a beautiful place! Thinking about all the princes and princes, kings and queens that got married here! And the beautiful painting that shows how the old palace looked.",
          "I really enjoyed visiting this small-ish church. I am a huge fan of brick and can't remember seeing a church similar to this one in North America or Sourthern Europe (although I haven't seen them all!). I also thought the famous statue was very lovely. Best part - my royal",
          "5hought this would be a plain Lutheran CThedral. Not so it's gorgeous with stunning paintings and sculptures and beautifully decorated. A must to visit and once again beautifully looked after by the wonderful Stockholm authorities. They are really on top of all their tourist",
          "Be careful not to arrive during the times it's closed, but otherwise it's a beautiful place to visit, reflect and pause.",
          "The cathedral is not a \"must\" see, but a \"should\" see. It has some very attractive and interesting elements. The foremost, in my opinion, is the magnificent \"St. George Slaying the Dragon.\" This oak statue was installed in 1489 to commemorate the Swedish defeat of the Danes",
          "Beautiful cathedral inside with interesting artefacts and well worth visiting. Outside un-prepossessing.",
          "Beautiful, very interesting design. Nice cathedral to tour! We found the brick interesting in the interior and loved the painted ceiling.",
          "Your typical cathedral in the old part of town. Think there was a SEK400 entrance fee if I remember rightly. Quite impressive inside, I especially liked the pulpit. Not the most impressive cathedral I have ever seen but probably worth going in if you are passing.",
          "The interior shines over the external features. Quality stained glass, part frescoed ceiling, stunning pulpit. The highlight is the St George slaying dragon statue. Centrally located in old town near palace, you are bound to pass by while walking around and should drop in.",
          "It had a renovation before the wedding of the Crown Princess, which it needed no doubt, and it is a nice church and it comes with a history as well.",
          "We visit the Church and it was beautiful,although different and simple,no picture taking was allowed ,nice icons,place for meditation and silence,great religious statues, the ceilings are very beautiful.",
          "An impressive interior, with golden decorations, especially the pulpit and the royal boxes. Also, nice vaulted ceilings and some stained glass. Too boxed in to have a stately presence on the exterior.",
          "Located in the historic center or the so called \" Gamla Stan\" the \" Storkyrkan\" or Saint Nicholaus Cathedral is the main and oldest Cathedral in Stockholm. Is a gotic styled in the inside (reconstructed in barroc style in 1740) constructed with red bricks and very high vaults.",
          "The cathedral Located right in front of the royal palace, it is big and impressive, the columns are made of red bricks which is typical Swedish style, not like other cathedrals in Europe. The interior is impressive and the statue of the king killing the dragon is impressive and",
          "Stunning Cathedral which doesn't look like much from the exterior (go with it!). Plenty of beautiful artwork and the Saint George and the Dragon statue is truly breathtaking. Highlight of the visit was the tour of the tower! When we visited on a Thursday in August, there were 2",
          "We enjoyed very much the guided tour of this truly beautiful Cathedral and the history dating back 1200/1300's and the rebuilding in the 1700's. The St George and The Dragon is a fantastic sculptural along with the wonderful Pulpit are only some of the many treasures worth",
          "This church is on the Stockholm Card and is one of the many things you can quickly assimilate in the Old Town. There is a fine ornate altar and a statue of St. George and the Dragon, and a painting about astronomy and in each hidden corner obscure memorials and markings which",
          "Beautiful historic cathedral worth a brief visit. The interior space is really beautiful and worth the small admission price.",
          "The church is lovely and the statue of St. George is very impressive. The church gives free tours in multiple languages and the guide we had was entertaining and informative. Lots of history to be found in this beautiful old cathedral.",
          "If you are in Stockholm you don't want to miss this Cathedral and ll the tombs and statues and artwork inside. I think it was 40 kr to enter but well worth the price. I was inside for at least an hour and they had an English speaking tour guide to explain all the different",
          "This is one of the oldest church in Stockholm and must be one of the most visited since it is located in Gamla Stan, just steps from the Royal Palace. However, I really don't understand why they charge a 5$US entrance fee since the inside is very ordinary. There are a lot of",
          "I went on the guided tour of the tower and church. It was a great 45min spent inside the church learning about its history. Please be advised the steps are steep and if you are afraid of heights...think twice. The tour guides were absolutely lovely and fun. It's worth the money",
          "Beautiful, airy cathedral with light-colored materials, intricate brickwork, and a variety of artwork from the 14th century to modern times. The main highlight is the statue of St. George and the Dragon (1489) with details made of oak, elk antlers, and horsehair. Even if you",
          "Next to the Palace, this is worth a visit. Beautiful inside, steeped in history, a must on your tour of Stockholm",
          "The church is in the Old Town just next to the castle. It's nice to see since it's so big and much statues. It's hard to understand what everything means if you don't know any facts.",
          "If you are in Old Town, you simple can't miss it. This is the oldest church in Stockholm from 1279. Today it is lutheran, former catholic. he altar is beautiful.",
          "This cathedral is stunning. And the free guided tour is very informative and well done. A must see if in Stockholm! The statue of King George slaying the dragon is great.",
          "I am not a church person but this is worth the effort. Great statue of St George slaying the dragon is worth the visit alone. Paintings and artifacts are all interesting.",
          "I am a fan of cathedrals all over the world but believe me this oone is special, doors and candle holders are amazing, do it ..",
          "We were in Old Town on a Sunday. It was 11:00 A.M. and we heard beautiful bells ringing from up above us, and we both said to each other, well, we could attend mass here, so we went inside. They were about to start the mass service, and the church was so beautiful I said let's",
          "I spent 1 hour on a tour in this beautiful church and feel like I could have easily stayed 2 more just walking around. A peaceful sanctuary in the middle of Old Town with fantastic works of art.",
          "The above statement may seem like an exaggeration but believe me, it's not. Our tour guide Isabella was succinct and charismatic with her storytelling. The history and stories behind the statues, pulpit, organ are fascinating at worst. I've not seen tourists collectively go up",
          "This cathedral has it all...art, history, architecture including in the interior designs, old tombs from prominent historical figures and a depiction of a natural phenomenon in the skies over old Stockholm in ages past. Intrigued? This is the church you see directly behind the",
          "interesting sculptures and history and a nice place to stop and rest after walking around Stockholm.",
          "A stunning interior with a lot of history, the highlights were the statue of St George Killing the Dragon, and the Painting of the Sundogs. Admission is free, and it feels like a grand old church.",
          "I am kind of church-ed out having visited countless churches and cathedrals in Italy and Spain, but we stopped in to this one as a way to kill time prior to the changing of the guard at the Palace. We were pleasantly surprised. The inside is magnificent with the Silver Altar,",
          "Really beautiful. Definitely worth to see. It contains the famous statue of St George and the famous painting with the halo phenomenon.",
          "Since Sweden unlike other European countries is not up to its eyeballs in cathedrals, visiting a couple does not seem like chore. It is as understated as expected for a Scandinavian church. There is an interesting statue of Saint George slaying the dragon. It uses moose and elk",
          "While the outside of the cathedral is nice, you really don't appreciate its glory until you step inside and see the many richly ornate pictures, statues and religious icons scattered throughout. Very impressive.",
          "Mot so impressive from the outside but wonderful inside, with red tiling and impressive art works. The star attraction being the sculpture of St George and the Dragon, seen by Swedes as being the triumph of Sweden (Sten Sture, the Swedish king, as St George over Denmark, the",
          "This cathedral is something really special with a lot of historical importance for the Swedish kingdom. I would say it is sufficient to stay for an hour or so. Great place if you are interested in architecture and history. Do not miss it if you are nearby.",
          "A free concert at the Stockholm Cathedral (Storkyrkan) came to my attention on a rainy Sunday afternoon. This fell into my practice of visiting churches by participating in an activity other than being a tourist. From the outside, the Storkyrkan does not look like much but the",
          "We went here during our trip in Old Town. There will be fee to enter this place, but it is not that expensive though. The interior is very beautiful indeed. I do remember the sculptures close to the audience chairs are very amazing. It is worthwhile to stay and enjoy this",
          "+ Awsome view inside, very gorgeous. I was spellbound. A must watch. Considering the age of the cathedral it has additional value.",
          "Called in for a quick look as we were passing and it literally ended up as that, as we had the Stockholm card we were meant to present it at the desk but the guy serving was having issues with a customer in front of us and spent 20mins on the phone in which time i'd had a quick",
          "Had been to see the Changing of Guard at the Royal Palace, just around the corner, and popped in to see what this unprepossessing (from the outside) church looked like inside. I was immediately taken aback by how beautiful it was - something one would never guess from the",
          "This really should be listed on TA as \"Storkyrkan\" because that is the official name. I love the silver alter because it is so different from the typical triptych alters one sees in cathedrals...it is sterling and ebony and typically reserved in Swedish fashion. The sculpture of",
          "Here is very solemn and impressive building. When I visited,there were a few people and so quiet. Its a little bit dart inside but so feel impressed so much. Here is called a cathedral but not as big as St paul in London or San Pietro in Vatican, You can take some photos here.",
          "This Cathedral had a modern feel even though it is actually medieval built in 1279. Apart from the George and Dragon sculpture there are other must sees here including the V\u00e4dersoltavlan (1535).",
          "A beautiful and serene candle lit cathedral. A recommended stop-off while wandering around Gamla Stan.",
          "The moment I stepped in my ears were filled with beautiful organ music. You can almost feel the history steeped in the church as the church is crammed with artefacts, each and everyone of them telling a story. Light a candle and sit for a while. You won't regret it.",
          "Since the outside of the church is not exceptionally spectacular, we almost missed experiencing this lovely church. This very old cathedral is exceptionally beautiful inside. The pulpit, aisle, royal pews, statues, windows, lighting, and candles are all stunning.",
          "Whether you are religious, spiritual, atheist, protagonist, antagonist or I'm-just-a weary-traveler', just go visit this church, espl'y in the evenings when all the candles add to the magic. I'm not religious but since we were in the vicinity, hubby wanted to visit. Little did",
          "The rather plain exterior provides no indication of the rich artwork that awaits inside. We would have liked to have been present when the Handel's Messiah was being presented and hear the magnificent organ but our travels didn't allow. Unlike the cathedrals in areas like",
          "A very nice Cathedral in the old city of Stockholm. Inside there are a lot of trophies and crypts. It is detailed, a lot to see and I think it is good to visit if you are in Stockholm and want to know more about the history of the city",
          "Like most brick gothic churches or cathedrals, the Storkyrkan may not look like much on the outside. But, venture through its doors and you will not be disappointed. Understated masonry is juxtaposed with some phenomenal set pieces, such as the epic sculpture of St George and",
          "With it's beautiful ceiling and ornate decorations (especially the St. George and the dragon sculpture) the cathedral is a can't miss!",
          "Had to visit the Cathedral to see the 15th century statue of St George defeating the dragon. The cathedral is between the palace and the old town not the biggest of cathedral but worth visiting. We visited on a Sunday and there was no entrance charge. St George alone is worth",
          "We managed to luck into a concert of Handel's Messiah. We sat on the 4th row for about $100/ticket.. and it was worth every penny. Awe-inspiring with amazing acoustics.",
          "I've been to many cathedrals while traveling around Europe, and some are better than others. There's so much to see in this cathedral, I guarantee you will walk out in awe of its intricacies. It's just so beautiful, I can only tell you that you must see it to get the full",
          "We walked in here without expecting much, and not only there was an organ concert but also the interior in this church is really very nice. Be sure not to miss the statue of Saint George defeating the dragon to get his people convert to Christianity. Over all...very nice artwork",
          "My teenage children weren't really interested in visiting the cathedral, but even they found some things to wonder at! The 15th century statue of St George and the dragon is amazing, and the spherical candle holder alone is worth popping in here to have a look. Many other",
          "It's amazing and beautiful. Very rich history. There are so many tombs to see. Beautiful sculpture. Ornate alters. Breathtaking 13th century.",
          "This Cathedral (locally known as Stockholms Domkyrkof\u00f6rsamling, or St Nicolas Cathedral) is just outside the Royal Palace. Between the Palace and the Old Town shopping streets. A good place to sit down and meditate.",
          "This is a great cathedral to visit. Not as stunning as other cathedrals I've been to, but I love the art works in this cathedral. I am absolutely mad with the sculpture of St. George and the Dragon and with Sweden's largest painting \"The Last Judgment\". They were next to",

          "There is some beautiful art and sculpture there and some fascinating old tombs. The main alter is the most impressive, ebony and silver.",
          "And this is no exception. Beautiful altar, amazing sculpture and artwork. Worth a visit if you're in Old Town.",
          "This church is a must. Its history is intresting. Outside it looks just as a ordinary boring Lutheran church, but inside you feel the history! St G\u00f6ran (George) is amazing! This a absolute must! Even if there is an admission fee...to a church...",
          "When you're walking through the Old Town, the temptation is to skip this church because of the admission fee. Don't. It's worth it for a couple of reasons. First, it's fun to see churches that started out as elaborate Catholic churches, and then became austere Protestant",
          "...richer than outside (as everything else in Sweden). Boring exterior, and nice and warm interior. Although I am more of baroque/rococo person this is a major example of brick Gothic architecture. Inside, elements of various styles are added to decorate interior. Come here,",
          "Situated adjacent to the Royal palace, the Cathedral has been the venue for many royal events (weddings etc). There is a fixed entry fee of 40SEK and it is well worth the entrance price. The Cathedral is wonderfully decorated, with guilt facings to the balconies - stunning. I",

          "Stockholm Cathedral is located close to the Royal Palace in the Old Town. It has quite a short stumpy clock tower, so don't head straight for the tallest spire in town, that belongs to the German church. The building itself is a bit plain. As compensation there are some very",
          "The church offers a free tour around at noon and this is the best way to enjoy the place. The church is filled with impressive work of arts ranging from the paintings to the statues. The tour will also take you to the tower balcony which will give you an amazing view of the",
          "An amazing cathedral right in the centre of Stockholm. The ticket it's not for free but I advise you to spend this money. So swedish style, a \"must\" of any tour of Stockholm!",
          "It is majestic and yet serene and you can go there and listen to concerts during lunch hours sometime just to enjoy the music for a while.",
          "It is very interesting how everything in the whole of Scandinavian countries is paid. The cathedral,is interesting. But it is hard to compare it with Notre Daem in Paris, for instance, the latter being free. For the time one spends visiting the Stockholm Cathedral, and if one",
          "We ran here after a guided tour to catch a peek inside before they closed. Wow are we glad we did! They have a great little map to guide you to the important things to see and allows you to make the best use of your time. As we were getting ready to leave before they closed,",
          "The view of the building from outside is absolutely stunning and then the oohs and ahhs start when you go inside to see the wall paintings, statues and the physical size of the Cathedral itself. Well worth a visit on your tour of the City -and it's free to go in!",

          "With Stockholm pass, there were many museums included, as well as the Nobel Prize Museum. For the admission price of 120 Sek, I wouldn't pay for it. Suitable for people who are really interested in history. After ten minutes we're back outside.",
          "Ended our walking tour in the square and as it was raining decided to give this a go. So glad we did - although small spent a couple of hours in here . The short films on some of the winners was a highlight",

          "Simple, good, inspiring.... but could be more interactive? Movie Cinema where you can spend hours on various Nobel Prize winners. 3\u2018 movies on specific winners. Some exhibition area is built now, which is needed. In any case a great museum",
          "This was on our \"to do\" list of sites in Stockholm. Glad we went, but unfortunately half of the museum was closed off due to updating/adding a new display? They did reduce the admission price because of this inconvenience. Had a snack in the Nobel Bistro - be sure to turn",
          "This museum is located in the heart of Gamla Stan, on the main square. It is not very big, and it would take just about an hour to quickly see the main exhibits. But, if you have time, it is worth going through the displays slowly, reading about all the winners, their lives,",
          "So cute!! We went on Friday and there was free entrance but it was so interesting! There was a guide that tell us Alfred Nobel's story and the invention of the prize. Little museum but it's worth it!",
          "This is not a must for everyone but I think it is worth the time if you are into a bit of general knowledge... join the guided tour and check the time table. They are currently installing a new exhibition so price is only 60 sek and they take cash! Allow an hour- 75 minutes.",
          "Set aside some time to spend in the Nobel Prize Museum. It will make you smile as you ponder some of the geniuses of this world. From the moment you enter and spot Schroedinger's suitcase (left behind when he fled the Nazi regime) with a little toy cat peeking its head out top",
          "Amazing Museum a definite must see in Norway. Located on the waterfront easily walkable from the Grand Hotel. Would recommend the Oslo Pass if visiting am any sites on your Norway vacation.",
          "This museum is in many ways a summary of the best of humanity in the 20th-21st century. The Nobel Prize is a cultural icon, and to see the winners throughout the last century with summaries of their achievments was inspiring.",

          "All sorts of information about all the past Nobel prize winners: by year of award, by subject and so on. Disoplays of various items associated with the individuals themselves, though in some cases the links with the award were a bit tenuous. Not sure why there was a large",

          "We didn\u2019t know much about how the Nobel Prize was established. The history was very interesting. The personal affects of the Nobel prize winners were also of interest. We were really tired so I don\u2019t think we spent as much time as we usually would looking at the exhibits. Also-",
          "Apart from the Vasa and ABBA museums, the Nobel Prize Museum was on my list of must see museums in Stockholm and can I say, I was not in the least bit disappointed. On the contrary, I was overwhelmed and humbled by all these great minds and institutions who have been recognised",

          "The Nobel Prize Museum was fascinating. I learned so much about how the prizes are awarded and who and why the prizes were awarded to the individuals. Our guide was excellent.",

          "Quite a vast display on Martin Luther King while we were there. It was very interesting and that alone is worth the visit. Also, very interesting to learn about Alfred Noble himself. There is quite a lot of detail and attention put to the Noble prize winners in peace however,",
          "Yes this isn\u2019t the biggest museum, but we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The tour was very informative (and included in entry) and the guide made it interesting and quite humorous at times. Not at all dry and stuffy. The highlight was that entry for kids is free and they",

          "This is a small, but uniquely uplifting museum. It was great to see a few of the actual instruments used by the Nobel-winning scientists. The Martin Luther King Jr. exhibit was moving, even if, as an American, this is a topic of great familiarity. Though it won\u2019t take long",
          "Good to visit on a rainy day. Can be very busy. Interactive displays can be interesting and full of information. The main display this July is Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement. There are videos playing with stories from or about Nobel Prize Winners. Fairly",
          "I love history and museums so I'm not one to complain; however, the Nobel Museum was pretty disappointing. Most things of value were video you can see at home for free. The majority of the artifacts were silly (the shoes a writer wore or the hat a man wore?). I would skip it.",
          "I am only giving it four stars instead of five because they need more room! I asked our guide if there were plans to move into bigger space and apparently there is a plan in the works. There is so much information in such a small space - we learned so much. The short movies",

          "I am surprised to see the relatively mixed reviews for this museum on TripAdvisor. This was probably just below the Vasa Museum in terms of ranking, return on investment (time), etc... Towards the back they also have a rotating exhibition so ensure you allot proper time to read",

We had a guided tour (at 10.15 ) and the guide, who\u2019s name i didn\u2019t get, was really interesting and engaging. She had lots of stories about some of the eccentric and in some cases controversial",

          "The Nobel Museum is located in the center. You can reach it by foot during a walk through old town. It shows the history of the Nobel Price and all of its scientists. With an audio guide you can get to know them better. You can plan about one hour for this attraction - ideal for",
          "Well worth a visit and very apposite as the award ceremony was on the day we visited.Staff were helpful and very knowledgeable.",
          "Great Summary of all around Alfred Nobel, the Prizewinners and why they won. Currently featuring Martin Luther.",
          "The main exhibit rotates out often to display the other Nobel recipients, but the one displayed while I was there was for Martin Luther King Jr. As an American and the current political climate, I found that exhibit to be extremely impactful and saw a lot of things I had never",
          "The museum is excellent, the displays about the past and present Nobel laureates give you faith in humanity. They also had a temporary exhibit on Martin Luther King which was very emotional.",
          "Outstanding! This was one of the highlights of our time in Stockholm. We were in the city in November and visited the museum on a Saturday morning, arriving around 11:00am. The museum was not overly busy during our visit, which made it easy to rove and fully appreciate the",
          "120 sek entry and only 80 sek for a sandwich and tea in the cafe. A very pleasant 3 hours. Recommend the free audio tour using your smart phone. Don't forget to check out the chairs in the cafe!",
          "As an engineer I find this place very interesting. I take the tour in English it is free. You will be told how the selection process works etc.",
          "Visited with the kids. We participated in the English Tour available almost every hour. Audio Tours with your cellphone also available anytime. The Museum shows and explains the History of the Nobel Prize and Alfred Nobel. It gives extended information and artifacts of previous",
          "It was truly amazing, chance to see part of the history. If you are visiting the Sweden, apsolutly you must visit this museum.",
          "Excellent guided tour by one of the staff members. It is very interesting to see personal objects from Nobel prize winners on display. 5 stars!",
          "Interesting gallery of the heritage of Alfred Nobel. Vide variety of personal item can be seen related to people awarded wit Nobel prizes. The actual exhibition of Martin Luter King Jr. is fascinating, you fell like you were the part of the history.",
          "A very interactive museum, interesting both to kids and adults. Most of it is dedicated to Martin Luther King, though, but it is still quite fun and educating. I would recommend it to anyone.",
          "I enjoyed a lot learning about Alfred Nobel life and most interesting was that he has left on Testament his desire about Nobel price. Was interesting but a little space for Albert Nobel and everywhere you see Marting Luther King!",
          "Learned things about Nobel that I never knew before, very fascinating museum, we were fortunate to arrive just as The Guide was beginning the tour and he explained about Alfred Nobel his wealth, and how the Nobel Prizes began. Very interested to learn that the Peace Prize is",
          "Month's later I continue to think about my visit. I am not quite sure how to approach this review other than to encourage other's to visit and be in awe of human thought, the artifacts present and the impact on global society.",
          "I was super impressed with the museum!! The included tour was a must. Only 30 minutes and extremely interesting. I\u2019m not a museum person, but this was excellent!!",
          "I went into the museum by accident. An amazing accident. I enjoyed every moment. The interactive display, the collection donated dy the laurietes and the exciting chance of being there on the same day and hour that the chosen laurietes for the nobel prize in medicine were",
          "Expected a bit much. Small museum telling the history of noble prize. You will mostly be on your own to explore. Staff are there and happy to help. Liked the short films about the prize winners. While we were watching at the cinema, one of the staff members walked in switched of",
          "Great for a visit to read and learn about Nobel prizes and Nobel winners. With some interactive parts, but mostly suitable for adults.",
          "We thought the Nobel Museum was just okay. It is a small building with exhibits on Nobel-laureates and explanations of the awards process. I would recommend the museum only if you are extremely interested in those topics.",
          "Very well presented and awesome viewing . A must see and do spend time to absorb the evolution of the Nobel prixes",
          "Unsurprisingly, the Nobel Museum is about Nobel laureates and celebrating their contributions to the world. At the moment, the museum is particularly focusing on Martin Luther King Jr., and promoting his want for racial equality and peace through non-violent means, which I",
          "Leave an hour or so to visit this museum. The exhibits were very informative and the short videos helped to understand the history and background of the Nobel awards. I\u2019d recommend taking a tour (they were free). The guides knew their stuff.",
          "This museum made me not want to read anything but a Nobel prize winners books. Plan to spend some time here and just hang out and read.",
          "I was visiting the Nobel museum on the day of the announcement of the prize for 2018 in chemistry and the suspense was felt in the air. The museum tells the story of the Nobel Prize as well as biographies of the laureates since 1901. A special screen with live broadcast was",
          "I attended the opening of the Martin Luther King exhibition and loved it. Great effort and vibe. Really interesting read. A real walk theough history",
          "Went today (Wednesday 26th September 2018), and found the place really interesting. I did not know that much about the different awards allocated or even how they decide who wins. This museum told us all about it, and when it was started, and who founded the award. We also got",
          "Being in Stockholm's Stortorget area, we visited the Nobel Museum. It was incredible to read about Nobel, his achievement and his will to create this Nobel awards from his fortune. The Nobel Museum showcases information about the Nobel Prize and Nobel prizewinners, as well as",
          "Really interesting museum in beautiful square surrounded by cafes in the old town. Went on the guided tour. (Included in the price of the ticket). Portable chairs provided - thank you. Interactive info on Nobel prize winners + short films. You can write a comment on a",
          "When fully open, I suspect the museum is worthy of four or five stars. Unfortunately, during our visit much of the museum was closed for exhibit updating. The good news is that the admission charge was reduced by half. The exhibits and films we saw were first rate. Since",
          "Films, displays, interactive opportunities: what more could you want in a museum. The films were very well done, interesting, and educational. Could spend hours here but it would be easy to get information overload. The special display of the Literature Prize that included",
          "We went to watch one of the short films about a winner and ended up watching a dozen they were so interesting.",
          "You don\u2019t need much time, maybe an hour or so to visit. Not very big, but interesting historical facts.",
          "Not as big as we expected and they had some construction going on (discounted admission). We had an excellent English guided tour for 30 minutes that was very informative. Lear ed a lot from our guide and we would recomme d a short visit to others.",
          "A section of the museum was closed for renovation on the day I visited but I can only judge based on my experience. Another section was closed due to water damage. I found it quite dull. It was okay to look at the computer screens and read about previous Nobel laureates and",
          "The Nobel prize and what it represents is a significant cultural touchstone on a global scale. Visiting the museum to better understand the history of Nobel (he made his money from dynamite!) and the collection of photos etc from assorted recipients over the ages was relatively",
          "It's not full of objects to serve but there are lots of information about Nobel cerimony, history and about people who received Nobel prize.",
          "Unbeleveable, so many Nobel prize winners. A very well organized exhabition, with short movie on every winner- you culd spend hours there and not get borred.",
          ".....very interesting visit and you learn a lot albeit could maybe be a bit more interactive. But reommend",
          "I enjoyed this museum! It was a quick tour unless you want to read every word or listen to every recording. Some got a little boring after while. The flags in the ceiling were not moving when we were there , which would have been cool to see, because every winners name is on a",
          "We had a good visit here. The museum is not too big but there is a lot to read. We took the tour, which is maybe 30-40 minutes, and that was well done.Since the guide tells you so much you can just read what you want. It really was fascinating and lots of information that you",
          "Although a little more expensive than we would have expected, the Nobel museum was an enlightening experience. They run tours in both Swedish and English which was both informative and worthwhile. Although the museum is quite small, there were a lot of interesting artifacts",
          "Mainly many long pages of text so pointless calling itself a museum. Few artefacts. Nothing really dynamic or creative. I could have read this all online.",
          "The Noble Museum is located on the Stortorget, the main square in the Old Town, and admission is free with the Stockholm Card. The museum chronicles the history of the Noble Prize and the biographies of the winners. There is so much to see and learn about at the museum and",
          "we had this like everyone else in the cafe. why not, very delicious and you could sit on chairs signed by nobel laureates, an honour in its own right. the guided tour is frequently conducted, take it.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed this museum, more so because I\u2019m an economics teacher. They\u2019ve been very creative with the museum. I didn\u2019t have to wait at all to go in and the museum is quite small which makes the visit more memorable. There is a guided tour available and takes place at",
          "We had high hopes for this museum, but it was surprisingly small and light on content. While there were a few displays and a movie running about several Nobel winners most of the information within can be easily found on the internet. Overall we would recommend this be skipped",
          "It\u2019s pretty small and won\u2019t take long. The tour gave a good overview of Alfred Nobel and how the prizes are awarded. Interesting, but not earth shattering. The bistro is a lovely spot for lunch and very good value for a museum bistro.",
          "If you want to know about the history of the Nobel Prize winners, go. If not, its boring. The interior is nice. Good layout. Free wifi. Good facilities.",
          "We had high expectations and queued early to beat the rush. We found the first room about the life of Alfred Nobel very interesting but much of the remainder seemed a little chaotic. It was a little difficult to access the limited interactive displays dealing with the awards",
          "We visited while visiting the old town. Very inspiring to see all the stories of the people who have won the prize throughout history. I think it\u2019s worth visiting and everybody can learn something new here.",
          "Loved the Nobel Museum in Stockholm. We were there during an exhibition on rebellious literature from Nobel winners but the regular exhibits are very interesting also. Something for everyone- science, arts, etc. And wonderful architecture and design.",
          "One of the most interesting museums in Stockholm. You will learn all you wish for, and more, about the Nobel Prize. Great guides! Go to Stadsmissionen across the medeval square for a coffee, with a cause, after.",
          "Visiting the Noble Museum is like meeting all the Nobel laureates at one place and getting inspired from their work. You can see a lot of things which have been used by these la",
          "Really lacking a lot of things. There should be a room for every category of the Nobel prize. The information is interactive, which is good, but it\u2019s not really appealing... Also the museum is quite small so it gets crowded.",
          "We enjoy the museum a lot. We also liked the temporary exibition, But What was the best was free english tour. I can recomend It!",
          "Just go to this museum. Take the English guided tour which is free. It is fascinating. Dont miss it.",
          "...but it isn't yet. It's OK. The reason for my title is it's going to move to a larger location and you can see the proposed new building. The museum is located bang in the heart of Gamla Stan and therefore is very visited. There were several tour groups going round when I went",
          "This museum has logos of the medals given in all the categories of nobel prizes. This has history of all the awards and for what they have been given. Plays few short stories about the nobel prize winners from generations. Of all, the most interesting thing for me was the",
          "I expected it to be bigger... nice place though. The toilets were out of order and we got our tickets half price",
          "Push to the front of the english language tour. The guide has a lot of good information and they deserve your full attention. They are hoping to move to a new location but that move is years away.",
          "My husband and I made a quick visit to the Nobel Museum as part of our Stockholm pass. Located in the heart of The Gamla Stan in Storetorget, this little gem of a museum is a detailed tribute to the history of the Nobel prize and the illustrious winners associated with this",
          "Although the placement of this museum seems strange (right in the middle of the Old Town), it's definitely worth seeing (and I'd suggest joining one of the free tours as well). The Nobel Prize is so well known, so prestigious and famous: couldn't imagine passing up a chance to",
          "The Nobel Museum was on my List to see while in Stockholm. It didn't disappoint. The Museum shows who Alfred Nobel was and why he started the Award. How and where he got the money to fund the Museum. I really enjoyed seeing all of Peoples Pictures hanging from the Ceiling. Each",
          "To be fair we only went in as my partner wanted to see the museum. We joined the English tour but both found it a bit dry, it was also quite hot in the museum. We left discreetly half way through the tour. On the upside, they had folding stools for tired travellers, and I'm",
          "The Nobel Museum is about the Nobel Prize and it's winners. The exhibition mainly consists of objects donated by Nobel Prize winners and I felt that the museum could have done more to draw out the interesting stories behind some of those winners. They also have a section of",
          "This museum is definitely not worth the admission. It is very small and does not offer much of an exhibition. It is mostly pictures of the noble laureates with text describing their field. All in all, you are better off just googling or reading a book/magazine about them. They",
          "What a hidden jewel full of information and steeped with history. You could spend 1 hour or the whole day going through the whole place in detail. A ceiling track runs throughout the museum with pictures of all the recipients of the Nobel prize. You can hear the tour for free",
          "Check for times. This is the BEST changing of the guard we have ever seen. Mostly because of the marching band on horseback! Never seen anything like this. Only done once a day. We really enjoyed the Palace. It compares well with other one s we have seen, but it was not",
          "It's probably one of the smallest Museum, without the guided tour it will not take more than 20 minutes. very little exhibits as well. If you do go make sure you do the guided (Free) Tour",
          "This is a very worthwhile experience. But the museum is too small that makes it\u2019s kind of a 2nd rate museum. The museum will be incredible when it moves into its new location",
          "They are not making the most of this museum. Needs inspiration to draw out the fascinating lives. Presentation is dull.",
          "This is a fascinating place. After walking in, the first thing to do is look up at the ceiling which has a cable that slowing turns depicting all the Nobel Laureates, with their citations. There are so many interesting stories shown, some that you will be surprised to read.",
          "A great exhibit if you appreciate the history and reason of noble awards . Great display and very interactive, with all the recipients. Lots to read if you wish . Really interesting and great shop !",
          "Having heard so many things about nobel laureates, this museum offers the opportunity to learn more about their work and lives.",
          "This is a well done museum with a lot of interesting material, but you'll need to spend time reading and examining the exhibits. There is a movie theater with short films on various Nobel prize winners, and I could have sat there all day watching these well-made and fascinating",
          "Visited the Nobel Museum while wandering around the Old Town. Joined a guided tour in english. Very informative, interesting and fun. The tourguide did a great job. She was lively and fun, but still learned alot of facts from her. Spent some time before and after the tour",
          "My family and I visited the Nobel Museum, which is on the Stockholm Pass. If you visit this museum, plan to spend some time to watch the videos. The museum has a small room with exhibits on certain winners, and touch screens that allow you to learn about every winner of every",
          "This museum is dedicated to the man and the \u201cprize\u201d that he started. Very interesting with a lot of history and information. This will take you a bit of time to walk through especially if you are going to read a lot. But worth it if you are interested in the Nobel peace",
          "The history of the winners of the Nobel is reviewed here. The Nobel prizes are awarded in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is given in Norway. There is an interesting movie on Martin Luther King and Marie Curie. The museum has collected articles associated with each",
          "Recommend a visit and take the English tour where they\u2019ll immerse you in the history of the Nobel Peace Prize, its founder, and those who\u2019ve received it. Of interest is when Norway and Sweden split, Norway retained the Nobel Peace Prize while Sweden retained the other",
          "Such a subject! Such a mediocre execution!! (the Dalai Lama's glasses are uninteresting). The exhibits are too small for the number of visitors. Two small movie theaters after the entrance. Go straight to the one on the right.",
          "Nobel Museum catered to my 2 loves : books and medicine! So many incredible things to see. First vials of insulin and penicillin! World changers!",
          "I wouldn\u2019t recommend this museum as somewhere to visit. It was very hot, and there was little air conditioning. The rooms were quite small, and they got crowded easily. It felt like the museum was lacking some basic information. And we left with more questions then we arrived",
          "A museum filled with history, exhibits and other memorabilia about Nobel , founder of the Nobel prize and the history related to it. Tours, films and other information is available for pubic and tourists. There is a restaurant for lunch and shop for souvenirs. It is located",
          "I so loved this City, full of culture, lovely places to visit, and although not the cheapest city Ive visited it really is worth exploring as you come across palces like this - a great museum.",
          "The Nobel museum as it stands nowadays, prepared as a temporary exhibition, has not impressive exhibits. It has though a guided tour of outstanding quality. The young lady, who offered us the tour, was excellent! She was fluent in English, and made an informative, comprehensive",
          "The Nobel Museum is located in a very picturesque and busy plaza in Old Town close to the Royal Palace. This museum can be visited in a short amount of time, 1-2 hours, since it is so small and all on one floor. We took advantage of the guided tour that is included with the",
          "I didn\u2019t know what to expect but was pleasant surprised. A lot of multimedia, interactives, tour, exhibits. I spent a long time here and walked away inspired!",
          "They have a guided tour every hour which is super informative. The price of the tour is included in the ticket price so there is no additional charge. The museum is a great insight into the life of Alfred nobel and also houses artefacts donated by the prize winners. The cafe has",
          "We loved learning about Arnold Nobel and the origins of the Nobel Prize. The films were educational and we were inspired by all the stories of the Nobel Prize winners throughout history. It's worth a visit!",
          "The Nobel museum is a museum which tells the history of the Nobel prize. It is situated in Stockholm's old town close to the castle. The museum itself is pretty small with a nice caf\u00e9. Different laureats have signed the bottom of some chairs in the caf\u00e9, they are indicated with",
          "I was really looking forward to visiting this place, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. Due to its small size, there are not that many things on display. Also I think some things could be presented in a more interesting and fun manner. My teenagers dragged us out of there",
          "With little prior knowledge about the Nobel prizes and prizewinners, I had a fascinating afternoon. I loved the displays, and it left me with enthusiasm to go and find out more; especially regarding the literature prizewinners. The cake and coffees were excellent too.",
          "I really enjoyed all this place had to offer. There was a small theater that played information about some of the Nobel laureates. We had the famous ice cream dessert in the cafe. Great fun!",
          "It is definitely worthwhile to see but a lot of attention is paid to the literature winners and a lot of it is just reading computer screens which I can frankly do from home.",
          "If you are new to the Nobel prize and the previous winners, categories, etc... then by all means you should come here. It is fascinating. If you are well read on the Nobel prize and familiar with the Nobel family I think it is a toss up whether its worth it. Outside of the",
          "There is so much information on hand but very difficult to find someone you are interested in. I couldn\u2019t find anyone specific unfortunately as there were people I wanted to read have to take what you get so much room for improvement. The guided tour, actually a stationary",
          "We, fortuitously arrived at a good time, only 10 minutes early for an English guided tour, the young lady was very competent and could answer all questions thrown at her. The Museum covers a lot of background information about Alfred Nobel - did he write his will to give his",
          "There was a line of display machines each dealing with a different decade and different category of award. That was enjoyable. However, I could not find Albert Einstein who won the award in 1922. Maybe I just missed it",
          "A good museum, would recommend for 17 year old and under as this is \u2018student age\u2019 and we had free entry! Great gift shop but expensive. Loved the nobel literature section towards back of the museum - after having visited I purchased 2 of the nobel winning books. A nice tour was",
          "The old stock exchange building where the museum is located adds quite a bit of ambiance to the museum. The exhibition is not large but has a few interesting bits - Additional the guided tour included a few entertaining anecdotes. It was well worth it spending an hour here.",
          "A very interesting place! Also for the kids. Lots of new facts to learn! Plus on a rainy day in the Old Town , a splendid place to hide away from the rain",
          "The story is interesting, but the exhibits and audio-visuals are outdated. There are large gaps in the stories of the various Nobel Prizes awardees. It is difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Prizes.",
          "To begin with, the museum was too small. And with the crowds, the entire visit was not pleasing as you try to read whatever bits and pieces of information you can while squeezing. Information was presented in randoms and there was no structure. To be honest, it felt like a",
          "Loved this exhibition. The English speaking tour guide was the most professional I have ever seen or heard and I have been to a lot of Museums! She was informative, well paced and managed the group very well! The place itself was amazing and clearly designed to get everyone",
          "The Nobel Museum is actually quite modest in scope and size. Do not expect fancy bells and whistles and interactive displays. I would guess that you can view a small display on every one of the past winners. The museum simply gives you a perspective on the men and women who",
          "I see this institution has attracted a range of quite mixed reviews but, so far as I am concerned it was excellent. The museum is not too big but is well set out with a variety of displays, some static, some interactive. It traces and explains the history of the Nobel prizes",
          "You can have the three stooges The prize loses its value. When you put people in that haven\u2019t done anything. Everything at al gore predicted never happen. Everything Obama was supposed to do never happen. Jimmy carter it did help peace prize",
          "What a disappointment! This was one museum I was really looking forward to. Before I came to Stockholm I went to the Nobel PEACE Museum in Oslo which has very interesting exhibits. I was expecting the same at this Stockholm location for the other prizes. I was wrong. There is",
          "Went to visit and regret not taking the tour. Every winner is honored here. Interactive and interesting.",
          "If you have free access with the Stockholm pass go in here to see just how poor a museum can be. If you have to pay then go and spend your money elsewhere. This is a tiny museum with exhibits that are unbelievably poor given the richness of the history. There are a series of",
          "This museum is not to be missed if in Stockholm. It is well thought through and well displayed. One could spend a half day and not exhaust the available information. Anyone interested in physics, chemistry, and medicine should be well pleased with the presentation on information.",
          "This is a very informative museum. Although not very large it has great information. Wait for the free tour guide, because ours dispensed a great deal of added information. We also took the time to find the chair signed by Barack Obama.",
          "This is my second time I\u2019ve visited this museum In Stockholm and I have also visited the Nobel peace Prize Museum in Oslo Norway- if interested see that review to. However this museum is located in Gamla Stan which is the old town and very historic and filled with charm it is",
          "Clearly this is a museum with a difference. Most museums are meant to inspire and educate. The Nobel Museum does it at a higher level. The Nobel Prize is known widely across the world and is aspirational for cultures around the world. The museum does not disappoint. It",
          "Very informative, but no hands on exhibits and only limited interactive experiences. Total \u201ctour\u201d limited to a first floor display of all Nobel Laureates and short bios of each.",
          "I did not enjoy the museum. It was laid out poorly. A lot of the information and artifacts were on Nobel prizes for literature and artifacts of those who won Nobel prizes. I am glad we had the Stockholm pass and didn\u2019t have to technically pay to enter. Would definitely skip in",
          "The Nobel Museum is well worth visiting if you have even the slightest interest in the history of the Nobel Prize. Almost all signage is in both Swedish and English, and there are many exhibits, photos and historical captions. The museum is an easy 5 - 10 walk from the Metro",
          "Be sure to take one of the docent led guided tours, as it makes the museum visit much more interesting. Also, don\u2019t miss looking under the chairs in the Museum Cafe ...they are signed by Nobel Prize Winners.",
          "This museum is very informative. It has interactive style displays not only about all the Nobel prize winners but also about Alfred Nobel.",
          "If you wish to spend some hours to read everything and event take a book and read it while visiting the Nobel Museum, it is possible. Unfortunately, we had only about an hour and a half to browse through it and look only for the things we were especially interested in.",
          "The whole museum is rather small and doesn\u2019t leave any lasting impression. I personally think they could have done so much more and I am not sure what is the reason that the whole exhibition is so amateur. You have a free access to the audio guide through their website and I",
          "We went because we wanted our kids to do something more than just fun or cultural on this trip. We got more than expected with a great series of short films about various prize winners, an easy to navigate museum and a 30 minute tour that was concise and interesting. Funny",
          "We thought that as we were in Stockholm we couldnt really not visit the Nobel Museum.The guided tour was well done but as everything in Stockholm the price was over the top.What an expensive city.I tried to find out what the wages were like but everyone just said they are",
          "The Museum is fairly small but fascinating. It is right in the middle of Gamla Stan. Discount rate for seniors. The excellent tour guide was very informative and his explanations of the history and the processes of the Nobel Prize awards was very interesting.",
          "The museum is very small. And it cost a lot for the time I spent. I was in and out in about 30 minutes. Some of the things were interesting but not a lot. At least to me. I think you have to really be into who won the award to enjoy this. If you have a casual interest you",
          "Interesting look into the Nobel prizes. Audioguides, guided tours, videos, and smart phone apps all aid you in your walk throughout the museum. Students discounts offered. Small museum but interesting! Definitely worth ducking into.",
          "Do the free tour if you can. Our guide was fantastic, and with her stories, made the museum exhibits so much more meaningful. Really recommend a visit.",
          "Hardly a museum - the space is small and doesn't hold much information that you couldn't find online. The content was not organized in a digestible way and looked to be thrown together by a few interns. At least make the museum free or heavily discounted if your patrons will",
          "A number of Nobel Laureates and their visions are reflected in unique objects and films. Here, we learnt of how courage, fortitude, perseverance, curiosity and hard work resulted in rich rewards. The daily guided tour takes one all the way from an idea to the Nobel Banquet. Do",
          "We spent about 90 minutes at the museum. Free WiFi and a very good audio tour is available by signing on to museum\u2019s web site with your smart phone. They have a few headsets so it\u2019s a good idea to bring your own.. Lots of places to sit and all displays are located on one",
          "We really enjoyed this small museum. It was located right by the Royal Palace, and there was plenty of good food in the square that this opens out to. It's also centrally located to 3 excellent shopping avenues. The entrance fee was fair--we paid about $25 for 2 people,",

          "I don\u2019t know quite what I expected but it was a bit disappointing. The museum is actually quite small and there isn\u2019t too much to show. I did learn a few things about Noble - but could have done the on Google. If you have limited time - give it a miss and head for the Vasa",
          "The Nobel museum round out any. Is it to Stockholm. I just thought it as very dumbed down. Nobel did so much that more than one room could have been dedicated to him. The largest portion is the book collection. My teenager loved all the interactive displays.",
          "This museum is a real gem, whatever your interests. You can learn about Alfred Nobel, the Prize and how laureates are chosen. You can learn about each laureate and hear them in their own words. There are many fascinating artifacts on display. We are both biolgists and loved to",

          "This is a very small museum - I saw everything in 20 minutes. There is a small area mentioning the current Nobel winners. Then there is a section where winners are grouped by decades. This is so small that only one person can view a decade at one time. There is a large",
          "Due to the day after the Stockholm Marathon, the museum was packed even on a Sunday. We entered and took a look, and even grabbed a brochure for the museum, but just too many folks filling the spaces we could see. We at least had the opportunity to at least visit for a glimpse,",

          "The building itself is gorgeous but in general the museum is disappointing. Very limited content for the high entry price - the space is cramped and there are lots of people - if fact the displays are mostly crowded out by the guided tour groups. Strong pass - go to the peace",

          "The place does not quite work. The space does not flow. The story is all over the place and it\u2019s not quite sure what it is. This is surprising given the quality of the material. Apparently it is moving let\u2019s hope it does it better. Still worth a visit.",
          "It was not aligned with my expectations: few explanations available, no chance to have a better perception of why some scientists have been rewarded with the Nobel prize! At the end there is only the story of Alfred Nobel and the list of all the winners! They could build much",
          "This museum is right in the center of the Old Town. I enjoyed the way in which the presentation was set up, and the technology to present the information.",
          "There is such a rich vein of history and human achievement untapped in this museum. There are some clever touches, but it is small and sadly lacking in coherence. More could be made of video of the winners of recent times and more to contextualise the achievements especially",
          "Interesting museum and lots to read about the laureates, however museum is small. Hard to spend more than 1.5 hours",
          "We went there 16:45 and it was closing. They closes 17:00. So we didn't have chance to go around. It was my only night in Stockholm, so we had a photo outside and by receptionist and had to leave, unfortunately. Next time must see it. If you are planning to visit please at",
          "The Museum is nice, with good structure and location, but I dont see the point of only names of people who won the Nobel prize. If you want to know it you can google it. In my opinion its just something to take people money.",

          "I've seen a lot of museums really, but this is seriously one of the best I've ever visited. The guide is really good and you can do a lot of things there. Like I said in the title it's a museum for young and old. I would surely recommend to visit the museum.",

          "Such museums are league apart! One of the best museum in true sense. It has the origins, stories, artifacts, videos, you name it and you have it there. On top of it, there is the old market tight infront of the museum. Awesome!",
          "This museum quite rightly gives you insight into how the Nobel prized started (Nobel discovered Gelignite amongst other things) and who has won and why they won. It is intriguing and shows what a variety of people have been rewarded.",

          "We visited with the children and it was very rewarding for them. For the kids, there was a quick questionnaire that rewards them with a chocolate coin. Nicely designed and good layout. The museum is at the stortorget (great market) so you can\u2019t miss it.",
          "The entrance fee is SEK120, there really is not much to see. It\u2019s a very \u201cyoung\u201d and small museum. If I had not joined the guided tour which was informative, I would have felt that it was a bit of waste of money. The way they display every Nobel laureate is rather creative, due",
          "Due to a variety of odd circumstances this is the only museum we ended up visiting during our 2 days in Stockholm, and I really wished I had enjoyed it more. There\u2019s nothing I disliked, per se, but I was not as wowed as I hoped to be. Maybe one needed to be more familiar with",

          "How will you miss the opportunity to visit the Nobel Museum if you are at the city where the Nobel takes place? Do not miss it. It gives a very interactive way of learning about Alfred Nobel's life and the contributions of so many Nobel laureates. Very interesting and rich",

          "We were excited to see this museum, but agree that it was not as good as expected. This was my second time, but the first for my sister and her husband. I thought it was better than my first visit (less than a year prior) as they changed the exhibit to a more interesting and",
          "This museum offered a great opportunity to better understand the Nobel Prize, the reason for its existence, and the history of its recipients. I recommend setting aside 2 hours, or if you\u2019re really interested in this subject you could spend up to 3 hours watching all the looped",
          "This was fascinating and definitely worth touring. Our guide was excellent and made our group even MORE interested in the history and current activities of the Nobel prize and its recipients. Definitely recommended.",
          "Quite boring to be honest - especially for the high price that was paid to get in. You can literally see everything within 15 - 20 min. Nothing to talk about and would not recommend as it was a waste of time",
          "We knew nothing about the Nobel Prize and left with a fair bit of knowledge so I would say this tour was a success! The tour is free and runs a few times a day, check times on their website. If you visit the museum without the tour you won\u2019t get the most out of it. Our tour",

          "This was my girlfriend's choice visit. To be honest, I really had no prior interest and minor knowledge about the Nobels. This visit changed that and I learnt plenty concerning the awards and those who were given them. The museum is not the biggest museum but it is extremely",
          "I felt so honoured just being there. This place is packed with information on all the Novel laureates to-date along with data on how the winners are actually selected. I went on a free guided tour which is really useful if you want to understand this process better. They have a",

          "Getting into this museum was a very bad choice, we invested time and money in a museum that should show the best of our age but makes you loose your interest about this place. Indeed, we forced ourselves to stay after 45 minutes searching for something interesting. The",
          "Very interesting museum, with a lot of videos and illustration to know all the history of Who, Why, When people had received this award through history. It worth a stop by during your trip in Stockholm. Tuesdays 17-20h is free entrance if I remember correctly.",
          "We were surprised that such a small museum cost so much. It was 80SEK for students and seniors. It was small and the exhibits were crowded together. The short films about some of the Nobel Prize winners were interesting. The exhibits were more informational than inspiring.",
          "In the Former Stock Exchange Building on the site of the original town hall, on the ground floor, the Nobel Museum currently resides. We were told plans were in the works to change to location of the Nobel Museum as it is out of space. - check on-line before you travel! The",

          "This museum is an interesting insight not only to the Nobel institute but the recipients of the prizes and Alfred Nobel himself. You may find some of the detail a bit to in depth but it is for you to decide how much you want from the museum. Can definitely recommend a visit.",
          "This museum had gotten such mixed reviews on TA that we didn't know what to expect. However, my husband and I thought it was fascinating. We joined a free tour in English. The guide was excellent, and told some wonderful anecdotes about the recipients over the years. I",
          "Fascinating displays very clearly set out and also everything in English. Easily spent 2 hours here. Film clips fascinating.",
          "Sorry, but this museum is just not that interesting. Not worth the price of admission. The displays are overwhelming, and difficult to understand. The wi-fi is great in here and there are comfortable chairs to relax in.",

          "Entry costs 120 Swedish Krone which seems quite a lot - but I think it was good value. There aren't that many exhibits, but that means you can see everything within a two hour visit. I'd recommend two things - find out the times of the free tour and take it. The guide was",

          "This ended up being one of the highlights of our trip. We started with a guided tour (free), which was worth the time as we heard some interesting stories, and key information. Then we wandered, each at our own pace, reading about Nobel prizewinners and their work through the",

          "There is really nothing much to see here and the fee is quite high. The inside seems flashy and one gets the impression there is a lot to see. There is a lot to read at the interactive stations, but nothing more than one could google at home. Given the number of guests the",

          "It was a small museum but very interesting, informative, educational and historical review of Nobel's life and accomplishments. We listened to the free tour guide in English. Loved visiting this modest museum and having a guided tour. There was a construction during our visit.",
          "It seemed like we needed to go being right there. It was mostly about literature prize winners, but there were other displays and lots of information about other winners. I'm not sorry I went, but I don't think it is a must. I enjoyed some of the short film clips about winners",
          "This was my second time at the museum and was disappointed it is under renovation and construction. I am sure it will be wonderful when they conclude the work.",

          "We took this tour as part of a day tour of Stockholm. To be honest this sort of tour is not my cup of tea. Go if your interested in architecture and the building process but I'd rather a hot chocolate somewhere else.",
          "If you have an hour to spare while visiting Stockholm, go to this museum. It's very small, but it has some interesting things from Nobel Prize winners, like the letter Einstein sent to the Nobel Committee written from the Japanese ship he was traveling at that time.",
          "I visited here by chance whilst overnighting in Stockholm. The museum is small and the tour probably takes about 40 minutes but i strongly recommend you go in. I think admission with the tour for us was about \u00a312 each and it is so worth it. Cannot recommend enough.",
          "There are pictures and interactive stations where you can look up the various prize winners. But do not miss the 4 minute video clips on the different awardees, covering all fields. We thought we would watch a few and ended up sitting there for an hour or little more. The",
          "I enjoyed watching the short films available and how interactive the displays were. It is clear that no one knows the answer though, as to why Alfred Nobel chose to host the Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo. Having just come from Oslo, our bike tour guide there said it was because",
          "Unfortunately, there are renos happening at the Nobel Museum so we only got to see a small portion of it. What we saw was impressive. The museum charged a reduced price since it wasn't totally accessible.",

          "Maybe it was not the best option to visit when travelling with children below the ten. But it was hard to visit Stockholm without giving this museum a chance. Certainly it was very interesting and anyone can spend there many hours, but at the end it might look like a lot of",
          "Four stars for the free guided talk on the free Tuesday evening 5-8pm..highly entertaining and informative. Wouldn't think you'd get as much from a visit without it, being a somewhat cramped interior with many displays and lots of visitors..it's moving to a much bigger 4-floor",
          "Definitely a must see museum for nourishing your inner nerd! Want to learn the story behind A. Nobel? Or he researchers that set out to cure childhood leukemia and launched the 1st class of chemotherapy drugs? Excellent presentations in a very historic setting. A must see!",

          "It's not large but you come here not to be impressed by its size but by the magnitude of the accomplishments of past Nobel Prize winners. It puts in perspective that leaders in thought and in humanitarian missions come from across the world. Take the time to absorb what a",

          "They were changing one of the exhibitions, but anywhere, it seems small. Altough it has a good explanation with the audioguide that you can scan with your phone at the entrance. Also it was quite interesting to see some of the things that won the nobel prize.",
          "A visit to the Nobel Museum enriches our general knowledge of the world we live in; i.e. the contributions you many have made to improve the quality of life for mankind, both in the advances in medicine and science generally, but also by putting in serious efforts to encourage",
          "Nice, small museum dealing with a really interesting and fascinating topic. We did join the official tour but background noise made it difficult to hear what was said. There are a small number of interesting displays that warrant spending time on. We also spent at least 30",
          "This is a small museum but the fun is seeing the short video clips about remarkable Nobel prize winners. Each laureate is asked to donate a personal item to the museum and the eclectic collection gives some insight into the personality of the donor.",
          "What a great experience. Loved the way the exhibits for the Nobel prize winners have audio stations along with the photos and biographies. The museum is in the old town so easy to walk to from the city center. Nice gift store with lots of books and educational gifts for kids.",
          "A part of the museum was closed when I went there, but it was therefore cheaper and still worth the while! They show short videos of the nobel laureartes in a dark room which are very interesting. And the tour is also worth it, they tell you stories about the different",
          "Though the museum is small, I loved the exhibits and the info an all the past laureates as well as Alfred Nobel himself. Everything is digital so you can skim through the decades learning about the people and their contributions easily. I easily spent 2 hours there and could",
          "When I came to Stockholm, I put this as one of the must sees. Once inside, it's a very small museum with some permanent interactive displays of the award process, an overhead conveyor belt of flyers carrying the names of the award winners and what they won their award for.",
          "All my kids easily spent 2 hours here. Reading exhibits, watching films and checking out interactive exhibits. It is all presented in interesting way. I would recommend to all. Must visit for Stockholm.",
          "Didn't have long as we came at the end of the free entry Tuesday session. It was very humbling seeing all these great people and their contributions to humanity. Imaginatively presented but probably wouldn't appeal to youngsters who would not recognise most of the names (unless",

          "Very informative and interesting",
          "The shop is worth it as there are many great books to buy, otherwise overestimated. On the other hand some times there are occasional exhibitions which are really interesting such as the Martin Luther King exhibition etc.",
          "If you\u2019re going to Stockholm, it makes sense to visit the Nobel Museum!\n\nThe museum is full of first hand insights, rare information and artefacts donated by recipients of the prizes. \n\nHowever, I found that, upon entering the museum, there \u2026",

          "The museum is quite small but still worth a visit to understand more about Alfred Nobel and the history of the Novel Prize and about the laureates. It's interesting to see the laureates' donated items to the museum to see what they meant to \u2026",
          "Not too much said about from locals. Also on the tourist map. Deserves more attention.",
          "I would say that this museum is a must place to visit. Extremely interesting. It even has a copy of Charles Darwin's book Origin of Species",
          "Guides were good who were explaining very well. \nVideo assistance was quite apprehending.\n\nMartin Luther king(was on the focus on that time in museum) - explained very well about him and his original live speech(audio) was very motivating.\n\nVery good experience.",
          "Great place, a little small. Definitely go when there is a tour. It will bring the purpose of the museum to life and make sure to stop on the cafe to sit on a chair signed by winner's of the prize",
          "This place is amazing. The work they have done is quite something and the exhibition reflects it well. They had civil rights exhibition on when we visited which was also very high quality. Well worth a visit.",
          "This museum is in many ways a summary of the best of humanity in the 20th-21st century. The Nobel Prize is a cultural icon, and to see the winners throughout the last century with summaries of their achievements was inspiring.",
          "Located in the iconic Gamla Stan, the Nobel museum is free for children up to 17.  The place was surprisingly small - only one floor and mostly dedicated to Martin Luther King.  What makes this place fun is the search game.",
          "Theres nothing special, most of the info can be found online",
          "Excellent explanation on each displayed Nobel prize.",
          "The primary exhibition here currently is based around Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights movement. You can watch the \"I have a dream\" speech on screen and also his acceptance speech when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\nAn unusual \u2026",

          "a real inspirational place of the nobles....must visit...",
          "A must visit while you are in Stockholm...especially for the knowledge it imparts for various nobel awardees and their achievements",
          "Visiting this museum was one of my top highlights of Stockholm. I ended up spending over 3 hours here! Definitely join one of the free tours they have to walk you through Nobel and his life. It\u2019s very inspirational walking around and \u2026",
          "This museum is worth its price just for the video about the Nobel Prize winners. But the rest is also very interesting.",
          "It's not so easy to find in the back streets of Gamla Stan where the GPS doesn't work so well in the narrow streets, but the museum itself is beautifully presented, currently with a great exhibition on Martin Luther King. It is also included in the Stockholm city pass list of free attractions if you have that ticket",
          "We visited in Nobel Calling weekend where entrance was free, so it was a very crowded place with appearently not much to do. The Nobel film and the rooms designed for children were the highlights, but other than that it was mainly reading things of screens.",
          "There are video systems probably 10 mins long and you can view all the novel prize winners list. It will take 45 mins to visit the museum.",
          "This is a must see if you believe yourself to be a man or woman of culture.",
          "Despite is a small museum, it really inspiring. Strongly recommend to enroll the guided tour as it offers some insights that beyond the exhibition. Do prepare to spend at least an hour if you wish to cover most. The staff and the guide is pretty knowledgeable. Enjoy the video installation if possible.",
          "A little overwhelmed, unclear where to begin and which direction to follow. I ended up staying in the documentary film room and watched most of the Nobel Prize winners film series. Overall good experience.",
          "Had a good guide!",
          "Very educational museum! They have several tours in English during the day.",
          "It is a small museum, but very nice. A lot activities and fun things to do. There are stories about Nobel prizes winners and a lot of informations about prize itself, winners and their discoveries and contributions. Recommendations for visiting \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Very interesting, an easy museum with donastions from many leaurats. A must when you visit Stockholm.",
          "Really cool. Arrive in time to take the 30ish minute guided tour. Some really amazing short films about the Nobel winners and some really cool objects that have been donated by the winners. Small place but enough.",
          "Was expeting to see much more that just info boards and a few instalations for kids to play with.",
          "Very good Information about the Nobel Prize, its founder, its Background and its laureates.",
          "Great place to spend a few hours in the heart of Gamla St\u00e5n.  Kids get a scavenger hunt type quiz, and a chocolate Nobel medal if they complete it.  Martin Luther King happened to be featured when we visited so it was nice to see a little reminder of home.",

          "Small place but inspirational.  Showing the best of humanity.  A rare sight these days.",
          "Great, you can spend all afternoon there if you are into science. Plus the guide for the short tour is excellent (I would have appreciated if it was a bit longer)",
          "First, it is located on the most famous square in the city \u2013 Stortorget, the one where everyone takes photos with colorful houses. In addition to the stationary exhibition about the prize and the winners, you can always see a temporary \u2026",
          "Smaller than expected but informative.",
          "A MUST visit in the World for the fellow travelers, one of its kind bank of intellect",
          "Inside of the museum you have a lot of great material.",
          "Inspiring location and one of the must visit place in Stockholm",

          "Many mementos of many noble winners including Amartya Sen's cycle inspired us",
          "Very nice and informative place. Guided tour is a must if you like to get most from the story behind the Nobel Prices.",
          "The tour was quite good and the museum really small. Most of the information were everywhere around and the structure was really nice. The only thing that I have to mention is the prize of the museum. 120S3K for such a small museum is really high.. Just for one time maybe is OK but there are plenty of museums which are much better.",
          "A great museum all about the Nobel Price and the Laureates. Many pictures and personal objects on display. A film about Alfred Nobel and one about various Nobel Price Laudeates. A special place and activites for children available.",
          "Underwhelming at best. Three stars are just for the nice gift shop.",
          "I like so much interaktive museum like here.",
          "Beautiful building, rich history, professional guides, pleasure to visit",
          "One of the most prestigious international awards given, how could you not want to learn about the history? The guided tour was informative and part of the entrance so do yourselves a favor and take it.  The exhibits are rotating so it's always good to pop your head in and see what's new.  Protip: look under the chairs in the cafe ;)",
          "Excellent museum, the Martin Luther king exhibit was sad,.poinent. guided tour was excellent. If they had an award for best museums,  this would win the Nobel prize.",
          "70% Martin Luther King exhibit, 29.99% a steal. Really not worth the time or money. Maybe fun for kids. Would not recommend.",
          "An interesting museum with a very animated tour guide showing us round. Not particularly extensive inside but a small collection of laureates artifacts and some nice explainer video clips.",
          "We liked it very much, it was also interesting to listen free guide tour.",
          "I really hope you don't have to be a geek to love this place as much as I did.",
          "A nice size - you can get round it without being mentally exhausted! A bit of background on the Nobel prizes and snippets about the laureates and a few exhibits. I found it quite interesting; others might not. There is an audio guide - it \u2026",

          "Really disappointed with this one. Essentially a Martin Luther King museum, much better sights to see in Stockholm",

          "Truly awesome. Lovely learning about the recipients and history of the Nobel Prize. The Martin Luther King exhibition was detailed and informative.",

          "Be reminded and inspired by our fellow humans!\n\nYou sometimes forget the game changing contributions made by the award winners. Let this museum remind you about dynamite, penicillin, and other momentous technological and medical \u2026",
          "Great place for young and adult visitors. Interactive surrounding gives lots of fun.",
          "A good place to visit and know about Nobel prize and laureates. Very small in size though. Takes approximately 1-1.5 hours to complete. Free guided tours available at different timings.",
          "Visited the museum and the temporary exhibits happened to be Martin Luther King Jr. What are the chances? Haha. The museum is extremely well designed and there are a decent sized area for children as well. \n\nThe highlight is the staff. That \u2026",
          "Fascinating museum dedicated to human achievements from all around the world. It is unique in its outlook in that while Alfred Nobel was Swedish his prizes are handed out to people all around the world. It's where they celebrate the best of human nature.",
          "I was quite pessimistic about exhibitions in this museum. However, it impressed a lot. Waking through it you understand how important were all those discoveries for entire world!! Totally recommended to visit \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

          "Nice exposition with some cool interactive elements",
          "There\u2019s no much thing that you can\u2019t google... The price is too high for what it offers, it\u2019s not worth it. If you have limited time in the city, you should give other museums a try...",
          "Great inspiring place to visit.",
          "I absolutely loved this place. It was very emotional and overwhelming to see the legacy of the greatest minds of mankind. The museum is very small and there is not a lot. There is a little shop inside the museum where you can purchase \u2026",
          "Such an interesting museum with a very informative guided tour and information video.",
          "The Nobel Museum is wonderful. The exhibits here are mostly for literature ,human rights and medicine. I was amazed to see so many of our writers books here - Nadine Gordimer, Doris Lessing, J.M Coetzee inter alia. There is also a treasure hunt to keep children entertained. It is an interactive museum and worth a visit.",
          "It is interesting museum, but price for enter is not corresponding. It was wasty time for me.",
          "Don't recommend it, boring, np good displays no good explanations. No good dynamics, bad proportions on the attention given to different novel subjects.",

          "Good one for the science lovers , the video showing the invention of Dynamite by Nobel is really nice",
          "If you find yourself in Stockholm you should visit this museum. It is interactive, it is inspiring, it is updated often and I could visit again and have just as good of an experience. You can breeze through in about 45 minutes if it isn't \u2026",
          "Museum leverages the cachet behind the Nobel prize to get folks in the door but fails to deliver a truly special experience. Many of the displays feel like one is reading Wikipedia on a bunch of fancy screens. The treatment of Nobel\u2019s life \u2026",

          "Great if you have a guide, really boring if you don't!",

          "Small museum jam-packed with information on the Nobel Prize history and recipients. There are many infoboards to read as well as stations with video and audio on headphones. There is a temporary exhibit on Martin Luther King, Jr. as well, \u2026",
          "An interesting idea - history and artifacts of the Nobel prize - but quite a small museum, and not worth the rather pricey 120 SEK adult admission.  Went through it slowly, and still saw everything in an hour.",

          "Learned a lot. Well worth an hour of your time or longer if you really want to watch the films in the cinema and read up on so many great people. The fact that it is a museum about people, thoughts and ideas made it refreshingly different.",

          "Very good museum. But in the summer it was very hot and there was no air conditioner in there.",

          "Serves as great introduction to the Nobel prize. The space is a bit restricted (considering the price). My other impression is that it\u2019s really just a museum for documentation, not the real place where the famous ceremony (concert hall) or \u2026",
          "Visited this lovely museum today alone. It is definitely one to tick off the wish list! The entrance was quick and free (special deal I believe) and the staff were quick to suggest the best way to see the whole museum, giving me a numbered \u2026",

          "I must say it was interesting. But I'd recommend visiting on Tuesdays because they offer the visit free of charge then. 120 SEK seems to me a lot for what's shown. It is only one level exhibition and you can do some experiments. Also for children kind of nice. ",

          "Nice, modern museum. I guess I wanted to be blown away by the museum as much as I would be by the award recipients' intellects, but that's not the case - quite a small amount of relatively simple displays / presentations really",
          "It's one of the must visit places at Stockholm. Very interesting design and building itself. Of course it's nice to find an info about Baku, Azerbaijan too, where Nobel brothers involved with oil industry. But it was a little information.",

          "Fascinating, recommend the guided tour and the short films!",
          "I would recommend going once they lower the admission price. It was a quick 30 minute museum for 16 kr. While it was entertaining in an informative sense, I would love to see more then just the one level of exhibits.",

          "Very interesting museum!",
          "Unique to this city",

          "It is interesting to learn about the history of the Nobel price. The exposition is not too big, but is quite educational so you have to know what you want to get to be happy about it. If it is information about the Noble prize - then this museum is worth the visit.",
          "Interesting exhibits.",

          "Really dissapointed about this one. Very small like a house and with few things to see. The price is nothing off limits but you dont see anything much besides 6 or 7 famous people that won the Nobel. It really needs some fresh renovations. Its located in a nice area by the way and has a good restaurant.cumps.",
          "Not a normal museum.  Small and tells the story of the nobel prize.  Take the guided tour and look at the winner progression hanging form the ceiling",

        "wiki": "Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde (Swedish for Cape Waldemar), is a museum located on Djurg\u00e5rden in central Stockholm.  The name is composed of Waldemar, an Old German noble male name, and udde, meaning cape. It is derived from a historical name of the island Djurg\u00e5rden, Valmunds\u00f6 (see History of Djurg\u00e5rden.)\nIt was the former home of the Swedish Prince Eugen, who discovered the place in 1892, when he rented a house there for a few days. Seven years later he bought the premises and had a new house designed by the architect Ferdinand Boberg, who also designed Rosenbad (the Prime Minister's Office and the Government Chancellery), and erected 1903\u20131904.\nPrince Eugen had been educated as a painter in Paris and after his death the house was converted to a museum of his own and others paintings. The prince died in 1947 and is buried by the beach close to the house.\nThe complex consists of a castle-like main building\u2014the Mansion\u2014completed in 1905, and the Gallery Building, added in 1913. The estate also includes the original manor-house building, known as the Old House and an old linseed mill, both dating back to the 1780s. The estate is set in parkland which features centuries-old oak trees and reflects the prince's interest for gardening and flower arrangement. The Art Nouveau interior, including the cocklestoves, by Boberg are designed in a Gustavian style and makes good use of both the panoramic view of the inlet to Stockholm and the light resulting from the elevated location of the building.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Stockholm\nCulture in Stockholm\n\n\n== References ==\nBengt O H Johansson (1999). \"Ytterstaden\".

          "There are really two parts to this museum. The first, and newer, part was devoted to a special exhibition. I found it quite interesting to see an in depth look at a female Swedish artist that I had never heard of. The other part of the museum is in Prins Eugens' villa. It",
          "The residence is lovely and the art gallery within has a good collection of artwork that was great to see. Even if you don\u2019t actually go into the residence it is worth having a walk around the exterior as there are some great statues, gardens and views to see.",

          "I like going to galleries and places that aren\u2019t necessarily the big crowded ones. This place was well worth visiiting for the opportunity to see both the house and the art. I walked out there from the centre of town - it is a long walk but flat - and got there just before it",
          "The tour guide suggested we go here. We were on our second day of dscovery when we decided to go visit Djurgarden Island. The islands are easy to get to. The day we went there was a temporary art exhibit. We ate at a nearby restaurant although I saw people ating on the grounds",
          "My favorite part of this museum was seeing the art in the setting for which it was meant. Prins Eugens' residence is lovely and the art is well-placed. Many of the rooms overlook the water and gardens, which are absolutely lovely. I wasn't fond of all of the paintings, but some",
          "Very nice place to visit! Great park with an extraordinary view and great cafe to have a break outside under the trees!!!",
          "Such a treat to discover this marvelous art museum and gardens on the far end of the beautiful Djursgaden island in Stockholm! My husband and I have been to Stockholm a half dozen times over the past decade and somehow had missed this treasure previously. Now it will be one of",

          "The museum is situated on a quiet place near the water in Djurgarden. It has a lot to offer. We enjoyed the Nordic Art exhibition and the temporary exhibition of works by Sigrid Hjerten. The mansion also has a lot of history, including a lot of paintings by Prince Eugen. Some of",
          "Out of the way but easy to get to on the #7 Tram, this house which has been converted into a museum is absolutely lovely. The home is full of art, many paintings done by Prince Eugens himself. They, and the work of other artists, are very good. The house itself in interesting",
          "At last I went to Waldemarsudde. You should go to. Beautiful interiors and garden, overlooking the water (Stadsg\u00e5rdskajen) and the boats to Helsinki and more. Always an art exhibition and nice shop. Have a coffee or a beer after, at the cafe close by.",
          "The museum is located in a beautiful place, there's quite a picturesque park around. The mansion itself has some nice interiors but the most important here is the collection itself. And now there's a temporary exhibition of Sigrid Hjert\u00e9n on display \u2013 definitely worth visiting!",
          "the walk from the tram stop is also interesting. We saw swans and their chicks as well as ducks and their young. Those animals were not particularly afraid of people nearby. Some of the aret I liked and some not. A woman's exhibition at first did not appeal tome. Her",
          "Arrived after 5pm, but the nice view and breeze makes it worth the walk there. First time seeing a gigantic cruise ship making a U-Turn near the park.",
          "This museum can easily be combined with Thiel Gallery. It takes about 30 minutes to walk from Waldemarsudde to Thiels. You can reach Waldemarsudde with tram no 7. There is lots to see in Waldemarsudde: there are the living quartiers of the \u201dart prince\u201d Eugen, a temporary",
          "Great exhibition, Sigrid Hjert\u00e9n. Beautiful paintings, tragically history. The house is just beautiful and such care with the flower arrangement. Loved everything, except the restaurant. No real selection of anything but sandwiches. Please upgrade this...and have some seating",
          "Beautiful genuine and interesting, good shop and well known cafe, popular site to visit for locals. A must do when in Stockholm, enjoy the beautiful garden and see how elegantly the painter prince Eugen furnished his home. See his paintings in Nationalmuseum. The flower pots in",
          "Just so good for anyone interested, not playing so cultural. I think everyone find something that tuch.",
          "The art didn\u2019t appeal to me but the furnished rooms were lovely. There is a nice cafe. The grounds are extensive.",
          "This was my first visit to Stockholm in 25 years. We ended up walking from the Vasa Museum out to Waldemarsudde. It was not a short walk, but doable. There is also a Tram that goes out there. (#7) I have always loved Prins Eugens art and the way his home has been preserved. It's",
          "As a stranger in Stockholm you probably arrive at Stockholm Central Railway Station. The easiest way to get to Valdemarsudde is to take the tram, so first thing first, go and get your transport ticket. If not already there go down to the cellar of the station and walk towards",
          "This is my favourite art museum in Stockholm. Situated on royal Djurg\u00e5rden with stunning views over the city ensure you take time to visit the garden and surrounding areas. The art gallery is predominately Swedish artists from the 18th and early 19th century, an era of",
          "Visiting the home of Prins Eugen on the southern part of Djurgarden gives you a great glimpse of 19 & 20th century Swedish history and art. The former home of Prince Eugen is a relaxing and inviting home blending art, gardening, and the beauty of a waterfront estate overlooking",

          "If you enjoy art and wish to get away from the madness of Tivoli, this is your place. The grounds are lovely and you can enjoy them without paying admission. There's even a garden cafe for those who wish to dine of fika. Should you enjoy art and grand old houses, please do",
          "This was the home of Prince Eugen starting in the 1800's. He was a gifted landscape artist. It is now a most wonderful art museum. Beautiful gadrens and many oak trees adorn the property.",
          "Went in to see the summer exhibition of arts. Then went to see the garden. There are many sculptures in the garden and liked the beautiful flowers",
          "This large house set in small grounds by the water is an excellent antidote to the noisy amusement park also on Djurgarden. Only half a dozen rooms are open downstairs in the house (hence the 4 stars rather than 5), but there are plenty of places to sit in the gardens",
          "Friends took us here to see the primary art exhibit and see the house. We enjoyed the art very much. It was an educational experience because we knew nothing of Swedish artists. However, over the years we have been to 100s of stately homes in France and the UK, so I would have",
          "Waldemarsudde was the private house of Prins Eugen. The first floor of the house is as it was when the prince was still in residence. It has a number of his paintings on the walls. It was a beautiful day and one could see why the prince chose this as the location of his",
          "Despite massive pressure from tourists and domestic visitors, one can get around in the spacious premises and take part in the exhibits. It's a little messy in the coffee shop and limited number of parking spaces but by the way top. Mixing between old and new among exhibitors",
          "As the National Gallery was closed until the Autumn I was keen to see good Swedish Painting, including Karl Larsson and was recommended this museum on the central island of Djurgarden. We took a ferry and tram from our hotel and as it was snowy our walk was quite magical. Prins",
          "The location of the place makes it a very special museum, it offers great views of the city and feels like one of this little hidden gems that you find by spending a bit more time exploring Stockholm. The temporary exhibitions are usually very original and interesting and it",
          "The location and home are beautiful and the art exhibits are first rate. A nice way to spend the morning",
          "This is not only a museum, it offers great views over stockholm. One can take a walk or just sit in the garden. I've been there many times to read, take a walk with my daughter, conversation with a friend, etc.",
          "especially if you have a couple of days to spend in the capital. Combine this with a walking tour around Djurg\u00e5rden.",

          "One of Stockholm's nicest art museum is Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde on the royal island of Djurg\u00e5rden with a marvellous views over the town and the water. There is a big park, the museum and a nice restaurant and coffee shop. There is a great permanent collection as well as",
          "See How the Prince Lived by touring his house, but the real joy here is the grounds. We walked over from the town centre and then around the beautifully landscaped grounds. A long walk past the Tivoli and the Abba museum, but the quiet was with it.",
          "We took the number 7 tram to the end of the line and it was a great ride with lovely properties to look at on the way to Waldemarsudde. The house and art collection of Prins Eugens was small but perfect. Well worth a visit!",
          "This is possibly the loveliest museum in Stockholm. The house itself is beautiful and both it and the galleries are full of fantastic paintings and objets d'art. If you visit on a nice day make sure to visit the pretty gardens for some lovely walks and great views of the city.",
          "We enjoy visiting home museums and look for them in our travels. This museum is unique in that it truly feels like a home. The Prince oversaw every detail of this, his dream home and studio. An accomplished artist in his own right, he surrounded himself with contemporary",
          "This is a lovely big mansion in a large, well kept, garden setting with water views. My husband went for a walk all around the property for an hour and enjoyed it very much. I went in to 'experience' the house, imagining what it was like to live and entertain back in the day.",
          "It was so impressive to see the Prince's paintings and learn about him. But there is also an impressive collection of Anders Zorn paintings and etchings. The gardens and grounds are lovely.",
          "The house and garden are simply beautiful - they designed in a special way - you don't realize you are in a museum - so special they are . The collection of paintings and sculptures is simply great . And - don't forget to enjoy the great view from the garden on Stockholm harbor.",
          "If small art museums interest you, you shouldn't miss the Waldemarsudde Museum. The paintings in the first few rooms in the permanent collection were stunning and beautifully displayed. I also enjoyed the current Anja Notini exhibition on the top floor. The lighting is so well",
          "This is a amazing place 'cause you can actually sit in the prince's kitchen and have you lunch. I was amazed to walk around in his home. It's a lovely place and a interesting prince who was a painter. The surroundings are very peaceful and there's a beautiful garden just by the",
          "This was on my must see list during my recent trip to Sweden. Prince Eugen was a gifted artist and his home is lovely. Royal history but also modern art exhibitions",
          "A visit to Waldemarsudde is always the highlight of our visit to Stockholm. We love the paintings of Prince Eugene and his contemporaries, and this is one of the most beautiful spots in Stockholm. This summer they have a wonderful exhibit of paintings from their collection,",
          "This spectacular home, on the island of Djurgarden, was built by Stockholm's painter Prince Eugene. He was fortunate to be a younger royal son with no obligation to produce an heir. So he performed royal duties, but mostly he painted and hobnobbed with his many artistic friends.",
          "This small villa on the water side is a gem of the mid-century interior decorations. depending on the temporary exhibit of art in the rest of the villa, the apartments are more or less worth while. However, a trip with the tram down Djurgarden alongside Skansen, Nordiska, Vasa,",
          "It is a very lovely place - beautiful rooms to admire, old clocks and books and different paintings.",
          "A lovely museum well worth a visit depending on what exhibitions they have. It is situated in lovely surroundings and they also have a decent restaurant. If you feel like a walk, you can walk to a more central part of Djurg\u00e5rden or even all the way back to central Stockholm.",

          "This nobleman and artist's house, art and gardens has a tidy little basement gallery with an exceptional collection of Miro paintings and sculptures. The house is charming and easy to walk through with open gallery rooms, nothing exceptional. An average tea room style restaurant",
          "I thought it was small, we walked from skansen and it was nice walked but never the less long walk and to be honest I think there are other things more important to see, but if you are art freak then its a must",
          "Waldemarsudde was hands down the museum I liked most in Stockholm. It combines Swedish art and architecture in a pastural setting overlooking the sea. Prepare to be charmed by the lovely interiors and great cafe. Allow time to walk the grounds and stop for tea. The ticket entry",
          "Please. If you are in Stockholm, visit this beautiful spot on earth. This is like Denmarks' Louisiana. A nice, huge house filled with art. Typical Swedish art. Very nice. Possibilty to get a \"fika\" or eat something. My suggestion is to take a walk from Skansen to get there. Or",
          "This must be one of the hidden jewels to visit in Stockholm. Very good food, outside in the garden ( in the summer ) as well as inside. A very relaxing atmosphere.",
          "Located on the island of Djurg\u00e5rden, Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde is the former home of Prince Eugen who was himself a painter and art patron. The stunning home is now a wonderful art gallery. The view over the water from the garden is simply stunning. Wonderful experience!",
          "Take the trip by the tram to Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde - the beautiful mansion - which also functions as a museum for special exhibits. The Miro exhibit is worth the trip - as is the mansion - and the original rooms where the prince lived..",
          "We went by tram 7 to the museum and had a nice walk back to the city centre after the visit. We enjoyed the interiors as well as some minor dishes in the restaurant situated in the former kitchen. A walk in the garden is a must, less because of the garden than of the view",
          "The former residence of painter and prince Eugen is the perfect setting for a gallery, particularly if the artist on show is Joan Mir\u00f3. The walk to this castle on the very tip of the island of Djurg\u00e5rden is a beautiful part of a well rounded experience. The restaurant is good",
          "We are regular visitors to Stockholm. We saw Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde on a recent program about Scandinavian art and decided to visit on our next trip. Its well worth the visit. Its situated on the archipelago of Djurg\u00e5rden which can be easily reached via Tram 7 or the ferry",
          "Such a beautiful place to visit. The interior and grounds were filled with many beautiful art pieces. A perfect little outdoor Caf\u00e9 nearby for Fika was a bonus. Must go back!",
          "Having seen the house featured in a BBC4 programme about Scandinavian art, I decided make a visit during my most recent trip to Stockholm. The house itself is very elegant and the art collection is worth seeing.",
          "This is one of my favourite house museums in Stockholm. The waterfront location is idyllic - within the city but part of the beautiful Djurg\u00e5rden neighbourhood. It is easily reached by tram from the city centre but also not too far to walk. The Mansion is wonderfully preserved",
          "Just taking the tram out here is enjoyable. A stop is well worth it. Pls make sure that the museum is open though...",
          "I walked from the Rosendal Palace through farms and woods to the Waldemarsudde Museum on Djurgarden Island. This took about 15 minutes and was relaxing and interesting. The Waldemarsudde is a large late Victorian Mansion and property built by Prince Eugen Waldemarsudde who was",
          "This small schloss was the home of a member of the Swedish royal family during the interwar period and has been maintained more or less as he left it. Prince Eugen of Sweden was not only a collector of fine art, he was also a painter of distinction. The main floor consists of",

          "We wanted a combination of nature and culture and found Waldemarsudde a great alternative on a sunny day. Easy access by tramline 7, reasonable entry fee, rich selection of art, both in the garden and throughout the many rooms of the mansion.",
          "Unfortunately not a piece of art any more. Some pure exhibitions over local artists, working hours are to be adjusted.",
          "The most artistic Prince! Beautiful home in fantastic gardens! A must when visiting Stockholm. Prince Eugens collection of pairings, including his owns are more than well worth the visit,",
          "We walked to the gallery on a beautiful day. The artwork is very nice and many of the pieces are painted by the prince. He was great! The home is beautiful, the sun room with dining area is absolutely my favorite there. One of the better house/ museums in Stockholm.",
          "The moment we entered the first rooms we knew this was going to be a special and memorable attraction. And so it was. Prins Eugen was fortunate as the fourth son in being allowed to devote himself to his Bohemian and artistic passions. His mother Queen Sophia, of German origin,",
          "One of the best spots in Djurgarden, especially during sunset; this place is great if you are a couple looking for romantic surroundings in Stockholm.",
          "The aim was to visit the gallery as it was an art exhibition on callet \"Ljusets magi\" The magic of light.A well worth visit. This gallery is also the home of Prince Eugene who was a great collector of art which you find here. The gardens are beautiful and the place has wonderful",
          "Eventually found that a No.7 tram took us close, and really enjoyed the visit. The ground floor was furnished as in Prins Eugen's time, and his paintings were prominently displayed on the walls. The upper floor was unfurnished but displayed more of Prins Eugen's paintings",
          "Very well presented gallery in a house with beautiful garden and views over the water. I would rank this one of my favourites in a packed visit to Stockholm. An oasis of calm compared to other more well known sites.",
          "This is a fantastic place to visit! There's not only the museum and the home of prince Eugene! There is also the beautiful gardens with amazing statues and wonderful views!",
          "This gallery is at the end of tram line 7 and very easy to get to. It is a pleasant short (ten mins) walk through the gardens to get to the house. There were a variety of paintings, some very good indeed, in a beautiful house. A very pleasant place to visit. Takes perhaps an",
          "We visited here quite accidentally. We originally planned to to take a walk in the park, and stumbled onto this, well, royal home, and decided to visit the art museum. We did not know at the time that this was the Swedes' favorite place to visit. The prince, a son of Queen",
          "If you are an art lover, then this house is definitely a must see in downtown Stockholm. It is very easy to reach with the tram (number 7) and then a short walk in nature. I suggest you book a guided tour as they will give you more information than the audio guide available. The",
          "Prins Eugens of the Swedish royal family was quite an accomplished artist and his beautiful house is filled both with his own art and his collection of art by contemporaries. The setting is gorgeous, with well kept gardens that invite a stroll or contemplative rest, and a",
          "We spent an engaging morning at this art gallery. Not necessarily the most outstanding works of art, but rather a show case for little known Scandinavian artists at the turn of the 20th century. Well worth a visit from art lovers.",
          "The prince was a \"nice\" artist his collection was good for what he was trying to do, the mini palace is really nice, renovations to house exhibits detract from the house but the grounds are also really good.",
          "When we went, there was an extensive display of Swedish women impressionists. We were impressed by the quality of the art and the spacious, well-lit rooms. Being a painter myself, I drooled over the second-floor studio: high ceilings, tons of space, incredible light. (it's good",
          "We took the tram and walked the short path to this stately mansion with an interesting history and beautiful art collection.",
          "Nice location of an old lovely Villa. Interesting display of (mostly) Swedish art. Some great art by female painters who studied in the French school.",
          "Truly lovely house in beautiful grounds running down to the water. I largely went because of a book I read recently which involved the art gallery and a painting housed there which wasn't actually on display when I went there but it was still with the visit. There is a windmill",
          "This was my second visit and it's really a beautiful villa with exceptional grounds. The art work is OK (after all Sweden isn't known for its fine art). The restaurant is charming. The problem is that the women who work in the museum are unpleasant and kind of troll around",
          "Visiting this place gives you four goodies in one: a lovely location, a fine art collection, an impressive impression of Prinse Eugen's taste for living in what most would consider \"luxury\", and a small but quite fine cafe/restaurant. We enjoyed our visit to this place also",
          "Good exhibitions ! A good example of a upper class home during art deco. It even has a good restaurant.",
          "We did not get into the proper museum of Prins Eugens, only the gardens which was open to the public even after the official closing hour at 21.00. Walking around the garden at dusk on a summer evening was very soothing and serene with a very different view of Stockholm",
          "We didn't go for the exhibition but just to walk the grounds and Prins Eugens was a lucky guy! Beautiful. Find the bench down by the pier overlooking the marina and watch the boats zipping in and out for a while.",
          "This gallery and former castle is very beautiful and situated in a fantastic area. Always new and interesting artists that are introduced in a stylish way. A lovely old-fashioned kitchen with yummy food.",
          "A pretty building, where you can visit the art-nouveau rooms, on the ground floor, and an art exposition (mostly Scandinavian painters, beautiful light!) on the first and second floor as well as in the separate museum building. Be sure to enjoy lunch in the little cafe, and",
          "I am a proud regular at Wudde and everytime I bring friends and visitors they are amazed at the mixed atmosphere of a preserved privat home and Art museum. Prince Eugen was not only royalty, he was a significant painter and even more importantly a leader and inspiration to his",
          "Magic Light \u2013 Plein-air painting from the late 19th-century was excellent. The exhibition presents some 200 works, mainly by Swedish artists, who inspired them. Women artists are especially highlighted, which was very nice",
          "Maybe it was the warm, sunny weather and the lovely walk through the grounds to get to the museum, but everything was just perfect. The weeping willows hanging over the water, the swans and their cygnets, the lack of crowds. The museum is totally accessible to disabled people",
          "My favorite thing we did. Awesome grounds and home. Neatly a fabulous collection of his art collection including pieces that the Prince did. hard to believe this were little known artists. Would defin. go back to this exhibit if returned to Sweden.",
          "We went to Prins Eugene castle Waldemarsudde with some friends from abroad. It was just perfect. The group was just 4 people and the service in the cafeteria was just perfect. Perfect service and really good food for our luncheon meal.",
          "I enjoyed my walk out here - and the setting is lovely, even in the rain. The exhibitions (temporary and permanent) were great and the house itself is interesting and enjoyable. There was a lot to see and I would say that it is well worth a visit.",
          "After a short but pleasant walk along Djurgarden edge we reached this musuem away from the hustle and bustle (it can reached by car, cycle). This was a great entry into early 20th century Swedish art and it was great to see a selection of Swedish female artists were well",
          "Prince Eugen was the youngest son of King Oscar II and became an artist, which was not exactly comme-il-faut for a prince at the end of the 19th century. He moved here around 1900 and built himself a mansion where he could invite other artists and culture personalities.",
          "I enjoyed everything about my visit to Waldemarsudde: from finding the number 7 tram, the scenic tour of the tram journey, the short walk through the garden to the gallery, and then the exhibition and the house. I read another review that described the house as disappointingly",
          "This mansion built by Prince Eugen sits on a hill overlooking the water and now, May 2016, has a beautiful art exhibit of Swedish open air art from turn of 1900. There are also originally decorated rooms that will make you dream of living there - the most beautiful flower",
          "I've actually never made it in to the museum as I just enjoyed the lovely park around which is for free. If you are lucky one of the bigger cruise ships comes by!",
          "The story of how this gallery/museum came into being is interesting enough but does not match the delightful quality of the exhibition. So much Swedish art remains unheard of in the rest of the world - this is a great place to experience some of it. There is also a great walk in",
          "The different artexhibitions have very high class. The building and the apartment of Prince Eugen is just lovely. The flowerdecorations are awesome.",
          "A must see while in Stockholm. Beautiful surroundings and a lovely museum. Nice restaurant. Well worth a visit.",
          "A poor attraction - not worth the effort of visiting and certainly not worth the entrance fee - only a few rooms to visit - most of the rest is exhibition space - and on our visit filled with terrible artwork . If you need to visit DONT go inside but walk around the house and",
          "Lovely location, excellent cafe, beautiful exhibitions superbly presented. Definitely a 5* experience for art lovers.",
          "We visit Stockholm about once a year and we always visit the Waldemarsudde. Not only it's a beautiful spot, the house itself (and the content) is interesting as well, so are the exhibitions and don't forget to stroll around in the garden.",
          "A charming park and a nice collection of Swedish painters. There is an entrance fee, but the collection makes it worthwhile.",
          "this is such a great place to visit - wonderful house and grounds and interesting exhibitions. tea room in grounds is lovely. do not miss this beautiful museum.",
          "Both the house and the garden surrounding it are stunning, with a great view of the fjord leading from the sea to the center of Stockholm. Interesting art exibitions, but the most important to see are the prince\u00b4s own paintings. He was an art collector and a great artist himself.",
          "The area surrounding here was beautiful, I probably preferred it to the gallery/mansion itself. The art in the gallery is not to everyone's taste, I personally found the mansion most interesting. There are a few impressive rooms to wander around, however I was expecting there to",
          "Prince Eugen\u2019s Waldemarsudde, originally the home of Prince Eugen (1865-1947), became state-owned after the Prince\u2019s death in accordance with his will, and is now among the most-visited art museums in Sweden. Prince Eugen was one of his generation\u2019s foremost landscape painters",
          "This has a superior collection of Scandinavian art and an extensive display of Edvard Munch. There are also several Strindberg paintings as well. The prince was a painter as well, and quite good. Although there are private mansion museums with much more renowned painters, the",
          "Prinz Eugen Waldemarsudde is a lovely place, that combines the features of a 19th century small palace with gardens and bucolic surroundings, with expositions, sculptures and art galleries. It is located a bit outside central Stockholm and reaching it by boat or bike will be a",
          "That a great place to visit! The small palace is great, you'll enjoy the art and nice surroundings. The garden outside is fantastic , full of flowers and great views over the sea. I visited this place twice, and would not mind to go back again!",
          "We were told by Swedish friends to go there. Best get the ferry and then a short bus ride or walk. It is an art gallery combined with a house on the water set in superb gardens. Really lovely place to go. You can then get the tram back to the centre of Stockholm.",
          "This is a truly charming art gallery partly situated in what was once Prince Eugen\u2019s house. The exhibitions are changing during the year, but we have been there 5-6 times over the last 10 years, and have never been disappointed. In the very unlikely event you do not like the",
          "This former home of Prins Eugen is a lovely place to visit. You do not find it easily in the tourist information. It is a museum with a nice painting collection. Some are of the prince himself. His house is a nice place, light and nicely decorated. Not so depressingly pompous as",
          "Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde combines rooms in which the early 20th-century grandeur and furnishings have been preserved with other rooms that have been turned into an art gallery. We liked the former, but the modern art exhibited in the latter was not our cup of modern tea. The",
          "Beautifully situated, easy to reach , just take the ferry from Slussen to Gr\u00f6na Lund and walk 20 minutes from there. The museum has nice surroundings as well.",
          "Beautiful residence in Djurgarden. The setting is really serene and calm/ Inside there is a beautiful art collection. Recommended.",
          "Touring the residence was enjoyable and the view from the living room was worth the visit. The art exhibition was just OK.",
          "I had the good fortune to visit with Swedish friends who know a great deal about art. The exhibit was an overview of Swedish romantic painting it was a crash course in Swedish art and it is magnificent. Attached to the exhibition space are some public rooms in Prins Eugens home,",
          "The permanent part of the museum; the prince\u00b4s home is wonderful and as it was when he lived there. In the former studio and in the annex there are always interesting exhibitions. The nature around the building on Djurg\u00e5rden are also beautiful and nice to go for a walk in.",
          "The house and garden of Prince Eguen is wonderful. One can easily spend an entire day there. If you only wish to go to the cafeteria you have to buy a ticket to the museum but the garden is free of charge and there is a caf\u00e9 nearby.",

          "The guide book had suggested that there were some ornamental gardens and sculptures to be found on the pathway back towards the city from Biskopsvagen, but I was not prepared for quite how pretty a spot this turned out to be. The walks and trails are on several levels, so you",
          "The house is nice in a quiet, relaxing place. But its location is everything - on Djurg\u00e5rdenden Island. It is so nice to walk around and enjoy the nature. there is a royal palace close by that you could visit as well.",

          "This is a great spot. I had a lovely walk to its location. There appears to be a lot of embassies nearby. The weather was lovely on the day that I went and I had a nice time sitting on a bench watching the ducks coming and going on the water.",
          "Prince Eugen's house was a real treat to see. There is a small art gallery currently showing the works of a Swedish artist and then there is the main house in 3 floors. The first floor of the house is set up with period furniture and is really beautiful. The upper two floors of",

          "Take the trolley past Skansen Gardens and walk out to the Prince's former home. It is like traveling back in time. It looks like he still lives there and that is what he wanted. The art collection is interesting and the gardens and view are worth it.",

          "A bit off the beaten track, but absolutely worth the visit. The house is a nice mix of history and art. The temporary exhibition of German impressionist Nolde was an interesting view. I loved the water colors. I fell in love with the garden and park. Such a wonderful, romantic",

          "We did not go into the museum, but the grounds were a nice place for a walk. We visited on a Sunday in June and spent some time sitting on the terrace and watching sailboat races. It's easy to get here using the #6 tram. We took advantage of our 24 hour transit card and rode",
          "My wife and I met a Swedish artist, Nils Gunnar Zander, at a wedding reception in Sweden and he encouraged us to visit his exhibition at Prins Eugens Waldermarsudde. Which we did and had a wonderful time with his paintings. There were other exhibitions there, too, and this is",

          "We weren't sure what to expect of the house but it turns out to be worth the walk from ABBA museum. The first part of attraction consisted of a museum that had a showing of a contemporary Swedish artist. Not my cup of tea but very colorful. The house was fully furnished as it",

          "My friends and I went here mainly for the views, and they were not the best. You can go here by taking the tram (I think Tram #7 runs here, don't know for sure) from the city center. If you're staying in Stockholm for a short period of time, this is not worth going to. Skip",
          "I did not visit the house and art exhibit of Prince Eugen's Waldemarsudde so I did not pay the entrance fee but was able to view the surrounding garden. I also peeked in one of the windows and saw a pleasant house with beautiful flower arrangements in very natural styles of",
          "We visited on a Thursday afternoon in April and the house was very busy. Apparently it is one of the most popular museums in Sweden. I find it difficult to see why. The paintings are not that impressive and although the interior of the house is very stylish it is not in any way",
          "This place has a castle of Prins Eugens, who apparently was an artist. We spent our time there outside just enjoying the view and the atmosphere. It's so tranquil and you just want to stay there for a while. To go there: take the tram (sp\u00e5rvagn) from Sergels torg towards",

          "I have a soft spot for this place. From Downtown just outside Kulturehuset, there is an aboveground train that is new which takes you directly to Waldemarsudde. So it is easy access for visitors. Once there there is a lovely garden and waterfront you can enjoy. The entrance",

          "When I visited, there was a substantial Matisse exhibition going on in the gallery section and it seemed to be very popular. Art, unfortunately, is not my thing, so I quicky went into the house itself. Eugen kept the first floor rooms as show rooms for his guests, while he lived",

          "Waldermarsudde has been one of my favorite goals for walks for many years. The view over the Stockholm harbor is spectacular, the gardens are beautiful, and the buildings are all worth a visit - especially the museum. An oasis close to the city, both for those taking a bus or",

          "We ended up here as we couldn't find our way to the Thielska! To be honest I'm not really that into art but my husband really wanted to see some. So we came here. The exhibitions are a strange mix of 19thc and modern abstract. Its ok from and art point of view but nothing",
          "Undoubtedly the highlight of our latest Stockholm visit. Prince Eugen clearly had great taste and the house is exquisitely furnished. He was also a highly accomplished artist and many of his works are on display, as are those of other top Scandinavian artists of his time. Do not",

          "This is mostly an exhibition of Prince Eugen's artwork. He painted very nice pictures and if you're into that, and you're visiting the area of Djurgarden, it could be nice to stop by. Enjoy!",
          "This is my idea of a pleasant afternoon looking at aristocratic life in Sweden a hundred or so years ago. It was an insight into the lifestyle of Prins Eugen, his beautiful furnishings and his paintings. I loved the soft colour palate of the soft furnishings andthe room settings",
          "They have temporary exhibitions so it's better to check in advance if you are interested in that or not. But the building itself is worth a visit, I believe. This is a small palace on the Djurg\u00e5rden island, on the shore, so the scenery and the view is really nice. And the palace",

          "The home of former Prince Eugene; a member of the royal family, an artist and an art collector. The house and location is worth a visit in and of itself and the art is a bonus, if not breathtaking.",

          "We didn't venture into the museum but we filled a whole afternoon here, first having lunch at the cafe then wondering round the gardens before sitting watching the boating life go by. Beautiful floral displays to see and is a convenient place to get to if you use the tram.",
          "We didn't even go into the museum but still liked the place. Take your picnic blanket with you or visit the lovely cafe - either way you'll love the scenery over S\u00f6dermalm. Must visit some other time again.",
          "The temporary exhibitions are quite varied and often have important works. They are displayed in spacious surroundings. The permanent collection is a delight, for it contains many fine paintings by Prins Eugen as well as the paintings he chose to hang in his home. It is lovely",
          "Prince Eugene, how was an recognized artist, build this house on the most beatiful spot of Stockholm. It is packed with art and wunderful interiors. His own paintings as well as others. The Prince loved flowers and the rooms a full of them. Even the restaurant is good and give",
          "One of my favorite places to visit is Waldemarsudde. There are fresh flowers daily, even in the long Swedish winter, and the art and furnishings are interesting to see. This is the former home of the current King of Sweden's uncle, who was a talented artist. There are special",
          "If you are taking a quick trip to Stockholm and aren't fixated on seeing all the art in town, this is skippable. It's kind of remote, all the way at the bottom of Djurgarden. There is a tram that runs fairly close to it - tram 7, which comes from the city - but on foot, it's a",
          "This was our 4th visit for the day and what a lovely place! Prince Eugen lived and painted there and the rooms were largely as they had been. His paintings were featured on the walls of the delightful house, set in lovely grounds with beautiful views. There were in addition,",
          "Waldemarsudde is a gem!!! Quite the extraordinary setting, and...how nice that a prince not only collected art -- he made it, too. Several of his works were stunning and the collected works also quite special on the whole. Highly recommend walking from the site eastward along",

          "This museum is actually the prince's former home and it has several beautifully furnished rooms complete with huge bouquets of fresh flowers. Many of the paintings on the walls were done by the prince. Upstairs there are numerous other paintings and we particularly liked those",
          "A very enjoyable afternoon rounded off a with afternoon Tea. The house has a wonderful collection of contemporary art. AS well as Eugens own art there are works by other prominent Scandinavian Artists and some European works including Picasso. If you like art then this is well",
          "A house and museum that had a very calm and soothing atmosphere, where you can see some lovely art. The gardens are a good place to view the sea and boats and take a rest.",
          "The no.7 tram runs out to this museum/gallery and it is worth a visit for the grounds and a different view of Stockholm. There is also an interesting outdoor cafe. Inside the house, the downstairs rooms are as Prince Eugen left them. Upstairs is exhibition space and there is",
          "Beautiful grounds. Nice location near the terminus of the No 7 tram. Nicely displayed galleries and wonderful views. Well signed. Nice coffee shop.",
          "We visited this house and the art gallery. We found the house (and its garden) more interesting than the gallery, even if the temporary exhibition of a lesser known Swedish female painter was quite nice too. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see all of the paintings of the",
          "We like late 19c/early 20c art & loved this place. It has a small gallery with changing temporary exhibitions, then you also get to tour a beautiful waterside mansion built in 1903/5 for artist-Prince Eugen with his tasteful art collection displayed in his beautifully furnished",
          "We visited this residence and art gallery on a sunny weekend afternoon. It is nicely set out and had a few charming exhibits. The views of the harbor and the small gardens were nice too. I found the residence a little boring but it was pleasant.",
          "Very good swedish classic food. Alittle extra expensive as you hav to pay entrance to the museum to eat, but the food and surroundings is worth it.",

          "Great view from the outside, but hardly anything except shifting exhibitions inside. Unless you are an art person, it is difficult to spend more than 30 minutes inside this place.",
          "Location's magnificent, view enchanting, ambiance refreshing. Best confine your visit to the grounds, as the paintings on exhibit are just awful. We briefly glimpsed some pictures of mostly dead animals. That was the special exhibit. The permanent collection consists of failed",

          "Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde is a lovely and very peaceful place that art lovers as well as outdoor enthusiasts should not miss out on! It's the perfect place to relax - enjoy Sweden's art, nature, and the view of the city!",
          "There is always some exhibition that is worth looking at, but the park is absolutely lovely during the summer. It is very nice during winter as well but\u2026 Stroll around, take a rest in the park, watch the boats (and ships) and of course the skyline of S\u00f6dermalm.",
          "It is easy for visitors to overlook this lovely art museum and garden which is located right on the water's edge surrounded by woodlands. Easily reached by tram from the centre of town, it was the home of Prins Eugen who was a gifted painter in his own right and a keen collector",
          "Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde is one of my favorits in Stockholm. Typically it hosts very interesting exhibitions, and thanks to museum pleasant size you really can properly enjoy the whole palette. Also museum location is very peaceful and it offers most beautiful scenes towards",
          "To be in a stately mansion, enjoying beautiful art while watching the huge ferry passing by very closely on its way to Finland, was amazing. We rounded it up with a meal in the museum restaurant - and we felt just so privilged!",
          "One of the old princes who never became king painted and lived in this magnificent villa on Djurg\u00e5rden. It's excellent to visit both for the villa as such and for the collection of paintings in it, mostly from the 19th to early 20th century if I recall correctly.",

          "and there's one of Rodin's The Thinker statues in the garden. Lovely walk to the place also - beautiful houses along the way. Wasn't too keen on the bird art, but worth ten pounds entrance fee I'd say to see the lovely chandelier!",
          "This place is worth a visit, not only for the special art exhibitions, but for the building itself, where Prince Eugen lived and held his parties. All furniturs still there and you can have a sandwich and coffee in his kitchen",
          "This is one of the few royal residencies which remains on the island. Although it is no longer occupied by any members of the royal family the history still remains and the house and its grounds have been turned into a coffee shop, art gallery and gardens. The house is on the",
          "The Swedish Prins Eugen (1865-1947) was a painter, who had trained in Paris and this was his home which he commissioned and had built by architect, Ferdinand Boberg at the beginning of the 1900s. Fittingly, after his death in 1947, the Prins was buried nearby, close to the place",
          "Take the tram and walk along the water to the museum. The gallery has a small but great collection of art. I had extra time to walk around the grounds along the water front. There is a neat old windmill on the grounds but it does not have its blades.",
          "Right outside Central Station you can pick up Tram #7 and take it to the last stop, Waldemarsudde. Then it is a 10 min. walk from there. The walk is quite nice as it is right along the water and there are ducks and swans and beutiful trees. All around the museum there are paths",

          "This museum was not on our list but we ended up there to avoid being soaked wet by a sudden rain on our way walking to the Thiel collection. We had a good time wandering through the museum and its naive art rooms. The house has lovely rooms where Prince Eugens was living and it",

        "wiki": "The Drottningholm Palace (Swedish: Drottningholms slott) is the private residence of the Swedish royal family. It is located in Drottningholm. Built on the island Lov\u00f6n (in Eker\u00f6 Municipality of Stockholm County), it is one of Sweden's Royal Palaces. It was originally built in the late 16th century, and it served as a regular summer residence of the Swedish royal court for most of the 18th century. Apart from being the private residence of the Swedish royal family, the palace is a popular tourist attraction.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe name Drottningholm (literally meaning \"Queen's islet\") came from the original renaissance building designed by Willem Boy, a stone palace built by John III of Sweden in 1580 for his queen, Catherine Jagellon.  This palace was preceded by a royal mansion called Torvesund.The Queen Dowager Regent Hedwig Eleonora bought the castle in 1661, a year after her role as Queen of Sweden ended, but it burnt to the ground on 30 December that same year. Hedwig Eleonora engaged the architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder to design and rebuild the castle. In 1662, work began on the reconstruction of the building. With the castle almost complete, Nicodemus died in 1681. His son Nicodemus Tessin the Younger continued his work and completed the elaborate interior designs.  The Flemish sculptor Nicolaes Millich made for the great staircase and hall sculptures of the nine muses in marble, along with a series of busts of Gothic kings.   In addition, he also made bust portraits of King Charles X Gustav, his wife Hedwig Eleonor and both their sons, the young King Charles XI, probably also of Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie and his wife Maria Euphrosyne, a sister of King Charles X Gustav. Millich and his assistant Burchard Precht also made decorative wood carvings in the queen dowager's bed chamber.During the period of the reconstruction, Hedwig Eleonora was head of the regency for the still-underage King, Charles XI of Sweden, from 1660 to 1672. Sweden had grown to be a powerful country after the Peace of Westphalia. The position of the queen, essentially the ruler of Sweden, demanded an impressive residence located conveniently close to Stockholm.\nDuring the reign of the kings Charles XI of Sweden and Charles XII of Sweden, the royal court was often present at the palace, which was used for hunting. Hedwig Eleonora used the palace as a summer residence until her death in 1715, also when she had become the undisputed host of the royal court during the absence of Charles XII in Great Northern War (1700\u20131721).\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nDrottningholm continued to serve regularly as a summer residence for the royal court during the entire 18th-century. After the death of Hedwig Eleonora in 1715, Queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden and King Frederick I of Sweden held court at the palace in the summer.In 1744, the palace was given as a gift from King Frederick I to the then Crown Princess, later Queen of Sweden, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia when she married Adolf Frederick of Sweden, who became King of Sweden in 1751. During Louisa Ulrika's ownership of Drottningholm the interior of the palace was transformed into a more sophisticated French rococo style. Louisa Ulrika was also responsible for having the Drottningholm Palace Theatre rebuilt in a grand style after the more modest original building burnt down in 1762. Louisa Ulrika and Adolf Fredrick continued to reside at the palace during their reign (1751\u20131771). In 1777, Louisa Ulrika sold Drottningholm to the Swedish state.\nWhile it was owned by the Swedish state, the palace was used by King Gustav III of Sweden, son of Louisa Ulrika, as a summer residence, and a grand ceremonial court life was performed at the palace, which is considered to have been a great age for the palace, during which it was known for the elaborate masquerades and grand theatrical festivities and tournaments performed in the gardens.  During the reign of Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden (reign 1792\u20131809) and Charles XIII of Sweden (reign 1809\u20131818) the palace was gradually used more sporadically. In 1797, it was the place of the great festivities when the King's bride, Frederica of Baden, was received there upon her arrival in Sweden, during which the last so called carousel, or tournament, was staged in the palace garden. After the Coup of 1809, the deposed Gustav IV Adolf was kept here under guard in the Chinese Drawing Room for eleven days.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nDuring the reign of Charles XIV John of Sweden (reign 1818\u20131844), the palace was abandoned. The King regarded it as a symbol of the old dynasty, and Drottningholm was left to decay. The buildings were damaged by the forces of nature, and their inventories were either taken away or auctioned off.It was apparently opened to the public for the first time during this period: a tour was mentioned in 1819, and the public used the park for picnics.\nOccasionally, the grounds were used for public events: in 1823, the bride of the crown prince, Josephine of Leuchtenberg, was received upon her arrival to Sweden, and her name day continued to be celebrated here. Foreign guests were received in the palace gardens, such as Tsar Nicholas I of Russia.Oscar I of Sweden took an interest in the palace, and though he preferred Tullgarn Palace as summer residence, he took care to preserve the palace by doing the first repairs in 1846. He further more used it for public celebrations, such as a reception for Pan-Scandinavian students in 1856, and in 1858, the future Gustav V of Sweden was born in the palace. Charles XV of Sweden preferred Ulriksdal Palace as his summer residence and ignored Drottningholm, but Oscar II of Sweden continued the repairs.Both Oscar I and Oscar II were criticized for modernizing the palace and adjusting it to contemporary fashion rather than restoring it to its original state, and it was not until the reign of Gustav V that the palace and surroundings were reconstructed to their 18th-century appearance. In 1907, a major four-year restoration of the palace was begun to restore it to its former state, after which the royal court began to use it regularly again.\n\n\n=== Royal residence ===\nThe current Swedish royal family have used the west-wing Drottningholm as their primary residence since 1981. Since then, the Palace has also been guarded by the Swedish Military in the same fashion as Stockholm Palace. The other parts of the Palace is open to the public.\n\n\n== The palace ==\nThe palace and its grounds have seen many renovations, changes and additions over the past 400 years. The largest renovation, in which electricity, heating, sewage, water lines were either  installed or updated and the castle roof replaced, took place between 1907 and 1913.\nDuring a 20-year-period beginning around 1977, several major areas of the palace were restored and rebuilt. The library and national hall received much of the attention and fire protection was installed throughout the palace. In 1997, work began to clean and rebuild the exterior walls. This was completed in 2002.\n\n\n=== The palace church ===\nThe church was designed and erected by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. It was completed by his son in May, 1746.\nIt is still used by the people of Lov\u00f6n parish, who worship in the church on the last Sunday of every month. Inside the castle church a Cahman organ from 1730 is still in use. Another noteworthy item is the traditional church tapestry which was made by Gustaf V of Sweden.\n\n\n=== The palace theatre ===\n \n\nThe Drottningholm Palace Theatre is the opera house located at the palace. It is still in use, and its summer opera festivals are quite popular. At times the Royal Swedish Opera company guest performs.\n\n\n=== The Chinese Pavilion ===\n\nThe Chinese Pavilion, located on the grounds of the Drottningholm Palace park, is a Chinese-inspired royal pavilion built in 1763\u20131770\n\n\n== The gardens ==\n\nThe gardens and park areas surrounding the castle and its buildings are one of the main attractions for the tourists that visit the palace each year.The gardens have been established in stages since the castle was built, resulting in different styles of parks and gardens.\n\n\n=== The Baroque garden ===\nThe oldest part of the gardens was created at the end of the 17th century under the direction of Hedwig Eleonora. The father and son Tessin led the project that created a Baroque garden right outside the main palace, flanked by thick tree avenues. The many statues scattered throughout this area were created by the artist Adrian de Vries; the Swedish army took them as spoils of war from the Wallenstein Palace in Prague, while the two marble lions at the main gate of the palace were transported from the Ujazd\u00f3w Castle in Warsaw. The Baroque garden was neglected along with the rest of the grounds during the 19th century, but was restored in the 1950s and 1960s on the initiative of Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden.\n\n\n=== The English garden ===\nGustav III of Sweden took the initiative for the English landscape garden of Drottningholm. This lies north of the Baroque garden and consists of two ponds with canals, bridges, large open sections of grass, and trees in groups or avenues. Walkways are laid out throughout this large part of the park. \nThroughout this area \"vistas\" can be seen, cleared lines of sight that are intentionally constructed to draw the eye to a particular view. Most of the antique marble statues throughout the gardens were purchased by Gustav III from Italy. The purpose of the statues is to surprise a visitor by their unexpected appearance in a green area, or as a focal point for a vista.\n\n\n== UNESCO World Heritage Site ==\nThe palace is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, mainly because of the Drottningholm Palace Theatre and the Chinese Pavilion. It was added to the list in 1991. The UNESCO comments were:\n\nThe Royal Domain of Drottningholm stands on an island in Lake M\u00e4lar in a suburb of Stockholm. With its palace, perfectly preserved theatre (built in 1766), Chinese pavilion and gardens, it is the finest example of an 18th-century northern European royal residence inspired by the Palace of Versailles.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Baroque residences\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDrottningholm Palace from the official website of the Royal Court of Sweden\nThe Royal Domain of Drottningholm \u2013 National Heritage Board\nDrottningholm Palace park's 360x180 degree panorama virtual tour at stockholm360.net",

          "I was expecting something extravagant and you can tell the royal family here didn't have as much money as other royalty back in the day and they tried to make up for it in many different ways throughout the palace and grounds. An ok visit, just thought it would be more",
          "Went to visit Drottningholm Palace on a crisp and bright morning during my first ever visit to Stockholm and Sweden. An amazing palace with much glory. Fantastic gardens, which are free to visit. We also took in a self-guided tour of the interior. Easy travel from the city",
          "I took a boat to get there, booked it through one of the boat companies. It was a scenic and leisurely way to get there (took about 50 minutes, and there are a couple of brief stops as the boat picks up a few people along the way.) The palace grounds are beautiful and orderly.",
          "It's fun to know you're in the King's Palace and the royal family could be only 20 feet away! Of course the tour does not include the family wing of the palace but you get to walk through lots of other rooms. I'd recommend going with a tour guide to get the most from your",
          "Drottningholm Palace. the queen's 17th century summer castle and royal residence, has a lot to see - the grand staircase, beautiful staterooms, an expansive garden, all on the \"Queen's Island\" ~ a boat ride or metro/bus trip from central Stockhlom",
          "This is a beautiful palace set along the river and surrounded by outstanding gardens. We had about 3 hours to do the entire palace and gardens, so we saw it so very quickly. It should have about 4 to 5 hours to see it well and coming in the Spring would probably be the best",
          "We traveled by boat to and from the palace which was pleasant and relaxing and my favourite part. It took about an hour each way. The place was ok - seen much better though but perhaps down to personal opinion. Some information available but not a huge amount. Gardens were nice",
          "Getting to Drottningholm Palace is very easy. You can take a leisurely boat trip or go by city bus. I took a bus, which dropped me off right in front of the palace grounds. I just took a quick peek inside the palace, which is still the private residence of the royal family. I",
          "As with all European Palaces the grandeur of Drottningholm Palace is impressive. I love its architecture outside with the beautiful, tree-shaded flowing lawns and surrounded by a lake. There is a ferry coming right up to the palace which I was told was worth a ride if time",
          "This is a beautiful palace where the Swedish royalty currently live. You can tour the inside apartments and also the grounds. We also went on a tour of the theater which is still operating. We did not visit the Chinese gardens, but that is another option. The palace is stunning",
          "We went to Drottingholm by boat, which was a wonderful ride dotted with many undeveloped islands. Drottingholm immediately reminds you of Versailles or Schonbrunn, but the buildings are much less grand. They tried to emulate those two palaces, but clearly did not have the",
          "The worst 18\u20ac spent in my life!!! The most small, empty and bad organized museum of ever. It made me want to not visit a royal palace in my life.",
          "We only walked the grounds as it was end of day but still really enjoyed this. The gardens are amazing and really worth the visit",
          "Lovely and famous place. You can either get there with a boat or by bus \ud83d\ude8c it\u2019s quite unclear though what to do theee as you arrive. I suggest to do some research on what to see or what to do before you arrive",
          "Lots to see at this beautiful site, the current home of Sweden's King. Was a bit annoyed that we paid full admission for the Palace itself but the chapel was not open: 'not enough staff working\" that day...in prime summer season. Also seemed cheeky that the theatre and the China",
          "We were staying not far from the palace so went to it several times. Sometimes we walked in the gardens, sometimes we sat by the water and relaxed. The grounds are very well maintained and there are good facilities there. If you are coming by ferry, it is a lovely trip. We also",
          "I liked to walk in the big garden. You can take a whole day for that, not to rush. Many birds. Not too many tourists. The main building is also nice. It is quite easy and cheab to go with train and bus.",
          "Enjoyed the boat ride to get here. The palace itself was okay. Sounds terrible but once you\u2019ve seen one palace....you do feel like you\u2019ve seen them all. Really nothing special about the rooms or the history. Perhaps we should have taken the guided tour.",
          "You can get to the palace by every way imaginable but we took the boat both directions and it is a beautiful way to go. The palace is a great stop by itself, great condition and it's so easy to see the difference between the southern Europeans and them. The grounds are",
          "When we were told at the ferry ticket station that the Stockholm Pass no longer was accepted for the trip to the Vaxholm Fortress, we decided to visit the Drottningholm Palace instead. Our second problem of the day was that it was difficult to find the ferry boat station,",
          "The palace doesn\u2019t worth a penny. Two floors only to see paintings. It would be better to visit a gallery. On the other hand the gardens and the view is awesome. In my opinion, skip the palace and go directly to the gardens and walk around the lake!",
          "Reached by a pleasant boat trip on the lake from central Stockholm. Not the most opriginal of palaces as royal palaces go, but some nice touches inside. Doesn't take long to go round the relatively few state rooms that are open to visitors. Extensive gardens, but they could do",
          "There is plenty of interest within the palace itself, although nothing outstanding. However, given a pleasant day, the boat trip from the centre off Stockholm to the palace adds considerably to the overall enjoyment, as do the gardens and the setting. Well worth a half day.",
          "The Palace in Stockholm where the Royal Family reside. The grounds and the buildings have echoes of Versaille. We arrived relatively early and were glad, for a little later in the day there were hordes, also like Versaille. The entry and steps within the Palace are dark and to",
          "This very large palace is full of different museums. They are all worthwhile. From touring the state apartments to the coach museum to the chapel, etc., you get a very well rounded introduction to Swedish Royal Life. It is a highlight of Stockholm",
          "I have been to quite a number of palaces in Europe and Drottningholm palace is a one is the most disappointing one. The area which the public can see is not big. We finished the visit in around 30 mins. But the garden was quite nice and we enjoyed the cruise tour as well. For",
          "I visited the Palace in a sunny August day. I have to tell that you need more than one hour from the city centre, with public transport, to get there. It's doesn't matter if you have plenty of time, but if you stay only for a week end...you van find better things to see. The",
          "A very nice boat trip to a World Heritage Site is well worth the time. Stockholm is all about water, so plan some time seeing the exceptional places east and west of Gamla Stan. We went primarily to see the all-original, 18th century theatre. The tour was curtailed by rehearsals",
          "Amazing location with beautiful architecture, and enchanting gardens, I fell in love with this palace, it\u2019s similar to the palace of my dreams, the interior of the palace was equally splendid, many amazing rooms with royal furniture, loved the bed room, especially the amazing",
          "The boat ride out is no big deal. In all fairness, we did not go into the palace as it's not our thing but were hoping for some beautiful gardens. The gardens are awful! THe stones they have throughout make it hard to walk on (forget a wheelchair). It is next to a busy",
          "We visited this palace during our trip to Stockholm. I recommend getting to the palace by boat. Trip will take about one hour and you can enjoy magnificent views. The palace is beautiful enough but the park is just fantasti\u0441. Behind the park is a magnificent Chinese pavilion. I",
          "Not as luxurious as Versailles, but with larger gardens than Versailles. Exquisite furnishings and curtains of the period in most rooms. Has beautiful stoves covered in oriental porcelain tiles, and incredible parquet floors. Easily accessible by bus (with a great fruit market",
          "Very nice we saw the palace the took a boat ride for 30 minutes, it\u2019s close to Stockholm city Centre Very nice",
          "This is the poor man's Charlottenburg / Versailles. It's still quite lovely and worth a visit if you have time. The cruise to the palace is a nice way to see the surrounding landscape. The theater was interesting but overall the palace is underwhelming.",
          "The theater is historically important, the Chinese pavilion is a kitschy 19th century period piece, the grounds are beautiful and well-maintained (by plant control freaks :-) ). On a beautiful day it was a wonderful place to stroll, far from Stockholm's bustle.",
          "The setting of Drottiningholm Palace is quite nice by the Lake Malaren but its interiors are no comparison to the Royal Palace at Stockholm. Dont know how some people compare and call it the Versailles of Sweden because neither the Palace nor its gardens can be compared to the",
          "My wife settled for visiting Drottingham as Mariefred was too far in the time allotted. The boat ride was fine and the Palace looked fine from the exterior but lacking in both splendor and warmth inside. Due ti rain we did not get to se the gardens or extended grounds.",
          "Another must see in Sweden. So much history in those walls and the gardens are beautiful. We even had a snack on location.",
          "Lovely house and garden. Very well presented and great tour from Stockholm. See the Chinese pavilion small but well worth seeing.",
          "Great to see the palace where the royal family are in residence although not in the sections we visited! Set in a beautiful location in woodland and on the shore of Lake Malaren. Many of the state rooms were open to visitors showing a lot of the history of the Swedish royal",
          "Took return boat trip from pier next to city hall. About 50 minutes each way, a great way to see some terrific scenery. Didn\u2019t go into the palace but spent a very pleasant couple of hours strolling around the magnificent park and gardens - which are free to enter. Cafe was",
          "We spent a whole day here. We started with the boat shuttle from Stockholm which takes you directly to the palace. Between the palace, gardens, Chinese pavilion and other miscellaneous sites it was a full day. We even stayed for the opera in the theatre which was kinda good. It",
          "Located outside of central Stockholm, best reached by boat, car, or tour bus. Home of the royal family, it has lovely gardens that double as a park accessible all the time. You're able to tour several of the rooms inside -- which include some basic information in English.",
          "Prefer the palace in the old town. Not much to see in the palace and very little information. Boat trip lovely and gardens too",
          "Our group had a guided tour with a very enthusiastic young guide. The palace is beautiful as seen coming in by boat. The exterior is nice...typical palace things. It is the private residence of the Swedish royal family but we obviously did not tour their section of the",
          "Really enjoyed my day at Drottningholm palace. I took the Stromma boat from City Hall and paid for the package which included entry to the interior of the palace. It was a pleasant 1 hour ride to Drottningholm. The interiors are definitely worth seeing. Very opulent with",
          "Beautiful place with lots of history. When possible, grab the audio tour guides. Very informative. The gardens are a must see. I must have spent two hours frolicking through the massive gardens.",
          "Very beautiful. Truly enjoyed it! A must see! But make sure you wear comfortable shoes! Its a big place. Try to get there to see the changing of the guard also! What a treat!",
          "You can get there in 50 minutes from the center of Stockholm and it's a nice boat ride trough all the small islands. The garden is free to visit but to get inside the building you have to pay a fee.",
          "We went with my husband to visit the Palace, the gardens are beautiful, lovely place to have a picnic by the lake and then have the visit to the palace. It is a half a day program since it is a little far from Stockholm, but easy to access using the public transportation system,",
          "Be sure to look up all three buildings here; The castle itself, and the nearby theater. Be sure to visit the Chinese castle some hundred meters through the park - left. You may also stroll around in the area. As always it is wise to join a guided tour. But go through the whole",
          "this a beautiful place Official residence for Swedish Royal Family beautiful place with ,beautiful garden One can visit by boat or by car Location of place is awesome facing beautiful lake You can visit some areas inside Still in some part King and Queen resides Its has lovely",
          "Do not miss the Asian Pavillion in the woods or the Guard House for that matter. Standard palace otherwise.",
          "A historical palace that you must visit if you are in Stockholm. Cafes for coffee and food are availble. Public transportation is available in most Stockholm areas and cheap",
          "We enjoyed the short cruise to the palace and felt it was a lovely way to arrive. The boat was a little cramped on the deck but I should imagine this would always be the case on a sunny day, and it didn\u2019t spoil our journey. The palace was lovely and the Chinese palace was a",
          "I felt the gardens were more pleasing to me then the somewhat typical palace with pictures of the usual nobility, fighters, etc. I went thru it in 10 minutes. Go by boat as that's the best part.",
          "Appreciated the charm of the 100+ year-old boat, which took us to Drottningholm, site of the palatial residence of the royal couple. Attached ourselves to the 2pm English tour which, for some reason, started a half-hour early. The residence is very reminiscent of Versailles and",
          "A lovely ferry ride to this spectacular palace. It is like a smaller version of Versailles on which it is modeled. Wonderful grounds and gardens. Its a UNESCO heritage site and definitely worth the trip.",
          "This is easy for tourists to access by public transit (Subway from Central Stockholm plus a short bus ride). Many rooms are available for viewing, as well as the extensive gardens. The Chinese Pavilion is also available and worth the walk from the Palace.",
          "We had a great day out. Going by boat is good. By public transport it is a combination of buses and a train, so more complicated. We got the first boat of the day (10:00). It was pretty full but it allows you to enter the palace before it gets too busy. From the outside the",
          "Myself and my boyfriend visited here last Monday and had a lovely time. We took the boat (which is approx 50 mins) to the palace which added a lovely dynamic to the trip. You can buy a ticket to the palace and for the boat return journey altogether, however we already had",
          "The palace is nice to see, but the tour adds a lot of additional insight and is well with the additional time/moderate expense. The garden is pretty and large. The Chinese pavilion is interesting and well done, but not as exciting as the hype about it. Do see both the palace",
          "The boat trip and the garden alone was worth it. It is beautiful, nice and quiet taking the boat to Drottningholm Palace. You see the nice scenery around Stockholm and get so pretty Swedish impressions. The view of the palace when arriving is great. Also the garden. The palace",
          "Go by ferry from Stockholm centre to enjoy the senery in the inner archipelago, before arriving at the palace. The first sightings from the boat are truly wonderful, especially if the sun is shining. Visit the Chinese Pavilion and wander through the gardens, before a tour of the",
          "A large lake is in front of the palace, Sweden's first World Heritage Site. The soft yellow pastel catches your eye, as well as the palace's symmetry. The gardens carries the 'mini-Versailles' theme associated with the palace. It is the interior that is particularly noteworthy.",
          "Drottningham certainly doesn't look like a palace from the outside, but its interior features beautiful paintings, sculptures and marble. And the huge grounds make for an enjoyable stroll.",
          "Visited this castle in July 2019. It\u2019s a historic site with beautiful display of heritage. I particularly like the armory, displaying guns used for the battles.",
          "We took the cruise from Stockholm CIty Hall which was busy - taking 1 hour to the Palace. We went immediately into the Palace to see the inside before it got too busy and then walked around the gardens. Although the formal gardens are beautifully set out the condition of some",
          "This was our favourite place to visit whilst in Sweden. Conveniently located a 40 minute tram / bus journey away, it was easy to navigate with the \u2018access card\u2019. It is also accessible by boat. We purchased a 3 way ticket for Drottningholm Palace, the Chinese Pavilion and the",
          "Here you can combine a stroll in a beautiful park with visits to historic palaces, an a historic theatre. Taking the boat out here crowns the experience!",
          "I'm happy I ventured outside downtown Stockholm however the palace itself was a bit of a let down. The gardens are the best part of the property.",
          "I took the T17 metro from Centralen Station to Brommaplan which took about 20 minutes. I boarded a bus at the bus exchange to the Drottningholm Palace bus stop which took about 5 minutes. It\u2019s a short 5-minute walk from the bus stop to the Palace. I opted for the combination",
          "I didn't go inside, but I very much enjoyed the grand view of the Palace on the water, as well as the gardens. Had a great lunch at the cafe as well.",
          "The boat trip took an hour and it was very nice. The palace and the garden is amazing. Otherwise it was much better from outside than inside. The rooms were not too interesting. The Chinese pavilon was disappointing.",
          "Enjoyed a wonderful boat trip out to this impressive palace. Lots of interesting rooms. Gardens are extensive and beautiful. Really enjoyed the Chinese Pavilion and the wonderful Baroque theatre.",
          "Stunning architecture and artwork. The grounds are impressive and offer lovely views. The king and queen were home at the time in their private quarters. The restaurant had the best kottbullar I had while in Stockholm.",
          "We did Drottningholm as a part of the Stockholm pass, so we took the ferry out and had admission to all the available areas. We had to pay extra for the guided tour in English but it was worth it. This palace is amazing and the gardens were so nice to walk around in. The grounds",
          "lots of grounds but be careful in the dog area....there is no place as they d o not clean it up...other than that its lovely. easy easy walking",
          "Easy travel by bus, although possible travel on ferry. Castle interesting although a bit gloomy. Don't miss the 18th century theatre or the gem that is the little Chinese Palace. Free entry to grounds. Some paths not wheelchair/pushchair friendly as paths covered in chipping.",
          "We drove out there so I'm not sure how easy it is on public transit. It was a pleasant area to walk around in with shady trees to sit under and a large manicured garden to enjoy. A few families were having an evening picnic which looked enjoyable.",
          "the building is large, the garden huge. He decorations in the palace not really that impressive, but the building looks great from the canal, the garden is huge, but not much there.",
          "We took a boat from near City Hall out to Drottingholm. It was a wonderful day trip out of the city. The hour long boat ride gives you views to Stockholm past downtown. Once we arrived we enjoyed the palace itself, which is reminiscent of Versailles, but smaller. The gardens",
          "We visited this place and arrival was via a ferry from the shore. The palace can be viewed only from outside. It was told that it is comparable to Versailles but it is not even a shade of that. Otherwise, the building is magnificent from outside and there is a scope to develop",
          "This was a nice 5 hours trip from downtown Stockholm with Stromma. Very nice location, beautiful rooms and a lovely park. The most interesting part for us was the visit to the Baroque theatre, one of only two original ones of this type on earth! The English language tour (30",
          "A wonderful place with a beautiful Palace, lakes, trees, birds, fountains and a vast garden - really worth visiting.",
          "My wife and I stopped here for a couple of hours on our way to our next destination. This was a really large palace with lots of grounds and a number of rooms that you can explore. We made it there as soon as it opened and were able to take a guided tour, that ended up being a",
          "We took the Stromma boat from Cityhall to Drottningholm Palace. A lovely 1hr. trip. Upon arriving we headed to the palace where we bought combi tickets to the palace and the Chinese Pavilion. We also decided to pay for the English tour, which we thought was definitely worth",
          "Drottningholm palace was a beautiful visit with exquisite rooms and gardens, with plenty to enjoy outside but inside was a let down as only a dozen rooms were open to enjoy. Personally wouldn\u2019t pay full price for a ticket as don\u2019t think that it is worth it for that expense,",
          "The palace was beautiful inside and out however a ticket doesn\u2019t allow you to visit much of the palace, perhaps a dozen rooms. I am a student and was able to visit at half the price of a full price ticket so it was worth the money for me, however I believe the full price tickets",
          "We took a boat trip there which was nothing special but totally worth while as you get closer to the palace . This is a magnificent building set in beautiful grounds. You can walk around most of it. Make Sure you check the maps on the way to the palace from the boat. Although",
          "I was fortunate to travel to the palace with lunch on the way out and tea returning which made a very pleasant outing, especially as I was on the older of the two boats. The palace was interesting but the tour was very rushed and our guide kept on asking other groups to move",
          "We took the boat from the City Hall pier to Drottningholm. The boat runs every hour and you can purchase tickets at the pier office. Once at Drottningholm, tickets are purchased inside. We used our Stockholm pass for transportation and palace entry fees. The Palace itself is",
          "Wonderful palace to visit and certainly worth going inside. Terrific garden at the rear of the palace.",
          "If you don\u2019t do the guided tour, there is not a lot of information available to read on your own. It\u2019s very well preserved so you can see how it\u2019s a UNESCO site. The gardens around the house are also beautiful. The Chinese Pavilion is worth the walk & you get to see the Guard",
          "Drottningholm is a beautiful compact royal palace on lake Malaren full of very unique Scandinavian treasures. I loved the. wonderful stare case, the queens official bedroom in all it's Rococo splendor, the library and the long room. The China Pavillion is such a splendid",
          "The Palace was such an interesting place to visit and in some ways I found it even more impressive compared to the Royal Palace in the city. The location is idyllic, the gardens are beautiful, the rooms in the palace are impressive. Tip - if you have a Stockholm Pass and a",
          "We took a dinner cruise to the palace on the Strommo vessel Prins Carl Philip. Would definitely recommend both the castle and a cruise out to see it, but sadly not the dinner. Appalling service and many items unavailable from the menu. Reminded us of fawlty towers sadly.",
          "Best enjoyed with the guided tour for the palace and theater. If you have visited palaces in France or Russia, this palace might be underwhelming. However, the theater shouldn\u2019t be missed. It\u2019s only one of two well preserved theater from 18th centuries.",
          "Choose that one tour, it is really nice, and I would say the best boat tour in Stockholm in general. One the boat there is a restaurant upstairs. That day Mr. Marre worked. He was so pleasant and kind to us. Recommended really delicious wine and some food. Thanks to him!",
          "This is a great day out and you will be surrounded by the beautiful past. Goof family excursion. Well worth your time.",
          "Visited in early summer, excellent wether on the day. Perfect for the enjoyable stroll in the large gardens. Paid entry to the palace. Impressive interiors alll in gold oak silk and paintings. Not much if you compare to rome or paris.",
          "Just gorgeous! The boat ride to the Palace was stunning, the grounds were stunning, and the palace was a beautiful building with lots of old stuff inside! Most impressed by the grounds! Also, a lovely cafe with lots of beautiful outside seating!",
          "Very nice place to visit. Theater is interesting.The Chinese Pavilion is nice but required a bit of walking to get to it. The inside palace does not contain much to see. The garden is nice, but did not have much floral or fountains to see. Would be nicer if they have some music",
          "This is a lovely castle to visit by ferry from Stockholm, takes around 50min one way. Only a small portion of the castle is open but it\u2019s \u2018boutique\u2019 feel is a nice change. Interior is stunning and lovely grounds to amble about Good restaurant / cafe if needed and toilet",
          "This is a must see place. A walk through this expansive location is simultaneously peaceful and beautiful.",
          "The palace is situated alongside water and has huge gardens on the other side. It looks really awesome from outside (we did not go in) and gardens are certainly worth spending couple of hours.",
          "Took a boat trip with Stroma boat company. A great way to travel to Drottingholm. The castle is amazing and well worth a visit. Do visit the theatre and Chinese pavillion as well.",
          "We had a lovely afternoon here, the palace is beautiful and the staff are friendly and knowledgable when we asked them questions. The ceilings were incredible. The gardens are so well kept and look stunning. There are many fountains and lovely flowers. The sun came out too so",
          "I have been to Drottningholm several times over the years. If the weather obliges, the gardens are superb and free of charge. On this occasion however, we decided to do the lot....House, Chinese Pavilion and Theatre. Getting there for the first English tour proved well worth",
          "Visited the gardens (free entry) which were slowly waking up to the spring. Excellent views and vibe, nice spots for a picnic, and cute ducklings. If coming from central Stockholm catch the Green Line metro to Brommaplan and then change to one of the many buses that serve",
          "Drottingolm palace ist beautiful what about the apartments or the garden. If you go there, plan your trip to go to old theather as it is one of 2 existing original theather togerher with that one in Cesky Krumlov where still the theather plays. I loved the way delegate spoke",
          "Impressive Swedish landmark. Really pleasant to stroll around, and drink in the history. All signs are in English, and explain what you are looking at. The on-site cafe is very popular and excellent quality. (But Swedish prices!). Take care the boat trip back to Stockholm centre",
          "I\u2019ve visited only two royal palace when I visited Europe and this is really a charming palace. I was enamored with the details! A must visit.",
          "This wonderful building surrounded by a huge lake and wonderful formal gardens is not to be missed if you are visiting Stockholm. There is a lovely Cafe in the grounds and the beautiful Chinese Pavilion which we would love to have seen but it hadn\u2019t opened yet for the season.",
          "The palace itself is structurally impressive inside and out; and many of the rooms are decorated handsomely with large tapestries, murals, painted ceilings and interesting furnishings. Visitor information is relatively sparse, though an audio or infrequent English guided tour",
          "Can\u2019t compare it with the glamorous palaces in Central Europe but I still find it quite nice, the rooms and interior furnishings..The garden was a little disappointing though..lake was partially frozen..",
          "We took boat trip to this palace. About 50 minutes ride. Nice exhibits. Maybe need more detail descriptions in English.",
          "Mediocre palace, with bad lighting, underwhelming interior (not comparable to versailles, palaces in copenhagen or st.petersburg). Not informative descriptions in the room: difficult to learn anything historical, who is painted in which context etc - not clear. Also cafeteria",
          "Though it is April and gardens are not in bloom, this was a delightful visit, complete with a Changing of the Guard at 12:15. We took the palace tour and our guide was excellent. Interesting how the various palace rooms are decorated in styles from different periods. We walked",
          "A beautiful palace with lots of ornate details and creative elements to observe. Consider getting the audio tour to know what you are looking at",
          "It is the private residence of the Swedish Royal Family, which is well preserved Royal Castle. It is surrounded by fantastic, well maintained gardens and fountains. Ideal for photos, picnics and afternoon tea.",
          "The Drottningholm Palace is the private residence of the Swedish royal family. It is located in Drottningholm. Built on the island Lov\u00f6n, it is one of Sweden's Royal Palaces. The palace and the beautiful park (from the year 1681) are mostly open to visitors year round. In 1991",
          "The Royal Palace is an essential visit, and don't be put off by its distance from the centre of Stockholm - it's easy to get to on Metro+Bus especially if you download the really user-friendly SL transport app. The Palace's rooms, passages, staircase and views are wonderful.",
          "The palace itself is nice. But I don't recall much after the visit. The most I remembered from the visit was actually the Court Theatre. It's a guided small group tour. You get to know the story about the theatre and the architect. You can see some of the original wallpaper in",
          "We took the metro first and then switched on a bus before arriving to the palace. Still owned by the Swedish royal family, it is available for visits and a UNESCO world heritage site. Originally built in the 16th century the present one dates to the 18th century. After visiting",
          "Go if you've got nothing planned for the day. Good boat ride to the palace. Lush green gardens and nice walks.",
          "We had nice weather and spent a good amount of time strolling the grounds. We didn't visit all of the buildings, but what we saw was beautiful and there were several interesting pieces to see inside the palace.",
          "The palace was beautiful with an interesting tour. Just right in length\u2014not too long. Boat ride out there was rlaxing and pretty.",
          "We traveled by boat to see the famous Palace and grounds on a beautiful summer day. What a treat! The boat ride was one of the highlights, actually, as it was so interesting to see all the other boats and ships around Stockholm as you head west towards the Palace. Even more",
          "The palace is huge, and numerous rooms are available for viewing. If you intend to see the Chinese Pavilion (located at the far end of the extensive gardens) and the Theater (separate ticket required), do plan enough time for your visit! I enjoyed all three, but felt at the",
          "Drottningholm palace is a private resident of Swedish Royal family. We went there by boat from Stockholm to Drottningholm. It is one hour ride through boat so sit back and enjoy the stunning views. Palace itself is beautifully constructed. There are beautiful formal gardens,",

          "I loved walking around this place, around the gardens, through the palace and best of all the old theatre with its fantastic manual and very realistic sound effects. The guide was very informative and also entertaining at the same time. Definitely a beautiful place to go and",
          "Interesting view to the recent history of Sweden (visited on 27 Jan 2018). Walking from one room to another, listening to stories and experience what it meant to live here. Amazing gardens.",
          "City bus was very convenient, but the boat trip looked like fun also. Other places on the property were a pleasant stroll away if the weather is fine, as it was on the day of my visit. There was an interesting video in the back of the gift shop.",
          "Its not the Versailles in Paris... Its not the Schonbrun in Vienna... Its not the Royal Palace in Madrid... But Drottningholms Palace is still big, beautiful, and worth half your day. An added bonus of being unpopular: less tourist crowds! We didn't see a lot of tourists as we",
          "We skipped visiting the palace itself because it was a wonderful sunny day and we preferred to go for a walk in the gardens ! Really beautiful place ! The fountains with sculptures of ancient heroes, the nicely trimmed bushes in the shape of a maze, the picturesque houses of the",
          "It's an easy trip out to the palace. Take the metro green line to Brommaplan and switch to a bus to the palace gates. You can walk around the grounds for free or pay to look inside. It's a bit extra for a guided tour but I'd recommend it.",
          "Nice place and nice palace - it gives you an idea and knowledge about Swedish history and rulers. The palace is not so big neither so rich as similar objects, you can visit in the other European countries but some rooms are really unique. I was genuinely impressed with the",
          "Definitely worth the price to see both the palace and the palace theater\u3002 Visited at off-peak season, must join the guided tour if you wanna visit the theater. But the ticket is definitely worth it!!! Staffs are friendly and willing to answer your questions. The palace and",
          "We got the ferry from the city which took an hour and was very scenic. The walk around the grounds was really beautiful, especially with all the autumn trees. We did a self guided tour of the palace, which wasn't worth the admission fee to be honest. The rooms did have",
          "Plan on spending more time outside vs in. The interior is of course impressive (its a palace, what's not to be impressed over). But compared to other palaces in Europe, the grounds here are like no other! Seriously could spend a day just walking them. BEST seen in spring",
          "Great place to visit the palace The park is beautiful to relax and enjoy with the nice weather during my visit I would recommend and must to visit",
          "My family and I had a very calm and relaxed visit to this palace. We took the metro then the bus to the palace, had lunch at the adjoining palace cafe before making our way into the palace to take a look around. It was so quiet in the palace, it felt like we had the palace to",
          "Drottningholm was my favorite site to visit in Stockholm. We took the ferry from City Hall and it was a very pleasant ride. The palace is beautiful and they have a large garden area to explore as well.",
          "Not to be missed. Offers great chances for photographers to take panoramic and landscape shots. Take a leisurely walk through this treasure and you will not be disappointed.",
          "The palace is situated on a beautiful lake and the extensive gardens offer a great walk around the grounds. We went during the week for opening time and only one tour bus and a few other people were there so it was a very relaxing experience touring the palace. We also took the",
          "This beautiful castle is still used by the Royals, and no wonder! What a breathtakingly beautiful place it is. It is far enough out of the city to be peaceful and quiet, and the grounds and gardens are extensive, adding to the feeling of being far from the city. We took a",
          "About 10km outside of the city centre. Took approx 40 mins from Gamla Stan station (changing onto a bus at Brommaplan). Large \"stately home\" style building, which has numerous rooms to view on two floors. Additionally you can see the original theatre (additional cost) which was",
          "Accessible by the metro and short bus journey (clearly labelled on the bus stops), we spent our first morning at the royal palace on the edge of Stockholm. Grand, but not overly ornate on the outside, the palace is still a royal building in use, but many of the more historic",
          "First up, we only toured the gardens, which were free. We decided against paying to see the palace and the Chinese Pavilion as we were already disappointed with what we saw at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. More of the same we didn\u2019t want. Having said that, I had expected more",
          "The place is very nice for a visit if you have the time when you are in Stockholm. The gardens are (obviously) very nice kept with fountains, so it is very nice to go for walks. If you like photography you will have a field day. Parking is free if you come by car, which is nice",
          "Take some time and peruse the gardens - they are beautiful and well cared for. Many opportunities for photographs near the fountains. The palace is very similar to Versailles - quite ornate, colorful and special, but not as extensive as Versailles! There are not a lot of",
          "I have been with my friends in this gorgeous palace, where king lives (some people say that sometimes It\u2019s also possible to see him while walking into his garden). Inside, elegance and beauty are no longer celebrated. We had visit into the palace and Chinese pavilion. We could",
          "The King of Sweden actually lives here! The grounds are huge and beautifully landscaped with trees and fountains and various historic buildings including the Palace, Chinese Pavilion and Court Theater. It\u2019s a World Heritage Site, and the grounds are open to the public year",
          "The Royal Family stay in one of the wings of the palace so parts of the grounds and the building are not accessible. Within the grounds there are formal gardens, ornamental lakes and islands, fountains, the Chinese Pavilion and the Theatre Royal although the last 2 are charged",
          "We had a wonderful guided tour of the palace, the gardens and some of the outbuildings. The guides were informative and the history lesson very interesting. The gardens are pretty and it is a nice walk. This is also the residence of the King and Queen who live in one wing of",
          "A very nice showpiece for the capital located in a very accessible area to those who are visiting. Go see the family jewels.",
          "We rode quite a distance from our place to stay to reach Drottingholm. The Palace was a little disappointing to be honest and for us a little expensive as well. Not recommended unless you have a lot of time.",
          "We visited here via a relaxing boat trip for free on the Stockholm pass and the view was absolutely stunning as we cruised in towards the palace. The area is really very peaceful and beautiful (see attached photos) and feels like a lifetime away from the city. The palace itself",
          "Drottningholms slott is a beautiful place. Besides the castle it self there is the old theatre which is original and also the China house, worth while a small walk. It is very nice to go there by boat from Stockholm city center. It will make a full day in the beautiful lake",
          "This is a wonderful day trip,outing from Stockholm. Take a leisurely boat trip,to this Palace. A self guided tour takes you through two floors with beautiful ornate rooms and furnishings. The surrounding garden area beautiful with manicured lawns and fountains. Great spot for",
          "Lovely palace and beautiful garden, besides absolutely worth additional attention is Chinese Royal Pavilion from 18-century, not far from the Drottningholm palace. It is also Unesco World Heritage Site. Take a steam boat from Stockholm city with nice lunch onboard.",
          "I might be the only person who wasn\u2019t a huge fan of Versailles. So if you liked Versailles, you will like Drottningholm. If you\u2019re like me though, Drottningholm might be a waste of time and money. It\u2019s pretty expensive with the boat ride, entrance fee and fees for the other",
          "So I was a little disappointed... First we took the Ferry. It\u2019s a nice way to see things from the river. It stops in front of the palace. Pretty easy. The palace itself is ok. If the weather is nice, the gardens are lovely to stroll around. However, they have a lot of it",
          "Most tourists probably go as we did by ferry. The ferry is very comfortable, the trip is pleasant and very scenic. The palace is impressive, but really not very special compared to others in Europe. If you've never seen a royal palace, you'll be impressed. If you have, you'll be",
          "Great day. A boat trip to a magnificent palace with manicured grounds. In places it was grand like Versailles",
          "we travelled by boat and spent a good deal of time going round the palace and the gardens. It was a very enjoyable visit with lots to see and some reasonable commentary in English. Some impressive rooms and contents",
          "Make sure to use the WC before you go in the palace. It is bit of walk to go and come back. We had conducted tours when we went in so it was a bit difficult to squeeze through them in the rooms. The King and his family still live there. It takes around 40 minutes by the",
          "A fairytale view from the water of a fairytale castle. Ok inside but is looking very worn and dated due to its age. Lots and lots of paintings. Makes you wonder why any family would need so many rooms. Outside the gardens are worth the trip by themselves. They just go on and on",
          "On a 3 day visit to Stockholm, we had a bit of time to do some out of Stockholm tourism. We chose to go to Drottningholm for the simple fact that he is a listed world heritage site and we are also suckers for palaces and royal history. I have to admit that the setting is great",
          "Amazing restored opera house - excellent performance with comfortable seats. You can walk around the palace and if you want also have a drink and snack in the interval. About 30 minutes from the centre.",
          "Taking into account this Palace is a UNESCO World Heritage site, I made an effort to travel on my own by metro and then bus to get there. The palace is beautiful and spectacular. In front of it, there is a calm and clear lake. At the back of the palace, there is a very greenery",
          "This must be one of the most boring places I have visited in Sweden. There's nothing particularly wrong with Drottningholm castle, but compared to most European castles it's simply cold and unattractive. In order to save on maintenance they've also covered half of the garden",
          "A really nice environment with a beautiful park! You\u2019re allowed to walk the whole area. You can either bring a a basket with some food, or enjoy the restaurant in the park. This is a nice day trip and also were our King and Queen lives. Even in the autumn it\u2019s beautiful to",
          "Even if you have seen many palaces, and are suffering from palace fatigue, Drottingham still merits a trip. It has lovely gardens, an interesting history and still has the royal family residing here. The guided tour was excellent, but a highlight was the Royal Theater. The only",
          "Add this place to your list, but I would avoid paying extra for the guided tour. Not worth it. The palace is cool",
          "The home of the King & Queen. Absolutely loved seeing this amazing castle. Grounds were well maintained. Go early to avoid the crowds. The rooms were spectacular. Loved reading avout the former royal families. Loved the artwork",
          "A pleasant boat ride took us to this nice palace. It\u2019s not as ornate or gilt as palaces in other places but has many incredible tapestries. It\u2019s kept dim, probably to preserve the tapestries, but in places, it feels a little dreary. It is a nice wat to spend a half day.",
          "We travelled to and from Drottningholm Palace by boat and enjoyed a visit of several hours. The palace is sensational, with high-ceilinged, richly decorated rooms put to various uses over time. We really enjoyed the Queen's bedchamber and the many beautifully appointed rooms.",
          "Enjoyed the day trip to the palace. We caught the ferry in the morning and spent the day at the palace. The exhibits are well kept and the gardens at the back of the palace are great for a picnic and exploring. They are worth visiting. The Chinese theater is well worth a visit",
          "Drottningholm is quite impressive. The guided tour was very well done. We also enjoyed walking the gardens and seeing the China Palace located at the end of the gardens. It's an easy and a relatively quick trip to get to the Palace from Stockholm via metro and a local bus",
          "Took the drottingholm boat from near the City hall. Boat ride was scenic. Drottningholm was interesting. Not as elegant as some other European palaces, but definitely worth the visit.",
          "Drottningholm means the Queens palace, and for our daughters - an empowering story about woman who rule (that and Elsa of course..) - the English tour was very interesting and especially Hdwig Elenora was a very intriguing queen...",
          "We took the ferry to the palace which was a lovely way to get there and back (it takes about an hour). On arrival, we made our way to the main palace and wandered through on our own - it's well marked and easy to visit on your own although I would have liked a guided tour as",
          "The one hour trip on the lake is very pleasant and not too long. The palace is beautiful and quite interesting, although not on the level of some of the other European palaces. Nice restaurant outside the palace to have lunch.",
          "A very pleasant ferry ride out from Stockholm is a spectacular way to arrive at the Palace. The tour is short, given the size of the place and we were done in a little over an hour so were left a little disappointed. The grounds are extensive but there is little that can't be",
          "Hakan Frandan our incredible travel guide gave us an in depth tour of Drottningholm Palace. So much to see and learn. Highly recommend those interested in learning more about royalty and relationships of the members of the Royal families all related yet ruling various monarchies",
          "A visit in the summer. Wonderful short ferry ride to Drottningholm, the ride itself was an experience as we saw beautiful houses on the way. Grounds and palace jaw-dropping from the outside. Interiors like what you would expect of a summer palace. Restaurant on the grounds",
          "The Palace is outside the city center and takes some zigging and zagging to access. A few points: 1. A lot of folks take a boat trip to get here and back. This takes over twice as long as taking public transport. It's scenic, but if you're short on time, I'd go the public",
          "Lovely transfer on the lake from the ferry point at the City Hall. Nice boat. No safety drill. No life jackets, Bit of a surprise in such as a safety mad country but there you go. Can be chill on the lake even in summer, so bring a fleece if you want to sit outside. Lovely",
          "In addition to a fabulous palace, there is a wonderful garden that deserves some time to just stroll through. Be sure to take the tour of the theater as well as walk to the Chinese Pavilion, which is quite a long walk from the palace. They also have an ecellent cafe for lunch",
          "I used my Stockholm Pass and rode the boat out here from near City Hall. My boat was not as crowded as some reviews complain about. Get there early, que up and grab a seat quickly. The ride was picturesque and I enjoyed seeing the little beaches with all the Swedes out",
          "A very beautiful gardens. One can spend a good few hours strolling in one of the most beautiful ngarfens I have been to. it is so tranquil and wherever you walk there is always something to see and appreciate",
          "Our concierge recommended the Stromma boat to Drottningholm. On a sunny summer day, it was a great way to go. The ride took a little under an hour. At the palace, you can sign up for a guided tour in English. The tour takes 45 minutes, and our guide, Anni, was great. She gave us",
          "At 9 AM, we boarded the T 19 metro at T-Centralen (using our 7 day Senior SL Cards-220 SEK each), arriving less than 30 minutes later at Brommaplan Station. Here we descended to McDonald's and passed a large fruit/produce market to find Bus #176 for the 2 km to the Palace. At",
          "We have bought the combined ticket with the boat trip on the place near the town hall. The ticket officer told us the wrong port number from where the boat departs, therefore we've got almost no sitting place on the board. The trip was joyful, the strand and the recreation areas",

          "My girlfriend surprised me when she said we are going to Drottningholm palace. We had the most amazing beautiful time together there. We travelled by boat from Stockholm which takes around 30 minuets as there is a few stops , I hear your able to get the bus But when it\u2019s the",
          "It is far from being the Versailles of the North as I've seen it advertised in some places. The castle itself is just like any other one, the grounds and gardens are rather dull - nothing that really catches your eye. Well, at least it's free to walk around the gardens.",
          "The Drottningholm Palace is the private residence of the Swedish royal family, located near Stockholm. Opening times: 10am-5pm The main attractions are the gardens which are breathtaking.",
          "We took our American cousin for a couple of hours of Swedish history. We strolled in the fantastic park and watched the castles. Some easy and nice hours spent.",
          "It takes 3 Hrs to go and come back for a 45-minute visit ... unless you have lot of time in hand you can give a pass and avoid taking the ferry as it takes longer to reach",
          "Drottningholm Palace, itself, is somewhat underwhelming, especially if you have been to some of the grander palaces in Europe. However, the grounds and the adjacent theater, the latter of which can only be seen by tour, are much more interesting. Combined with the beautiful",
          "The palace is on the island of Lovon on the shores of Lake Malaren. A boat trip brings visitors in about 50 minutes from the city center, from the Stockholm City Hall to the Royal Drottningholm region.",
          "Beautiful palace, great history, nice tour and grounds, took subway and bus from City Center, was easy fast",
          "This is the official residence of the King of Sweden. It is located about 1 hour by boat outside of Stockholm. The boat leaves from the City Hall area and makes a couple of stops along the way to Drottningholm Palace. On arrival, there is an information area and a cafe. The view",
          "I suggest to spend at least half day in the Palace area & check the boat schedule before you go. The main Palace is wonderful, the Drottningholm Court Theatre is worth to go if you\u2019re a drama/play lover. There\u2019s tour for the theatre around 30 mins. For me, a Chinese to go",
          "Drottning means Queen. You need to take a ferry to get to this place since it is not near the town center. The palkace became more newsworthy when iot was heard that the Royal Jewels were stolen.",
          "The current royal family residence an hours boat trip from Stockholm Interesting collection of antiques and memorabilia Good caf\u00e9 and outdoor seating area The Chinese pavilion is a long walk through the grounds and charges another entrance fee - not really worth it",
          "Most definitely worth a visit; it\u2019s approximately a 1 hour boat ride from city center but as you approach the palace, you\u2019ll understand why it\u2019s worth a visit. Once you disembark, there are a number of items you can see and tour on the estate, to include the Chinese Pavilion (a",

          "The Palace is served by ferries and we used the Stromma ferry to take us along the waterways to the Palace so much to see from the water and then a lovey Palace at the end. Our ferry ticket included entry and we found it very interesting with links to various other places we had",
          "We took the boat cruise from Central Stockholm to Drottningholm. The boat leaves from near City Hall and over the course of an hour cruises through part of the archipelago past summer and vacation homes and small swimming spots to Drottningholm. I wouldn't call the boat itself",
          "A wing of Drottningholm Palace is the home of Sweden's modern royals but the rest of the Palace and the entire Gardens are open to the public. We travelled across by a little steamboat and enjoyed a delicious formal lunch on the way before wandering through the public areas of",
          "We took a boat/ferry to the palace and seeing it from the water gives you the opportunity to take in the size of the palace. What a beauty this palace. Stockholm had a heat wave during our stay and although we wanted a walk through the gardens it was just too hot so we opted for",
          "Eventhough we went in peak season, it wasn't too busy and well worth the time to visit. The palace itself looks really grand as you approach it by water. Many reviewers were disappointed that the palace inside wasn't as luxurious as others in Europe but for me this was the",
          "This was something on my list to visit while in Stockholm and while I like the view of the palace and the gardens were really nice too, once inside the palace I wasn\u2019t really too impressed. Having been to the Stockholm palace and feeling disappointed, I was hoping that this one",
          "A distant beauty I'd say but close up a bit of an also ran. Not too much to see inside and the grounds are very formal and a little sterile. The boat trip takes an hour and the ride is not terribly scenic either but crowded and stuffy, especially when its 32c and the engine is",

          "Took the 1hr ferry ride out to the palace. Bit warm this time of year so find a seat with some fresh air out of the sun or head into the restaurant and buy a drink to escape the crowds. Nice little cruise and then spent a couple of hours looking around. Nice spot with some great",
          "It was totally by accident that we ended up at Drottningholm at about 10pm just as the sun was setting. We had the place almost totally to ourselves. This made the visit more enjoyable and our photos better. Of course we couldn't do any tours, but just exploring the beautiful",
          "Take the nice 50 minute ferry right out to the palace and then enjoy the Palace, the Theatre and the Chinese Pavilion. Buy a combined ticket in Stockholm and avoid the lines once you get here. Look to spend about 3 hours or so in total, but well worth it.",
          "The palace is huge, but parts of it are underwhelming. This palace is better looking than the Royal Palace where all official affairs are handled. However, there were plain wooden floors which would have been covered with parquet designs. Instead you saw wood like the rafters of",
          "If you haven\u2019t planned a trip to Drottningholm while inStockholm you\u2019ll be missing a worthwhile experience. Check out the Theater Tour behind the main castle. Caroline was our guide and was amazing. Her knowledge base and command of English (including humor) was fantastic.",
          "Being one of the most visited tourist attractions in Stockholm I am sorry to say it is a bit overrated. We took the boat to Drottningholm which was expensive and crowded with little opportunity to see anything through the very small windows. That is such a pity since the rural",

          "The Palace was a 45 minute boat ride from City Hall. As we had taken several other boat trips around Stockholm, the boat trip was pleasant, but nothing new to see during the 45 minutes there and 45 minutes back. The Palace is well kept, but has been said before, does not take",
          "More than the palace, the lawns make for a great spot in the summer. When we went there was a live band, so good idea to carry drinks and eats and plan a half day there",
          "Although we were unable to visit inside the palace we had access to see the garden which had many varieties of flowers and rose beds.",
          "It was a cool building and gardens but for some reason i was expecting to be more impressed. The boat ride over was nice and the scenery was great on the journey. Maybe it was because we had been to some other more impressive palaces in the same week. Doesn't take too much",
          "We didn't go on a tour of the palace but chose to wander through the extensive gardens as it was a warm & sunny day. As it was early spring, the various trees were just beginning to bud but it was an interesting place to visit. We took the subway and bus to the palace and had no",
          "What incredible trip in stokholm. We decide to have a trip on the lake because other trip were all busy. Two hours and half in relax and we also decide to have dinner on the boat. Good dinner and very good service on to taste a fantastic dinner during the trip. Prices are",
          "The Palace is beautiful from the outside, but the interior is not so impressive. One can visit only a small portion of it as it is the residence of the king. Apart from the beautiful library, I don't think it stands in one line with other famous European palaces. The grounds are",
          "Badly signed, badly lit, captions dryly factual with far too much detail, much of the furniture had covers over it and dirty toilets. Crowd management for the changing of the guard chaotic. Soldiers were pushing people out of the way to clear the area.",
          "The palace was not open on the day we were there so we enjoyed the gardens and the Royal Theater. We took the ferry back to the city from here. Delightful day.",
          "It is an official residence palace of current King and Queen located outskirts of Stockholm city. the surrounding places around is very beautiful, one side is sea side view and another side is lake. The park behind the palace is very nice and well maintained. Its an ideal place",
          "The palace is really beautiful. If you choose to go see the changing of the guard, just know that is can get very crowded and lasts for about an hour! It's nice to see, but prepare yourself for elaborate and likely crowded. The castle itself was very nice to visit at any time",
          "Only saw the grounds of the palace. Arrived by Stromma steamer ship from central Stockholm. Excellent grounds and the palace looked lovely. Everywhere guarded by palace guards. Had a lovely time. Highly recommend visiting.",
          "Took my parents here and my mom is in a wheel chair. We were surprised to find that not only are there loads of stairs in without a lift but after asking the staff about options, they said they have a chair lift but they refused to use it as we didn\u2019t call a day in advance - ?",
          "We took the ferry from Stockholm to Drottningholm. It is a pleasant trip and when you arrive you have a dramatic view of the summer palace. We enjoyed visiting the palace, gardens, Chinese Pavilion, and theatre. We took the 11am ferry from Stockholm and returned on the 4pm",
          "We were only in Stockholm for 3 days so wanted to make the most of our visit and take in as many sights as we could. The Palace is well worth a visit. We took the boat trip to get there as that was lovely as well with lots to see. I don't have great 'sea legs' so wasn't",
          "An old palace going back to the 16th centuray situated in a very nice location around Stockholm with all the touristic features, cafe, free parking anf free rest rooms. Rather high entrance fees but worth it. A must see if you are to visit the 11 castles in Sweden.",
          "There are two gardens well worth walking through. The King and his family lives in one part of the castle but the rest is open to the public. Interesting to see the changes that happend through the centuries when it comes to furniture, clothes and paintings.",
          "AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION: the walkways around the property are small pea gravel, so don\u2019t wear sandals/open shoes unless you want to be dealing with rocks in your shoes (or your kids\u2019 shoes) all day! We took the Stromma ferry round trip w/palace entry included with our six",
          "We took the Stromma boat ride to get to the palace. To and fro ticket costs 220 kr. Fine baroque building. Amazing baroque garden. Impressive theatre. Nice to look at, nicer still to take photos for remembrance.",
          "Lots of lovely shops very busy but nice to see traditional Swedish souvenirs and traditional sweet shops . The tube stations is there and bus stops for most bus routes",
          "We took the boat trip (included in our Stockholm pass) from Stockholm City Hall to the palace and it looked very impressive arriving on the water. I would recommend that if you do this, you are up early to get an early boat there as it gets very busy later on in the day and",
          "With one day in Stockholm before we left for the National Park, visiting the palace was a highlight for us. The place is huge, so take your time, and to think how people managed to live here, impressive. The park is prefect to walk around and it's not really necessary to get a",
          "I'd have liked more written explanations in the palace rooms but pleasant stroll around beautiful rooms, gardens and Chinese Pavilion anyway.",
          "This is an amazing place to go, especially if you are fascinated in the history of a city like Stockholm.",
          "The boat ride to and from Drottningholm Palace was absolutely beautiful and the history was interesting. The palace itself is lovely but I was surprised that the paint work was old and it seemed like to.maintenance needed to be done. Once again, great history. We also saw the",
          "The palace itself was impressive, but not overly interesting. The gardens were pleasant and the Chinese Pavilion was more interesting as long as you don't mind a long walk to get there. The theatre, only accessible on an English tour that is built into the entry fee, was",
          "After spending a good half hour trying to figure out parking (a common occurrence on our trip) we got to spend a good couple of hours walking around the palace grounds. The palace itself was still closed for the season, but the small amount of tourists allowed us to get great",
          "Maybe i visited in the wrong order. The palace in old town is amazing; this palace is beautiful on the outside and grounds. The interior wasn't any thing nearly as impressive as the other. I didn't feel well, so I wasn't able to see the touted Chinese pavilion or the theater.",
          "We took the boat from Stockholm City Hall to Drottningholm on an exquisite day. The arrival by boat is stunning. This is where the the king and queen reside. The tour of the palace was excellent. Many of the rooms are ornate and of considerable interest. The exterior",
          "We took the boat I get there. It takes about an hour and is the best way to get there. Peaceful and nice. The palace itself is marvellous, and a walk a round the palace garden is highly recommended. It\u2019s a don\u2019t miss off a visitor.",
          "We took the subway & bus there, which was easy and reasonably priced. Just bought tour of palace & Chinese pavilion ( which we liked best). Walked the grounds-very nice. Took the boat back-last minute decision-they had space & we bought tickets on board. Rode in upstairs",
          "The ferry ride to the island takes about 50 minutes and takes one through waterways and past islands that dot the landscape. The palace is beautiful and they provide explanations in Swedish and English in each room, but it is worth it to invest the extra money (30SEK/person) for",
          "This is a very nice palace, but we didn't learn much from reading the signs while walking through the rooms. I wish we had taken the guided tour, as I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more. That said, it wasn't a huge stand out for us among the palaces we have been lucky enough to",
          "If you just visit the palace itself you are missing some gems - make sure you go on one of the guided tours of the theatre which is just as it was in the 18th century - also walk down to the Chinese Pavilion which is absolutely fascinating. Cafe by the palace is reasonably",
          "Nice day out, peaceful boat ride from Stockholm to the palace. The palace gardens are beautiful and some good photo opportunities. The palace itself there are better out there so I wouldn\u2019t pay to go in.",
          "Got there via an hour boat trip. Nice grounds. Packed a picnic too. Don't bring large bags. They disallow them in the palace.",
          "The grounds are very well maintained and nice. The palace is interesting. You may be best taking a guided tour as the signs did not provide a great deal of information. The room are also not often large enough for a few individuals and a large tour group. We took a train and bus",
          "The Palace grounds were pretty. You can see the guards in the front and rear standing near the palace, including a woman guard. Stockholm is known for fighting for equal treatment of women and men.",
          "I had a great time here. be sure to get the tour in yor language. It's only around 45 minutes with a treasure trove of information .",
          "The palace is breathtakingly gorgeous...full of history and the rich culture of the Swedish people. Stopped for lunch at the cafe and the soup was amazing! Worth the visit any time!",
          "Didn't go inside but the outside was. Accessible and so was the shop. It is certainly a beautiful old palace.",
          "The palace is quite old. Floors squeak while you walk around. Very dark. Pictures on walls sometimes barely visible. Gardens are vast. Pity one needs to pay additional entrance fees for theaters and special gardens.",
          "A beautiful setting and lovely voyage by steamship from central Stockholm. Definitely worth doing, but don't expect a very sophisticated visitor experience in the palace. Very traditional and formal. Very little interpretation for the main house and not enough joy in their jobs!",
          "Take the boat here guys - the views up the river are fabulous (weather permitting) and when you turn the ben of the river, the Place appears in front of you and to the port side of the ferry as you approach the small dock - a perfect photo opportunity The inside of the palace",
          "This palace is huge like most palaces I visited in Europe. Lots of walking expected if exploring the place is desired. Recommended to visit during summer.",
          "We made the easy train and bus ride to Drottningholm using our Transit Pass. It was still early in the season so there were not a great many people there. The grounds and the palace are beautiful. I am sure that they are even better when everything is in full bloom. The",
          "Very nice garden. The chinese pavillon is lovely. The confidence is interesting to see. You have to pay extra cost for the theatre... The castle itself is like other castles in Europe (Sch\u00f6nnbrunn, Versailles etc...)",
          "I have been here lot of times. One of my favourite spot on earth. Landscape, park and castle architecture is in world class. Here can you walking around and feel how wonderful this place is.",
          "Really unique experience. Place where palace was built is really has magnetism. This is a complex of the exotic Chinese Pavilion pleasure palace, the palace theatre and the place where Swedish royal family lives.",
          "During our visit in Stockholm for 5 days we bought the Stockholm pass and we enjoyed the Drottningholm Palace during one afternoon. The place is nice, you need around 2 hours to visit almost all of it - the museum inside, the garden and the lake near it. The Chinese pavilion was",
          "Too much time spent on Queen Hedvig. Seating furniture very plain and throne missing. Some giltwood tables and looking glasses, but those used to the magnificent furnishings of royal palaces in England, France and Vienna will be disappointed. Excellent faux marble.",
          "We planned to take a boat ride using our Stockholm City Pass, but the lake was still frozen at the end of March, so we took a train and bus to the palace. We toured the palace and grounds on our own reading the signs available in English. Our favorite part was a guided tour of",
          "My husband and I visited the palace a week ago and found it to be great! It\u2019s definitely worth the trip from Stockholm! Definitely recommend the Stockholm pass!",
          "This place is nice but if you have seen other castles in France or in the UK this one is a bit overated - the palace is relatively small and the entry fee expensive for what it is. I would not recommend it.",
          "Drottningholm Palace is the permanent residence of the Swedish Royal family. This UNESCO World Heritage site is the most well-preserved royal castle built in the 1600s in Sweden. It's located on the island of Lov\u00f6n. We had a wonderful tour of the palace with a very",

          "The Palace and the gardens are very beautiful. Nice place outside the Stockholm. I would recommend everyone to visit it. It's easy to reach by metro and bus or boat.",
          "Beautiful grounds and great for an explore if you like looking at these types of things (like me). Can't remember cost, but was good.",
          "Such beautiful grounds and such a peaceful environment. After 2 weeks of stomping around Scotland and France, it was a welcome break. Revitalizing.",
          "If you are lucky and the weather is fine its an amazing place. We took a boat to get there and the trip was ~1 hour long but with a couple of stops. When we arrived the weather changed and we had loads of sunshine and we could visit the Garden and the Chinese Pavilion. Definetly",
          "This palace is a bit out Stockholm itself, but it's not too hard to get to (Google maps is always my friend with its public transport option). This is a really nice palace with beautiful gardens. However, as palaces go, it's by no means the best in Europe.",
          "This was the best place we visited in Stockholm. The castle is beautiful with big garden around. It is reachable by the bus, not far from the city. I highly recommend this place.",
          "I've seen a lot of Palaces in Asia and Europe, and I like virtually all of them. Drottningholm is by no means the biggest nor the most \"beautiful\" but it is in a marvelous location with very nice gardens. I like the Chinese Pavilion and the theater. We ate lunch here, too,",
          "My wife and I met a friend from college and his wife at Drottningholm Palace during our trip to Sweden this past summer. My friend had been a foreign exchange student and stayed the year in our fraternity house in 1971. It had been over 45 years since we had seen each other.",

          "Beautiful palace in a beautiful setting. Do not miss visiting Drottingham Palace-especially the grounds!",

          "The wooden theatre was very interesting, especially given that it was used as potato shed at one time when the occupants of the palace lost interest in the theatre. The grounds are quite vast and one can walk quite a distance, so time your boat trip accordingly. You'll need a",

          "This place is amazing. There is a Baroque style room that is very well preserved. Very interesting. Also a beautifully preserved Gobelin tapestry that hangs in one of the rooms which was gifted by Louis the 16th. It is quite detailed, and worth seeing alone.",

          "If you\u2019ve been to Versailles or Sch\u00f6nbrun, this is just another palace, and that\u2019s true for the building and the gardens, the really different is the scenery, the wonderfull trip by boat at M\u00e4laren lake, and the picture of the palace reflecting into the water",

          "This is the home of the Swedish Royal Family, and is set a little way out of Stockholm. You can get here via buses, but I took a steamboat which I think was a nicer way to arrive. The house sits facing the sea and it's worth walking along to get a view from across the water",

          "This attraction has two sides and is a personal opinion. On one hand, the boat ride to get there is very enjoyable and the palace itself is a beautiful building. However, once you visit the inside, it almost makes you sick when you see all over extravagant rooms and furnishings.",
          "While the grounds and gardens are compared to Versailles, I did not think it reached those levels. However the grounds, which are free to wander, are extensive and beautiful in good weather. Don't just concentrate on the palace, but also visit the Chinese pavilion. I thought the",
          "Well as mentioned before it really looks like the Schonbrunn of Sweden. We did not bother to go inside as it would be probably similar to any other palace. The garden is really huge and beautiful. You can get lost there for a couple of hours. If you are 3-5 persons rent a car to",

          "By chance I decided to go on one of the boat trips. I chose the one going to the Palace and I have to admit I enjoyed it to the fullest. The approx 1-hour voyage gives you an opportunity to see Stockholm from the other perspective as well as to see some houses situated farther",
          "It is a lovely day or half day trip out to Drottningholm. The theatre is well worth a visit and a stroll through the park is perfect in nice weather. A faster way to get back into town is the bus and subway but the boat is a nice trip as well.",
          "Boat ride was not too pleasant--crammed on the deck of an overcrowded boat when it was starting to drizzle rain. Palace is nice--but I've seen Buckingham palace and some in Germany that make this kind of \"average\" by comparison.",
          "The combination of the boat ride out here (which isn't the only approach, but is the best one), the beautiful setting and the manageable number of tourists made this a good half day out. I think this is likely to have been a much better experience than touring the palace in the",

          "Although the Palace itself was not one of my favorites, the history of the theater and the theater itself is well worth the visit. Be sure to leave time to explore the grounds. The ferry ride over was also beautiful & made the visit even better.",

          "Our Stockholm Pass got us a free boat ride to the palace and free admission to the palace. The boat ride is OK, as is the Palace. Just OK. The few Palace rooms that are available to tour have very little in them, and the placards that describe the rooms are small, few, and",
          "The boat ride is beautiful specially if you can do it in a sunny day. The palace is small and dark, nothing surprising except for the library that is quite original. Fine if you have enough time if you don't have much time just consider the boat ride",
          "After enjoying the Rotal Palance in central Stockholm we were expecting something truly spectacular, we were disappointed. We tool tube and bus to get to Palace which is very easy. First shock the Palace is located alongside a major dual carriageway , really odd. We paid to get",
          "Lovely park and gardens. Exteriors are very imposing viewed both from Malaren Lake at the front and the garden and woods/ponds at the rear. Interiors were not to our taste and we did not spend long inside, but the main Staircase is spectacular and worth making the effort to go",
          "Getting here from Central Stockholm, one can opt either for a boat trip, or bus. They both take the same time ( roughly 1 hr), so I would definitely recommend the boat! Both the palace and the gardens are beautiful, and you'll need about 1.5-2 hrs to truly appreciate what this",
          "Visited in early spring, but even then it was quite warm and some flowers were already blooming. Great park for a half a day walk behind the palace. As for getting to and from, I'd recommend to take a boat to the palace and use bus + metro from the palace. That way, on your way",
          "Drottningholm Palace is the private residence of the Swedish Royal Family and is open to the public for tours. It is about an hour north of Stockholm, and you can get there by car, bus or by an excursion boat from Stockholm. It is well worth a visit. Unlike a lot of European",

          "We took a steam boat from Stockholm City which took about an hour to get to the palace. The first view of the palace from the boat is stunning and the interior doesn't fail to impress - very ornate and beautiful as you would expect. The gardens are perfectly manicured and make",
          "Palace exterior is as beautiful as its interiors. Gardens are very nice as well. Interior may not be as appealing as some of high-end palaces in Europe but is certainly very interesting, even better if you decide to take the guided tour for only 30 SEK extra you can get a better",

          "Took the boat which was pleasant. Did not do the guided tour and wish we had as there is no audio tour available. The grounds were lovely. We didn't eat at the restaurant by the boat but the food we saw being served looked delicious.",

          "This beautiful Royal Castle with its beatiful garden is a must when you visit Stockholm Sweden. It is not placed in the center of Stockholm but not to far to go there. This is where the King and Queen of Sweden lives.",
          "The best thing about seeing the palace is the boat ride to get there, it leaves from near city hall and is not expensive. The ride to the palace is about an hour and is a great journey. The Palace itself is nice to look at but any more than an hour and you're bored. Have a bite",
          "Drottningholm Palace is just a 1-hour boat ride away from Gamla Stan in Stockholm. The boat, made in 1928 surprisingly stood up to all modern standards (A/C, W/C, Optional Restaurant, etc\u2026). Providing the weather agrees with you, the view from both sides was very picturesque.",
          "This is a perfect place to visit on a lovely day. The boat trip only takes about an hour and the house, Chinese pavillion and theater can all be seen within a few hours. While the house was inspired by Versailles, it does not come close but it is still worth a visit. The",

          "We took the boat from the city hall area in Stockholm, to and from the palace. Between the boat ride (50 minutes each way), and the visit to the palace and grounds, it pretty much ate up a good part of the day. We were disappointed that the only way that we could see the theater",
          "The Palace is beautiful and there is no walls with the exeption of a thin metal rope to separate you and the royalty. It is quite amazing. There are many birds, ducks and Swans around the lake, which adds the beauty of this place. You can also take a steamwhip cruise to",

          "The palace in Stockholm is used primarily for state visits and official events, but the Swedish royal family lives at Drottningholm, away from the bustle of the city. We had been there on a previous visit to Sweden, when we got there by boat from Stockholm, but we liked it",
          "We took the subway and bus to the palace before 10am. It is very easy. Almost all buses at Brommaplan could reach there. I am glad that we could arrive earlier than the tourists going by boat. Anyway, there were a group of people waiting for the opening already. I suggest going",
          "We recommend taking the boat from Stockholm - you can buy tickets to the palace with the boat tickets - and taking an afternoon to wander the house and grounds. There are countless period paintings to see as well as the architecture and fittings. There are also various sights",

          "I would consider Drottningholm to be the most beautiful palace in Stockholm. It is a beautiful palace itself that can be toured, but the grounds really make it special. Since it located on the water, it is accessible by boat.\n\nIf you want \u2026",

          "Stunning, reminds me of Versailles.",
          "A beautiful palace, worth visiting. Yet it is rather stuffy inside. The halls opened to public (which require admission tickets) are rather limited. Rather pricey for the amount of things we can see. Nonetheless, it's a UNESCO world heritage, n beautiful too.",
          "An awesome place to chill out with great view and especially Autumn is great with colourful trees all around",
          "The grounds are beautiful. However I wouldn't pay for admission to the palace itself. It's worth a look if you have free admission with the Stockholm pass, but it's not well curated. There are no audio guides, the guided tour costs extra \u2026",
          "Nice place to visit. Went with the ferry from Stockholm. Nice trip!",
          "Nice tour of a smaller but interesting palace and associated theater. The theater includes sound and stage effects as they were used from the beginning. Both the theater and palace have a lot of \"tromp d'oiel\" effects - columns and walls \u2026",

          "The place is great, loved the park and view, I might actually come back just for a coffee there! The castle is definitely worth a visit if you're in Stockholm for more than 3 days, next big thing to do after Vasa Museet and Archipelago. The theater visit was a bit disapointing, too short and skipping its true gems behind the scene",

          "Alternatively known as kings summer palace, has a picturesque sight to offer. The lawns, the palace, the adjacent dock will keep you appreciating its raw beauty.

          "The palace is a very nice place to go with the family but i would not recommend getting the guided tour you would learn a few interesting things but we had a terrible experience with one of the tour guides who was terribly rude towards everyone in the surrounding area but all in all ok experience",

          "Nice view ..park and lake",
          "A very pleasent & good place to visit",
          "The garden was the highlight for me. Probably best seen a nice summer day or in the middle of winter with lots of snow. The castle was your standard 1600s castle with rooms being changed throughout the centuries reflecting that specific period in time. Some really nice portrait paintings as well.",
          "Beautiful place but will be better when the flowers start to bloom.",

          "So nice",
          "Beautiful gardens to walk through, even off season. Of course during the late spring and summer it is more impressive. You can also buy tickets to view the inside of the palace which is worth it if you have another few hours to spend. There is a Cafe on site as well for fika or lunch",

Not sure there's a point of going inside, it's not much to see for the price, but the grounds,  the park, little Chinese pavilion ang the palace from the outside are very beautiful. I was there in winter and still it was very picturesque, it's probably amazing in summer.",

          "One of the best experience knowing the rich heritage of Sweden",
          "Ok, but area and gardens were not impressive while showing the swedish temper and generosity.",
          "Beautiful place, good to visit in a sunny day. The staff is very helpful and nice. The restaurant/cafe is pleasant and has a beautiful water view, but is certainly overpriced. I expected to see more inside the castle itself. It is worth a visit if you combine with the boat trip.",
          "I recommend to buy a combined ticket, the one I got was the palace and the Chinese pavilion, they have different ambience and collections. Both interesting. In warmer season the park is very pleasant.",

No caf\u00e9 at The China pavilion like write on the information map, but toilets..No toilets in the castle...\nThe castle is nothing special...

          "Know what to expect: Compared to other royal castles in Europe you won't get to visit all that much, nor will the display be that extensive. Even with reading all the (English) information tables, you'll be comfortably done within 45 minutes. Add extra time to stroll around the park, and in high season the Chinese palace.",
          "Very nice place and worth to visit. We enjoyed our visit to Drottningholm. But sad part was that palace was closed and even some part of their garden and we could. It take share of it. Will hopefully visit again later in summer period",
          "Amazing place, could spend hours here. Detail is incredible and gardens are enormous.  The Chinese theatre is worth a visit to.",
          "Almost rooms are empty, visit only if you like old paitings.",
          "It is a beautiful palace. I recommend going on a guided tour of the palace and the theator. Both tour guided were very friendly and knowledge able and their tour was very interedting. I learned a lot of Swedish History.",
          "Beautiful palace, but on March none of the buildings are allowed to enter on workink days",

          "Very awesome place.",

          "Love this place. Good for leisure walk and experience the royal nature around the royal family",

          "The gardens, which are free to visit are beautiful, full of surprises and well worth a visit even if you don\u2018t go into the Palace itself which is less interesting. Travel there by bus, or even better by boat.",

        "wiki": "The Swedish Army Museum (Swedish: Arm\u00e9museum) is a museum of military history located in the district of \u00d6stermalm in Stockholm. It reopened in 2002 after a long period of closure, and was awarded the title of the best museum of Stockholm in 2005. Its displays illustrate the military history of Sweden, including its modern policy of neutrality, and of the Swedish Army.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Army Museum has been located at Artillerig\u00e5rden in \u00d6stermalm, Stockholm, since it was opened in 1879. The site has been used for military purposes since the middle of the 17th century, and the main depot of the artillery was located here for nearly 300 years. The current buildings were erected during the latter part of the 18th century. The museum was first known as the Artillery Museum, and changed its name to the Army Museum at the beginning of the 1930s, in order to reflect more accurately the focus of the museum. The museum underwent a major refurbishment and opened in new, modern premises in 1943. \n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe displays show the living conditions of the soldiers, their families and the general population during wartime and peacetime. They include life-size figures of soldiers of past centuries, as well as scenes of the major battles of Swedish forces, weapons, military clothes and other attributes of war. The trophies and flags of armies defeated by Sweden in the 17th and 18th centuries are displayed in a special room.\nThe museum also houses a mini-exhibition about Raoul Wallenberg, the Swede who saved thousands of people from the National Socialists.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Stockholm\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Army Museum\nThe National Swedish Museums of Military History\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite of the Swedish Army Museum",

          "Very evocative and interesting, even if military museums are not your thing. Lots of manikins in tableau scenes depicting different wars fought by the Swedes. Plenty of information in English and very helpful and welcoming staff.",
          "Have been in many military museum\u00b4s but this is one of the best, great displays and short and snappy information. It\u00b4s even great for those who don\u00b4t really are interested in military stuff, the museum explains and show how the life was for all other during the wartime.",
          "To be honest, I passed by and went in as I had time to kill and it was free. Very glad I did. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. There is a fascinating chronology of Sweden's wars and growth and decline as an empire from 16th to 19th century. Huge maps on the walls",
          "This is such a good museum that it goes beyond just Swedish military history to give you a glimpse at how Sweden evolved as a state and society as well. The museum galleries start with, perhaps, a bit of unintended humor - you walk through the entry into the first gallery and",
          "We had two hours to burn which was enough to see the museum however you could spent much more time. A fascinating history of Swedens army from the beginning to present day.",
          "If you are interested in ww1 or WW2 it's a must visit. First of all it was free and that amazed me, there is enough to see, you will spend maybe some time but it's worth it.",
          "I made a special attempt to get to the war museum as I do in every city I visit. This one was gold. Free entry for a start, helpful and friendly staff who speak English. Then a fantastic collection of uniforms and weapons. A lot of the guns are hands on meaning you can pick",
          "I had to rush around in only forty minutes, but to you could easily spend a couple of hours here. It is a great mix of exhibits, thing related to war like uniforms, families, disease, personal accounts and a very good overview of Swedish military history from the 16th through",
          "I took my son who was only aged 6. I summarised the historical travel of Swedish history and its battles with all neighbouring countries. The displays are very good and informative. There's a great 'scavenger hunt' or activity for kids that keep them looking for the wooden",
          "My 19-year old daughter and I visited this museum on a Sunday afternoon. There wasn\u2019t a large crowd to deal with, and we were able to take our time and see all the exhibits without competing for space amongst a lot of other visitors. It took us about 2 hours to walk through the",
          "I absolutely had a great afternoon in the museum. It is so amazing and with many exciting and unique exhibits which you can do more than just looking. I my self am a wwi history lover and it was packed with weaponries from wwi. I loved it and highly recommend everyone to visit",
          "Best museum for the family Big, interesting, educational and free\ud83d\udc4d Nice little shop and nice surroundings",
          "All my family have enjoyed our visit.The museum is not only for army history but you can learn a lot about the European or even the whole world history. It was also interesting to watch how soldiers used to live and what they were taking and eating.Visitors also can try some",
          "Free and interesting museum. If you are in Stockholm you mast visit this museum because it's interactive and you may learn about Swedish history.",
          "This was well worth the time; in fact I spent longer at this museum than the time I originally set aside. It will appeal to Scandinavian History aficionados as well as those interested in military History. It focuses mostly on what it was like to be a soldier at different times",
          "this is the only museum we visited that was free and well worth the time to find it and take the tour. there are lots of things to see here and interact with.",
          "This is a very informative museum, giving information about Sweden and Europe's military past and present. There are many hands-on displays, such as guns which you can explore. Bonus is that entry is free! We spent 2 hours here.",
          "Good museum and well worth a visit, two floors of exhibits covering up to the modern day and information in English.",
          "We popped in here as I had ready the positive reviews and it was free so even though we didn\u2019t have much time, it seemed like w worthwhile thing to do. We ended up spending much longer than anticipated because we enjoyed it so much. No one in our family has a particular interest",
          "By default a museum about army is not the most exciting to do. Except in Stockholm : this museum is very very interesting with a lot of illustrations, paintings, pictures and interactivity And what a surprise to have something free in Stockholm, city which takes your money",
          "I\u2019d happily pay to visit this museum, compared to the others its just so much bigger and much more interactive and interesting! Easy walk from centre of Stockholm! Staff were nice. The museum Is clean and because of how spacious everything is it has a nice quietness to it!",
          "The museum is free, which is a big plus. You start with 14th century and go down through the museum until late 21st century. It details things like wars with denmark, loot, battle flags, etc. and what I found really interesting was the 20th and 21st centuries. Finding out that",
          "This museum provided a great overview of Swedish Army history, and the history of Sweden. Lots of artifacts (swords, muskets etc) well displayed and with good identification labels. Good storyboards to give the context of events and dioramas to complement them all.",
          "We went there on a Thursday and we didn't have to pay an entrance fee. The museum has 3 floors. It's very interesting and also interactive. We liked it a lot. But it is also very sad to see what people can do to each other.",
          "Another great museum we had the pleasure to explore while in Stockholm. It displays various weapons, uniforms and instruments used in wars from medieval times to the present. There is plenty of information and also scenes depicting certain moments in Swedish history. And the",
          "Not only does this museum have the usual artifacts on display and military-themed paintings, it also has life-sized dioramas. Lots of maps to show the Swedish Kingdom\u2019s expansions and contractions. Free WiFi. Don\u2019t miss the pennant displays\u2014they are displayed adjacent to the",
          "Since the army museum opened in 1877 the museum has collected and exposed a large collection of army items from different periods in the Swedish war and peace history. The museum gives a detailed description of how Sweden has developed its army since the 1600th until today. This",
          "Always liked the Army Museum in Stockholm, the Swedish history of the Civil War, the war of Napoleon and how Sweden has changed throughout the time. It's admission free, so it's perfect to spend some hours there alone or with family and friends. You can have a guided tour as",
          "My husband and sons love it, easily accessible, main higlight for them was the modern Swedish army part. Soviet ICBM warhead cover was hair raising to see. A part of the Berlin wall was also a unique piece. Highly recommended for military history enthusiast.",
          "First: this museum is free! The museum is basically focused in two floors (2nd and 3rd). The second floor is about Sweden's war in 17th ~ 18th century, conflicts with Russia, Denmark, King Carl VI and VII... All is really well explained both in Swedish and in English, with",
          "I was really not aware of just how long Sweden was at war before modern times. Something like 400 years of conflict and that doesn't count Viking times. The collection here is just so-so but i have been to a lot of military museums. I was very impressed with the history",
          "The museum has many weapons from world war 2 era on display. You can see the missiles, guns, gas masks, apparels used in many battles. It sheds light on old and modern weapons with interesting take on wars and bloodshedding. The temporary exhibitions are also interesting and",
          "I love this museum and have been over 5 times, They sell wonderful lego-like army toys which are really cool, the attractions are wonderful and the restaurant is great!",
          "Free to enter when I visited. Impressed with this medium sized museum and it's cross section of exhibits and information. Some exhibits are hands on and a good source of Swedish History.",
          "The best museum to learn about Sweden's history. Well depicted over 3 stories, with the centutlries carefully devided.",
          "Not a fan of war, but the museum has a good history imprint: lots of details and accounts about Swedish and Scandinavian history. Installations are well made and almost disturbing. If you expect a celebration of military power, this museum is not it, it is actually rather",
          "The exhibits were so interesting, and especially premodern and early modern period was very exciting and educational. A lot of unique sets, models and charts to explain the life of army and the shape or warfare at that time were provided. Very good. For those who are",
          "Military history of Sweden presented in a rather objective way, with some though-provoking reflections. A bit too \"old-school\" in a way that there's maybe a bit too much to read on various boards, as opposed to some more modern activities. Don't miss the part about Raoul",
          "The museum was very nice, there were a lot of different informaitons about the history of Sweden. They never loose the red line for the whole museum. It is for free and very close to the markethall so this two attractions can be easy connected. I very liked it.",
          "Very informative and well done. There were some interactive exhibits for the kids to use, and overall they loved it. A lot of history on Sweden, the Nazi's, and the occupation of Sweden over the decades. We were ages 11-50 and everyone agreed this was a great museum.",
          "It's the Swedish Army official history museum, so of course, it is focused on Sweden, but it is still worthwhile to visit for a foreigner with a military historical interest. The museum starts about the time Sweden became Sweden and the collections and the dioramas displayed are",
          "I have no idea how Swedish army dressed or fight before I came here, nice to saw a lot of stuff and some history.",
          "Didn't realise that Sweden was such a power historically. Lots of information about the history of both the Swedish army and country. Went to go got lunch but looked like half of Stockholm had the same idea - went to moms lichen instead",
          "I needed a meeting space for a group working on (de-)militarization and social media and thought the museum would be a great place especially given that it presents war and military in thoughtful rather than boastful ways. Everything exceeded my expectations. From Elisabeth",
          "I'm sure it would surprise many to learn that Sweden was once a major military power in Europe, and here at the Army Museum you'll learn about that part of Sweden's history and more. With exhibitions on three floors going back to the 16th century, there's much for the visitor to",
          "What a great find, brilliant for anybody with a slight interest in military or history matters. Also free ! A museum that\u2019s let you get hands on with some of the weapons (there safely deactivated) and for the war games/warhammer geeks a games section.",
          "The museum feels modern today. I really like the exhibition about World War II. I also liked to see the stuff from my own military service.",
          "A good overview of Swedish history as well as the development of state, the mindset of Swedes and Swedish achievements throughout the history. Despite of looking small it took us three hours to make the tour. The entrance is free and it is another good activity for a rainy day.",
          "More an extremely well-presented story of Sweden's conflicts, battles and wars with its Baltic neighbours (and there were many. up to 1814!) than what you might guess from an Army Museum. Plenty of uniforms and guns, big text panels, comfortably big rooms, insights into power",
          "An interesting military museum, which is interesting for anyone who is a little interested in history. The child was interested in various fields. from the relay and terminating the doctor's help.",
          "If you like military stuff, this a place for you in Stockholm. Not too big, so 1 or 2 can br spent here. Very nice displays of weapons, uniforms and history. Oh, and it's free!",
          "Unfortunately by the time I found the place it was near closing time but the personnel were very accommodating. I found interesting the new way of presenting the exhibits. Also hope that this museum could perhaps enter into agreement with others overseas to exchange or loan some",
          "Being in peace for over 200 years, Sweden does not have recent, rich, dramatic / horrifying collections of war memorabilia. Those collected in this museum therefore reflect its past as a major power in Northern Europe and its decline by territorial losses in the early 18th and",
          "Good displays and layout. An hour here can easily be spent. Not really interactive but reading is optional and plenty to look at. Only 1 tank and 1 drone and 2 armed vehicle on display. More about wars,guns and equipment and history. Would recomend for good sweedish and war",
          "The museum is basically split in 2 parts. One floor covering the 1500's till 1900. And another floor covering everything after 1900. This museum is great for both adults and children, as everything is presented clearly and beautifull... with miniatures, live size dolls, trophy's",
          "We had planned to visit on our way to another location and were really pleasantly surprised! This was free and was interesting throughout, especially given our very limited knowledge of Swedish history. Very quiet and tucked out of the way - worth an hour of your time.",
          "Cant recommend this museum enough - in our 3 week tour of sweden this was without doubt the best presented and most accessible museum we've seen. Life size dioramas present materials in their complete and visceral setting whilst the english and swedish signs are short enough",
          "This museum was really worth to see. All the guns and Army tanks and etc was found there. I learned a lot about how they used these things during the war.",
          "The Nordiska Museet in Stockholm is currently advertising that you should visit \"If you want to understand Sweden\". The Armee Museum could justifiably make the same claim. Although Sweden proudly asserts that it hasn't been at war for two hundred years this rather overlooks the",
          "Excellent museum. I love war history and make it a point to always visit a countries military museum. This has been one of my favorities thus far. Very dense and thorough examination of the Swedish military through its history.",
          "Loved the horse trick! There where lots of interactive surroundings created, which makes history coming very close to now.",
          "An interesting balancing act between showing the horrors of war yet taking pride in all the booty the Swedish exploits have gathered over the centuries, this museum has some very nice individual pieces (I always wanted to have a look at a Stridsvagn!) as well as a great story to",
          "It has a very well done exhibition and it's quite big. I was very suprised how good it was for being a free museum. It's also quite close to the other museums, so you should definitely visit it.",
          "This museum is not very crowded although it is free of charge, at least for students. It is beautifully structured, I don't like war history but the beautiful exposition made me change my mind, at least for the visit.",
          "Not a huge museum but very interesting exhibitions. From war trophy banners to Strv S tank. A must see to any military enthusiast. Admissions are free.",
          "Happened into this venue one day on wy to harbor. Very interesting learned Sweden was quite warlike before 1900th century. Also sent 5000 troops to Finland in 2nd world war to fight Russians.",
          "This building is impressive and the museum organized inside covers part of the space. It's free and has powerful exhibits that show how Sweden approached conflict in its history, from the 1500 onwards. Good lighting, ingenious exhibits and proper photographs info make this a",
          "I've visited a lot of war/army museums, and this one is great. Very well done. I enjoyed every minute of it. Seriously, you have to go. Props for the \"Wargaming exhibition\"!",
          "When we arrived we found a temporary free Finnish 1950-60's photography exhibition and watched the trooping of the colour by the Air Force. The museum is normally 80SEK but was free entry at the end of June. An interesting exhibition about how choices are made about what goes",
          "Went there because of our 15 year old. The usual weaponry is shown. Very interesting to realize the Sweden was NOT a very peace loving country...will about 1809. It was war after war till then, many of them started by the Swedish rulers. So, the history bits were very good!",
          "This museum was the favorite of all the sites we visited during a 2 week trip Baltic cruise. My 15 y/o lamented that he could not spend all day at the museum. Lots of interactive exhibits, including real (but inactivated) guns the kids could hold. In other museums some of",
          "We stumbled across this museum while walking around in Stockholm. So glad we did. We were very interested to see the displays and descriptions of Sweden's role in WWII. We had not seen much about that elsewhere. Sweden was neutral, but there were still many things going on",
          "We had no idea what to expect but received recommendations from friends to see this museum in Stockholm. Unlike most things in this city, this museum is Free?! It's such an amazing place I actually felt bad about no entrance price. There are 3 levels - starting at the top and",
          "This is a chance to see unique items that have put a mark on international history (German Goliath, for example), not only that of Sweden. The free museum is definitely worth while with its large collection of arms, clothing, vehicles and so on.",
          "Although I am not a big fun of Army Museums but I can highly recommend you this one. It`s very interesting.",
          "If you are interested in the subject or if you want to know more about the history of Sweden, you should obligatory visit this awesome place! It is full of wax figures and war items that are brand new - as they are about to be used. The story starts with the story of animals",
          "Absolutely fantastic. An experience not to be missed for anyone interested in history and the wars that took place in Europe",
          "Quite centrally located and spread out over several floors the museum is a good place to visit if you like history and have a couple hours free.",
          "This is a nice museum, focusing on the Swedish army from the renaissance onward. There are a good selection of uniforms and weapons on display and the information with the exhibits is in both Swedish and English. There are some cannon and 3 AFVs outside in addition to the",
          "Within walking distance of the hotel, not far from the Vasa Museum. This museum is very well laid out and charts Swedish history from a military point of view right up to recent times. Also, it is free. The staff are very welcoming and helpful.",
          "Within a block of museums, and this one was free to get in. Although the name is 'army', it is quite interesting. The building itself is also quite an art in itself. Close to the museum of music and Modern art.",
          "Interesting walk through the history of Swedish wars and rulers. Well built and educational. Bring the family. Watch out for war-nerds.",
          "I visited this museum 7 years ago & also recently. The exhibits have evolved to show the military history of Sweden from the origin of the country until the current war on terror. There is a lot to see & if you are a military historian you won't be disappointed. There is also",
          "It's THE museum to go to if you ever wondered anything about Sweden's place in Europe over the last millennia and anything regarding our military capacity. Why did Sweden remain neutral. Why did Sweden have a conscript army. How did Sweden act during the Cold war? Lots to see",
          "Centrally located. Free admission for everybody. Free Wi-Fi available. It is about the Sweden at war (from middle age to cold war), the impact on people, the life conditions, the rules of conscription, the history of weapons, the controversial neutrality during WWII.",
          "A lot to see and all the information in English and swedish. Amazed this is free. Really worth seeing",
          "Rich collection of weapons from 17-th century onwards. You can hold some items in your arms making it more interactive. What you read inside makes you think and reflect and this is what makes this place different to other military museums i've seen",
          "Very interesting war museum. It's put together really nicely. Very interesting and detailed whilst easy to digest/absorb. Very good standard and museum exhibits are kept and restored to a very high standard + they make it really easy for any visitor of any age. Lockers are",
          "We visited here for my son really, as he is passionate about history. I mostly found it quite interesting which was a pleasant surprise :) I was less interested in the weapons section, however my son was really interested in it, so it certainly suits some more than others.",
          "Covers some miedival arms history and some modern. Nice exhibits, some of them realy interesting. A couple of wrong explanations but in total a good place to go. The lockers need a 10 krona coin. The museum is providing a token to replace the coin. Nice service.",
          "In a very expensive country as a visitor you cannot go wrong with a visit to the Army Museum. A key bonus is that it is free to enter. It also contains a lot of interesting displays from wars in the past. It is quite central to most of the main sites too. \ud83d\ude00",
          "Who would've thunk Sweden, quite little ole Sweden, used to be war hungry? I mean, it's been a number of years but this museum gives a nice overview to foreigners of the wars and whatnot that changed Scandinavia over the years. Interesting for history buffs :)",
          "Came with our boys 13 and 11 years old. Both moaned about coming and then loved it. Spacious, modern museum covering 17th century war onwards. Plenty of guns, knifes, various weapons, flags, uniforms and artefact's. We would have been happy to pay for admission after seeing the",

          "It's really interesting, exhibition starts from 1500 and takes you through different times showing weapons and outfits that were used. If you like history or you are into weapons, you gonna like it for sure. There are also modern guns and you get a chance to hold 4 different",

          "This museum is a fine mean of finding an interesting piece of northern history. The set-up is impressive.",
          "An interesting review in Sweden's history of war. Exhibition was built in three floors, beginning from Stone Age all the way to the Modern Era. Impressing and detailed installations, lots of war flags from Medieval and Renaissance eras as well as weaponry and armours. As Sweden",
          "The museum covers from the 16th century to the present day, The full-scale scenes and original artifacts presented were amazing. As a former member of the Armed Forces it was great to see the history presented in the Museum, well worth the time to wonder through, you can",
          "First off, the Swedish museums and their lifelike replicas/dioramas are really well done, but the ones here take the cake. Chronological setup regarding the history of Swedish military. Enjoy museums with touchable history.",
          "This is probably the only time in my ife that I will stand beside a nuclear warhead. The museum documents Sweden's (and Europe's) military history with sensitivity and humility. Would recommend for all tourists. Its mandatory to deposit bags, but the lockers require a 5 Kr",
          "This place is very impressive. Considering this is a free attraction, the quality and size of the collection is amazing! Well funded and well looked after, the staff are great and the atmosphere is nice. The whole place takes you on a fantastic journey through not only Swedish",

          "I have visited this museum on every trip to Stockholm over the past 15 years. While it is not for everyone, anybody with an interest in military history will find a stop here well worthwhile. This museum has steadily improved in the breadth and quality of its exhibits -- not",
          "This is more than just a building full of old army equipment. It is well curated, well laid out and informative. It touches on all aspects of life that the military touches upon including peace. Don't miss it! They have some great displays - even the head of a nuclear",
          "We were staying nearby and the museum was free so we popped in. It was way better than expected. Thorough coverage of all the wars to present. Lots of memorabilia and exhibits. Not just for army lovers. It is worth your time. It is on several floors and the building itself is",

          "I totally recommend it to all visiting Stockholm. The museum shows Europe's history from swedish prespective. The exhibition presents very human approach to war and military topics. It's not just watching guns, it's meeting real human stories with wars in the background.",
          "It is a great way to learn about Sweden history! This museum was really interesting, one could spend a couple of hours just to walk around and learn about all the interesting things. The museum is entrance free and I think is better than other similar museums you have to pay for",
          "A great place to learn about Swedish war history. Very friendly staff and free entree during the summer. They also sell army surplus items. If you get there around 11:30 to 11:45 on weekdays you can see vaktparaden setting up for the walk to the royal castle. The riding",

          "This museum, in my opinion is the best way to learn about history of Sweden from 16th century onwards. I got some basic history lesson from a walking tour and this museum explains further and I could easily spend a full day in this museum! It was so interesting! The displays,",

          "Decided to go last minute and were so happy we did. Fascinating exhibition. Would recommend to anyone with time to go. Pleasantly suprised",
          "The exhibits were excellent and the narratives well done. You follow the later history of Sweden through its military campaigns against Denmark, Russia, Prussia, Poland and others. Crossbows, small arms, cannon, swords and even modern weapons. Read how WWI and WWII affected",
          "free entrance, building very impressive, Exhibition is interessting even if you are not into army/war, ...",
          "The museum is well laid out in chronological order with all caption in English as well as Swedish. It charts Swedish military history from the early days to the present day. There are some very good displays showing a range of uniforms. The only disappointment is the bookshop",

          "I absolutely loved the army museum, not only is it free which is always good it also cover mainly on the top floor an very interesting part of Swedish history. The museums top floor looks at the history of Swedish conquests and wars up until just before WW1. I found this",

          "It's a free museum, with English descriptions. There is organized recount on the war history of Sweden. Very interesting and easy to understand. We spent about 2-3 hours. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Sweden's military history.",
          "For of all this museum is free of charge since this year. You get a very nice welcome greeting when you enter and museum is very clean and tidy. The exhibitions are very well done, they show lot of history from 17 -19 centuries war history from the wars during Sweden's empire.",
          "Definitely worth a visit for when you are in Stockholm, and provides a well aligned view on the history of the Swedish army",
          "I had a few hours to kill and I thought, why not try it since I am both interested in military and history. The museum took me about 2,5 hours to complete. With a well thought out route including a few \"interactive\" part where you could try holding some weapons, the time flew",
          "We didn't know what to expect from this museum, but we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of exhibits, the pacing, and the contents. I never felt like there was too much to see - just the right amount of information and visual material to keep my interest. They had a",
          "I'm former Army. Worked with a few Swedes here and there... This was a cool stop but with more history than I would expect in many military museums. Definitely worth checking out. I'm just sad I couldn't try out the tank or other toys... :)",
          "Swedish history presented in an appealing way. Not so much focus on the actual guns and material but of course present as well. Interesting also for you not into \"military\" ...",
          "This is about history and they are in no way pushing the visitors to join the army, which made me like this place alot.",
          "It's an army museum - and it offers you exactly what you can expect of it and it does it well. A lot of history, guns, guns and more guns. And some sabers, swords... Anyway, you get my meaning. So if you enjoy stuff like that, go - I do, and I really enjoyed the visit.",
          "You don't always associate Sweden with anything military but this museum puts paid to any such notions. A fascinating history of Sweden's position in Europe in days gone by. Interestingly entrance was free, which was unexpected (I might have visited on a special day).",
          "Great exhibitions on the history of Sweden and warfare. You get a lot of context, different perspectives and even surprising angles. This is certainly not just a display of arms, but also a museum of the impacts of war, and its consequences.",
          "The exhibitions not only show the Country's defence force but also a thorough war history of Sweden from the 11th century, through world war 1 and 2, right up to the present year. It was better than I'd expected.",
          "Good and interesting in city center. Esoecially if your interested in history and military. Its wirth spending 2-3 hours there",
          "A must when you are interested in the 30year war. Imposing collection of banners and flags from that period. Do not miss the 2nd story. And do a little knitting for peace in the basement... :)",

          "Great museum , nice staff , excellent for those who like military history. Many exhibits , and some interactive ones, like military uniforms which you can wear. I liked it",
          "I accompanied my husband to army museum only because he really want to visit. To my surprise, I really enjoy myself very much at the army museum. It was informative and interactive. I gain more insight about the Cold War and Finnish war. Glad that we made a trip down.",
          "This is a great museum gem and a must-see for anybody interessted in military history. The life size wax dolls makes the history come alive - eventhough some of them take up a lot of space without telling much... That you can try out weapons and guns is also a very nice",
          "This was an alright museum. Emphasis is placed on Swedish military development prior to the 20th Century, and the museum boats an impressive collection of arms and uniforms from various periods in Sweden's history. I thoroughly enjoyed the flag rooms, where standards captured",
          "Was buy the museum several times. It was ok, nothing special. Huge court yard, not sure if they still use it, but huge. Looked like a hot spot for lunch, a little cafe nestled into the museum.",
          "This isn't a happy place because of the subject matter, but a very interesting place to visit nonetheless. Some of the exhibit texts are only in Swedish, so asking for an English audio guide at the entrance is a must if you don't speak Swedish. The building the museum is in is",
          "After growing up in London where most museums are free, it was refreshing to find one in Stockholm that was too (even if it was only one afternoon a week), and we were pretty much the only people wandering around after 5pm. little gem of a museum, which gives a good narrative",
          "it was a fantastic experience. First of all you are going through the history of Sedish wars ans warriors. there are a lot of things to touch and try. liked it a lot",
          "For Army Museums, this one was pretty good. It gave a history of Sweden along with their military over the years. We always try to purchase food at museum cafe's, this one was closed except for cookies and drinks--But the cookies were really good",
          "Stumbled across the Army Museum by accident, where a parade was taking place involving soldiers and a marching band. A great experience to encounter!",
          "OK, so I'm a military history kind of chap. And I had a general idea that Sweden was one of Europe's 'great powers' in the 17th and early 18th centuries. But I learned more in 3-4 hours at this excellent medium-sized museum than I thought possible. To call something",
          "Let me first say, I normally am not interested in any military museum. However, my husband and son were keen to visit. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I wasn't bored reading about centuries of war between Sweden/Germany/Finland/Russia. The top floor was my favorite.",
          "It's relatively cheap and not that big. I was expecting more for Swedish army and this museum. Modern section is quite poor, almost no interactive stands. The good part was that it was in Stockholm card, so I decided to visit it. It took less than 1 hour to visit it.",
          "We visited this museum on a whim and were so thankful we did. It is full of the history of Sweden and we learned so much that we never even suspected about Sweden. It is so very well laid out and all the displays are in English as well as Swedish. When we visited the crowds",
          "This museum does a great job of laying out the history of the military and Swedish wars from 16th-19th centuries. Good artifacts and some insight to the politics. For a war buff allow yourself at least 3 hours to do the tour. The museum store was pretty good, with more",
          "A must see military museum in Stockholm. It is rich in history and there are military items for sell. There is also plenty of military equipment to see and touch to keep you busy for hours. The staff there is very friendly and they are more than willing to answer any",
          "This is the kind of museum you can spend as much or as little time as you want in. There are 3 floors of the building, with the top floor starting the earliest in terms of history and artefacts. The galleries are set out so that you 'walk through time', increasing your knowledge",
          "This is a straightforward museum, interesting for the appropriate audience. One unusual feature that has a bit more mass appeal are several \"hands-on\" exhibits that are permanently out for people to touch, instead of being behind glass. Two examples that I remember are a",
          "Full of uniforms, weapons and equipment showing the history of the Army in Sweden with some very good life size models and diarama's to see. Short walk from Nybroplan.",
          "This is a nice traditional museum, but very well executed. The exhibitions don't just relate to the objects, but also tie them together and show the wider story behind them and the times.",
          "I found this museum very fascinating narrating the history od medieval Sweden and also covering the Www1&2 and cold war . It an interesting museum which interacts with visitor.",
          "Mainly shows what life was like for soldiers during wars involving Sweden and what it was like to grow up in neutral Sweden in WW2.",
          "They have a nice exhibit that rotates a couple of times a year so you can come back and see something new. The restaurant offer a pretty decent lunch as well.",
          "The history of Sweden's role in wars, spanning something like 800 years. A good crash course on the relationship between Sweden and it's neighbouring nations, the development of their army (later, the abolition of the national service) and their role in the 20th century as a",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to the Swedish Army Museum.The exhibits are well laid out and informative,and the weapons collections were comprehensive.Not all of the exhibits had an english explanation,but still very interesting.There are even some weapons to handle.A great museum",
          "Everyone who is interested in war, weapons and army, its a must go then , i really enjoyed it , i think that everyone will enjoy it",
          "I thought this would be just a collection of weapons and only popped in because it was free and I was in the are - but what a surprise!! Not only do you get a full picture of the Swedish wars, you also learn the history of the Scandinavian and north-Germanic peoples, all through",
          "Great history museum. Loved the use of life-sized models to illustrate Sweden's military history. The exhibitions on the top floor (roughly covering prehistory to World War 1) I found the most interesting, but the whole museum is great if you're interested in military history.",
          "It had free entrance when I visited Stockholm so I gave it a try and I enjoyed it a lot. I expected a collection of various weapons, equipments and machinery but it goes well beyond that. It debates the violent character of human nature, it gives you a historical approach to",
          "Based in a large lovely building this large collection is very detailed and contains much of general interest as well as the in depth Swedish stuff. There are many displays of army scenes which are very well done. It is spacious and well worth a couple of hours - any less and a",

          "This museum was very well laid out with it starting right from when King's lead the army to modern times. The English guide was very informative and nice. She did a great job at explaining the history of the Swedish army. The museum hands out headsets with different languages,",
          "Enjoyable displays. Information is nicely explained and you don't need to know about Swedish history in advance to follow it. Wheelchair access at the entrance is a bit cobbled but they are planning to improve it. Inside the disabled access and toilets are good.",

          "O.k. I went there to please my partner who is Swedish and has 'a thing' about the Swedish army and all those weapons. Big surprise. Our visit lasted almost three hours and I loved every minute of it. Those early weapons, then the daily lives of soldiers through the centuries so",
          "This museum was renovated some years ago and the objects are shown in interesting ways. There are interresting presentations of the development of different weapons and the visitors are guided through the Swedish history in a pedagogic way. What I definitely cannot understand is",
          "This museum shows Swedish military history. My children are like it. But Russian museum of Artillery in Saint-Petersburg has both Russian and English descriptions, and this one in Swedish only, but audio guide in different languages corrects situation.",
          "Good museum if you\u00b4re interested in that kind of stuff, I missed that the zone dedicated to the \"dark history\", torturing devices, etc, ...of sweden were bigger. Seems that there is also a tour visit that really improves the experience but we went there on one free day (not",
          "This museum is well worth going to and entertained adults and kids (males and females of all ages) alike. The fee is low and includes an audio guide. The lockers are free (need 10kr coin to activate which is returned) and the small gift shop was good plus there is a restaurant",
          "Even I am not big fan of army and history of wars, this musrum is well done. There is a lot of figurins, you can see \"real scenes\" from soldiers life. Interesting.",
          "This museum is small relatively to famous army museums in the world, but has many interesting exhibitions on Swedish Army history",
          "The first few exhibits on the beginning of war and it's medieval phase are very vivid life-sized tableau which the visitor can walk through. I was impressed. Some of the later exhibits don't require much time, and this museum and the Music and Theater Museum across the street",
          "Museums too often are simply a collection of \"stuff\" with little or no effort made at conveying context or insight. This museum not only makes the attempt but excels in the effort. Among the themes: 1. Why do humans make war and is it inevitable. 2. Large armies consume amazing",
          "Honestly, I only went there because there was an offer 'buy a ticket to the Music musem - get a free entry at the Army museum'. \"What an unexpected thing to do\" we thought. But indeed, I'm really glad they did that as the museum had lots of very interesting stuff, and I would",
          "We took our three young boys to the Army Museum and we all loved it. It was refreshing how the museum told more than just war stories. There was much to learn about military life in Sweden and the reasons why men joined before the days of conscription. The audio guide is a must",
          "This is an examplary look at the nature of why armies exist - to conduct war...but asks the question - what is war all about? The answer is deeply conveyed and really inspires and provoked thinking about the widespread impacts of war. Really appreciated.",
          "This is an interesting museum, dedicated as it is to the history of warfare (among mankind as a whole, in places). There is not a lot of patriotism here, but some interesting installations.",
          "This was my first visit to this museum and I had very little time that day, but I loved it and will for sure come back and use much more time. They had several different exhibitions and one of them is called \"Twice a stranger\". It's about people born at one place and raised",
          "Surprisingly interesting museum right in the center of Stockholm. Gives an background to war in general but also the history of Sweden. Nice, but a little bit expensive, restaurant.",
          "You need to take the audio tour as this really lets you dive into the exhibitions. A very good and thorough history of the Swedish army from 1600 to 1721. Then a quick overview of the 18th-20th century.",
          "If the museeum is very interesting, there is no need to look forward to eat there unless you like fast food like food... Forget it except there is a terrace that can be used when it's warm..",
          "I saw many army museums before, but iin this are really great exhibitons... fantastic figures (horses also), techniques, guns... and through all this is message - wars are not so heroics and greats as in cinemas",
          "Other countries call this kind of museum war museum. In Sweden we have chosen the rather more neutral name Army Museum. Anyway it's been modernised late last century and is very good. There are a number of dioramas (3 dimensional scenes with costumed characters) and lots of",
          "A nice expose over contemporary and ancient Swedish military history. More than you think. Good for families and maybe best for traditional father and son visit.",
          "Really interesting, seeing as Sweden hasn't been in a conflict for 200 years. More on Wallenberg would be good. Clearer chronology of Swedish military history would have been better (though I suspect it was there in Swedish displays). Great use of IT, although the audio guide",
          "This is a very interesting museum with more to in than the chronological military history of Sweden represented by usual displays of various military memorabilia. They of course have this and a good collection of it as well but I found the special display on the logistics of",
          "Plenty to see over 4(?) floors. Well presented both displays and memrobelia. They have a free day so to preseve your budget it is worth finding out when there is no admitance charge.",
          "If you are a fan of military history, you will have to see this museum. However, the appeal extends beyond this. There were a decent number of exhibits that discussed the impact on civilian life of different wars that Sweden was active in or was able to avoid thru neutrality",
          "This museum presents a very balanced view of the Swedish military and its history. That was refreshing. It is also a good introduction into the civilian sector that necessarily supported the military forces over the centuries - from the rote and rusthalle system to the",
          "A great museum. If you don't speak/read Swedish, the audio guides are a must though. Give yourself plenty of time - we spent much longer there than we'd planned.",
          "the Army museum in Stockholm is well worth a visit - modernized several times during the last 10 years in now diplays both memorable items, old guns as well as the Swedish war history. On the court yard in front are also some interesting artillery items and some armoured",
          "This place will be interesting for those who like history, especially war's related. All info represented in easy understandable form, audio guide and written info is available. Lots of weapons exponents that you can touch and try to hold. I've visited this museum 3 times and",

          "The best part of the museum is its coverage of Sweden's military history until ~1800 (I think), when Sweden was one of the most aggressive countries in Europe. However, everything afterwards falls flat: for example, there is an exhibit - no joke - about how Swedish people in the",

          "Museum is well organized. There are three floors of exposition. And if at the time of the Vikings does not show a particular, unlike the Danes, the Renaissance Swedish mercenaries were valued very highly. The museum has a great installation of more than 5000 figures, each about",

          "Great museum for kids and grown up kids (men). Excellent guides, clean interesting and well presented. Focusses on Swedish military history (of which in the last 200 years to their credit there isn't much) but presented in a very thoughtful and entertaining way.",

          "I'm into military history and know quite a bit about Sweden's past. My wife isn't and doesn't. We visited in February and had a very enjoyable couple of hours. There isn't much English text about but there are audio guides which worked well. Excellent summaries of early Swedish",

          "We could find very little information about this museum on the internet, but took a chance and visited here anyways. Boy, are we glad. The Army Museum is lots of fun. The displays are creative and very interesting. They tell a great story about early Swedish history and the",

          "The Swedish History Museum has a wonderful lay out to walk visitors through the history of Sweden. The treasury with the gold hoards is interesting. The only drawback is that the Viking exhibit was under renovation and not open.",
          "The gold room of this museum contains 52 kilograms of gold in the form of ancient jewelry. Standing out are 3 gold collars, but there is much more. The rest of the museums' collection covers prehistoric human activity, medieval times and the history of the Swedish nation in",
          "Going to see the gold and silver room at this museum is worth the (free) visit alone. It just took my breath away. The gold necklaces that would have been worn by Royal leaders were almost luminous. They were both spectacular and ornate, and a part of the 52 kgs of gold tucked",
          "We took free Viking tour guided by Ellen (an archaeologist and also an osteologist). Ellen was amazing, telling interesting stories about Viking lifestyle and their customs and beliefs, making it super fun. Thank you Ellen! Concept of museum is really smart, you walk on timeline",
          "Only had time for a short stop here. Enjoyed the Gold room and the medieval art collection. Would have liked to stay a bit longer. It was worth it just for the collection of gold. Free entry and wheelchair accessible.",
          "This museum has an outstanding collection of Medieval art, a very good collection aout Sweden's history, and a lot of gold and silver artifacts from the Viking age. Totally worth a visit.",
          "Initially we were very disappointed to find that the Viking section was closed until next year, having planned our holiday around visiting it! However the rooms which were open were suitable consolation. The prehistory gallery was very atmospheric and the key items were well",
          "It\u2019s a very good museum but unfortunately the Viking exhibition was closed for renovations and will first reopen in 2020. But there were lots of other interesting exhibitions to see too. The museum also has a restaurant with friendly staff, reasonably priced and good food.",
          "You can spend hours in this museum. Following the timeline is really informative. The only disappointing thing for me was a lack of any detail about Swedish indigenous people, the Sami. Unless I missed something they were relegated to a a small screen display in a corner. That",
          "This history museum is free There was a short and very interesting tour where the guide told me some things that I did not reliese. The bigger one being that there was NO such race of people as the VIKINGS. Vikings is just a word used for people who were sailors - like the term",
          "Although the building is not impressive, the exhibitions are really good. The admission is free, but you need to pay a little for the audio guide. I strongly suggest to get it. I enjoyed pretty much all exhibitions. But I absolutely loved the one that takes you through time line",
          "Myself and my boyfriend visited here at the start of July and found it very fascinating. All the exhibitions are very well thought out, (and also in Swedish and English). It takes quite a while to walk round and see everything. Even though it is free it never felt too busy",
          "I highly recommend the Swedish History Museum as a must-see destination for any visitor to Stockholm. In my estimation, it ranks right up there with the Vasa Museum and Royal Palace. And it doesn't hurt that admission to this estimable museum is free.",
          "I am a museum person. I have been to many museums in many countries that cover a vast range of topics, but especially history museums. And this museum is an amazing museum if you love museums. This is the only museum I've ever visited that openly devoted time and space to the",
          "Swedish history is presented in an interesting way. Some references to the Viking period, although a new section dedicated to the Vikings is still in preparation.",
          "Swedish name of museum is Historiska Museet and admission is free. The Gold Room and the Vikings Exhibition were closed for renovation when I visited in early June. Museum is well-laid out and you can follow a time-line on the floor to see all the displays in chronological",
          "Last time we visited this museum in the evening but could not spend very long time here as it was about to close. This time we arrived early to be able to spend more time here. The visit started with rather emotional exhibition about holocaust and how the survivors rebuilt",
          "The museum is huge with lots of historical things to see which dates as far back as the ADs. I enjoyed my visit here, and loved the outstanding historical collections and descriptions of items, pictures and places. What stood out for me and was most inspiring was the Wheel of",
          "Spend 3 hours there and had a great walk into the Swedish history. There is no admission charge, which surprised me. There are lots of artifacts but felt seems disorganized. The galleries should have been better organized in timeline order, I suggest. Overall good experience.",
          "If you are interested in Swedish history it`s a good idea to visit this museum with a free entrance. A regular museum.",
          "I really like the section about primeval times, but the upper floor about the history of Sweden was mostly - to be honest - dull selection of things in showcases or on walls... You have to be a bit more interested in history than average person to enjoy it, I think. And if you",
          "take the tram from central station direction to Vasa and Skansen, step off just before going to the Drujgarden island currently viking part and golden chamber are closed for renovation in the other parts, some chambers are nice, in other not so much to see parts are also missing",
          "I've knocked a star off because the Viking part of the museum was closed for refurbishment, and that was my main reason for visiting. Nevertheless, it was still a very interesting couple of hours with lots to see and free admission made it even better. The whole history of",
          "We had some time to kill before our flight back home and choose to learn something of Sweden\u2019s history. This museum has no entrance fee and the best exposition imaginable. Fun for young and a bit less young. We spend much more time as we presumed.",
          "Of all the museums in Stockholm, this is my favorite. It portrays a comprehensive history of Sweden and asks visitors to consider what it means to be Swedish. Starting in pre-history and moving through to our modern era, the collections are displayed in an engaging fashion that",
          "Entrance is completely free. The museum is very interactive. Has lockers to put jackets and bags. The Swedish national history museum will walk you through Swedish history. There was a special section for the Holocaust and it was quite touching.",
          "The Viking exhibition is currently closed (for refurbishment until 2020 according to the website), which was disappointing as I had gone there specifically to see Viking artefacts. I looked in the rest of the museum and couldn\u2019t really find much else Viking. The gold room is an",
          "The staffs in the museum were very helpful. They gave us tips on how to do the tour. The museum is huge and you can spend hours here.",
          "I loved this museum! Extensive collection with very well preserved and presented exhibits, so much to see and do. Definitely get the audio guide to make the most of your visit. It's a beautiful museum.",
          "The Swedish History Museum, where we were able to admire some beautiful runic stones, viking weapons and armor and even a ship. There was also a lot of medieval religious artifacts such as altar panels, relics, stonework and other objects. Particularly interesting, though",
          "History buffs should devote at least a half to explore all the artifacts on display. Most patrons start their visit on the bottom floor, containing impressive collections of gold and other treasures from days gone by. Moving upward, you approach modern times. There are a lot",
          "It was a great pleasure to visit the museum: very informative, with great atmosphere and understandable! After the visit you will learn the most important highlights of the history of Sweden. And all these amazing things are free of charge. I would highly recommend to rent an",
          "This place has a good combination of old fashioned museum and new. There is great activities for the children. Would warmly recommend it!",
          "I had a day to kill in Stockholm and had never been to this museum. The Viking part of the museum was closed. I gave the rest about two hours strolling through and reading most of the info.",
          "a very descriptive explaining place full of artifacts and amazing for clicks. A must visit if want to know about vikings",
          "Great Museum.lots of exhibits and information(perhaps too much to take in!)but considering the entrance is free, a good place to visit,if you're interested and a museum enthusiast. The timeline on the floor is a really good idea and the gold room is one of the best parts of the",
          "At first I could not expect anything from the museum. On the homepage I did a little bit of preliminary work to introduce a little to a child before going to the museum. The museum is very large and spacious. We started from the lower floor. The child was so excited. In English",
          "The museum has over a million pieces and displays only a fraction of it. You can spends hours in there and be entertained and fascinated by all the history and beauty. The signs are in English and Swedish. Most Swedes are fluent in English and very helpful.",
          "For a better understanding of Sweden a visit to the excellent History Museum in Stockholm's \u00d6stermalm quarter is a must and one can easily spend a half day in there, especially if one reads all the very informative comments on Sweden's past, often by Dick Harrison, history",
          "Some parts as old religous art can be a bit tiresoem if you don't have special interest but I recomend all vistors to at least see some parts like the gold room and viking exhibitions. No entrance so why not a quick stop. Few tourist find their way here which is another plus.",
          "Liked the concept of the museum. Pretty interactive and focuses more on how people lived and on the social and economic conditions of the populace rather than what this king or that king did. The layout as well as the info provided in various languages was certainly helpful.",
          "Situated about 15 min walk from the Royal Palace (or a quick us ride on the Number 67 from Central Station), Historiska museet is one of the Swedish capitals premier museums, covering both archaeology and cultural history of Sweden (with Finland, Norway and Denmark) from the",
          "We were passing and fancied spending a while out of the cold so ventured in! Very glad we did as the museum offered a fascinating view of the history of Sweden. The Viking exhibition and the gold room were highlights but in truth it was all worth seeing. There was also a shop",
          "I strongly recommend everyone that is going to Stockholm to visit this free museum! It is just incredible! History, archeology...just perfect! I went 3 times already and will go back for each guest I have",
          "This place is full of great finds over the years . Trouble is there is so much it would take you hours to look and read all the information, free entrance which is always a bonus",
          "A free, informative and interesting museum- what more could you ask for? The Swedish History Museum is free for all, and does a great job at placing objects and items for exhibit comfortably within the afforded space, so you're able to move freely between everything. The museum",
          "Great museum! Loved the rune stones and other artifacts! Really enjoyed going through and learning about the history of Sweden, the Old Norse folk, Scandinavia etc.",
          "Its a huge museum complex and can be considered the best in Nordics region. Spent almost 2 hours in the museum and didnt get bored.",
          "We have toured well known museums like Vasa an Nobel, and thoroughly enjoyed them. The Swedish history Museum, in our opinion, topped them all. We spent about three hours looking at the Viking exhibits, the gold room, and Middle Ages floor. Fascinating look at how a people,",
          "This museum was a personal highlight of my trip. painstakingly detailed with state of the art galleries, its a must do.",
          "Since we were with a group we saw very little of the large museum. Our visit concentrated on Viking gold and burials. The exhibits on the Vikings were well presented and interesting. There was actual Viking gold jewelry and real rune stones. There was some information about",
          "History of Sweden, cultural information, temporary Vikings exhibit, all very interesting and well-laid out. Many state-run museums are free, including this one.",
          "This museum gave an excellent overview of Swedish history from prehistory to the Middle Ages. The exhibits, details and visuals were interesting and well presented.",
          "We walked past by accident on the way somewhere else, but as it opened at 11 we popped in and it was very interesting, but if you want to see it all you need a couple olf hours at least. Best thing is entrance is free.",
          "During the summer months there are guided tours and games and activities in the court yard. Audio guides available. Easily accessible by bus. Metro, or tram.",
          "The gold room is amazing, showing all the gold from earlier times, beautifully displayed. Most of it was found by farmers I think, all over Sweden on sites of various settlements. I was stunned at the intricacy of some of the work. In the same museum, there is a History of the",
          "Great collection of Viking and medieval sections, very educational. Shows great history of Sweden. The museum is free if charge. There was a lovely cafeteria with outside seating, very peaceful. Would recommend to visit",
          "Viking history is nice and interesting, but the other parts of the museum were a bit dry for me. I recommend to visit this museum if you are interested specifically in viking history.",
          "A great way of spending a few hours learning about Swedish history through the ages, added to which it\u2019s free to get in! Some amazing things to see and learn about.",
          "This museum is essentially about Swedish history. It has quite an eclectic mix of things on offer and thematically I found it a little hard to follow at times. There is a whole section on Vikings so if that is your primary interest then this is the place to visit. It was free to",
          "This is one of the best historical museums that we have visited. The displays are very interesting. A timeline that you walk through to take you from the days long before Sweden was formed as a country. Very interesting artifacts. Occasional activity days with activities",
          "We found the Viking displays fascinating but confusing. There seemed to be no obvious chronology and we couldn't work out how to approach the exhibition. Improved signage may help. Individual displays, such as the model of a Viking village and the skeleton of the young girl and",
          "The museum is nice, especially the gold room. Negative is that first we could take our dog in the foyer - everybody could see that and the receptionist agreed to stay in the foyer with it. After 30 Minutes a security guard said we have to leave the very large foyer. Sweden is",
          "Interesting museum, and free! I love the displays that were chronologically ordered in a timeline. You can use the free app and the museum wifi to guide you through the whole museum!",
          "The gold room is amazing. So many treasures found in Sweden and so great details on the items. A lot of info about Vikings + the Danish assult of Visby in 1361. Some remains that has been found can be seen and som Details info is in paper (in plastic) and it\u00b4s a bit annoying",
          "A friend took us here to introduce us to Viking history, but there is so much more. Of course the centuries of Viking exhibits were informative, but I was particularly intrigued by the timeline running along the floor on the second level, spanning the whole of Sweden's history.",
          "This museum is free and is located near to tram stops from N7 or a short walk from the Theatre. It gives real insight into Swedish history from Iron Age to Vikings and more recent history. A good part of a visit to Stockholm. There is a cafe on site where you can sit outside on",
          "If you are into history, go. It was boring. Lots to see. It just did not grab my attention. Give it a miss if you have limited time Free wifi. There was lockers, that were free.",
          "We visited this museum from opening time at 10am. The staff were a delight, happily showing us how to use the wifi for commentary and giving is headsets to use. A great journey from medieval times right up until the present. Take your time here, it is well worth it. Highly",
          "During our visit, they had Viking days with displays outside including cooking Viking summer bread and playing traditional games. My kids loved it. For the standard exhibits in the museum, there are activities to make it interactive for kids and we found it interesting. Overall",
          "Even with the English audio guide I found this museum a bit difficult to navigate and process fully. That said it is informative and covers prehistory to the present.",
          "When we visited, there were loads of kids outside being a Viking for the day with clothes, tents, crafts, the works. It looked great but we were sadly too old. Instead we looked at the Treasures in the Gold room and the rune stones and displays about the Vikings. Further on in",
          "We spent almost 6 hours here, there was so much to see, history from prehistoric Sweden right up to the modern day. We got so much out of it, it was really interesting and engaging. Nice little cafe as well.",
          "We got caught in the rain right by the museum so decided to wait it out inside. The museum is free and offers a lot of interactive exhibits to keep kids engaged. Other than that though, it did not have too many unique items to browse through. We went through the Viking exhibit",
          "Probably the largest collection of Viking and medieval exhibits in Scandinavia. Well presented, Swedish and foreign translations available, free audio commentary available. Accessible via on off tour transport. Allow at least 2 hours, we had to cut the medieval section short.",
          "A pleasant stop on a walk through Stockholm. We spent our time in the medieval section with artifacts from Sweden. The section of the attack of Visby was a highlight. A extra plus for the free lockers.",
          "This museum is free of charge. It is educational but not very exciting to be honest. We finished within 2 hours. If you have spare time in Stockholm, it is still a good place to go.",
          "My expectations for this museum were higher than they should have been. It's lovely that it's free, so you can't really complain, but I was not really impressed. I really hoped for more from the Viking exhibit in particular.",

          "Excellent museum with many different well laid out exhibition spaces which enable you in a fairly short time to get a very good understanding of the Viking era and the overall complex history of Sweden. Very highly recommended. It is a short walk from the city centre and the",
          "Originally didn't plan on visiting this museum but glad we did. It has a wide variety of things to do, includes quite a bit of Viking history and the gold room. We only had a short bit of time to visit but I suspect you could spend hours here. Worth a visit.",
          "This is a real favourite of mine! The museum is HUGE - there are entire floors dedicated to viking pieces, gold and jewels, and Swedish history. There's also often temporary exhibitions which are typically very good and interactive. The admission is free, and the gift shop alone",
          "This museum creatively brings Sweden's history to life using multi-media displays that capture the senses and hold your attention. Particularly moving is a thoughtful reflection on the nature and shaping of national identity and on what it means to be Swedish. From hands-on",
          "Well worth a visit to this free museum which is well designed for anyone wishing to see Swedish history from very early day, through viking times up to more recent eras in a format that is not demanding. Try the restaurant for an inexpensive lunch.",
          "For all history buffs, plan to visit the history museum. It will take 3-4 hours (depending on how much detail you will like to absorb).",
          "We spent about 2 hours here. The exhibits are well displayed and highly informative placards are displayed neatly. Ambience is good. Museum is spacious.",
          "A great free museum, a little off the main tourist route, but well worth a visit, its good for all ages, good information, great displays and it gives a true feeling and understanding of Swedish Culture, well worth seeking out for a visit.",
          "the best and must visit.. it's the best place to see Swedish culture good place to see the tradition",
          "Pretty cool and free! If you really want to learn a lot about history, you can spend a good amount of time here; otherwise it gets a tad boring, but still interesting to walk through. Go to the gold room and think about how dope it'd be to have all that!!",
          "Historical Museum is a great place to visit for everyone - it is interesting for any age: both kids (they were provided with pencils and pages to draw on them) and adults (listening to the guide and watching their kids drawing in front of them and listening to the guide). The",
          "Almost everyone has heard about the Vikings, but few of us have met them. Here is a very good way to get both some basic and more detailed knowledge. This is then the background for understanding more about Swedish history. Very well presented with an aim to make every exhibit",
          "They have a really good exhibit on the vikings. It talks about many aspects of their life. They even have people dressed and acting like vikings. They have a few other exhibits but they aren't as good or detailed as the viking exhibit",
          "The section that stands out in this museum is definitely the Viking exhibit. There are more genuine Viking artifacts here than in the other Stockholm museums that I visited. As an opera lover, I was especially thrilled and surprised to find the original Br\u00fcnnhilde costume from",
          "This museum and the Arme museum tell you the history of Sweden. Do not go to both museums on the same day because that will be overload. There are free toilets in every museum use them",
          "I enjoyed my visit a lot, the Viking exhibition was excellent, the free guide (Theodor) was very knowledgeable and entertaining, always fun to hear people who are passionate about what they do. The items on display are well chosen. The Gold Room in the basement is very",
          "We had only one hour free the day we were here, so we limited our visit to the Viking exhibit and the gold exhibit. Both were educational and well-done. Impressive that this is a free admission museum, and we were impressed by all of the activities for children. We will go back",
          "I thought this was an excellent museum, and I learned so much about Swedish History here. More so than some of the other museums I\u2019ve visited in Sweden. One of the exhibits was dedicated to a Swedish woman (Selma Lagerl\u00f6f). She was the first female Nobel prize winner in",
          "I visited this free admission museum to discover the Vikings and found so much more. What well laid out museum with much to learn and discover about the swedes. I highly recommend.",
          "Good museum let down by its ridiculous feminist slant whereby any female who did anything remotely important is seized upon and 'bigged up'. History is being re-written in museums like this and it is wrong. This is typical of Sweden at the moment though The viking section was",
          "The Swedish History Museum has exhibits of artifacts and Swedish culture from the stone age up through present times. Much of the focus, naturally, is on bronze and iron age Swedien - especially on what is known as the Viking Age. These exhibits are extensive, thorough, and",
          "This was a really nice museum for both adults and kids. The Gold Room was beautiful, but there's plenty of other things to do there. We were lucky to visit during the 'Viking for a Day' exhibit in the courtyard for kids, which had 6-7 interactive exhibits like baking, making",

          "This is a fabulous museum and so well laid out. The viking exhibits were fascinating and gave a good insight into their life. The gold room was just amazing. The free entry means it is open to everyone and not just those who can afford it. Go, go, go.",

          "The museum is quite big as it covers Sweden's past from the stone age to the present. As I was short on time I visited only 2 galleries - the Vikings' and the gold collection. Both were very well curated and beautifully presented. The Vikings gallery was especially captivating,",
          "Heaps to see, read, learn, very interactive, great gold collection and the kids loved the activities in the courtyard. Great full day out. And free for everyone. The only disappointment, was the cafe. Awful food and coffer.",
          "For all you want to know about the ancient history, long ago history and recent history of Sweden, this is a must visit museum, and it's free! Really worth it. Also included a great deal about how Christianity evolved in this country. Can spend 2 hours at least. The walk thru",
          "This is a very good museum covering Sweden's past from the stone age to the present. The first floor contains two galleries - the first covers Swedish \"prehistory\" including the stone age, bronze age, and iron age. These periods are covered predominantly by reconstructing the",
          "We went here after the Nordic Museum and discovered that this was more of what we thought the other museum would be--and it's free. The Viking display is the best and most informative I've seen. The Midieval Massacre exhibit is also exceptional. It can be a little",

          "I read the reviews and decided to go, even though I wasn't interested in the history of the Vikings, because as we learned in college, a great professor will bring any subject alive, so pick the professor, not the subject. Unfortunately, this museum didn't do it for me. Although",
          "A fantastic, free museum depicting the pre-history and history of Sweden. Instead of paying for the VikingAlive museum, go across the canal, walk up the street a bit and visit this museum. It is world class. I would recommend the audio guided tours.",
          "This is a large traditional museum with a significant amount of artifacts displayed in a professional atmosphere. I would recommend spending at least a couple of hours digesting all of the information presented. This is a place more geared toward adults who want to concentrate",
          "We were surprised that this museum is not more widely publicized. We were especially interested n seeing the Viking artifacts and were not disappointed. The gold room was an enormous collection of golden treasures. There are audio guides to buy but we did it ourselves",
          "This is a free museum that has an excellent section on Swedish prehistory and the Vikings. You can pay for a headset at the desk to hear added descriptions of the exhibits in different languages, which is very helpful. During the school year, groups of school kids often visit in",

          "We had a wonder around this museum as it was free entry. The history of sweden was interesting as it followed the timeline of Sweden's past. East to follow.. Unfortunately the rest of the museum has less of a flow and we were overloaded with information a bit.",
          "We opted to go the Swedish history museum to check out the items from Viking history. The museum had two very good sections and one not so good. The gold room is amazing with loads of items of jewellery and other bits to look at. The section on Viking history is also",
          "It has some good interactive elements and is laid out well. The medieval section through to c21st was well laid out. If in Stockholm for 3 days it is worth a visit, especially as it is free!",
          "After 6+ hours in the hypnotising Vasa museum, I was not looking forward to walking over to the Historika Museet in pouring rain, but I'm very glad we did. I've very much enjoyed TV shows about the Vikings but the Viking exhibits in this museum gave me a much deeper and broader",
          "This museum was quite interesting however we di not have enough time to view all the exhibits as them museum was closing in 45 min. We went straight to the Viking section the artefacts are quite good as in Australia we do not have anything like this in our museums and we are in",
          "The museum has a rather beautiful collection, especially regarding prehistoric objects. These are certainly worth visiting if you wish have an interest in pagan art and society. However, the expositions are a mess. Signs are often missing, many texts don't have English",
          "This is a great collection of mediaeval history. The section on the battle of Gotland is fascinating. The gold and silver room is like i have never seen. There is a decent little restaurant here which is nice for a break. Lockers so you don't have to haul your coat. This is",
          "It is not THE most interesting thing to do in Stockholm, but sort of a \"must-do\" if you are in town for a few days.",
          "I chose to concentrate on the Swedish history exhibition, which I found very much to my liking. I think, however, that the primary focus is on the period leading up to 1800. From 1800 onwards, I found the presentation to be more sporadic and less cohesive.",
          "Excellent museum on the history of the Vikings and pre-twentieth century. There was, however, an odd lack of information on Sweden during the twentieth century, specifically during World War II. We really wanted to learn more about that time in Sweden and their place in that",
          "The Vikings section is really good. You will find many small ships, skeletons preserved as they were at the time of excavation. That's really amazing. The history of Sweden is also good. The Birka girl is one of the main attraction. The baroque hall is grand. The medieval art",
          "Free entry. Interestingly constructed informative exhibitions about the swedish history. The viking exhibion was good. It had a modern scholarly approach that brough into the focus a more realistic interpretation on vikings instead of propagating the national romantistic",
          "I mostly learned that Vikings were mostly farmers that comb their hair, that men wore necklaces and that their helmets did not have horns. There was only 3 helmets on show for example and one small Viking ship reproduction. Generally, Swedish people seem ashamed of their",
          "Visited this free museum with my fianc\u00e9 during our holiday in Sweden. Great value (free) for a history lesson in the Nordic countries. Check it out if you are on a tight budget.",
          "Good collection of objects from Viking era, including boats and swords. The period after medieval period did not have impressive sets of objects, but you will learn a lot.",
          "The Swedish History Museum is a great place to put on your list of things to do when you are in Sweden. The history of this country is very interesting and high class place.",
          "Amazing museum with wonderful exhibitions on Prehistory and Viking Age! I really enjoyed time which I spend admired usual archaeological finds from Sweden.",
          "I'll start by answering the most important question. FREE ENTRANCE, you don't have to book or pay anything, except of course if you eat at the restaurant or buy souvenirs. They have a massive collection of viking artifacts, remains and rune stones. The museum features the start",
          "Traveling with 4 others, we all thoroughly enjoyed this museum. Learning about the Vikings was fascinating!",
          "This museum is not on the beaten track, where you find the other museums, but it is on the hop on hop off bus route. I specifically went for the Viking exhibit, which was exceptionally well done. There are other exhibits about the history of Sweden etc that are interesting too.",
          "It was a miserably wet day in Stockholm that\u2019d dashed my fair-weather plans when I visited, but it turned out to be quite a fun and informative day in the museum. This is a free to visit museum in what\u2019s considered one of the most expensive cities in the world, with very nice",
          "I personally love to visit countries' history museums whenever I visit and this was no disappointment. There's a tonne of artefacts to enjoy dating from prehistory and the way the museum is set up, you walk through history and see the artefacts associated with each time period.",
          "Lots of original details from the Viking time. Modern, well adapted for kids, and very enjoyable by adults. Don't forget the gold chamber! We pay the museum at least one visits per year.",
          "I can highly recommend this museum. It is a really well thought out museum with fantastic artefacts and displays. My only criticism is that some of the tours are not in English :(",
          "The Swedish History Museum is a lovely place to visit to know more about Sweeden and its' history so visit it!",
          "This museum is tucked away (though wasn't too far from our hotel), and in May when we visited, it was almost empty. My husband and I enjoy a good museum, and found this to be informative and enjoyable. It taught us a lot about Scandinavian and Swedish history, was well laid-out,",
          "Good even if you don't have children. We saw a good deal of Viking artefacts, across the ground floor. Free entry. Worth a visit",
          "The museum shows the history of Sweden from its first inhabitant to today. It has many very interesting collections including the world's largest collection of Viking artifacts. The Swedish history is quite interesting. Explore the galleries following their chronological order.",
          "Amazing how many information and artefacts from the viking time you find in this wonderful museum, the presentation is fantastic, I highly recommend to everybody, for me one of the best museums I ever see, and no charge for entry, whow",
          "The Historical Museum covers two floors of a large building. There\u2019s a good light restaurant for lunch and a pleasant gift shop. Likely the Viking exhibits are most popular, but the earlier prehistoric exhibits, also on the first floor, are well arranged. The second floor offers",
          "I loved the Viking display especially, a robust and very well laid out collection. I would recommend getting the audio guide as well. Also, the pre-history collection was quite good as well. As was the Gold room. Free admission was nice as well, and unexpected. Would",
          "The museum is well laid out and have some interactive activities for the visitors. The Viking section is very interesting. However, Sweden's so called 'nutrality' during the war, apart from saying it is controversial, barely mentioned. I suppose if you declare yourself nutral",
          "We visited the Swedish History Museum to specifically see the Gold Room. The building is a bit off the tourist path, you\u2019ll find it on the mainland on the way to museum island. It\u2019s free admission and the gold room is the first room, just to the right off the main lobby. It\u2019s",
          "Well organized and with a lot of interactive stuff. You will need around 3h to visit this museum. There are several exhibitions. Free entrance.",
          "One of the Swedish museums that you can enter for free. If you go every 2-3 weeks, you will find new stuff to watch. Interesting for children and adults. Nice restaurant too",
          "This museum has some fine artifacts and is very much oriented towards youngsters. It seems to encourage dialogue on social conventions as much as history, and while that is basically a good thing I found the set-up somewhat irritating, even patronising. However I am not a",
          "Lots of artifacts and nicely organized exhibits of the settlement and people of Sweden. Free entry. There's a little cafe and the T stop is close by.",
          "We did not see the entire museum, just the first floor. The Viking portion of the museum covers an entire wing, with a second wing relating indirectly. The Viking section is quite interesting; it approaches the vikings from their cultural side, as opposed to their conquest",
          "here you can meet the swedish history and what made this society so good through the years. totally recommended",
          "Interesting exposition: jewellery, human bones and skeletons, instruments (chance to see and understand how church organ looks inside and play it - there's a small exhibit), bells, viking's boat, history etc. Free admission.",
          "This FREE entrance museum was fantastic. Amazing amount of articles and artifacts. I learned so much about Sweden's past here! We visited several museums, and this one was definitely the highlight!",
          "Enjoyed the exhibits showing history of fashion, food service, furniture, etc. Museum is in a large space so wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking and probably more to see than you can do in one visit so start with the areas of most interest.",
          "Yes, there's lots of gold - rings, necklaces, coins - in cases in the underground Gold room (they made a lot and brought in a lot in Sweden)...but...but...the best bit is the hall of wonderful 15th/16th century wooden alter sculptures up on floor 1. Slightly baffling layout",
          "My family loved the Viking exhibit, could have spend more time here. Free!! when you are a party of 9 it's the kind of place to go. There was something for everyone, from age 8 - 70.",
          "Enjoyed this museum and the price was right-FREE. with in walking distance of our stay. Great history lesson of Sweden.",
          "Tips: 1. Visit this museum on Fri-Sun at about 1pm to catch the free guided tour. 2. If you were to choose to focus on one room, do visit the history of Sweden section. The artifacts are not laid out plainly and simply for visitors to view; we are expected to pay attention to",
          "Hosted in a modest-looking building this is an very well organized and detailed walk through Swedish history from pre-history till 17th century. The entry is free (was a nice surprise), audioguides are inexpensive. Moreover it is the same audioguide that you can follow on their",
          "Se genuine artifacts from history and Viking culture and GOLD! And they got an excellent medieval department.",
          "I wasn't planning to visit this museum but was wandering past on my way to Vasa and thought why not. I thought it was a beautiful museum and very well organized and interesting all the way through. I'm not usually all that captivated by artifacts, but it was cool to learn about",
          "A great experience for those interested on archeology or history in general. You can find a timeline of Swedish history with very amusing displays here. The battle for Gotland and the viking sections were particularly interesting for me.",
          "A lot of Viking era exhibits, be sure to go down to the gold room. A nice cafeteria. This was one of our favorites.",
          "There was in the end of august an open exposition about vikings. It was really nice; they even had some games and tents outside to make you feel like one if you wanted. You could try your skills in archery trying to get some ducks, squirrels or foxes drawn in a dartboard. Some",
          "The exhibitions are very interesting and invite you to compare life of the Vikings or the early Swedish people with our life nowadays. The atmosphere is very relaxed and there are not many visitors. We didn't use the audioguide and still received lots of info. Some texts are",
          "We had a look here on a whim. However, it's really interesting! There is plenty here for adults and children. There is a full range from vikings to religion. Plenty of history surrounding Sweden itself in the form of a timeline. Considering this is also free entry, I think",
          "The good part of visiting this museum was the free entrance, good restaurant and the audioguides (5 euro). The exhibit of christian goods is interesting and well displayed, on large rooms with few people around. But the newer version of history displaying commonly-based",
          "I heard this was a great place to go and I was not disapointed. Fantastic collections, great info, and very few people. They should market this museeum so more tourists would find out, it's great and even ha free entrance!",
          "A nice museum to browse through various ages of Swedish history. Also conveniently close (10 minutes' walk) to Nordiska museet, Skansen, Junibacken, ABBA museum, Vasa museum, Gr\u00f6na Lund and a good number of other Stockholm attractions (between 10 and 20 minutes, depends on the",
          "We spent a couple of hours going through the Swedish history timeline and the Viking exhibits - both excellent and very comprehensive, but the best was to come. The museum has the most wonderful collection of medieval altar pieces you could see anywhere. Absolutely stunning - we",
          "This museum is worth a visit, even with children. We went during the summer, and in the courtyards there where several live exhibitions about Vikings for children. We took the 45 min guided tour of the Viking exhibition wich was really good, and after the tour we took the time",
          "During our trip tour we had the chance to visit this great museum. Lovers of history and not only will find here a oasis from oldest prehistory to the Viking and Middle Ages. Where else you can try to dress like a Viking if not here... A lot of important archaeological",
          "Good museum about the history of Sweden, from the pre history through the vikings all the way to the present. Most people go for the Vikings history section, but I found the other sections much more interesting.",
          "This museum has a lot to offer, and it has free admission. We had visited several other cultural sites dealing with Viking history in Denmark and Norway, so we visited other areas of this museum instead of the Viking section. The museum offers an interesting timeline of Swedish",
          "Although we did not stay at the Grand Hotel, I had a long conversation with the doorman who is a history buff. He recommended this museum to me and he was absolutely correct. I learned so much about the early people of Scandinavia here. The exhibits are thoughtfully presented",
          "This is a great place to visit to learn more about the Vikings, se their gold treasures, the normal life equipment and how they lived.",
          "I wanted to see the Viking exhibit and was not disappointed. We caught a free (English-language) tour just because of our good timing. It was a great thing to have done before wandering about through the rest of the museum. The collection is great and for someone who wanted",
          "Too strung out into too many areas. For most it would be fine but it sent you in too many directions. The Viking display is good. Wanted more history in that direction rather than just items found.",
          "Very nice museum Free every day and with possibility os audio guides only for 15 seks. The Viking area was very good with interesting details from audio guide. Interesting for children with Viking plays outside",
          "The Swedish History Museum, portrays life hundreds of years ago. For all of those who like the Vikings (adults and children alike), a visit to the museum is very enjoyable and interesting.",
          "Before you enter the Museum proper, do remember to read the history of the Museum on the board at the entrance. The building housed originally Military Barracks and over the years it's conversion into a Museum has been magnificently achieved. The first surprise as you enter is",
          "We spent time in the silver and gold room - beautiful - before taking an English tour of the Viking part of the museum. The guide was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, and the displays were well done. There seemed to be hands-on activities for kids going on in the courtyard, too.",
          "Of the five very fine museums we visited in Stockholm, this was the best. The exhibits were arranged in thoughtful, creative ways. For instance, the lives of people were imaginatively reconstructed through the bones and possessions of five specific individuals going back in",
          "We found this museum while walking - quite random. We are so glad we went in! The woman at the desk asked us what we were interested in. We said we knew nothing about Swedish history so everything was of interest. She suggested a path through the museum that was a perfect",
          "Excellent display of Swedish history with an easy to follow timeline. Not only get historical facts but political insight that is important to comprehend the historic events. Recommended.",
          "As a History student at university in the UK visiting Sweden for the first time, I was SO impressed with this free entry museum. The presentation of information is just so progressive and interesting in comparison to all other History museums I have been to. I spent most time",
          "If you, like me, are a huge nerd who can spend all day in a museum, this is a great one. They have exhibits on everything from European pre-history to the Viking Age to modern history, and the museum itself is quite beautiful and aesthetically clean. If you're a person who",
          "The best bits for us were the Viking and Dark Age displays. These had remains from numerous graves which make the Sutton Hoo remains in the UK appear to be an outlier of a wealthy burial tradition based in Sweden. The prehistoric material, though good, was a bit more difficult",
          "First off this museum is free of charge. So that's a huge plus. It has a complete history of Sweden from 900-now. Very informative and very easy to navigate. We were there for 2 hours and it was time well spent. Go to this place if you can. It's climate friendly and has",
          "Very good Historic museeum and a large one. If you want to learn about the Swedish history from the Vikings. A matter of fact it is one of the largest about Vikings and very interrested. This summer you can try to feel like a Viking in outdoor of the museum, bake, see how the",
          "It's free so you can't go wrong. It has some great aspects to the museum and interesting displays. I found the way they displayed it a little odd though. The Viking section wasn't what I expected it to be but still very interesting. It's worth going to. Again, ITS FREE.",
          "We spent a wonderful 3 hours exploring the Viking displays and the historical displays. Many kids were outside in the courtyard playing with the interactive activities and games. We loved it.",
          "Very fun to visit during the summer with outdoor activaty. Look and read alot about the vikings and nordic history. Close to Djurg\u00e5rden, only a 5 min walk.",
          "This museum has an interesting approach to how it presents Sweden's history. It is built in the form of a walking path, chronologically following events, etc through history. It has a nice collection of items. I found the curation very confusing because items discussed often",
          "Very good chronological detail of events in history since the 13th century. One caution. At the top of the first set of stairs the arrow suggests going right. If you go this way you really tend to go from modern times backward. Go straight ahead and through chronological detail",
          "We got great information from the Information Desk about how to best use our two hours of time in the museum. We were lucky to arrive shortly before a tour of the Viking Exhibit in English began. There are also exhibits spanning prehistoric times to the modern era, and a \"Gold",
          "I had mixed emotions about this museum. The vikings section was nice but I thought it could have given even more information. Some artefacts exhibitions were a bit weird (toothbrushes?). Goldroom was boring. But, the timeline upstairs was nice, amongst other things. And it's",
          "Modern museum includes a good display of ancient gold work from several centuries. While we were there, it also opened the courtyard for a re-enacted Viking settlement in which kids could watch metal working, see cooking, try archery, board a small boat on the pond, etc. Very",
          "The history museum is a completely worthwhile stop to lay your foundation of Swedish history. It has many interactive displays and makes good use of multimedia. The Viking gold room (plunder room) has an amazing range of gold and other precious metals brought to Scandinavia from",
          "Very diverse museum nicely organized. A chronological path could be followed to connect to Swedish history. Huge amount of info in various display methods. We especially enjoyed the Vikings exhibition. Free entrance.",
          "Not packed with visitors and oriented towards children (there were many children doing crafts and activities in a special soundproofed courtyard; if I had children with me this would be a great place to go for them!) but as adults we learned a lot about the Viking culture. Very",
          "Like all historical museums it has a lot to tell and so it is large but well laid out, the exhibits are interesting and informative and logical. Fascinating artifacts from the earliest settlers to this area and wonderfully preserved depictions of life. Deserves several visits.",
          "Some of the exhibits appealed to us more than others. However, there is a wide variety and we are glad we went. The Viking exhibits were of particular interest. A nice cafe provides a place to sit down for a break.",
          "We aren't really 'Museum' people but we came because this place boasts one of the world's largest Viking exhibitions and the museum was Free...how can you beat that! We walked through the 'gold room' and the collections weren't as vast or as interesting as I was expecting. Oh,",
          "This FREE museum was not on my radar to visit but I was glad that I did. Amongst the many treasures on display is the \"world's oldest organ\", lots of Viking artifacts, Medieval art (such as a great collection of altarpieces) and much more.",
          "This is a very nice free museum to visit and understand more about Sweden and its people. Can be nicely completed by a visit to the Nordiska since this one is more based on archeological finds and antique history, while Nordiska completes the picture with a portrait of the",
          "a little off the path of central stockholm but worth the trip especially the Golden Room. Close to Ostermalms Food Hall so that makes it a nice combination",
          "Our small children couldn't spend much time indoor and undestand the interesting the exhibition but they were completely captivated by the amazing outdoor activities. They spent an hiur making and cooking flatvreads, rowing in the ship and trying archery. Would highely recommend",
          "Viking exhibit was first rate. Covered all aspects of viking life. The gold room is literally the jewel in the crown. It's not too often that you can see a display of old gold and silver artifacts, coins and jewellery as they have on display Free entrance which is nice.",
          "We went here specifically to see the displays focused on the Viking era (800 to 1050 AD) and to gawk at the gold and silver items (Bronze Age to the Middle Ages) in the Gold Room. Both proved to be a worthwhile investment of vacation time. The Viking displays were beautifully",
          "We spent 90 minutes here and only saw on part. We had limited time so we went round the Viking history section we did not have time to visit the Gold Room which we understand is very good. The Viking Section was very interesting and appeared to dispel the myth that they only",
          "Most of the museums in Sweden are interactive. This one too, very informative and interesting. When I was there it was even free of charge. It starts the tell from the Vikings national propaganda and continues with the later medieval and modern part of the history of svenska",
          "This is an exceptional museum. You can easily spend 1/2 a day here and not get bored. It is best museum in Stockholm. Many Viking artifacts. Really special.",
          "We went to the Swedish History Museum on a whim, since the reviews were good, it was within walking distance, and our other tour was cancelled. I am very glad that we did. This museum provides information, but it also asks you to think about what you see. Take the time to see",
          "This museum is free. It was designed well and understanding Baltic culture, history and tradition are very good. There are a lot of historical material.",
          "If you like museums, you'll like this one. It's not one of the best museums I've ever been to, but it is a good one. I wish it had done a more thorough job explaining the waxing and waning of the Swedish empire and why Sweden was such a European power in the 1600's, but it did",
          "Went here for a few hours and really enjoyed my time there. I'm very interested in the Vikings era and this museum had a lot of very interesting stories and exhibits covering that period. Also with Stockholm being so expensive my wallet appreciated the fact that it was free",
          "We weren't planning to visit this museum, but read a description and decided to check it out. It is great. Make sure to use the audio ap for your phone. I had to return to the info desk where the signal was strongest a few times to get it going, but the cards hanging on rods",
          "Especially the viking exhibition and the treasure room are must, when you visit this museum in the center of Stockholm",
          "I wanted to learn about the vikings and the museum has a great exhibit about their ancestors, the Vikings. This multi-media exhibit included video, displays and documents that helped illustrate the life of Scandinavians in 800-1100 AD and the 10% who were Vikings. The museum",
          "Very well organized museum about the history of Sweden from the prehistoric era to 21st century. Three main sections: prehistoric Sweden, the Vikings and a historic path from year 1000 until now. A part from that there is the \"Golden Chamber\" displaying ancient jewellery for",
          "I could have stayed here for hours, there is lots to see and the museum is fantastically curated and well laid out. It is easy to get to on public transport and in a nice area which is close to other attractions.",
          "It's free so worth a visit when the weather is poor. There are some fantastic pieces from across the ages which have a big wow factor. The low score is because the audio guide (wifi/internet version) frequently dropped out and failed to load correctly - this lead to frustrating",
          "This museum is one out of 80 in Stockholm. It specialises in Swedish history from the earliest times to present. The battle of Gotland 1361-Medieval was well presented. The gold rooms is not to be missed. We spend over 3 hours strolling through this museum. Wonderful exhibits.",
          "This is a great museum packed with many informative exhibits on the history of Sweden. I liked the Viking medieval exhibits. It also has free admission.",
          "We particularly liked the Viking exhibit. The gold room is not as impressive was we anticipated. We also liked the medieval massacre exhibit. This museum takes about 3-4 hours to see thoroughly.",
          "Great museum for adults and children alike with little activities for the younger ones. Very pretty too! The Viking section and the Swedish history one are great! My favorite in Stockholm",
          "We had some problems getting there from the tram because there is a lack of signposting. However, once there you forget. This is one of the best national museums I have visited. The displays are clear and they contextualise the finds very well. I especially liked the timeline in",
          "It's not a fantastic museum but it's worth seeing. The hordes of gold are amazing--showing just how much the Swedes sailed around conquering and acquiring. The timeline-oriented exhibit of history was well done although a bit more commentary and less detail would have made",
          "This is one of the best museums that I have ever visited. The Viking exhibitions were striking as well as the elements from the Goths and earlier bronze-age groups. I felt like I was looking at relics from Beowulf. I was a little disappointed in the brevity of the Empire section",
          "The museum is worth a visit for a number of reasons, but if you're going solely for the highly-touted gold room, you may be disappointed. I was.",
          "We ound very interesting the viking section (including the presentation of the Birka village), the idea of making a year counter for the Swedish history with a lot of enterntainment gadgets to discover. Very very smart created and very interactive (including for the children).",
          "Inspired displays on the ground floor, very informative and English translations everywhere. Learnt a lot about Swedish history. Well worth a visit..and it's free!!",
          "I liked the museum, it was just one strange thing, museum also showed Kurdish person producing bells in his own country. I wondered what does it have to do with Swedish, or Norse history ?",
          "This museum was quite large, and was also free. Having not ever learned much about Swedish history, this museum taught me a lot. There is also a nice cafe/restaurant that is inexpensive.",
          "Unfortunately we were limited on time when visiting this museum and had to rush in the end as it was closing. We'd spent a long time meandering through the Vikings section, moved on to the next section when we realised that time was very limited which unfortunately meant that we",
          "This is one of the best presented museums for prehistory I have visited. It displays everything beautifully and in an interesting way that focuses on the lives of the people. It is designed so that children will enjoy it and I find this approach is conducive to adult pleasure",
          "Besides the Vasa Museum, this is the other amazon museum in Stockholm. The exhibits are beautifully curated and there is so much to see that you really need several visits. The permanent collection is as fabulous as the temporary exhibits. The cafeteria serves really delicious",
          "Lots to see hear and some fascinating stuff if you're into the Viking period. Opens late into the evenings too if you're making the most of your days.",
          "I remembered is as a very interesting museum from my first visit a couple of years ago and loved it even more this time. Naturally lots of information and interesting exhibits, but also fascinating ways of showing and discovering history. Surprisingly enough, one of the things I",
          "It woulh have been a great experience if not for quite many missleadings. Either the captions are wrong or are intentional wrong. As a total the museum is interesting, a window in the life of Scandinavians.",
          "The museum has several permanent exhibits, including one of the Viking heritage of the Sweden, a second on the history of Sweden from the Middle Ages to the present, and a third on the battle of Gotland in 1381. It provides an excellent introduction to Swedish history and",
          "We visited Stockholm in early May and need a nice cool place to recover. The wife happened to look up museums in the area and had this little gem tucked away just in case. After a short ride in the subway, we exited at Karlaplan and walked a couple of blocks to the museum.",
          "A nice museum. Well laid exhibits. The museum entrance is free. A must see in Stockholm. Its at a walking distance from the VASA museum and Nordisk Museum.",
          "During previous visits to Stockholm we did not make time for a visit to the Swedish History Museum - I had no idea what historical treasures we were missing and am so happy that we took the time to visit on this trip. The Viking exhibit is simply awesome as well as the artifacts",
          "Considering that this museum is free, it's really quite excellent. You can learn more about Swedish history (this is the best section in our opinion) and a lot about vikings. We found some of the content a bit random and without a good flow but this is our only criticism.",
          "We really appreciated the free entry. They have a nice Viking exhibit with many runic stones and other artifacts. Very informative and I came away with some new information. I also enjoyed the Swedish history exhibit that brought you throught the history of Sweden. very",
          "Traveling back in time is exactly how you feel when the doors of this amazing place closes behind you when you enter the Swedish History Museum. To start at the year 1000 and then progress slowly through time on the time line laid out on the floor is again amazing. I think one",
          "As first time visitors to Sweden and Stockholm we spent a very enjoyable and informative 3 hours at this museum. The Museum offers free entrance and provides very detailed information and exhibits on the history of Sweden. Well worth visiting.",
          "Very interesting exhibits on the history of Sweden, including the Vikings and how modern day Sweden came to be. There were also interesting, thought-provoking sections on modern life. The museum is small in comparison to the behemoths in London or Paris, but it's still a worthy",
          "I can't say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed this museum. It had a very unique view of how best to share Sweden's history, and they did an excellent job taking us from pre-historic era to 'modern-day' Sweden. If you are at all into museums put his on in the must-do pile,",
          "I thought it was very interesting but I don't think the children were not so impressed. The 14 year old said there were lots of dead people. Worth a visit to find out about vikings and toilet brushes. The restaurant is ridiculously expensive tho....",
          "Great museum to visit in Stockholm. The exhibitions are well made and should also appeal to children (there are children activities too). The museum covers the history from the Iron Age, Vikings and up to the more recent history of Sweden. There's also a caf\u00e9 and a small museum",
          "A small little museum that covers life in Sweden. Great for children and families. And tourists that are curious about our history!",
          "A great free museum about the history of Sweden, if history interests you then you should like this museum.",
          "If you are a museum and history lover, it is a very good museum with artifacts from many different periods in Swedish history. The best thing is that it is FREE! :) I wish the content was a bit richer though... On the other hand, it offers books and games for the children too,",
          "This really gave me a very good update on the history of Sweden from long time ago through the vikings, the Vasas, the european superpower during the 16th and early 17th century and onwards.",
          "Fascinating history museum telling you about the history of the nation and the people of Sweden. A good restaurant there as well, we stayed for lunch.",
          "Very good museum, great to understand viking era. Is you are lucky, they organise during summer a viking market. You can bake you own bread like they used to do it, and play with the tools and much more. Very good way to spend half day in Stockholm.",
          "Lots about vikings and early Swedish settlement. Liked the play area for kids where they get to pretend to excavate an archeological site.",
          "I love to learn about history of all countries I visit. So historical museum sounds just right for me. I first surprise for me was there's no entrance fee needed. Then the year by year content are easy to follow and helped me understand Sweden as a country in the past better.",
          "This is the only museum I visited during a day trip to Stockholm. It is good to explore the culture and the history of Sweden in this museum. I was impressed with it. Admission is free. Overall experience was great.",
          "With all the techno whizz in some places , this museum seems a bit plain and conventional. Actually some of it is a bit country museum , done well. But, stay an extra hour, get the app or headsets , walk the history trail and listen to the excellently curated explanation of each",
          "If you only go to one museum in Stockholm, this should be it. This is Sweden in a nut shell and should not be missed. Built in Baroque style the building itself is magnificent. The museum outlines in incredible detail all aspects of the long and colorful history of Sweden. The",
          "Definite lack of recent history. They have plenty of material but it's not really joined up into any story.",
          "We only managed to see some of the museum's sections, but it was all so impressive, stunningly arranged and engaging. I believe this is one of the many musts to see once in Stockholm.",
          "This is a very interesting museum, a lot of history over that ages, great information and artefacts. Definitely go down to the Gold Room",
          "The museum was having some work done when we looked around. But it was still possible to see some really interesting artefacts from Swedish history, particularly the Vikings.",
          "I actually went to the museum twice. On the first visit I saw the prehistoric section, the Vikings part and the Gold Room. As I was running out of time, I returned two days later to see the remaining part, essentially covering the last thousand years. As it happened, I",
          "I thought the layout of the museum and general chronological layout was well designed. Felt too much of the space was given over to the pre-historic man. Definitely wanted more of the viking history and culture.",
          "It had been years since I had visited the historical museum, and the displays had been changed, but it was still very interesting.",
          "The first thing you should know about this excellent museum is that it's FREE. This is a great museum to begin any trip to Sweden. The Museum covers Sweden from prehistory to present day. and there's a lot to see. Audio guides are available. Some of the exhibits that I enjoyed",
          "I'll admit, I visited this museum mainly to gain better insights into the Viking portion of Sweden's past, and it definitely did not disappoint - there is a lot of great information and artifacts to examine. The Gold Room also is a great look into the precious metals work of the",
          "Swedish History Museum is great place to visit, bouth solo or with family ( Some parts are very interesting for kids, like the Arheology part, where they can dig in the send). What I loved most is that in every room history meets legends, beautiful tales and philosophy. Past is",
          "This museum is free to enter which is always a bonus and we found to be very interesting. The viking exhibits are very comprehensive and interesting as you would expect. But we found the medieval section great as well as it walks you through the entire history of Sweden.",
          "Great museum. Gold room was amazing, and the 5000 BC skeleton and prehistory very interesting. Probably could have spent 2-3 hours here.",
          "I spent 2 hours in here, so interesting giving a good background and understanding of the Swedish country and people. Lots of gold and silver the Viking Era brought back lots of goodies to Sweden. It is easy to navigate and you can take pics without flash.",
          "The museum is really worth to visit. You can learn more about Swedish history and lifestyle, answer questions and listen to the unique stories. It's nice for adults as well as for children.",
          "Being a history teacher, I really enjoyed this museum. It is well-worth a visit for families as well as adults. Admission is free and there are many things which children would also enjoy.",
          "Like all swedish museums, this one is pretty plain and full of pictures and drawings, depicting the ancient and middeval life. Not extraordinary and I am sorry for the entrance fee (hint: friday is free).",
          "i traveled half of Europe and i can say that, this museum does not stand out. It gives you the feeling how people then lived and how everything looked plus how Sweden became what is now, but you are always getting a feeling that you have seen all of it before and hopefully they",
          "For swedes visiting would be fantastic, for a casual observer it was interesting for 1 hour. Free!!!!' Stop after Vasa visit very close by!",
          "Visit this place as it is free!!! So much Swedish history and it is in a lovely place within the centre of Stockholm. They also have a nice restaurant and serve good meals.",
          "What I love about the Swedish History Museum is how it tries to bring history to its visitors. Its exhibits help you understand what it might be like to live during Viking times or the 18th century. Not only that but many of its exhibits are LGBTQ+ friendly!",
          "I shouldn't give this a 1 star...it really is a 5 star...but frankly, when the iron age exhibits are framed around gender wars, my disappointment level rises immeasurably. Signs like \"<<is a boyish girl more ok than a girlish boy?\" belong in a sociology class, not a museum about",
          "The museum showed the early history of the area. There were interactive activities for the younger kids. For those of us that did not read Swedish, there were translations in English.",
          "This was our favourite of the three museums we went to in Stockholm....and not just because it was free! They had so many different displays...the Viking one, was probably the largest. My favourite was the time walk....where you could follow Swedish history through the ages",
          "This museum is now free. It gives information from prehistoric times, through the Viking Age up to about 1500 AD. We went back for a second visit during our three day stay in Stockholm. The museum does an excellent job at asking probing questions and making visitors think.",
          "We recently visited the museum and we were so glad we did. The museum is free to the public. We visited Birka the day before and learned of some of the items in the museum - it was pure luck this occurred, but we were able to appreciate the items in the museum so much more",
          "The Swedish History Museum is a not to be missed experience. It is a large free museum northeast of the downtown in an area which has some of Stockholm's oldest buildings. The museum covers Viking culture extensively showing their culture, lifestyle and many artifacts. It also",
          "We love museums and this was no exception. Well curated and full of interesting displays. ...and it was free? They even had some interactive things for kids to do in the courtyard. Very glad we went.",
          "I was there about two hours learning about Stockholm history. The museum has a lot interesting things from the Viking culture.",
          "Learn more about the Vikings and Swedish history in this Museum that is FREE. They do have an audio tour for little cost and at certain times they have a tour in English with a guide. It is only a five minute walk from this museum to the Vasa Museum. This is largest museum in",
          "The Swedish History Museum is one of the unmissable places to go in Stockholm. To begin with, it's free. It contains a lot of the Swedish history, from early ages through present days, but the real highlight is the Viking section: swords, shields, helmets, clothes, treasures,",
          "We enjoyed our time in this free museum. The historic items are well displayed and organized and all of the descriptions are in English. The collection of gold ornaments is impressive. I feel like I really have a good sense of the country's history now. Good for adults and",
          "On my first day in Stockholm, I went to the Historiska Museet and was amazed by their exhibition on the Vikings. The museum is well organised and the audio guide is only \u20ac1,5. I only visited the Viking exhibition as it was what I was most interested in and didn't have much time",
          "I found the museum bursting with life and accessible to all ages. Great exhibitions and interesting pieces.",
          "Housed in an old army barracks, this museum clearly had a mission to show that history is interesting. The central courtyard contained interactive scenes where children could dress up in period clothes, play games of that age, and join in various creative activities such as",
          "So, I based an entire trip to Stockholm on the fact that the Historiska museum advertised it's fantastic Viking exhibition and we were not disappointed. Although the claim: \"Viking for a day!\" was a little much and the program of bow shooting and dressing up was directed at",
          "Very good considering it was free. Enjoyed the interactive Viking reenactment and the exhibition. Very enjoyable experience and good for a rainy day",
          "The Historika Museet aka the Swedish History Museum is situated in Stockholm and is a must for those who like vikings, free museums.... and gold! The gold room is simply a very large collection of golden objects from by-gone ages - mainly viking objects. There are bracelets,",
          "This free museum is a must see! Great viking exhibition to get to know them better. Do not miss it if you are in Stockholm! My favourite museum!",
          "First thing to know: there is no admission charge. This excellent museum is free! We enjoyed the Viking exhibition a lot including the interactive outdoor activities in the inner courtyard which brought Viking customs to life. Instead of the usual default Vikings=Bad Guys, this",
          "Located in a former military barracks & stable, The Swedish History Museum contains relics, war spoils and archeological finds from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages. Chronological displays in well organized rooms front an inner courtyard. Ancient pagan collections are found on",
          "A real trip through the ages, might be boring for younger people but mature individuals will be enthralled with the old clothes, toys and general household items for times gone by.",
          "Meet the Vikings was on show during our visit (not sure if this is permanent) but it was truly fascinating, don't believe all the hype on TV this really shows you their way of life with real life artifacts and a interactive village setting. I really loved this display. Don't",
          "All the expositions were interesting, with the proper labeling in swedish, at some points it got tricky to find the english descriptions, the audio guides are in very specific items. The vikings section was my favorite, everyone should learn more about vikings, vikings are good.",
          "Large museum covering all periods of Swedish history. Very well laid out and with information information. All areas worth a visit, especially the Gold Room and Viking area. When we visited there was an outdoor 'meet the Vikings' activity - cooking, tug of wars, Viking chess",
          "We decided to visit this museum to try and get a better understanding of the vikings. It is an excellent museum with free entry and has a great deal of information from pre-history up to the medieval times in particular, but not so much modern history. Excellent guides",
          "We spent a couple of hours here but skipped over some of the medieval history. We used an audio guide. It was useful for the Viking portion of the museum but not much use elsewhere. Many of the descriptions are in both Swedish and English, though less so in the medieval portion.",
          "Take the kids and a lot of time, this is the best museum you'll ever see. Brilliantly arranged exhibitions, such fun and nothing is boring. I absolutely loved it.",
          "The exhibitions at the Historiska Museet are well worth a visit. They are arranged in a very viewer and visitor friendly way with enough text (not too much) in Swedish and English. The Viking activities in the inner courtyard are especially child friendly and my grandkids spent",
          "Meet the Vikings exhibition was only one of the many fabulous collections, located in this grand classical building dating from the 1860s. Thousands of years of history, social, political, artistic, military are laid out in exemplary detail. We began in the prehistory epoch",
          "My teens weren't that interested in this museum but my husband definitely loved it. The Viking exhibition was a good, interactive attraction that I'm sure younger children than mine would love. Great that in summer it's open every day.",
          "This museum is a must for adults and kids. Smart, clever, progressive, hands on. It's free. It's provocative. It shouldn't be missed. Far better use of time than going to Skansen.",
          "Free Admission, pay for tours or audio guide, we paid for tour of Viking Exhibit [ if interested go to BIRKA], need to go back for more that we missed. I also checked in reinactment area, it was fun, baked some bread/pizza. Tram exit Djurgardsbron; Metro station Karlapan or",
          "There's awesome artifacts from the Viking era thus this can be called the museum of Scandinavian History. Solid restaurant and fun activities for the whole family in the yard of the museum. Recommend!",
          "We had planned a picnic for the day we visited, but were rained out. This free museum proved to be a great diversion. We spent several hours wandering through the wonderful exhibits, including the Meet the Vikings outdoor exhibit, where blacksmithing, stone banking and other",
          "If you had a greta interest in Swedish history, or if you wantd to know everything about vikings, look elsewhere, because this place does, in theory, have large exhibitions on both, but in realtiy , you ned up with mor or less zero new insights. The Sweden history tour takes",
          "Do not miss the golden room in the basement ! There you will find all the jewels that been found from Swedish history !",
          "The museum has several sections on Swedish history which do not necessarily link to each other chronologically, so you might get lost or confused. We visited the Vikings and general history afterwards. The artifacts were not amazing, but you'll get to know about the country's",
          "Interesting artifacts about the vikings, including a nice gold room full of jewelry. The museum is free and includes also children activities. English explanation is widely available. Free bag deposit boxes are also available.",
          "I visited this towards the end of my stay, but wished I'd visited it earlier so I could have spent longer at this museum. Not sure how long I did spend here (several hours at least), but there is plenty to see. I'm happy to pay entrance fees, but this is a free museum. It is",
          "I really enjoyed visiting this museum. The parts that I really enjoyed the most were the vikings and the gold room.I particularly loved the explanations of how the vikings used to live and their religion.",
          "Really enjoyed this place. Cool exhibitions especially the gold room. The cafe was nice too for a break. And it's totally free! Would definitely recommend!!",
          "This was an excellent museum. The three exhibits we saw were Vikings, Gold, and 1000 Years of Swedish History. We spent over 2 hours here and enjoyed every minute. We did not travel with children, but there were definitely activities for children as well. We opted to rent",
          "This is actually rather good and free. Look out for all the viking stuff and make sure you have a coffee and cake in the cafe - good value.",
          "It was very nice i really liked it . Sweden is a nice country with a beutifull history! Its good to go there in the summer.",
          "What blew me away about this museum is that I've never been to one that deals so critically with history and actually makes visitors wonder about the status quo not just of the past but also of today's society, while creating links to the world of today and presenting",
          "A quick tutorial on Swedish history. Most interesting, however, we were lucky that there was a special Viking exhibition on now that I think will run through until October. The Viking exhibition is excuse enough to visit the Museum",
          "This museum is housed on the grounds of a beautiful former estate that at one time was situated on the outskirts of the city. The many exhibits are professional and quite thoughtful. We chose to concentrate on the Viking history exhibit to learn more about a fascinating empire.",
          "Fun interactive stuff for kids, as well as beautiful galleries of exhibits more geared to an older audience. Really beautiful and fairly extensive collections of medieval religious artwork. Gorgeous courtyard cafe with tasty drinks and snacks.",
          "If you find yourself with a rainy day in Stockholm, the Swedish History Museum is a great way to pass an hour. With lots of exhibits on Viking history, it's entertaining to walk around viewing and educational if you take the time to read the captions, which include English",
          "Impressive arcitekture and exebition inside was nice. Great cafe inside the great hall with ok prices and good quality food. I do recomend a wisit to this place. Overall a good feeling and a great choice to cobine with the wasa museum.",
          "It's a good place to visit if you are interested in Vikings history. Plus you get to see lots of gold and silver in the basement.",
          "Just not my interest. I like machinery not so much jewelry and old skull, but for those that do, you will be happy here. I promise. The place has a lot of that to look at. I just don't much care how many times this or that place has been conquered by outsiders. That after",
          "First of all, this museum is free! The best parts, in my opinion, are the 1st floor (for Viking history and artifacts), and the gold room. So, if you are limited on time, just focus on those two areas and walk through quickly for the rest. It was interesting to see the rune",
          "This museum takes you through the history of Norway from prehistoric times. It also has a good Viking section. There are a range of activities designed for kids, which is one of its strong points. The museum offers guided tours, for example in English at 12 pm and 2pm. It",
          "Very well curated, with an impressive collection of artefacts. The Viking exhibition was fascinating and the medieval rooms were compelling. Be sure and start on the lower level in the Gold Room where you find huge displays of gold and silver! I would say it caters to the",
          "Very well curated, with an impressive collection of artefacts. Lots of interactive items, and worth spending a couple of hours there. The Viking exhibition was fascinating and the medieval rooms were compelling. No entrance fee!",
          "Just two blocks up from the bridge leadingto Djurgarden, this small museum outlines Swedish history from the Viking era to present. Admission is free, and it is open on Mondays when most other museums are closed. Be sure to visit the Gold Room downstairs, where you will find",
          "The museum is free, and we only got around the entrance level, which houses the Vikings exhibit and a gallery of gold artefacts from prehistoric times to the end of the middle ages. There is plenty of space so at least when I visited (Sunday lunchtime) there was no need to queue",
          "There are some gems in here, but there seemed to be a lot of \"padding\" and the mock-ups were mostly uninspirational. Looked like it was set up for school trips.",
          "The Viking and gold sections were pretty nice. I enjoyed them. Interactive place. It's great for kids. It has many things you can touch and interact with. Kids can run around outside and play with exhibitions. Interesting enough for adults.",
          "If you are interested in the Vikings like I am, then no trip to Sweden would be complete without visiting the Swedish Historical Museum. The Vikingar exhibition is outstanding, as it features a lot of exhibits that are concerned with the more parochial domestic side of Viking",
          "Having very little knowledge of Sweden and it's history other than the stereotypical Viking one most folks know I thought this would be a useful place to visit. First up it is free and no education that is free should be passed up. It leads the visitor through the pre-history",
          "I loved this museum. It had so many artifacts and presentations. There was so much to see you could easily spend an entire day. I loved the middle ages and viking ages. I learned so much about Swedish history. I could visit over and over again. So much to read and",
          "This museum is designed very well, with interesting information spread out in different presentation styles. I learned a lot and was never bored (which happens sometimes). The museum curators also took great care to make sure that the presentations were thought provoking and",
          "This museum takes you back from pre-history to modern times. Looking at the wonderful artifacts on display, it was easy to see how people lived back then. The Gold Room exhibit showcased wonderful ancient golden objects found through the years. The displays were well done and we",
          "Great experience learning about the Swedish, Viking history. Exhibits were fantastic, and each era was covered with amazing detail and equally impressive visuals. Not too crowded on our visit, which made it even easier to enjoy!! Many thanks!",
          "This museum covers Swedish archaeology and cultural history from the Mesolithic period to present day. Nicely laid out exhibitions. Very informative and educational. Highly recommend it to everyone visiting Stockholm, especially the history lovers!",
          "I wanted to like this museum more than I did. The displays are well laid out and very informative. The Gold Room in the basement is truly splendid and gives a surprising picture of how the Vikings leaders held power and the society functioned. The artifacts are carefully",
          "If you love Viking history then put this museum on the top of your list! The admission is free but I would have gladly paid admission to see this amazing collection which is the world's largest collection of finds from that era. The Gold Room has an extensive collection not to",
          "The Swedish History Museum charges zero admission. But, that is not the best news about this place. That would be the excellent exhibits and the museum's friendly, helpful staff. My husband and I spent almost four hours here and enjoyed every minute of it. Just as we were",
          "Accurate exhibitions drive you through the history of the piece of Scandinavia called Sweden in the past centuries.",
          "The visit is easy, ludic and teaching. Ideal to know some information about Swedish culture on a funny way.",
          "Excellent information that connects well to all ages. High quality display of information . Very interactive and kids can easily learn.",
          "I'm a history buff so this place is on my must-see list for when I'm in Stockholm. If you can, visit it in summer when they have re-enactors in the courtyard. Also take in the free wifi and treats in their cafe.",
          "So I'll start off with, there's not a lot to do in Stockholm that's free, so we walked around downtown and found this museum, walked in, and didn't expect a lot.... We were wrong. We spent a couple of hours walking through displays on the Vikings, religion and church through",
          "It is hard for me to identify a \"favorite\" of any type of thing when I am traveling, because I like different aspects about different things and it's hard to compare. At times, something will stand so far and above others. This is one of those museums. I have not seen anything",
          "Not many places that are free anymore - take advantage of this one. Great Viking display and the gold room was terrific. Small gift shop and cafe on site.",
          "1. Attraction: For about 300 SEK (\u00a325.00) on Saturday we got 2 tickets and audio sets so we could listen to the stories all way long in English language. It took us 4 hours to visit and I felt we should have come back for more. It's a walk through the ages of Sweden's history.",
          "The museum is a great investment of your time, as a half day will let you explore all the exhibits. The museum is currently free, which is why I decided to eat at the museum's cafeteria. It is not necessary to rent the audio tour, but I (gladly) did anyway. If you are not a",
          "This nice museum, also one of the largest museums in Stockholm, hides in the neighborhood of Ostermalm. It offers free admission so it's really great for visitors on a budget. All of its exhibitions are very extensive and comprehensive, and will probably take half a day to go",
          "I liked this museum and its restaurant. The only problem I found was that renting a head phone tour gave me little more than just reading the information provided. Some of the numbers where you push a button were only in Swedish. I wanted more explanation and better sound",
          "That's right it now has totally free access all year round. We spent most of a day there. My son loved it, he's 12. Very much Vikings meets Games of Thrones, lots of gory grisly history, skeletons and of course tons of fabulous Viking gold. Affordable gift shop, and reasonable",
          "Vikings, gold and silver in the huge Gold room, prehistory, interactive exhibits, and much more awaits you in this free museum. I really liked it a lot!",
          "A most interesting place to visit for those who want to learn more about Sweden. You may have a look all over the museum or only its one part and then come back next time - the museum is free of charge and so interesting that you might like to study it closer. I would",
          "I was surprised that there was no entrance fee for this museum in the off season. The building is shaped like a big square donut so it is easy to get around the 3 levels. There are lockers of all sizes situated near the restrooms. If you do not have a kroner coin, you can get",
          "A traditional museum where real artefacts are displayed and there is good use of lighting and audio interpretation. Gives a comprehensive and educational insight into Sweden's history",
          "An excellent Museum that is well worth the visit. This is a free Museum and is a welcome home for all. A good friendly atmosphere that is not too busy, and spacious, which is helpful if you have a family and kids. There is a coat hanger available and also lockers for your",

          "We went here on a Sunday, what was nice and quiet and give you plenty of time to look around at everything. The museum is brilliant, they have the best Viking collection I have seen and it was super interesting and fun. Anyone who loves Viking history has to come here it's a",
          "I didn't expect that much of free museum! I am used to boring exhibitions without any places to relax or have fun. But this is not the case. There were not only exhibitions with old artifacts but also there were a lot of parallels with present time. A lot of quests for children.",
          "Situated in a very picturesque surrounding the museum gives a glimpse of Swedish history from the age of Vikings. The artifacts are well preserved. The museum also boasts of a nice cafeteria and the admission is absolutely free.",
          "We wanted to go to the national museum but it was closed for refurbishment. We instead came to the Swedish history museum and weren't disappointed. Free admission and a small charge for a smart phone guide! Definitely worth it, and the walk over from Slussen around the water",
          "We went here for a few hours on the day we arrived in Sweden. As we had purchased passes, the entrance was free so I am not sure what the cost would have been, (there was a charge at the time but I think it is now free!). The visitor pass is well worth buying as you get entrance",
          "This museum is interesting for everyone who's interested in the history of sweden. It covers with great detail the viking period starting in the 5th-6th century via the medieval period until our time. The museum, similar to other museums in stockholm, is bilingual everywhere,",
          "Quite a large museum, interesting displays (although sometimes a lot of bones), good quality. The largest part is about the older history (Vikings etc) and a relatively small part is about the more recent history.",
          "This History museum is well worth a visit to get to know about Sweden's complicated history. It is free entry which is a nice bonus, but well designed and maintained with very interesting exhibitions. In particular, you can learn about early Swedish history dating back over 5000",
          "I found some of the exibits interesting but unfortunately there wasn't a lot of English translations so we struggles to find out what everything was. The Viking part was interesting though",

          "What a museum: a unique collection from the pre-history over the period of the vikings to the late middle ages, with some exceptional artifacts and all of this in a clear and visitor-friendly setting. A must see!",
          "I enjoyed the museum not only because it has a nice display of Viking artifacts but the way it leads you year by year on the floor and points out highlights of swedish history Entry is free there are lockers if you need and a small souvenir shop Located in \u00d6stermalm 2 blocks",
          "This was a great place to visit on the first afternoon of our trip. It really extended our understanding of Swedish history and culture. The exhibits are beautifully presented in chronological and themed order. The gold room - wow!!",
          "Excellent museum, informative and interesting but check opening hours online first. It has shorter opening hours in Winter, not opening until 11 or 12, depending on the day. Not open on Mondays at all. You will be asked to cloak backpacks so you will need a 1 crown coin.",

          "Super place to spend a whole day where kids can play and learn in many ways. I did it many times with my kids and friends, they had a great day everytime we came. If you also want to see the viking exhibition, go there first than play in the courtyard and have lunch in the nice",
          "If you want to learn about the history of the Vikings it's a good place to visit. As with most museums here it doesn't open til 12. But it's worth spending time here",
          "I spent half a day here after seeing a poster about the Viking display. It was wonderful to get a look at different aspects of Swedish history. I did a tour shortly after I arrived about the Vikings. The tour was very insightful (and in English!) and was a good start to my day",
          "It's a great museum and it's free of charge! It covers the whole history of Sweden with highlights like the Viking era and the golden room etc. It's really worth a visit, not many places would offer a museum like this for free, be prepared to take around 2 hours for the museum",
          "With just few well picked items per century it still gives good idea of how Sweden become what is it today. Even our museum hater (12) survived it rather well.",
          "This visit was 3 hours well spent in a well organised, well laid out museum. The free audio guide explains, in detail, where you are and at what you are looking. Our schedule didn't allow us to visit the caf\u00e9 but if it matches he rest of the museum, we missed aa treat!",
          "The gold room should have been a highlight but they managed to get the description key wrong on the signs and the two different booklets offered to visitors - they were not even consistent among themselves! Lots of new fangled stuff aimed at kids but I dare say irritating for a",
          "Viking exhibit is extensive and gives great insight to how it was back in the days. For sure one of the best museums in Stockholm. Keep and eye out for when they have free admission! And don't miss the gold in the basement! Impressive collection!",
          "We visited the Historiska Museet on New Year's day. We were surprised by the extensive collection about Vikings on the ground floor. The exposition about the Swedish History on the first floor was interesting, but not more than that in my opinion. The treasure collection in the",
          "We spent a wonderful afternoon at the museum. The displays are excellent, especially the Gold Room and the displays on the upper floor. It was wonderfully warm, as it was freezing outside, and we had a lovely coffee and cake in the caf\u00e9.",
          "After a rather wet visit to Birka, we decided that finding somewhere inside to see Viking Age artefacts may be a good idea, and visiting the Historiska Museet was great for this. Awesome exhibits on different aspects of Viking Age life, as well a very interesting exhibit that",
          "We went for the Gold Room, which won't disappoint - unless you work at Fort Knox you will never have seen so much in the same place, The exhibits that really blew our socks off, though, were the mediaeval altar decorations. Well worth the 10 minute walk from the Nordiska",
          "We were short on time, so we only visited the Viking exhibit and the Gold Room. Both were highly informative and well laid out.",
          "I will not be able to do this justice in a short paragraph. An amazing collection of artifacts. Excellently displayed. Geared to kids (over 8) and adults at the same time. Creates a sweep of history from Stone Age to Bronze Age to Romans to Vikings to Sweden as it emerges as",
          "Great museum with very kind service. The museum exhibits many unique pieces that offer a glimpse into swedish history and tradition. Worth the admission price",
          "Unfortunately we arrived about an hour before closing. Really enjoyed the 'gold exhibit' but missed the remaining museum.",
          "This museum has a unique and engaging way of displaying its artifacts, and the Viking collection was really impressive. My family and I enjoyed this so much more than the Vasa, and my brother (an archaeologist) said this was the best museum he's ever been to!",
          "We arrived at 10 am only to find it closed until 11am (winter opening times) This was very well done and most informative, going back way beyond Viking times. Lots of displays and information all about Swedish history, The highlight was visiting the GOLD ROOM !!! An underground",
          "Place for the ones interested in the history of visited places. Learn about the culture and history of Sweden. The Swedish History Museum offers a lot of extra activities during summer season, what make it even more welcoming.",
          "Vikings exhibition was great with the audioguide. Not crowded at all. A very pleasurable way to spend s Sunday morning.",
          "alot to see and alot to do. Went here as a afterwork activity with my colleges. Had a good time but after half way we were tired.",
          "I was lucky enough to visit when they had the Meet the Vikings exposition. The staff are very helpful, and even though you don't do a guide visit you can still learned a lot because they have the notes next to the expositions in both English and Swedish.",
          "This museum has changed face over the years. Today it is exciting, some great exhibitions and interesting walks to take. Very nice caf\u00e9/restaurant.",
          "The second floor has an excellent tour of Swedish history from the middle ages till today. Good place to start a visit to the country! The first floor is about the Viking period and is not as good - at least for the English speaker with an audioguide.",
          "On the last day of our recent visit to Stockholm, my wife and I enjoyed this museum. Everything was very good, all the displays have some sort of explanation in English, there is an Audio Guide, and it will require more than 4 hours to cover all the exhibits. We particularly",
          "We had a very enjoyable visit to this museum which has a good range of information and artefacts from different time periods. It's worth getting the audioguide as this provides a little bit more information on certain exhibits, particularly in the 'Gold Room'. There was a very",
          "We spent 4 hours in this museum without even realising the time!!!! It is so full of artefacts, stories, videos, and animations that we were intrigued from the start. The displays are very well presented and extremely well-explained. There is an audio guide in English, but many",
          "I found this museum super interesting, especially the prehistory and vikings sections. In the middle courtyard there were some activities to keep children entertained, but they were also fun for grown ups. There was a craft table, a tug of war rope, and the part I enjoyed most",
          "I went to the History museum for The Viking Exhibition, this part was great. Very interesting since there are a lot of myths about vikings and it is nice to get it sorted out. The guided tour was great too but also a bit disappointing since it only covered the viking exhibition.",
          "Interesting and informative! Easy to reach. Good demonstration and sometimes there are separate exhibitions. Just check what interesting things are going at the time of your arrival.",
          "Very interesting museum, with lots to see and to learn about Viking history. I would definitely recommend seeing while you are in Stockholm. The museum is not far away from the Vasa Museum. I think both museum complement each other and you can see them both in one day.",
          "We came here on a Friday, which was the free admission day. It wasn't too busy, but then again, it was mid-September when we went. I enjoyed very much the Viking exhibit and learned a lot about the Vikings at this museum. It allowed us to skip the day trip to Birka we were",
          "This is a fantastic museum for learning the history of Sweden. The museum does a great job of laying out the pre-history of Sweden with an insightful Viking exhibit. The museum also has an interactive archaeology component for kids, so that they can experience and learn about",
          "Very interesting museum. There's a lot in this museum! One of the \"exhibits\" contains a timeline on the ground which is really awesome. As you walkthrough you can go from the beginning of what is now known as Sweden to modern time. I really enjoyed getting a better view into",
          "It is easy to get to the museum by public transport. Desutom as it contains large collections of natural history that has been collected over several hundred years.",
          "I especially like the viking history part of this museum. Some of the artifacts, like jewelry and weapons, are truly amazing and the displays are well designed. The Gold Rroom is impressive and will dazzle with the amount of gold items on display. The museum store has some cool",
          "Very interesting display of Viking history. Especially informative is the small replica of a Viking village. We learnt that Vikings were not by nature a belligerent and agressive people. They were farmers mostly, trying to trade their produce with other peoples and countries. So",
          "I liked the history about Vikings and when first Swedish appeared. Really interesting history about Sweden.",
          "If you want to see a 2000 year old bun you have to visit this museum! If not, it's very educational if you\u00b4re interested in Swedish history. It took me three hours (including a cake eating break) to see everything. The museum shop was kind of boring, not too much variety going",
          "If you have kids, definitely take advantage of the hands on activity in the viking town. Actually, if you're an adult, it's still fun. The museum itself lays out the various monarchs and major historical events throughout Swedish history. Like any history museum, it's a lot to",
          "Large and Sprawling, the Historiska has pretty much what you expect to find in a museum about the History of Sweden, namely artefacts from the History of Sweden. Everything is presented very systematically and well-ordered although a number of exhibits will toss you back to grim",
          "I wanted to see the Viking artifacts from Birka. Unfortunately, while the museum was wonderful, the artifacts from Birka weren't labelled. Lots of Viking swords, treasure, a ring from the Middle East, etc. it's the museum to see for Viking lovers like me. The food in the cafe",
          "Our recent trip to Scandinavia to see and learn more about the Vikings and their culture had to include a trip to the Historiska Museet in Stockholm. Our tour company originally thought we would only need a couple of hours, but we convinced them that we would need all day, and",
          "Definitely one of the highlights of Stockholm, this is a must see! Some brilliant stories, AV concepts and displays make this museum experience one of a kind! A Lot of Viking history on display including the life like replica of the 'Birka girl' as well as some very very very",
          "This museum was really cool. There was a load of interesting stuff about the Vikings - we got to listen in on the guided tour for a little while and it was interesting. They also have a gold room filled with lots of coins, Viking gold and other goodies. Overall very cool.",
          "Very interesting museum to visit. The Viking collection is really great and worth visiting. Plus the museum offers free admission every Friday",

          "I've only had one hour before it closed so I didn't see the whole thing in the museum but it was really nice and so many things to learn and see, if you love the history about vikings and stuff you'd fall in love with this place",

          "Great displays well laid out Very important small bishops crozier from Ireland. Excellent viking material",

          "They have a great Viking Exhibit which is what drew us in but the entire museum is very interesting. They have parts that are interactive and its laid out very well. Well worth a visit",
          "Went there for the Viking exhibit. Very well done, concentrates on the life of the Vikings in Sweden not their more bloody endeavors. Interesting reconstruction of a small girl, lots of artifacts and some very nice and large rune stones. The gold room downstairs has a rather",

          "The main draw of this museum is the Viking section. It is very interesting, but anyone expecting stuff about the rape and pillage which went on elsewhere will be disappointed - this is about the life of Vikings in Sweden. The museum is very well thought out for adults and",
          "I enjoyed the visit to the historical museum, particularly the vikings exhibition. i've enjoyed the audio guide as well and the viking games outside the museum for adults and children",

          "the museum is also known as Historiska Museum. The entire museum was interesting. I enjoyed the viking exhibit as well as the gold room! so much GOLD!! the medieval massacre exhibit was also extremely interesting. storage lockers (have a 10 SEK coin for use) cafe and lots",
          "Very Cool exhibits, largest Viking exhibit in Sweden, our hotel gave us a coupon for buy one ticket get one free so make sure you ask your hotel if they have the coupon, if they dont its not expensive to get in. Nice cafe to get a bite to eat.",
          "We really enjoyed the Viking exhibit! I like this kind of museum where the exhibits are so varied. You can either browse through or you can learn more about the things that catch your fancy. Walking over glass floors with viking bones under your feet is just one example of the",

          "They have a Goid Room, with many rare and interesting gold artifacts and reasonable attempts to explain them, including commentary from goldsmiths. The had an exhibit on the Vikings which was extensive and had an informative English tour guide, who really knew her stuff - she",
          "The museum is veray accessible for all visitors and whilst not in the centre of the city it is esy to find using one of the Hop-on Hop-off bus tours. There are a number of gallerys covering Swedish history and culture - our favourite was the Viking gallery.",
          "We could have easilly spent a whole day here. Paid extra for the audio guide to the current temporary exhibition on vikings. Great idea but almost unnecessary as we were able to tag on to an excellent live guided tour with a member of the museum staff and local archelogist.",

          "Interesting (quick) overview of Sweden's history. Plenty of interactive exhibits and hidden facts to discover. A fun experience for kids and those young-at-heart. Their current Viking activities in the yard are informative and entertaining. Didn't try the restaurant. You need",

        "wiki": "The Katarina Elevator or Katarina Lift (Swedish: Katarinahissen) is a passenger elevator in Stockholm that connects Slussen (the sluice/lock area) to the heights of S\u00f6dermalm. The lift was a shortcut between Katarinav\u00e4gen, Slussen and Mosebacke torg. The original lift was constructed in 1881, but the current structure dates from the rebuilding of the Slussen transport interchange in 1936. The lift has been closed since 2010 due to lack of security in the construction.  There are plans to renovate the elevator's structure so that it can resume operation in 2019.\n\n\n== The old lift ==\nIn 1881 the engineer Knut Lindmark, was permitted to build a lift and a bridge between Stadsg\u00e5rden and Mosebacke Torg (Swedish: Mosebacke square), to make it easier for people to move between the different heights of S\u00f6dermalm. The lift was opened March the 19th 1883. During the first month approximately 1,500 passengers rode the lift daily. The price was 5 \u00f6re for going up and 3 \u00f6re for going down on the lift at that time.\nThe lift and bridge was constructed by the Belgian firm Lecoq & Comp, using a mechanism sourced from the American firm Weeks & Halsey. The original steam engine was replaced in 1915 with an electric engine.The elevator is shown in a scene from the movie The Prize starring Paul Newman.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Katarinahissen at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n== See also ==\nPolanco Lift\nSanta Justa Lift",

          "Unfortunately the lift seems to be out of order and there is a major construction site beside the tower but it's still an amazing view point. The glass at the top is also covered in graffiti. You can still get to the tower via a sky bridge which you can reach either from the",
          "The iconic Katarina Lift is gigantic metal construction that connects Slussen to the heights of S\u00f6dermalm. The lift was a shortcut between Slussen and Mosebacke Torg. The original lift was constructed in 1881, but the current structure dates from the rebuilding of the Slussen",
          "There\u2019s a lot of construction around S\u00f6dermalm and Gamla Stan so you have to meander and climb a bit to get to the old lock walkway with the view. The elevator itself is closed but you\u2019re not missing anything. Be sure to read the historic info plaques as you cross over the",
          "This has one of the most stunning views of Stockholm. It is free and you get some exercise getting there climbing the stairs.",
          "The elevator is currently closed as there is a great deal of construction at the base. Access the platform via the walkway. From Slussen Tbana stop, take the G\u00f6tgaten exit, turn left then left again onto H\u00f6kens Gata and walk one block to Mosebacke Torg, turn left and you\u2019ll see",
          "I visited here with my brother after we walked across the bridge and over to the Slussen area. The old lift towers over the other buildings and we found our way up the numerous flights of steps. It's fairly grimy around the area and as many other reviews already mention there",
          "Yes there\u2019s a lot of construction. It will probably be there for another few years according to locals. But it\u2019s a free view of the city. Free!! Either walk from Gamla Stan or get off at the Slussen stop. We only stayed for about 20 mins.",
          "Best way to see Stockholm from above. If you think the city is beautiful from the ground wait until you see it from here. OK, at the moment there are major constructions going on around the area, but the waterfront of the old town is still as beautiful - and the view over the",
          "As at many places in Stockholm, there is a quite large construction site here. You hardly can find where the walkway starts, and there is no entrance from the ground through the elevator. Advice: Do not even think about to get here at all.",
          "When we eventually found the entrance to the walkway, no signposts and with the amount of construction going on at the time it was very difficult to navigate, it was slightly disappointing. They have big plans for it so perhaps wait until those renovations are finished ..",
          "This is within easy walking distance from Gamla Stan, although bear in mind you have to climb lots of steps to get there as there is no elevator. Definitely worth it though as you benefit from a really good view over Stockholm. And all free of charge. You have to cross a walkway",
          "This one of the best known palces to visit in Stockholm. From the terrace you have wonderful view of the city. From the Gondol you have access to Restaurant Gondolen which is famous for its food.",
          "What you can see right now is mostly the vast reconstruction of Slussen down below, which will take a long time to finish. On top of that, the walkway feels like a prison yard. There are better viewpoints on S\u00f6dermalm.",

          "This whole area is under construction now. It has been closed to traffic and pedestrians, although the underpasses are still in use. The view from the top restaurant gives you a good idea of the chaos - but you also get nice views beyond that part of the city.",
          "This really is the best places for a beautiful view of Stockholm. Comes here during a beautiful sunset and you will be amazed",
          "I have been here twice recently. As others have mentioned the elevator is no longer in use. If you want an excellent view of the deconstruction of slussen this is the place. if you want a view of Stockholm - there are much better options. Take a bus to the ersta sjukhus stop",
          "Though the elevator is not in use any more, the view worth a visit. Famous deep fried Herring burger stall, Nystekt Stromming and Djurgarden ferry pier are very near.",
          "This is an old elevator that took people up to a terrass where you could see at least 300 degrees of town. Underneath there a cool restaurant called gondolen with a bar with great drinks and the same view! I strongly recommend visiting!",
          "We have visited this place in the begining of December when the lift wasn't working but we knew it so we simply used the stairs to get to the top. Because of huge constructions on the ground the view wasn't very great but it is not the problem of this atraction. So I can say -",
          "Just a 5 minute steep walk up to the top of the hill from Slussen, the viewing area is a great place to take in Stockholm. I love this city so to see it from a free vantage point like this was amazing. It is a great place for photographs. There are a few downsides at the",
          "This spot can be accessed from the island of S\u00f6der close to S\u00f6dra Teatern but to be honestly with you, there are in fact better views over Stockholm as f ex Katarinav\u00e4gen or Fj\u00e4llgatan... Both located on the island of S\u00f6dermalm too.",
          "No lift, so it could be a difficult climb for some, but its worth it to see the entire city. Great views of Gamla Stan.",
          "I was walking North to Old City when I saw people up on this platform. I walked to the building and took the elevator to the 11th floor. It is free and offers great views of the city. It wasn't too packed and I got some great shots right at sunset.",
          "Oooh, it was a nice view over Stockholm but i really dont like to be this high up. But so worth going there\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Go over when you're half way up shopping in Slussen. Love the cobbled walks to get there. The fencing really is camera friendly. Enjoyed the walk down the narrow stairs to the lower street and the open air pavillion at the theatre while we were there.",
          "It would have been better if the construction work is done as soon as possible, otherwise you see a huge area just below the elevator. Otherwise the view is spectacular. You can see Stadshuset, Riddarholmskyrkan, Klara kyrk, Storkyrkan and Tyska kyrka. If I remember correct, the",
          "Looking down on the ferries and over the water it is just a greta feeling, been there many times but every time it is amazing. easy to go there and stil in town, nice cafes around so just relax and take you time",
          "They're refurbishing the whole of Slussen, the transport terminus and traffic bottleneck - and it's not that easy to get to the old Katarina lift (now sadly no longer running) But you can either climb up all the steps to get to the walkway and the views - or walk up to Mosebacke",
          "We ascended a short time before sunset and were rewarded with marvellous panoramas over the Stockholm skyline. It was a clear evening, giving extensive views, lovely to see as twilight emerged and the sun set. Given that the city is essentially low-rise, these are undoubtedly",
          "This part of Stockholm is lovely when you start climbing up into the side of the hill, you get some of the best views of Stockholm. You can see gamla Stan, the theme park and much more. Plus this part of the old city is beautiful, old buildings washed in red and yellow and a",

          "Nice idea for bird view over Stockholm but real situation is it overlooks a train station, lot of repair and construction works around, spoiling the view. The lift starts working at 4 PM. .. at least today bypass is climbing up the stairs",
          "It's just a quick walk up some stairs and across a little bridge - it's a good place to get a good view of the city, especially down towards Djurgarden, but personally, I preferred the views you get from Monteliusvagen. Also not recommended to people who are scared of heights.",
          "It was a very nice ride when it was open, but that is 5 years ago. You can get the view from the top where the elevator used to stop by going from the \"other side\" from Katarina G\u00e5ngbro that starts next to \"S\u00f6dra Teatern\" on Mosebacke Torg. According to newspaper report 2014 the",
          "Katarina Hissen is very easy to find in Stockholm Slussen. It\u00b4s closed and might be opened in 2016, but don\u00b4t worry! Take walk on Katarinav\u00e4gen and on the top of this street I think you\u00b4ll see maybe the most beautiful part of whole town: Djurg\u00e5rden, Skansen, Gr\u00f6na Lund... Walk",

          "Actually Katarinahissen not so remarkable in itself, but in the history of Stockholm takes place and the view from here has always been great! Nowadays there is also a very good restaurant right next to the elevator ... When the elevator was new and was inaugurated, it was a",
          "You can visit a bridge with tower on top of the hotel building with a view on old part of Stockholm. If you stay near by, go there, it is FREE :)",
          "Nice place to see the city from above. You can take some nice pictures over old town, city hall or skepsholmen. In the summer air balloons make the pictures even more picturesque. they have good restaurant where you can try some swedish food or enjoy a drink.",
          "We have been here today after a recommendation and definitely worth it. You can see over old town (Gamla Stan) and other areas of Stockholm. Unfortunately the actual elevator was under the construction and the Cafe not open. Still great views and worth it, especially as it is",
          "A bit difficult to find the entrance, but when you come up tere- what a view! There is also one of the best restaurants - Gondolen.",
          "If you have bought a Stockholm card you can easily fit in a visit to this lift and save another 10 sek. It is open until 10pm during summer. At first I wondered what Katarina Hissen was - it's basically a lift which has been operating for over 100 years and provides unrivalled",
          "Look for this place until you find it! An amazing sight of Stockholm completely for free! It's even quite easy to get to. Simply BREATHTAKING",
          "Located right at Slussen, and across from the old town, this gives a great view of Gamla Stan and over across the water towards Grona Lund theme park. It's surprising that most people don't know about it, I visited it a few times when I lived there. You can enter in a building"

          "This is the type of tour where you don\u2019t ask questions(that is for free Stockholm walking tours)-this is the type where the guide is a very good actor who tells the stories (like a \u201cjack the ripper\u201d night tour in London)-he is a very good performer & story teller. He is native",

Calum was hilarious and super engaging. The key to having a good time is to go ready to a contributor to the experience \ud83d\ude09.",

          "Our guide was Lewis & he was brilliant! We arrived at our meeting point in Gamla Stan & a man dressed in all black with a trench coat, top hat, walking stick & case approached us in a serious manner. That didn\u2019t last long! Lewis broke the ice real quick with his witty remarks",
          "My son (9) and I enjoyed the Stockholm Ghost Walk on a wonderfully warm and sunny July evening. Our guide Lewis was witty, knowledgable and highly entertaining and we had a fabulous time for nearly two hours. We nearly didn\u2019t sign up as we weren\u2019t sure what to expect but so glad",

          "The guide was in character and told stories with a great amount of passion. The places he took us and the stories he told us, made us loose track of time. We would highly recommend you doing this tour if you like a bit of dark history.",
          "I really love Ghost Walks and have been to many in several cities around the globe. This one in Stocholm was the best ever!!! It was entertaining from start to end, and left you with a craving for more. We where on the english tour with Calem? (I can't recal the name, but",
          "We read quite a bit of good reviews but were still skeptical about a ghost tour in a sunny eve. It turned out to be perhaps the best tour we had ever. It's very different, not particularly strong in storytelling, in history background, or in city scenery, however, it was a bit",
          "I came across this your by accident and decided to drag my boyfriend along with me. He's not that into sightseeing or tours but came along anyway. Both of us had an excellent time with our tour guide Callum! He was witty and all around entertaining. Thanks for a great",
          "Luis showed up at 7 o\u2019clock displaying immediately a nice humor and dressed up for the occasion. Do not think that summer light will spoil the tour! Not only our guide was amazing, fun and witty, but the tour itself is truly cool, lots of stories await you and you get to walk",
          "I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone visiting Stockholm! Callum was an incredible tour guide who made sure everyone was having fun :) He is extremely knowledgeable and a wonderful entertainer! We didn't have a lot of time on this trip, so this was a great way to see",
          "We love a ghost tour and seek them out when we travel. They offer a bit of history with a bit of camp and a whole lot of fun. This tour met our expectations. Our guide was terrific, as were our fellow guests. The tour ended in a crypt, which was an added bonus!",
          "My wife and I, who are in our early 30s, really enjoyed the Stockholm Ghost Walk. I was skeptical, having been on other \"ghost tours\" which were just dumb and kitschy. We met at a large square in Gamla Stan (Old Town) and our guide, Callum, was dressed as a magician which was",
          "I\u2019d been on a ghost walk in Gamla Stan earlier. It was a totally different experience. The reason being that there are different companies doing similar things. This one is definitely worth the effort. Callum weaves wit, knowledge, history and humor into a 90 minute guided tour",
          "Callum was the best tour guide! Loved that he could become serious or funny on the flip of a dime! He had great knowledge about the area and overall was a lovely time. I think it would have been even more amazing if it was actually darker at 7, but sun is expected this time of",
          "A great way to experience the back alleys and streets of Gama Stan, the old town of Stockholm. Callum is a gifted storyteller and we really loved having him as a guide.",

          "A walking tour that talks about the murderous past of Sweden. It's not that scary and somewhat short on historical facts. Even though it's a bit cringy at times it's good fun for families. Callum is very charismatic!",

          "We did this ghost tour on our first night of the holiday. The tour was taken by Callum and he was great! I can not recommend this more. Doing this tour set the ground work for things we wanted then to do on our holiday. Callum is hilarious and engages the audience with his",
          "Callum was excellent in his presentation making it a highly entertaining and ghoulish walk. Highly recommend this as an introduction to gamla Stan.",
          "This is a must if you want to learn about the darker side of old Stockholm! We had Lewis and he was fantastic! Funny, scary, dramatic, mysterious...all you could wish for on a ghost walk really. Thanks Lewis!",
          "This tour was so much fun! Great stories of murders, traitors, and historical battles all in the area you\u2019re walking. Guide Callam was amazing and fun! Great times, great information and definitely some spooky areas seen!",
          "Wasn't sure how good it would be as it was still light when we began the tour but loved every minute. Lewis was entertaining, fun (especially when commenting to people attaching themselves to the tour). We learnt much and laughed a lot. A great touch to take us down under the",
          "You\u2019re in for a great time if you go on this walk, and especially if you get Collum as your guide. He\u2019s a Scot who really makes the sleazy history of Stockholm come alive. You\u2019ll learn a lot, and you\u2019ll be entertained at the same time! Two thumbs up!\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Great fun plus some interesting history, and stories of murder and ghostly goings on. Our only comment, was our guide tho excellent and held our attention, walked quite fast and most roads in Gamla Stan are cobbled and often uneven, so if you have any mobility issues it was a",

          "My wife and I were discussing whether to go on this tour since it really sounded too touristy. Anyways, even though we were very tired from exploring the Old Town we decided to give a chance to ghost walk, and it was definitely worth it. Tour guide Luis was very intelligent and",
          "Let me start by saying that Lewis was amazing! His acting was meticulous and we truly enjoyed having him as a guide. Perhaps the ending could be a bit more interesting, and it would be great to know what stories are true and what are legends. So perhaps you can work a bit on",
          "I really recommend this tour. My husband and I signed up for Monday 29 April and Lewis was fantastic. The history was really interesting, the atmosphere was great (especially as the church bells started chiming when we heard about the plague!) and the fire/food and visuals were",
          "Caleb was excellent! We were engrossed in the stories he told the entire time. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone wishing to learn about Stockholm\u2019s spooky past.",

          "The Ghost Walk was an astonishing and unforgettable experience and our guide Louis was not only very charming but smart and funny. We learned a lot about the history of Stockholm and felt sometimes a bit shocked, because you never know what is hiding in the dark \ud83d\ude0f",

          "We had the tour with our 7 years old daughter. It was funny, interesting with a nice historical overview of Stockholm history and at the end it was a little spooky (at least for our daughter). In general really nice experience. Louis or Lewis did a really good job. Recommended.",
          "Honestly one of the greatest things we did in Stockholm! The guide was absolutely hilarious and just set a great vibe the whole time. Not a single thing to complain about. Will definitely book his other events if I\u2019m back in Stockholm (I think he mentioned something he\u2019ll do",

          "I normally avoid group tours like the plague (which as you\u2019d imagine also featured in the walk) but it was our last evening in Stockholm and we felt like doing something different. Glad we did because this was a fun way to spend an evening and learn some local history. Callum",

          "I was really looking forward to this Ghost Walk having read previous reviews. Callum our guide was brilliant, very funny and an excellent story teller. Unfortunately there were more than 60 people on this tour/walk. To say it was a scrum would be an understatement. There were",

          "This was hilarious and informative, and our guide, Lewis, spared no-ones feelings! On a freezing winter night, it was the absolutely best choice of things to do, and he had quite a large group of approx 40 people. We discovered bits of the town we'd never noticed and the whole",
          "The tour was fantastic, albeit more of a history lesson with a twist than a ghost walk per se. I really recommend taking the tour before visiting the old city, as it offers you a different perspective of the area and it also familiarizes you with the place and its main",
          "Our tour guide Louis was just amazing. He was fun and knowledgeable and the fun little facts he presented were really nice. There are some surprises on the tour which I won't spoil but all I can say is: If they offer you something to eat: EAT IT. We had a little incident with",

          "No better way to spend 1900-2030 in Stockholm. I recommend even if you\u2019re only here for one night - spend it on the tour. Lewis, the tour guide, was awesome. Not only knowledgeable about Swedish history but extremely personable. His personality keeps you so engaged you don\u2019t",
          "The tour itself was amazing, the guide was a tad late but his storytelling was intruiging and humorous. Sometimes truly uneasy in a good way. Starts at 7:00 though, not at 6:00",

          "On Saturday 22nd December I did the Ghost/Historical Tour. We were lucky enough to have a full moon that night! Firstly, Lewis gets extra points for pronouncing my name correctly, which so rarely happens. But besides that he is by far the best guide I\u2019ve ever had on any tour.",

          "I did the halloween special and it wasn't clear that this would be a haunted house and not a historical tour. Whilst it was still fun and a good performance I don't really like haunted houses as it's often really obvious they're fake/playing off stereotypes and I wish it had",
          "Great 90 minutes. We had so much fun and our host, Callum, was so entertaining and funny. Highly recommend. Just don\u2019t book through viator, so much more expensive than just paying in cash (280SEK v 220 SEK)",
          "A tour lasting around 90 mins takes you around the back passages of Gamla Stan learning some tales of old, customs and history of the district. We wanted to find something we could enjoy as a family and this provided a novel way to find out more about old Stockholm. Our",

          "Good choice if you want to explore the old city center area and also want to know the relevance/history behind the area, buildings, tucked lil corners and places of interest. The guide is entertaining gives the background while making it interesting with little bit of a role",
          "The English tour with Callum was a fantastically entertaining and informative walk through Gamla Stan. The 90 min. tour was full of ghoulish and macabre facts on the seedier and lesser know characters and places that have colored Stockholm\u2019s rich and twisted history. Callum\u2019s",
          "We loved the ghost walk whilst visiting Stockholm. Louis was very informative and with a little black humour thrown in. Who knew Swedes took something horrific and turned it into a festive occasion. And I will never look at juniper the same way. Creepy moments... But no",

          "I discovered this type of walking tour last year and have done some in Edinburgh, Prague and now Stockholm. This one was a LOT of fun! Don't think of it as a ghost walk where you will get scared but more of an outdoor, walking, historic, live, one-man play! The tour takes you",
          "I'm always a bit skeptical about tours being too mundane and boring, but this particular one was well thought out with its humorous but educational execution. You can tell that our tour guide Luis/Louis/Lewis put in the time to make the tour enjoyable, rather then just reciting",

          "We made this tour 3 days ago and it was really really great! We saw streets and places in Gamla Stan that we otherwise may have missed, we learned quite a bit about the history of Stockholm and the guide Lewis was just hillarious. Thanks for a GREAT evening!!",
          "My husband and I really enjoyed our ghost tour. We had taken a bike tour that day and learned a LOT more about the underground and dark secrets of Stockholm. For those saying it wasn\u2019t \u201cscary\u201d clearly have not have been on ghost tours in other cities or must enjoy over the top",
          "Its not really a ghost walk. But offcourse you dont expect to find ghosts on a ghost walk. Its more informatory in nature. Some interesting history will be shared. The guide will try to be spooky, but will fail miserably. Shall we rename it as: The historical walk.",
          "This was one of the most enjoyable, interesting & entertaining walking tours we have ever taken! Lewis was outstanding with his story telling & theatrics. We learnt a lot about the history of Stockholm in a very memorable way. Would highly recommend this tour!",
          "The tour mentions some ghosts, but does not really have the scary appeal that it portrays. It is a historical walk and shares lots of information about Stockholm. We were disappointed in the tour because we were hoping for a bit more fright.",
          "It was a great tour in the old city. The guide, who speak fluent and easy-to-understand english (even for us, poor french) was at the same time scary, full of knowlegde and funny. He managed to make this tour really alive !!! (if you have the chance to be with the same guide,",
          "Our guide Callum was awesome. Dressed the part for a ghost tour and was very dramatic... Almost too dramatic at one point. He engaged the group at many turns and had us laughing, always a good time. Only negative thought was that he needed to slow down his speaking, as an older",
          "Wife found this as something to do for an evening. We had quite a few people in the tour, but I thought it still worked - his voice carried plenty. Lots of knowledge about the old city and its history, some of it dark. I dunno about the \u2018ghost\u2019 part, although there were some",
          "There were way too many people and the presenter was a self-absorbed, theatrical wannabe-type. People were leaving after about 30 minutes.",
          "One of the most interesting times i've had at stockholm. More funny than scary really because of the theatrics and storytelling. The guide is a professional theatre person... It's a must try if you're in gamla stan... :)",
          "We have completed many of these tours and this one did not disappoint. We thoroughly enjoyed the whole tour and our guide Louis was hilarious! Great great tour!!! Definetly reccommend for all ages!!!",
          "Our guide knew a lot about the area and had a heap of great stories (with even better delivery), but there were not as many 'ghosts stories' as I expected. The Scandinavian summer nights also meant that there was no darkness to add to the mystique! Nevertheless, it was a good",
          "in my opinion it was a bit low content & over priced. Especially in comparison to free walking tours. Although the speech of the tour guide was a bit fast at some moments, so sometimes it was a bit difficult to understand.",

          "I went on this ghost walk last night (7/5/2018) led by our guide Tom. Although he had a large crowd, he still managed to interact with everyone at some point or another. Very funny and knew the history very well. A very enjoyable tour!",
          "Alice met the mad hatter, we met the ghost hatter, and we saw hell. All in all, a great visit. Saw and heard the dark secrets of Stockholms past, and they were not even nightclubs, a story of blood, books and cigars of happiness. And today families take their children to these",
          "What a fun way to get to see some local landmarks that you wouldn't normally find on your own. It was also a fun way to learn about some of the dark history of the town. Luis was an excellent and entertaining guide. He said everything was 100% true but I haven't fact checked all",
          "Don\u2019t expect scary scary, this was definitely more of a factual tour! However was really interesting and very very funny! Such amazing charisma from the host, and really interactive! The only small downside was that we had done a walking tour of Gamla Stan earlier in the day and",

          "Louis is a fantastic tour guide and he is quite entertaining. I took the tour more of a history lesson than wanting to see ghosts since I am not superstitious at all. Anyway, we went into the basement and the bone room and I took pictures and they turned out pretty well.",
          "This is a mildly entertaining walk which is, in essence, a one-person show centered around the theme of death, murder and disease. The cobblestone setting adds to the ambiance although the long days counteract that. You won't learn much of value here because it is difficult to",
          "Highly recommended Tour round the Old Town in Stockholm which is great fun for all ages, we made the trip with friends and family and all throughly enjoyed the night. Our guide was called Josefine and she really knew how to captivate an audience - our youngest was hanging on",

          "We (4 of us) decided to give this a try after seeing a flyer taped to a window. Not sure if it was a reputable operation or not but we took a chance and was pleasantly surprised (in a good way!). A little history, a little scariness, a lot of fun! Our guide was articulate and",
          "Some good fun on a very cold night! We were taken around Old Town and learned a lot about historical events that took place at each location. There were some ghostly things brought up, but it\u2019s mostly about historical events which I love. The guide was VERY entertaining & did",

          "Callum gave a fascinating and informative tour of the dark past in Gamla Stan, the 13th century 'old town' of Stockholm. I highly recommend it, and suggest you do it early in your stay in order to explore the history further. And don't forget to rub the head of the smallest",
          "This was a great little tour which makes the most of the beautiful but winding streets of Gamla Stan. Callum was an excellent guide with just the right mix of macabre and whimsy. Bring comfortable footwear as the cobblestones and steep gradients took their toll on some members",

          "It was fine. Some decent history, and our guide was decent if a touch overblown. Admittedly, it probaby didn't help the atmosphere of the walk that it was still bright out during the tour given the time of year. There was a touch about ghosts, but, truly, it was more about gory",
          "We spent the first sixty minutes waiting for the tour to get better..... and the next thirty minutes willing it to end. What a dull tour... a wander around the streets of the old town, hearing contrived stories that somehow tenuously link to 'ghosts', and at the same time",

          "We went to this event with an open mind and did not know what to expect. It was a great walk with an English guide with excellent local knowledge. We weren't spooked in any way but we finished the trip with a bit more bizarre knowledge regarding the history of Stockholm. Well worth 220 sek and 90 minutes of your time.",

        "wiki": "Moderna Museet (\"the Museum of Modern Art\"), Stockholm, Sweden, is a state museum for modern and contemporary art located on the island of Skeppsholmen in central Stockholm, opened in 1958. In 2009, the museum opened a new branch in Malm\u00f6 in the south of Sweden, Moderna Museet Malm\u00f6.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was opened in 9 May 1958. Its first manager was Pontus Hult\u00e9n. In May 2010, Daniel Birnbaum became the new director of the museum. He stayed until the end of 2018; Ann-Sofi Noring was named acting director until the formal appointment of Gitte \u00d8rskou as the new director by Amanda Lind. \u00d8rskou began in her new functions in September 2019.In 2009, the museum opened a new branch in the building previously known as Rooseum in Malm\u00f6.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe museum houses Swedish and international modern and contemporary art, including pieces by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dal\u00ed and a model of the Tatlin's Tower. The museum's collection includes also key works by artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Niki de Saint Phalle, Henri Matisse and Robert Rauschenberg, as well as ongoing acquisitions by contemporary artists.On 8 November 1993, six works by Picasso and two by Georges Braque totaling more than \u00a340m were stolen from the museum in a renowned coup where the burglars came in through the roof by night, copying the method from the 1955 French film Rififi (French: Du rififi chez les hommes). All six of the Picasso paintings and one of the Braque paintings have been recovered.Visiting the permanent collection is free of charge, but some of the temporary exhibitions has entrance fees.\n\n\n=== Pontus Hult\u00e9n Collection ===\nIn 2005, former museum director Pontus Hult\u00e9n bequeathed over 700 works of art to Moderna Museet, along with his archive and library. A few works of the collection are on display with the museum's permanent collection; many others are exhibited in the purpose-built Pontus Hult\u00e9n Study Gallery.\n\n\n=== Sculpture park ===\nThe museum has a sculpture park on the island with works by sculptors of diverse nationalities.\nThe Four Elements, Alexander Calder, 1961\nLe Paradis fantastique, Jean Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle, 1966\nD\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe, Pablo Picasso and Carl Nesjar, 1962\nMonumentalfigur, Christian Berg, 1927\nMonument \u00f6ver den sista cigaretten, Erik Dietman, 1975\nLeninmonument 13 april 1917, Bj\u00f6rn L\u00f6vin, 1977\nMannen p\u00e5 templet, Bj\u00f8rn N\u00f8rgaard, 1980\nSvart svensk granit, Ulrich R\u00fcckriem, 1981\nPavilion Sculpture II, Dan Graham, 1984\nLouisa, Thomas M.

The Pontus Hult\u00e9n Study Gallery was designed by Renzo Piano.\n\n\n== Activity ==\nThe museum organizes and is a venue for temporary contemporary art exhibitions throughout the year. In 2005, the museum hosted the onedotzero festival bringing a new younger audience to the museum with screenings, installations, talks and live VJ audio-visual events.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Stockholm\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \u2013 in Swedish and English",

          "Moderna Museet is on little island Skeppsholmen in Stockholm. Beautiful views, great art gallery. Ideal tip for spending afternoon in Stockholm. We strolled through the gallery, than stopped for coffee, and walked around the little island to take photos of Stockholm.",
          "Located on lovely Skeppsholmen Island, a tour onto itself, the giant Calder outside just bekons for you to come inside. Like any well-stocked museum, it will wear out your eyey long before you have seen it all. Highly recommended!",
          "Free entry. A short walk from the old town, and very close to the National Museum. Lots to experience. Only a few pieces of art caught my attention.",
          "This is a very interesting museum, rich in exhibitions. I'm not wise when it comes to art and still got to enjoy. Took an electrical scooter to get there.",
          "I was looking forward to my visit to Moderna but somebody decided to reshuffle everything into an assemblage of nothingness. The Matisse room, the surrealist, and the Russian avant-garde rooms disappeared. The few best-known works are hidden in small places and decontextualized.",
          "On a late November Saturday,I went to this wonderful museum of Modern and Contemporary Art.I spent 6 very worthwhile hours at this art museum.I saw splendid paintings by these painters;Pablo Picasso(\"Head of Woman\"),Henri Matisse(\"Moroccan Landscape\"),Wassily Kandinsky(\"Green",
          "While there is obviously a path of art appreciation that involves seeing the world's most famous paintings, it does not stand to reason that every museum should have a Picasso. Instead their time is probably better spent exploring specific themes within art and putting on",
          "This was a let-down: I was led to believe from travel shows & gudiebooks that it was just crammed full of Picassos, Matisses & Pollocks. There maybe was one painting by each being displayed & they were far from their best. The newer artists' work is not to my taste at all. At",
          "Amazing palce, which we highly recommend. An installation with a liquid clay is unbelievable, until you see it with own eyes!",
          "We had read about this museum and was impressed by the art and layout. The restaurant with spectacular views had a great selection off food Aldo which for Sweden prices was very reasonable.",
          "The modern museum is located on an island in central Stockholm. Nice area to visit. The museum itself is modern but not outstanding if you are a modern art freak. There are plenty more interesting museums to see for an ordinary museumvisitor with limited time.",
          "I love modern and contemporary art, so I really liked this free and uncrowded museum. It's not very big (or at least the parts that were open when I was there weren't) - even a big art fan need only set a couple of hours aside for the interior, and about half an hour for the",
          "Very nice, not too big place with exquisitely curated permanent collection. There is Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Kandinsky, Mallevich, Marina Abramovich's \"Spirit House\", the great Croatian artist Mladen Stilinovic and his \"Exploitation of the Dead\" wall installation, along with",
          "The museum intriduces you into modern Swedish art as well to Swedish architecture. The exhibitions of Atsuko Tanaka and Carl Fredrick Reutersward are highly recommended.",
          "The permanent exhibition is not that interesting. Maybe wait for a more spectecular temporary one. The building is nice to walk by, inside no special architecture.",
          "We are not into modern art as much as some of our friends. We had a nice visit but it's not that big of an art museum so unless you love modern art and want to spend time on every peace you will get through the museum fairly fast. We were surprised to see some very important",
          "Take a boat, walk across a bridge, explore the island, take a morning, have lunch - good art on display - Matisse, Pop, film, photography, design - and for us in the morning not packed with the now normal tourist crush.",

          "I'm a fan of modern art and went to this museum expecting a little more. The rotating showcase was expensive and was a little more experimental than I was looking for, so I checked out the permanent collection. The permanent collection had a few interesting pieces but for the",
          "Delightful but not a great museum. Well laid out. Temporary exhibits were second or third rate and expensive. Very friendly & helpful staff. Have a drink on the deck.",
          "The collection is not very big, it has some very good pieces from the period until the 1940s, the contemporary part is not so good. It's free, and there is the better Architecture museum in the same building.",
          "Great place to view modern art (for free) if you want to explore a different genre of art. The cafe is wonderful with excellent food selections and a deck with views of the city.",

          "I have visited this museum again after 14 years and I still like it. It has impressive avant-garde collection (Cubism, Surrealism etc.) but it\u2019s fresh and interesting for giving voice to contemporary artists (no matter if you like it or not). Great experience, don\u2019t miss it!",
          "I wouldn\u2019t call myself someone that fully understands art. If I see something and I like it, I know it\u2019s good (at least for me). It was a nice walk to the museum, I had nice lunch in their restaurant and I\u2019ve seen some interesting art. But, if you are not a big enthusiast of",
          "After I visited this museum several years ago and was fascinated back then, I decided to give it another visit during my latest stay in Stockholm. Unfortunately I was rather disappointed by the exhibition this time. It seems to be a blend of uninspired pieces of ''art''. There",
          "Another great museum to visit in Stockholm, especially if you have more than 2 days in the city. It's free and fun to get to, whichever way you come here (by boat or on foot). The collection is fairly modest but certainly enough to keep your attention for 2 hours at least.",
          "There are some great works here but it is rather small. We couldn't spend more than 2 hours. It was a pretty good two hours though.",
          "We came for the gingerbread house exhibition but spent time looking around the rest of the museum. I\u2019m not usually a lover of museums but loved the spending time here. The highlight, of course, though was the gingerbread houses which were absolutely amazing.",
          "If you're an artist and frequent art museums you'll like it; it will also be okay if you don't have the time and have to miss it. It was nice to see the Rauschenburg combine, but if you can't fit it into your schedule you shouldn't feel bad about missing out on this museum.",
          "a nice stroll to get here and a great visit inside. the architecture is already worth it, and in the permanent exhibition (free entrance) there are some really interesting pieces. definitely worth it.",
          "This museum has a really impressive collection of modern art (Picasso, Matisse, etc)! Just a fun place to wander around and get some culture in between overeating at the spectacular restaurants in Stockholm.",
          "The moderna museet offers free tours through the gallery and we were pleasantly surprised to get one of the most interesting tours of our lives. Our guide was sweet, funny and smart and managed to make every piece he talked about come to life! I still highly recommend it to",
          "We visited this with a friend who enjoyed it. I'm personally a fan of classical sculpture, so this art was largely not to my taste. It was free so I lost nothing by going. If you are in to thought-provoking, in-your-face modern art, then you'll enjoy this museum. If you like",
          "This museum is beautiful and the building that the art is in is a really incredible structure. The art is incredibly emotional and makes you think about the thoughts and feelings behind it.",
          "The moderna museet is in a wonderful building that suits the modern exhibits that await inside. A range of exhibits from multiple artists with some permanent art is inside and around the museum. There are also some free exhibits which is great.",
          "Nothing special with the permanent collection which includes a lot of the same art that you can see in other museums of modern in Europe or the US. The cafeteria restaurant is an attraction in itself, with a spectacular view over Stockholm. Well worth a lunch.",
          "Why visit the Moderna Museet? Firstly it free. Secondly it in a beautiful part of the city with great views back to the old town that you might not visit you certainly would not go there by accident. Last but not least it will challenge you. The rooms have some pretty hard",
          "Free locker storage. Free public bathrooms. Very modern art. Many of the exhibits are free. The paid sections are clearly marked with a guard in front and signs. Worth the visit. Some art was a little too \u201cmodern\u201d for my taste. Viewer discretion advised for those with young",
          "So much to see and plan your afternoon to take in all the site and sounds of this museum. They also have a downloadable audio guide which makes the walking about a whole easier. Great snack shop to recharge your batteries when you are done.",
          "exhibitions were so boring and outdated on a world scale. the worst modern art gallery i have ever been to with pedestrian, uninteresting exhibits. waste of time but at least it was free so i wasn\u2019t paying for misery.",
          "Full of unexpected experiences, the Modern Museet houses an exceptional collection. Beautifully and thoughtfully presented, the artwork and its well articulated rooms work hand-in-hand to create a superior experience. Some of the exhibits are mind-blowing. Experimental and",
          "We enjoyed the museaum and the Saturday we visited it was free. The art is unusual and avant guard for USA folks, but quite good. We took the ferry here from the Vasa Museum. I recommend the city public bus pass with a discount for seniors.",
          "Visited this Museum of Modern Art this afternoon. Very impressive exhibition. I am a Fellow of the Royal Society of the Arts and have a deep seated respect for the arts. At times I may not appreciate what I see, but my anticipation that others will appreciate is sufficient for",
          "They have extremely poor collection with crappy arts, this museum is indeed the perfect exemple of degenerated art and people who stay in their microcosme of self centered megalomaniacs",
          "I admit I was originally only looking for a toilet while I was walking around the island, so I tried my luck at this museum. After that, however, I walked around the building and realized that the permanent exhibits are free to enter. So I entered them, and boy, am I glad I did.",
          "The Modern Art museum was one of my favorite things that I visited while in Stockholm. Admissiom to the main exhibits is free, but you can buy a ticket to visit the special visiting exhibits. Small enough museum that it\u2019s not overwhelming, and it\u2019s also connected to the",
          "Moderna Museet is located at a beautiful quiet part of the city, but still near the city center. Lovely open spaces. Also recommending the restaurant with a sea view.",
          "It's small enough not to become boring, but still has an interesting selection of art. A mix of different styles and artists, from soviet propaganda posters to a dali painting, in the permanent collection. The exhibitions vary, but most are very interesting. It's also free to",
          "The museum is small, but well curated. The special exhibitions are a little overpriced. The best part of the museum is the caf\u00e9 that offers great views and good food and drinks. It's a nice place to spend a relaxing afternoon with friends and family!",
          "We went there to see Gilbert and George . I was different and interesting but We do not need to see them again.",
          "The Moderna Museet, coupled with adjacent ArkDes, is a small museum but worth visiting. The regular collection is free to see, but I went to both of the special collections at MM and ArkDes and was happy with that decision. Nice views of the city from that island, as well.",
          "A reliable museum with high standards all around with great variety. Went to see the colourful pair of Gilbert & George and it was well worth the time.",
          "Permanent collection is free so definitely worth going! It's currently under rennovation (March 2019) so they had a limited collection out but still a good number of pieces/rooms open from some notable modern artists (Judy Chicago, Barbara Krueger, Cindy Sherman, etc.). Good",
          "Some exciting pieces to experience! It is free to enter, which is also a plus. There is also an excellent bar/cafe on the back of the building with a gorgeous view of the city.",
          "A very inspiring museum full of great art by world renowned artists.Spend at least a few hours here and visit the cafe too.",
          "Very interesting experience. Apart from the permanent collection, the time of my visit I was lucky to see the \"ANDY WARHOL 1968\" and the \"GILBERT & GEORGE THE GREAT EXHIBITION\"",
          "Nice current display of video, pictures, architecture and other. Currently Warhol and Gilbert&George as special exhibitions. Take 1-2 h depending on how much you are interested in the exhibition.",

          "During a very cold, snowy (but beautiful) walk we visited Moderna Museet to warm up. We had a lovely coffee and cake and then enjoyed the exhibits. As it was a January Saturday, it wasn\u2019t overrun with tourists. The free lockers were a great help and then we had a lovely wander",
          "Good and changing permanant collection in an interesting part of town and special exhibition was interesting if small",
          "Very good for a museum with a free entrance, but not a must in Stockholm. It's not quite interesting as other museums which you can find in the city.",
          "If you are in Stockhom at Christmas time, make sure that you visit the exhibition of ginger houses in the Museum. It is free and the creations are beyond amazing!",
          "The modern museum features many famous works and breathtaking exhibits. An incredible museum to visit in Sweden",
          "We had a great visit with the family. There were two very different temporary special exhibitions running as well as the permanent displays. It is a spacious building with an interesting range of modern pieces, though relatively few real blockbusters compared with many other",
          "We visited the museum in december. Nice vibe at the place. The warhol-exhibiton was disappointing. Nice works in permanent collection.",

          "The free art exhibitions are good and we were fortunate enough to visit in December when there is a Peperkaken (spiced biscuits)competition and exhibition taking place. It was a bonus being able to vote ,too!The architectural exhibition was very interesting and if you wished to",
          "Worth paying a visit when in Stockholm, some great pieces of Modern Art. Even better in December with the exhibition of peppar kakor (ginger bread) constructions.",
          "And again, it is free for everyone! Well the permanent exposition is, you have to pay for the temporary exhibit (was about the visit or Andy Warhol when i visites). I saw painting from Picasso, matisse, dali and much more. The display is interesting, you have lots of place.",
          "Its a beautiful (also free) place to go if you like art and painting. I am not a big fan of contemporary art but still I enjoyed the exhibitions. It opens at 11 in the Sunday which stupid. But I loved spending the noon there.",
          "We enjoyed visiting the Moderna Museet while visiting Stockholm. Neither of us are art experts but enjoyed wandering through the rooms checking out art from different periods and reading about the inspiration behind certain pieces. We checked out the Warhol exhibition - I",
          "Stockholm must be the worst city in the world to visit museums, unless you belong to the extreme left or is a hardcore feminist. I used to like this museum but its just annoying to all the time being told what political opinion you should have in this country, especially since",
          "The average Earthling can't grasp and hates modern art...but I love it! Forget the classical paintings. Forget the traditional sculptures. Forget everything you know and define as \"art\". Go in here with a clean slate, open up your mind. Is it interesting? Is it thought",
          "Worth an hours visit if you have the time. But if you don\u2019t, don\u2019t bother. The Modigliani and the Dali are worth seeing, their Picasso is a joke. It is free and a nice view if you have spare time. The walk there was nicer than the museum itself. The bridge, the island and",

          "I was not sure what to expect but this medium size modern art museum has great representations from many artists in the modern era laid out beautifully. Very much worth a visit if you're in Stockholm.",
          "Great location, nice to find some interesting modern art pieces, nice museum but it could do with more works.",
          "We went to the Andy Warhol exhibition with very high expectations. Unfortunately they didn\u2019t come true. Very small, not much paintings all about the Brillo box. Don\u2019t go there.",
          "Couldn't take it all in, Picasso, Niki de Saint Phalle, their regular exhibits were great and the special show with NATHALIE DJURBERG & HANS BERG took hours to go through including VR experience.",
          "We were surprised there was no admission fee to this museum, and more so when we saw the collection. Many great modern and contemporary artists on display. There's a section dedicated to architecture that's worth a visit - don't miss the scale models of Stockholm and Gothenburg.",
          "I am a big fan of contemporary / modern art and have been to numerous museums that offer this style of art. For me, this museum was just ok. There were some nice pieces, but the collection itself didn't seem large, unless I was missing something. The building itself was nothing",
          "We loved the amazing Nikki de Sainte phalle outdoor sculptures - so beautiful and unexpected. The other part of the museum we weren't expecting (hadn't done our research...) was the wonderful architectural sections. We spent ahead looking at the fantastic exhibition showing",

          "there are pictures by Picasso, Modigliani, Mattise, and many other older masters among some rather wacky stuff which was lost on me but the gallery itself is lovely as is the quiet little island on which it is situated, and a visit next door to the Architecture and Design Museum",
          "Worth a visit. Excellent temporary exhibition when we visited. Plenty to see and a good restaurant and cafe! The architect museum is also on the same site and worth a look.",
          "The museum is located on a beautiful island of Stockholm, very peaceful and clean. We took the the boat to the island and loved the surroundings. Free admission, extra for the special exhibition. The work of many artists are shown, such as Salvador Dali, Matisse, Picasso, Miro",

          "Boring and a waste of my time. Im into art, but not this kind. If you have limited time in Stockholm, give this a miss",
          "Entry to the museum is free. They have a good sized collection so you can spend a couple of hours here. It was pleasing to see a collection that makes a deliberate attempt to ensure women artists are not obliterated from the history of art (as other art galleries can do). Works",
          "We recently visited and were very pleasantly surprised to find that this museum does not charge an entry fee. We enjoyed the range of art on display - some of the more contemporary pieces are definitely not to my taste but I like to see them, and they have a great range of early",

          "Just a short walk from the heart of Stockholm across a bridge with spectacular views of the city and port. The museum is free except for a small charge to see the current temporary exhibits. They have an awesome, huge Salvador Dali painting that alone is worth the visit. Plus",
          "Really interesting displays of art starting in garden and surrounds . Some really special art by very famous artists and then modern art ! Really good and also exhibits for particular dates etc . Worth a visit if you like art",

          "Apart from the fabulous art collection I thought the shop was very good. I also enjoyed watching some young mothers and small children interacting with one of the installations. How lovely to be able to introduce one's children to art so early.",
          "If you love modern art, it is a nice museum to visit. It's not very big, 2 hours should be enough. It takes a while to get there as you need to walk for over 10min after getting off the bus (we took bus no. 57) before the bridge.",
          "If you like Modern Art, then don't miss this place. Extremely interesting temporary exhibitions with a good permanent collection to enjoy as well.",

          "Took the ferry from Djurgarden to Slussen, a very short ride, then decided to visit this museum. Entrance is free. Only explored the permanent exhibition on the group floor, it didn't take long to finish looking around. Surprisingly there are quite a lot of famous artists'",
          "A little out of the way from other major museums on its own island, but still relatively easy to get to, the Moderna Museet doesn't look like much from the outside but offers a spectacular collection of modern art in a well presented setting. We enjoyed a spectacular show of",

          "We strolled in here as we were eandering around Skeppsholmen. There are some interactive (music) pieces outside & some slightly disturbing, mechanical pieces abusing what looks like disfigured anthropomorphic shapes. Inside the museum is more structured and appeasing, however",

          "We decided to go here because of the free entrance to the museum. We later learned that only the first floor was free for everyone, but it was still worth walking around that floor. We had fun and got to take some great photos. Worth going there if you are looking for",

          "Great free museum, also has some changing collections where you need to buy a ticket. The permanent exhibition has many great pieces, if you're at all interested in modern art it's worth seeing. Perhaps even if you aren't... The restaurant has a wonderful view. I think kids will",
          "We loved the Moderna Museet. Out of one and half days in Stockholm, we visited it twice. Just to be able to see the entire collection. If you love the modern art don't miss it and bring your smart phone to be able to hear the audio guide. Such a pleasure.",
          "I love modern art especially for the humour in it. This museum had not much that was inspiring or amusing.",
          "Getting there by ferry boat to one of the least touristy islands is a great start. Being free is another. Whilst it is not too hot on video, installation art or sculpture, the permanent exhibition is well worth a visit. Moreover, it is not just geared towards Scandinavia.",
          "A must even if you are not too much into art. Everybody will find something for oneself there. There are guided tours, so join them and you will hear interesting stories about several artworks.",
          "This museum is free and quick to go through. There are some good pieces in the collection, and it's laid out semi-logically.",
          "The permanent exposition is for free and shows amazing painters such as Dali, Miro, Picasso or Munch. Coffee and especially hot chocolate were amazing. Plus, there is a restaurant with an amazing view of Stockholm. Between 11 and 17 for 120sek there is a buffet and the food was",
          "I believe this is one of the best museums for modern and contemporary art that I had the chance to visit so far. Both the permanent collection and the temporary exibitions are very well displayed and can engage all kinds of audience.",
          "My husband and I came here on a beautiful day to have brunch and see the free exhibits. The food wasn't the best we had in Stockholm, but the view was worth it. The modern exhibits might not be for everyone, but we very much enjoyed a leisure walk around after eating.",
          "It is impossible not to be impressed by this incredible exhibition. To be so close to the work of some incredible artists is awesome. And to top it all, its free!",
          "Stumbled upon this museum after finishing the Free Walking Tour Stockholm. This place is not huge, so it is easy to walk from room to room - interesting pieces and installation on display.",
          "great museum! not too big so perfect place to go. this is good modern museum and a must see while in stockholm",
          "Even if you're not that into art you should go check the collection in here. There are stuffs you might not like but you'll surely find something incredible.",
          "Museum with some great pieces from Picasso, Matisse, Dali, etc. Compact museum with beautiful views. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit. Pleasantly surprised that permanent collection was free.",
          "Your usual modern art museum. Special shows looked interesting, though the collection is already plenty to see and explore for free admission. Nice rainy afternoon activity with the family. Great variety from Picasso to Duchamp and Hatoum... alongside some local talents.",
          "Mainly the worst of modern art, if we except one painting from daily, the rest is really horrible... hanging a pink sheet on the wall, put a ventilo and call it art? almost everything is in that vein... if beaubourg in paris is great, this one is really a joke...",
          "Enjoyed this art collection a ton. Even on a Saturday in August the rooms were not crowded. From Picasso to present, an interesting, informative (in a non-boring way) and well curated collection. Beautiful bright building overlooking the water with many windows/views. Children",
          "This is one of our favorite museums and we go there all year round. The restaurant is great overviewing the city and water.",
          "The museum houses many interesting modern works, and I also thought the temporary exhibit was worth visiting. The collection is really large, so make sure you have enough time to see everything you want, or try to make a game plan before you get there. There is an architecture",
          "A bit off the beaten path on a small island across the water from Gamla Stans.It is a modern museum and FREE, but the collection is an excellent composite of modern art movements from Picasso and Braque to Warhol and the minimalists. The curators descriptions are clear and",
          "Free to see the permanent exhibits but worth paying particularly if with younger people who get in free. Too much to see in many ways. Allow a couple of hours at least. Restaurant good if not cheap. Have a look around the island and consider using the ferry service.",
          "surprisingly extensive collection of art moving through the 20th century with many famous names. and temporary show i saw was a swedish illustrator who had quite a huge body of work over a long career. premises are nice on an island and cafe is great.",
          "This was a must see and it didn't disappoint. Only the temporary exhibits were ticketed. It had a wonderful collection and an amazing and large painting but Dali. There is also an outdoor cafe that is a secret garden and had some great salads. Well worth a visit.",
          "A must visit, I would highly recommend. We went as a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 children, aged 13 and 10 and they both enjoyed it. I find it interesting and it is definitely worth a visit, and it stirred up mind-boggling conversations with our children, especially on the",
          "Definitely worth a visit, a little off the beaten track but obviously popular given the large number of people (though not congested). A decent sized permanent exhibition of contemporary art, much of which I liked and others of which I didn't understand. There is an interactive",
          "Lovely walk here from Gamla Stan, as we discovered whilst having some free time to ourselves. It was the outdoor sculptures that captured our interest and from there we ventured onwards. Art is art and entirely up to personal perception and taste. Free and gives you an insight",
          "Quite an interesting collection and a pleasant walk getting to it. The permanent collection is also free, which is very civilised.",
          "Modern and contemporary art is not very accessible through its nature - it seems it has to be this way to qualify. We visited only the free exhibitions and noticed some interesting and creative installations, but some dod not really seem worthy of a place in a museum.",
          "As with most contemporary art, some of it clicked with me and some of it didn't. That's OK. And hey, it's free! I found the museum layout a little confusing at times, but I'm glad we saw it. There's a tapestry in one of the far galleries that is pretty amazing.",
          "One of the best things is that admission to the collection is free (though you have to pay to visit exhibitions). Finding \"Free admission\" in a city as expensive as Stockholm is always worth looking into.",
          "Plenty to see for free although entry fee for special exhibitions. As you would expect, modern art and exhibits only.",
          "First of all, it's free--anytime. If you listen to Lonely Planet it's only free during certain times. It's actually free always. And it's manageable. You can't do the Louvre justice unless you spend three days there. This one just had a few very well arranged rooms, which is",
          "For the vulgar eye and not necessarily modern art-oriented person, this has been a great surprise! The museum host a beautiful and very well balanced collection of modernism, highlighted by key artists's work and a unique 1850 photo collection.",
          "Most of the museum is free aside from two of the main exhibitions. I found the collection to be slightly disorganised at the start but overall definitely one for the modern art lovers. I particularly enjoyed the photographic section, and the coffee shop is also reasonably priced",
          "This was excellent museum of modern art and we were surprised that it was free of charge with a wide collection of different kind of art. Don't miss this one.",
          "One of our planned events was cancelled so we walked to this gallery with no expectations and were pleasantly surprised. We shared the space with groups of school children who added to our enjoyment. I particularly liked the soviet era art and eclectic arrangements.",
          "Don't miss this museum. It is free and the collection is surprising and beautiful. The most impressive piece in the collection is the exhibition of models by Olafur Eliason. Go and for yourselfe that creativity is endless.",
          "Most exhibits are free to view, only one visiting exhibit had a fee. Thoroughly enjoyed the artworks on exhibit. Only took about 60-90 minutes to see everything.",
          "I'm a little bit disappointed by the collection, I expected more. There are several interesting pieces by Miro and Dali, plus there was a great installation on the first floor depicting the connection between science and art. Other than that - nothing to be amazed of or",
          "As many museums of contemporary and modern art this one too is a bit too much for me. Very pretentious and unclear in terms of expressing author's ideas. Otherwise it is well organized and, I am sure, it will be interesting for people of art. I enjoyed the most the movie",
          "A very nice museum of modern art - lots of Matisse, Warhol, a Dali, and a Picasso. The museum featured substantial art by female artists - painters and photographers. Excellent 90 minute interlude - enjoyed it.",
          "This is an excellent museum for anybody remotely interested in Modern Art. Includes works from Warhol, Dali, Matisse, Cindy Sherman and others dating from the beginning of the 20th century to the present day. I especially liked the wall full of Russian revolution posters which",
          "Though not a huge fan of modern and contemporary works, I have come to appreciate them more and more throughout the years and now always visit museums that feature this genre during my travels. I especially liked this small museum, which is located on a peaceful island in",
          "I am not a modern art lover but am willing to take it all in (see my reviews of the Instanbul Modern Art Museum and Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice, which I also visited on this trip). The beauty or otherwise of modern art, in my view, is certainly in the eye of the beholder.",
          "A must-see on a Stockholm visit. The art is interesting; the architecture is really cool. And it is free -- what a benefit!",
          "A modern and well organized museum, a great art place with roof restaurant with nice food, free entrance , we expected more paintings",
          "Wonderful free museum with some special rooms on surrealism. Deceptively large as one room lead to another as it goes through eras of the 20th century. Perhaps the best item is a Dali on William Tell. Audio is available for rental or download their app and listen for free.",
          "This is a lovely place to visit....it's a great space with excellent light...there are some very helpful guides that are young and energetic.....not the best quality collection but still worthwhile....there is a nice cafe and restaurant..there are some large colourful sculptures",
          "Love Moderna, the food is so so but all the art and the building is amazing. You can also buy art the shop!",
          "An interesting museum, among the many around town (but not my type of art unfortunately). There are different exhibitions, and 2 main floors. Good merchandise. Staff is supper friendly and efficient. The cafe is basic, but the coffee is excellent (some pastries are available).",
          "Walking towards the museum, the art already begins with massive sculptures welcoming you as you get closer. Then the exhibitions are definitely a place for art lovers. The book shop is worth a look too.",
          "I was very surprised t find such a rich and compelling art museum with a free entrance. Interesting selection of books too.",
          "A 15 minute walk from downtown to a small island brings you to a spacious large collection of themed rooms. Large iconic art from Warhol, Man Ray, notable Swedish artists are mixed with sculpture and photography, notably Cindy Sherman and Jeff Wall. Simple, helpful English",
          "Even in the rain the outdoor exhibits attract a lot of attention. Several preschool, primary and secondary groups were wandering around these comical exhibits. They are colourful, entertaining and full of fun, even on a wet day in Stockholm.",
          "There were a number of interesting and contrasting exhibits during my visit. A mixture of international artists but also local work and topics. It was interesting to learn information which challenged my (pre-conceptions?) of Sweden such as their housing siutation. The",
          "The location of the Modern Museum in Stockholm is on Skeppsholmen island, an easy walk from the centre of the city, even during winter. The museum has an excellent range of modern pieces and it is accessible and easy to enjoy. There are lovely little spaces to sit and relax if",
          "Lots of large outdoor art to take cute photos with and walk around. Lovely area for a picnic and to take a relaxing time",
          "The location in Stockholm at Skeppsholmen the island where the museum is at is beautiful. The Museum itself is very nice with interesting and ambitious shows. Museum also contains a nice restaurant and a terrace. I highly recommend this for travellers interested in art or",
          "It is in a very nice island so we enjoyed the walk to the museum and back more than the museum itself, but it is of course a matter of taste",
          "Yet an other of these Stockholm free museum for its permanent show. It also has 2 nice coffee/restaurants with a view",
          "Entrance is free and the rooms are nicely laid out with lots of space. Saw some interesting pieces from some great artists.",
          "I enjoyed a long visit to the museum and could easily go again. The collection of modern art of the museum is impressive and worth a visit. The shop is interesting and full of good stuff",
          "It was a very cold day and the museum had few visitors. The entire island seemed bleak. It's probably not a good stop during the winter months, and April was still late winter, with snow.",
          "There were a couple of current exhibitions when I visited the museum but the entrance for either of them was quite expensive. Museum's permanent exhibition was free with the artworks from Picasso, Ernst, Duchamp, to name just a few. Sadly, most of them were copies, not",
          "The receptionist is laughing in front of my face and didn't answer my question in a good way. I can't find easy the library.",
          "Marina Abramovich was such a great exhibition - good job Moderna museet! I even consider seeing it another time, it was such an amazing experience. Lovely gift shop as well + extra points for the good design museum at the same property.",
          "the museum has an impressive collection of contemporary art, and apart from temporary exhibitions, the entrance is free. i was there in april to see the marina abramovic retrospective (impressive per se) and ended up spending the whole afternoon in the museum (couldn't last any",
          "In my opinion this is the best Museum of Stockholm and it is free. You will see some really weird pieces of \"art\" but in general there are some interesting exhibitions.",
          "It is mandatory to see the general exchibition in Modern Museum because you can see more great paintings form the expressionist, surrealist or other modern styles. Picasso, Dali, Matisse, L\u00e9ger, Duchamp, Kokoschka, Ernst, Ray etc. for free.",
          "Late opening on the weekend (11am), but free admission. The restaurant and cafe are very popular for families with kids. The museum has a decent collection, worth spending an hour to explore. There is usually a special exhibit with the fee. The cafe food was pretty good and",
          "Like many places, the museum is a bit of a walk from Kungstradgarden, the King's Garden in the center of town. But it's a lovely walk over a bridge and you'll wind-up on a hill, surrounded by quality art. Stop in the cafe for a coffee and enjoy the view overlooking the boats and",
          "Came to see Yayoi Kusama, but we were one day too late... Back in the USSR as compensation. Cannot complain....",
          "It's the best free thing you can do in Stockholm. The walk towards the museum passes through a nice little park ideal for an afternoon stroll. Very varied galleries and there are even some really interesting interactive exhibitions, including one where I walked in and got",
          "We visited the Moderna Museet out first day in Stockholm when the snow was really coming down and we needed to get out of it for a couple of hours. The staff were really helpful and pointed out which exhibits were free (we didn't want to pay for specific exhibits). We spent an",
          "Stopped in one morning after walking past it to get to the city a few times and was very surprised to find the general exhibition was free. It's on the small side but interesting if you like Modern Art. All of the big names you would expect are represented along with a few",
          "The artworks you can see for free include quite a few by incredible artists, including Dali, Matisse, Munch, Picasso, Warhol, Pollock, and Lichtenstein. The most impressive for me was a vast collection of Duchamp, but there is a bit of everything. We did not go to the",
          "If you are a fan of modern art you will enjoy this. Not many things are free in Stockholm and this is for the permanent collection. It has some Warhol and Picasso pieces.",
          "Be open to modern art when you visit the collection. Some paintings by Picasso and Salvador Dali are on display here. Free lockers for luggage, coats behind the museum shop.",
          "A good sized collection of modern art, however the special exhibits really make the experience so much more than a review of historical pieces. Also, the restaurant which has great views is worth a visit. Highly recommended.",
          "I was recently here to see the Marina Abromovic exhibition. It was interesting and i found the other exhibitions interesting as well.",
          "Skeppsholmen is an museum island in the middle of Stockholm city. It is free of entrance fees and on a warm summer day you can just walk around and take a look at the beautiful seeside of Stockholm. On the island there are ceveral attractions including Moderna Museet which has",

          "The best museum in Sweden for modern art, and at a price that is impossible to beat, as the main gallery is free. You can easily spend 2 hours with Picasso, Miro, Mondrian, Dali, and a lot of Fernand L\u00e9ger, without paying a penny. This was my first visit, and even though this is",

          "It is free (the permanent exhibitions - the special ones are not free and the current one is 125SEK) but do yourself a favour and take a walk instead of visiting this place. The only nice thing about it is the location. Inside - screaming children, obscure (and, frankly",

          "There is restaurant facing amazing water view and which happens to have lunch of the day and brunch on weekends. Museum is free of charge (main exposition; have to pay for tiny part showcasing some new exposition), has some famous peace of art. Very specious. Great atmosphere.",
          "The Moderna Museet, located on lovely Skeppsholmen, is truly one of the great museums of modern art in the world. The collections are in a global top 10, the space is nice and the exhibition programme is excellent. Don't miss it!",

          "Not all modern art is my thing, but I appreciated they do have an excellent collection here, so if it is your thing you should go. We actually enjoyed the Gingerbread House competition more, which showed around a hundred gingerbread houses built by a cross section of children,",
          "Extraordinary if you like art - Miro, Picasso, Magritte, Dali, etc. Vast collection. Great thing that it is free for most exhibitions and you just pay a small fee for the specific stuff. The money you save on the free entrance can be well-spent in their lovely coffee shop.",

          "This museum was included in my Stockholm Card and received good reviews so I checked it out with high anticipation. It was very interesting to say the least with many quirky and downright weird exhibits. You could spend a long time in there, as it is pretty large. I thought I",

          "One of the best museums I've been to! Understated intelligence even in the design and flow of the museum. Very rare modernist pieces, it was a joy to see in person. The newer exhibits were also extremely sensible and intriguing. We spent hours pondering different installations",

          "Superb museum. We came to see the Yayoi Kusama In infinity exhibition. Which was wonderfully curated and very inspiring. The outdoor space is also great, grab a coffee and sit there and re enter when you're refreshed. Free wifi too. Loved expiring all the art here. Don't leave",

          "Loved this museum, had a bit of everything. My friend who isn't into art at all really enjoyed it too. Had a few temporary exhibitions like 'The new human' which included video clips, etc. Also worth walking through is the garden next to it which forms part of the architecture",

          "The best thing about Moderna Museet is the venue/actual building and location. Skeppsholmen is worth a walk by itself. Great modern building with a very simple cafe, really good bookshop/store. You can leave your belongings in lockers. And don't miss a go at the toilet if you",
          "Went to see the Yayoi Kusama exhibit which was very well done if a bit pricey. Otherwise the museum is free but I didn't have time to see the rest - after wrestling through the very crowded exhibition with three kids I was too exhausted! Went on a Sunday and it was more crowded",

          "I will not pretend to rate the entire museum, which is located a comfortable walk from the famous Grand Hotel in central Stockholm. But the Yayoi Kusama exhibition was much talked about, and led me back to this museum for the first time in years. There is no lack of originality",

          "Some of our favourite artists' works are here. It is a most impressive outstanding permanent collection in a fittingly wonderful building. Given Munch's dominating fame for The Scream it was fascinating to see others of his oeuvre, such as Portrait of Helge Rode, Girl on the",

          "We went to Moderna Museet to watch the Kurasama exebition, which did not let us down. We are 'friends' of the Astrup-Fearnley museum and as a perk we get discounts at this museum. The visit was very rewarding, not too crowded, the Cafe Blom adjacent very nice and the trees in",
          "The permanent collection is free, and the works on display include many prominent international artists. I was a little disappointed that there was not more of the museum's collection on display, but I thoroughly enjoyed what was there. A large number of Duchamps were on",
          "Wasn't too impressed with the New Human exhibition but then found Yayoi Kusama upstairs and was blown away. The museum collection is superb with work by everyone from Braque to Warhol, including Dali, Rauschenberg, Miro, Malevich, Schwitters, Matisse, and of course Picasso.",

          "A great place to visit for a nice (not too extensive) overview of some modern art (easy to combine with National Museet as they are some 300m apart) - especially as it is again free of charge to visit! When visiting, take a stroll around the island where Moderna is located and",
          "We had a tour with a fantastic guide , loved it. Free entrance but the special exhibitions cost extra.",

          "An excellent way to spend a rainy/snowy day! Ended up spending almost 4 hours here and loved every second of it. It introduced me to Scandinavian modern artists, and also had many other examples of the more mainstream works. Highly recommended. Also very close to the photography",

          "an odd location that's a little hard to find (a ferry ride or a long walk) and it's even hard to find the entrance to the building. Once inside, however, the museum is laid out nicely. Nice collection of modernists. As we walked out of the last room, we found a totally great bit",
          "Food is of a reasonable standard and price, cafeteria style with plenty of choice. But the real reason to come here is the unbeatable view over Stockholm and its harbour. Try to grab a table by the window, or sit outdoors on the terrace.",
          "A great selection of modern and contemporary art pieces in a beautiful setting close to city center. The special exhibition of YAYOI KUSAMA was excellent.",
          "I took my my 12 year old son here, the basic exhibition is free and it is very good, and on a 3 day trip I wanted to do alternative things with a young boy.. We both liked it, and the Skeppsholmen island in the very centre of Stockholm is charming. I do strongly recommend!",

          "I came for Yayoi Kusama's In Infinity. It was a marvellous experience. The rest of the museum is vast, there's so much to see. Pop in to their cafe for lunch while you're there. Buffet style at a fixed price, fantastic value.",
          "If you are in the center and it is raining, really a good option. Worth of visiting. If the weather is good and you have no more than 3 days in Stockholm is not really worth of visiting, unless contemporary art is Nr1 importances in your life. It is really Scandinavian style -",
          "We are serious art lovers and we were so glad to have discovered this gem of a museum in Stockholm! The permanent collection includes an amazing array of all you might hope to find in a museum like this- Picasso, Dali, Munch, Matisse (a lovely room of his cut-outs), Braque, Dix,",

          "Way too far out for me. There were some exhibits of classy modern art by the talented and famous, and then some exhibits which I found laughable, appalling, and downright disgusting. It's a beautiful museum, but I can't get my aged head around some of the works which are beyond",
          "Some of the artwork is first class (Picasso, Warhol, etc) but some just takes the biscuit (an inch long piece of string on the wall???). It felt as though the exhibitions were a bit of a mishmash.",

          "Amazing permanent collection and free to visit!",
          "Honestly I'm not interested in modern art, but I went there because it's one of few attractions free of charge in Stockholm. I didn't really liked it, it was a bit confusing and the most interesting exhibitions are not free.",
          "It's very completed and has a lot of recognised artists like Dal\u00ed, Matisse, Picasso and Duchamp, but also you will discover new ones that can surprise you. It also have a restaurant, and you can spend hours in the gift shop.",

          "Even if you don't go inside, wandering the area during a nice summer day is well worth the trip.",
          "Located in one of the smaller islands. The building is very modern itself.  Permanent collection is free. They've got a really sizable collection of Duchamps (around 30 pieces ) ",

It could warrant two trips for one serious in art, or one could break up their visit with a break at one of the great caf\u00e9s nearby (Caf\u00e9 Blom is best!). The best things in life are free; Modern Museet is the case in point.",

        "wiki": "The Westfalenpark is a large public park in Dortmund. With an area of 70 ha (170 acres), the park is one of the largest inner-city parks in Europe and is a popular destination for excursions and recreation in North Rhine-Westphalia. The park is situated between the Westfalenstadion, Westfalenhallen, Bundesautobahn 40 and includes the Florianturm. The Emscher valley forms the southern border of the park. \nThe Westfalenpark Dortmund was opened for the first of the three Bundesgartenschau (a biennial federal horticulture) there (1959, 1969, 1991). On the grounds of the old Kaiser-Wilhelm-Hain, the bushmill park, a waste disposal site and overgrown allotments, a park was created, the centre of which is the Florianturm, at 220 metres the highest German building at the time.\nIt is home to the German Rosarium, which presents its visitors with more than 3,000 different types of roses, and is the venue for many concerts and regular events, such as the Juicy Beats Festival or the Festival of Lights. Especially popular are the concerts on the lake stage as well as the a cappella festival and flea markets. Many events take place under the awning located in the middle of the park. The 1980s parties or the Ibiza parties were crowd pullers, attracting well over 1,000 visitors.\nThe awning, designed in 1969 by architect G\u00fcnter Behnisch, is considered an experimental building of a self-supporting roof construction. After the feasibility of such a ceiling construction was proven here, the construction of the Munich Olympic Stadium followed.\nThe Westfalenpark was extended by 10 hectares for the Federal Horticultural Show Euroflor 1969. The Rosarium and, in its centre, the Water Heart, a basin whose water level changes periodically, were created on the site.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBundesgartenschau\nWestfalenstadion\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Nice open space park to take a walk in or just sit and relax in nature between all the stunning trees and flowers. There are a few places to sit down and have a meal but my suggestion would be to bring a basket and have your own picknick in the park. In spring the flowers",
          "Three Euro fifty to get in but should perhaps be free out of season. The lakes were all dry, the cafes were not open and very few of the flower beds had many flowers. A few daffs about but very disappointing. Also make sure the tower is open before you go!",

          "We were a bit miffed to have to pay a few euros to enter the park, but after a while we understood why. Many different areas, both for strolling through, sitting in and playing with the children. We actually took the train ride for half of the park, it's huge! The tower was",
          "At first glance once in the park, you feel a little let down. But once you venture further in the park is very nice. Full of colour, trees, flowers, lots of roses, lily ponds, koi and a large tower. We bought some food and drink with us and had an enjoyable picnic there too.",
          "Here you can have a fantastic Brunch Buffet at Dr\u00fcch Blick in the Westfalen Park in Dortmund.The price is reasonable and the quality is great. After a hearty brunch a stroll through the park is well worth it too, with a very large car boot market, the Florian Tower, the train",

          "I spent a couple of hours strolling through this fine park which feels a million miles from the city. A great escape for a couple of hours, grabbing a seat here and there to take in the views and the fresh air. I guess it had passed its best for this year but I'll bet that it",
          "We came to the park because we wanted to visit the tower. But we had to wait for two hours unitl 12 o clock beacuse the tower was not open yet. Not much to do in the park besides strolling along the flower beds",

          "The nature in the park is really great, it has various areas with lovely plants and animals, cute places to have a bite or a drink, it is a nice place to escape from the city and enjoy some relax. On the other hand, some of the people working at the park weren't very nice to us",

          "We chose a rainy day to visit but it didn't spoil our enjoyment at all. Just 5 euros each to get in which included a ride up the 210m high tower with fabulous views across the city. Walking around the park there was so much to see, lots of bits of art and sculpture amongst the",
          "Although it was spring and there was little in bloom, this park was beautiful, it must be stunning in summer",
          "We were killing time before the football game and decided to see what the fuss was all about. Personally, I didnt think there was much there. \u20ac3.50 to get in and up the Florian Tower but apart from that theres nothing there. If you want to kill a few hours, then give it a look.",
          "Dortmund has not only a top football team, but also a very nice Rose Garden which shows the different classes from different continents and centuries in a romantic way. Try to see it in June.",
          "We went there in May, the month of flowers, and of course it was beautiful. The roses were blooming, flowers were colourful, the grass was green. The flamingos were the greatest attraction for me, I really like them. The price was reasonable, it included the Florianturm visit.",
          "Lovely park in the heart of Dortmund, close to the U-Bahn station. You have to pay for the entrance, but, surely, it is worth it. Simple park with few water ponds, own rail road, not expensive restaurants. Perfect place for families with children (there will be lots of",

          "Apparently I took my first steps in this park, and I have many fond memories going there as a child, and now taking my children there when we go to visit. In the summer there are gorgeous styles of gardens all over this huge park, together with the most fun and unique",
          "I went to Dortmund for the football. There is not a lot to do in the city so this was a nice diverstion for a few hours. The Park is well-kept. I can imagine in Summer that there is a lot going on but in December everything is pretty dead. Nice rose garden however, nice puppet",

          "Probably the worst time of year to do this, however with a day in town to kill before a flight, well worth it. Just a few stops on the metro from the centre of town this beautifully kept park has lots of installations and features to keep you wandering around. Top of the list",
          "On a winters day in mid December there is not a lot to see apart from the modern sculptures. However a trip up the Florian Tower was worth it with amazing views as it is all so flat. Unfortunately the cafe did not open until 12 noon so we missed this experience. It was good",

        "wiki": "Dortmund (, also UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u0254\u0281tm\u028ant] (listen); Westphalian Low German: D\u00fc\u00f6rpm [\u02c8dy\u02d0\u0153\u0250\u032fpm\u0329]; Latin: Tremonia) is with a population of 603,609 inhabitants as of 2020, the third-largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany's eighth-largest city. It is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of Westphalia. On the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine), it lies in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg.\nFounded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 230% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.The region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Unionand is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries and logistics. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction, especially for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as Europe (Benelux countries), and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions, including the Technical University of Dortmund and Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, International School of Management and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities with over 49,000 students, many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. The city is known as Westphalia's \"green metropolis\". Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past.\nDortmund is home to Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund, a successful club in German football.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Sigiburg was a Saxon hillfort in the South of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by Westphalian Saxons. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni \u2013 In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the \"Ecclesiastical council\" and in 1016 the\"Imperial diet\" meets in Dortmund.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===\n\nAfter it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold's Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court (German: Freistuhl) was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the Femelinde. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - Stadtgymnasium Dortmund. The 1661 earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.\n\n\n=== 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n\nWith the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\nDuring the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch - a right military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. Radical workers formed a Red Army who fought the freikorps units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nUnder Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients for euthanasia at the Hadamar mental hospital as part of the Action T4 (an additional 229 children were killed in the \"Children's Specialist Department\", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941).\nBombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenh\u00fctte AG, the \"Hoesch-Benzin GmbH\" synthetic oil plant, and the Zeche Hansa. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped through Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\n\nPost-war, most of the ancient buildings were not restored, and large parts of the city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict H\u00f6rde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nDortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are 87 km (54 mi) long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten kreisangeh\u00f6rig (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4 million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, L\u00fcnen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills in the south of the city to the Sauerland.\nThe Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund 254.3 m (834 ft). There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at 48.9 m (160 ft).\nThe Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called Stadtbezirke), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, H\u00f6rde, Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each  Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n\nStadtzentrum (City centre)\nHafenviertel (Harbour Quarter)\nNordmarkt\nBorsigplatz\nKaiserviertel\nKronenviertel\nKreuzviertel\nKlinikviertel (Clinical Quarter)\nSaarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\nUnionviertel\nGartenstadt\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately 9 to 10 \u00b0C (48 to 50 \u00b0F), the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately 800 mm (31 in). Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as Ostflucht (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical \"loss\" of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.\nAs of 2012, Dortmund had a population of 571,403 of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has large Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 2014 the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (49.9%) and Catholicism (27.4% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4 - I.N. Ag\u00edon Apost\u00f3lon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of \"guest workers\". Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 84,944 community members.\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, H\u00f6rde and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s. Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - German Evangelical Church Assembly.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Ullrich Sierau with variable majorities between SPD, CDU and Alliance '90/The Greens\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\n\nDortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\nDortmund is often called the Herzkammer der SPD (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Hen\u00dfler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): Ullrich Sierau (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nDortmund is twinned with:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.\n\n\n=== Urban districts ===\nUnlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.\n\n\n==== Kreuzviertel ====\n\nThe Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer and players of Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42 km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the Westfalenh\u00fctte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n\n\n==== Kaiserviertel ====\n\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n\n==== Unionviertel ====\n\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.\n\n\n==== H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix ====\n\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L\u00fcnen, Unna und Schwerte. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost \u20ac;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east\u2013west and 320 meters wide in north\u2013south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\nZalando\nHSBC Trinkaus\nGerman Handball Association\nHandball-Bundesliga (HBL)\nAcademy of the German public Bank\nMircosonicThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.\nThe River Emscher flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public water board Emschergenossenschaft. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by the year 2020.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nReinoldikirche, a Protestant church (built in 1233\u20131450)\nPetrikirche, a now Protestant church (start of construction 1322). It is famous for the huge carved altar (known as \"Golden Miracle of Dortmund\"), from 1521. It consists of 633 gilt carved oak figures depicting 30 scenes about Easter.\nMarienkirche, a now Protestant church originally built in 1170\u20131200 but rebuilt after World War II. The altar is from 1420.\nPropsteikirche, Monastery of the Dominican Order in the city center (built in 1331\u20131353)\nSt. Georg, Aplerbeck, the only Romasque cross basilica of Dortmund\nGro\u00dfe Kirche Aplerbeck, a Gothic revival church\nSt. Peter in Syburg suburb, the oldest church building in the city limits\nHeilig-Kreuz-Kirche, a Protestant church (start of construction 1911)\nSt.-Margareta Chapel, a Protestant chapel built in 1348\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Castles ===\nHaus Bodelschwingh (13th century), a moated castle\nHaus Dellwig (13th century), a moated castle partly rebuilt in the 17th century. The fa\u00e7ade and the steep tower, and two half-timbered buildings, are original.\nHaus Rodenberg (13th century), a moated castle\nAltes Stadthaus, built in 1899 by Friedrich Kullrich\nRomberg Park Gatehouse (17th century), once a gatehouse to a moated castle. Now it houses an art gallery.\nHusen Castle, the tower house of a former castle, in the borough of Syburg.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrial buildings ===\nThe most industrial building in Dortmund are part of the Industrial Heritage Trail (German: Route der Industriekultur). The trail links tourist attractions related to the industrial heritage in the whole Ruhr area in Germany. It is a part of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.\n\nU-Tower, former Dortmunder Union brewery, now a museum\nZollern II/IV Colliery, now part of the Westphalian Industrial Museum and an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH)\nHansa Coking Plant\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cultural buildings ===\nKonzerthaus Dortmund\nOpernhaus Dortmund, opera house built in 1966 on the site of the old synagogue which was destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.\nThe major art museums include the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte and the more recent Museum Ostwall.\nDASA, Germany Occupational Health and Safety Exhibition (German: Deutsche Arbeitsschutzausstellung)\nBrewery Museum Dortmund\nMuseum of Art and Cultural History\nGerman Football Museum\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other important buildings ===\nFlorianturm, (television tower Florian)\nWestfalenstadion: Football ground of Borussia Dortmund, licensed until 2021 under the name Signal Iduna Park\nClose to Westfalenstadion are the Westfalenhallen, a large convention centre, the site of several major conventions, trade fairs, ice-skating competitions, concerts and other major events since the 1950s.\nSteinwache memorial\n\n\n=== High-rise structures ===\nDortmund tallest structure is the Florianturm telecommunication tower at 266 m or 873 ft. Other tall buildings are the churches around the city centre. A selection of the tallest office buildings in Dortmund is listed below.\n\nRWE Tower (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestnetz Hochhaus Dortmund (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestfalentower (88 metre-high skyscraper)\nHarenberg City-Center (86 metre-high skyscraper)\nSparkassen-Hochhaus (70 metre-high skyscraper)\nIWO-Hochhaus(70 metre-high skyscraper)\nEllipson (66 metre-high skyscraper)\nVolkswohl Bund Hochhaus (60 metre-high skyscraper)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\n\nDortmund also serves as a major European and German crossroads for the Autobahnsystem. The Ruhrschnellweg follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the Ruhr Area. It crosses the Dutch-German border as a continuation of the Dutch A67 and crosses the Rhine, leads through the Ruhr valley toward Bochum, becoming B 1 (Bundesstra\u00dfe 1) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A 44 near Holzwickede. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to Der Spiegel, it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes A1 and A2, which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the Kamener Kreuz interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn A45 to the west these form the Dortmund Beltway (Dortmunder Autobahnring).\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a Bike freeway called the Radschnellweg Ruhr (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\nThe central train station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Dortmund with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive Stadtbahn and bus system. The Stadtbahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of L\u00fcnen in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre.

        "wiki": "Dortmund (, also UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u0254\u0281tm\u028ant] (listen); Westphalian Low German: D\u00fc\u00f6rpm [\u02c8dy\u02d0\u0153\u0250\u032fpm\u0329]; Latin: Tremonia) is with a population of 603,609 inhabitants as of 2020, the third-largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany's eighth-largest city. It is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of Westphalia. On the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine), it lies in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg.\nFounded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 230% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.The region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Unionand is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries and logistics. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction, especially for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as Europe (Benelux countries), and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions, including the Technical University of Dortmund and Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, International School of Management and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities with over 49,000 students, many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. The city is known as Westphalia's \"green metropolis\". Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past.\nDortmund is home to Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund, a successful club in German football.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Sigiburg was a Saxon hillfort in the South of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by Westphalian Saxons. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni \u2013 In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the \"Ecclesiastical council\" and in 1016 the\"Imperial diet\" meets in Dortmund.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===\n\nAfter it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold's Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court (German: Freistuhl) was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the Femelinde. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - Stadtgymnasium Dortmund. The 1661 earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.\n\n\n=== 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n\nWith the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\nDuring the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch - a right military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. Radical workers formed a Red Army who fought the freikorps units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nUnder Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients for euthanasia at the Hadamar mental hospital as part of the Action T4 (an additional 229 children were killed in the \"Children's Specialist Department\", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941).\nBombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenh\u00fctte AG, the \"Hoesch-Benzin GmbH\" synthetic oil plant, and the Zeche Hansa. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped through Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\n\nPost-war, most of the ancient buildings were not restored, and large parts of the city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict H\u00f6rde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nDortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are 87 km (54 mi) long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten kreisangeh\u00f6rig (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4 million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, L\u00fcnen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills in the south of the city to the Sauerland.\nThe Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund 254.3 m (834 ft). There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at 48.9 m (160 ft).\nThe Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called Stadtbezirke), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, H\u00f6rde, Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each  Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n\nStadtzentrum (City centre)\nHafenviertel (Harbour Quarter)\nNordmarkt\nBorsigplatz\nKaiserviertel\nKronenviertel\nKreuzviertel\nKlinikviertel (Clinical Quarter)\nSaarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\nUnionviertel\nGartenstadt\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately 9 to 10 \u00b0C (48 to 50 \u00b0F), the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately 800 mm (31 in). Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as Ostflucht (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical \"loss\" of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.\nAs of 2012, Dortmund had a population of 571,403 of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has large Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 2014 the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (49.9%) and Catholicism (27.4% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4 - I.N. Ag\u00edon Apost\u00f3lon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of \"guest workers\". Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 84,944 community members.\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, H\u00f6rde and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s. Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - German Evangelical Church Assembly.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Ullrich Sierau with variable majorities between SPD, CDU and Alliance '90/The Greens\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\n\nDortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\nDortmund is often called the Herzkammer der SPD (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Hen\u00dfler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): Ullrich Sierau (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nDortmund is twinned with:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.\n\n\n=== Urban districts ===\nUnlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.\n\n\n==== Kreuzviertel ====\n\nThe Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer and players of Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42 km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the Westfalenh\u00fctte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n\n\n==== Kaiserviertel ====\n\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n\n==== Unionviertel ====\n\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.\n\n\n==== H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix ====\n\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L\u00fcnen, Unna und Schwerte. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost \u20ac;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east\u2013west and 320 meters wide in north\u2013south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\nZalando\nHSBC Trinkaus\nGerman Handball Association\nHandball-Bundesliga (HBL)\nAcademy of the German public Bank\nMircosonicThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.\nThe River Emscher flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public water board Emschergenossenschaft. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by the year 2020.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nReinoldikirche, a Protestant church (built in 1233\u20131450)\nPetrikirche, a now Protestant church (start of construction 1322). It is famous for the huge carved altar (known as \"Golden Miracle of Dortmund\"), from 1521. It consists of 633 gilt carved oak figures depicting 30 scenes about Easter.\nMarienkirche, a now Protestant church originally built in 1170\u20131200 but rebuilt after World War II. The altar is from 1420.\nPropsteikirche, Monastery of the Dominican Order in the city center (built in 1331\u20131353)\nSt. Georg, Aplerbeck, the only Romasque cross basilica of Dortmund\nGro\u00dfe Kirche Aplerbeck, a Gothic revival church\nSt. Peter in Syburg suburb, the oldest church building in the city limits\nHeilig-Kreuz-Kirche, a Protestant church (start of construction 1911)\nSt.-Margareta Chapel, a Protestant chapel built in 1348\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Castles ===\nHaus Bodelschwingh (13th century), a moated castle\nHaus Dellwig (13th century), a moated castle partly rebuilt in the 17th century. The fa\u00e7ade and the steep tower, and two half-timbered buildings, are original.\nHaus Rodenberg (13th century), a moated castle\nAltes Stadthaus, built in 1899 by Friedrich Kullrich\nRomberg Park Gatehouse (17th century), once a gatehouse to a moated castle. Now it houses an art gallery.\nHusen Castle, the tower house of a former castle, in the borough of Syburg.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrial buildings ===\nThe most industrial building in Dortmund are part of the Industrial Heritage Trail (German: Route der Industriekultur). The trail links tourist attractions related to the industrial heritage in the whole Ruhr area in Germany. It is a part of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.\n\nU-Tower, former Dortmunder Union brewery, now a museum\nZollern II/IV Colliery, now part of the Westphalian Industrial Museum and an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH)\nHansa Coking Plant\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cultural buildings ===\nKonzerthaus Dortmund\nOpernhaus Dortmund, opera house built in 1966 on the site of the old synagogue which was destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.\nThe major art museums include the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte and the more recent Museum Ostwall.\nDASA, Germany Occupational Health and Safety Exhibition (German: Deutsche Arbeitsschutzausstellung)\nBrewery Museum Dortmund\nMuseum of Art and Cultural History\nGerman Football Museum\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other important buildings ===\nFlorianturm, (television tower Florian)\nWestfalenstadion: Football ground of Borussia Dortmund, licensed until 2021 under the name Signal Iduna Park\nClose to Westfalenstadion are the Westfalenhallen, a large convention centre, the site of several major conventions, trade fairs, ice-skating competitions, concerts and other major events since the 1950s.\nSteinwache memorial\n\n\n=== High-rise structures ===\nDortmund tallest structure is the Florianturm telecommunication tower at 266 m or 873 ft. Other tall buildings are the churches around the city centre. A selection of the tallest office buildings in Dortmund is listed below.\n\nRWE Tower (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestnetz Hochhaus Dortmund (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestfalentower (88 metre-high skyscraper)\nHarenberg City-Center (86 metre-high skyscraper)\nSparkassen-Hochhaus (70 metre-high skyscraper)\nIWO-Hochhaus(70 metre-high skyscraper)\nEllipson (66 metre-high skyscraper)\nVolkswohl Bund Hochhaus (60 metre-high skyscraper)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\n\nDortmund also serves as a major European and German crossroads for the Autobahnsystem. The Ruhrschnellweg follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the Ruhr Area. It crosses the Dutch-German border as a continuation of the Dutch A67 and crosses the Rhine, leads through the Ruhr valley toward Bochum, becoming B 1 (Bundesstra\u00dfe 1) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A 44 near Holzwickede. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to Der Spiegel, it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes A1 and A2, which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the Kamener Kreuz interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn A45 to the west these form the Dortmund Beltway (Dortmunder Autobahnring).\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a Bike freeway called the Radschnellweg Ruhr (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\nThe central train station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Dortmund with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive Stadtbahn and bus system. The Stadtbahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of L\u00fcnen in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last trams on the surface.A number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system. Night buses replace Stadtbahn services between 1:30 am and 7:30 am on weekends and public holidays. The central junction for the night bus service is Reinoldikirche in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.\nThe H-Bahn at Dortmund University of Technology is a hanging monorail built specifically to shuttle passengers between the university's two campuses, which are now also flanked by research laboratories and other high-tech corporations and startups. A nearly identical monorail system transfers passengers at D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nDortmund Airport is a medium-sized, but fast growing airport 13 km (8.1 mi) east of the city centre at the city limit to Holzwickede. The airport serves the area of the Ruhrgebiet, Sauerland, Westphalia and parts of the Netherlands and features flights to Munich, London, Vienna, Porto and a lot of eastern European city and leisure destinations. The airport is served by an express bus to Dortmund main station, a shuttle bus to the nearby railway station Holzwickede/Dortmund Flughafen, a bus to the city's metro line U47, as well as a bus to the city of Unna.\nIn 2019, the airport served 2,719,563 passengers mainly used for low-cost and leisure charter flights. The closest intercontinental airport is D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\nDortmund Harbour (Hafen) is the largest canal harbour in Europe and the 11th fluvial harbour in Germany.\n\nTransport in Dortmund\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDortmund has adapted since the collapse of its century long steel, coal and beer industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, biomedical technology, micro systems technology, engineering, tourism, finance, education, services and is thus one of the most dynamic new-economy cities in Germany. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow.Hundreds of SMEs are still based in and around Dortmund (often termed Mittelstand). Dortmund is also home to a number of medium-sized information technology companies, many linked to the local university TU Dortmund at the first technology center in Germany named \"Technologiepark Dortmund\" opened in the 1980s. With around 280 companies like Boehringer Ingelheim and Verizon Communications and more than 8,500 employees, TechnologiePark Dortmund is one of the most successful technology parks in Europe. The city works closely with research institutes, private universities, and companies to collaborate on the commercialisation of science initiatives. Furthermore, 680 IT and software companies with 12,000 employees are based in Dortmund, making the city one of Germany's biggest software locations. Two of the top 10 IT service provider in Germany are based in Dortmund -  adesso SE and Materna Group.Dortmund is home to many insurance companies e.g. Signal Iduna, Continentale Krankenversicherung, Bundesinnungskrankenkasse Gesundheit (BIG direkt) and Volkswohl Bund.

Starting in the mid-1990s, Dortmund, formerly an industrial centre, saw rapid development that expanded its cultural and tourism possibilities, and transformed it into a newly vibrant city. An important strategic step was the start of construction the new Konzerthaus Dortmund, the reuse of vacant old industrial buildings like the Zollern II/IV Colliery, Kokerei Hansa, Dortmund U-Tower and the strategic reorientation of the Dortmund Christmas market with over 300 stalls packed around a gigantic Christmas tree creation that stands 45 metres tall \u2013 reputed to be the biggest in the world. A new Tourist Information center right next to the U-Tower, gives visitors a quick overview of the tourist attractions in the City and Ruhr Area. Today Dortmund is with more than 1.450.528 (2017) overnight stays one of the most popular destinations in North Rhine-Westphalia.The majority of tourists are domestic visitors, coming from Germany. International travellers arrive from the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland.

The top 5 most visited attractions were the Christmas market, with more than three and a half million visitors, Signal Iduna Park, Deutsches Fu\u00dfballmuseum, Dortmund U-Tower, Zollern II/IV Colliery and Westfalenpark.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nThe Westenhellweg is a popular shopping destination and with nearly 13,000 visitors per hour it was Germany's most frequented shopping street in 2013. During the Middle Ages, Dortmund was the only free imperial city in Westphalia, having already been regarded as an important centre of trade. Today some of the most reputed shops, department stores have stores here. It is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by the Reinoldikirche in the east and U-Tower in the west. The Westenhellweg has one of the highest rents for retail and office space in North Rhine-Westphalia. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as H&M, Saturn, Esprit, Zara or NewYorker.

During the month before Christmas, the extended pedestrian-only zone is host to Dortmund Christmas Market, one of the largest and oldest Christmas markets in Germany. With more than 3.5 million visitors and 300 stalls around a gigantic Christmas tree that stands 45 metres tall, it is one of the most visited and popular market in the world.In close proximity to the Dortmund concert hall lies the Br\u00fcckstra\u00dfenviertel  - a quarter hub especially for young people. The \"Rue de Pommes Frites\", which is what the Dortmund citizens have called the Br\u00fcckstra\u00dfe, has turned into a modern shopping promenade, geared towards a younger market.\nFor a long time, the Kampstra\u00dfe had a shadowy existence as a parallel street to the Westenhellweg and Ostenhellweg, but it has become a grand boulevard containing specialist stores. Right next to the Kampstra\u00dfe is the Kleppingstra\u00dfe  \u2013 a shopping street with a high concentration of gastronomy and expensive, prestigious shops like van Laack, Lindner Fashion, Marc Cain. It is located between the Ostenhellweg and Neutor to Wallring.\n\n\n=== Port and Logistic ===\n\nDortmund is one of the most important logistic hubs in Germany, more than 900 companies working in logistics, as well as nationally and internationally recognised scientific institutes. Dortmund Port which terminates the Dortmund-Ems Canal connecting Dortmund to the North Sea is the biggest European canal port with 10 docks and a pier length of 11 km. The variety of different activities taking place at the Fraunhofer Institute Material Flow and Logistics (Fraunhofer Society) has, over the past few years, led to a bundling of skills in the areas of logistics and digitalisation in the city. Industry-based initiatives and pilot projects, such as the Hybrid Services in Logistics innovation lab, the efficiency cluster LogistikRuhr, Industrial Data Space, the Dortmund Mittelstand 4.0 Centre of Excellence, and the enterprise labs.

You have to catch the train to trier park station from the Hauptbahnhoff in the centre of Dortmund and",
          "We were staying near Dortmund, so we decided to try the zoo. It's in a very nice setting in the middle of the city. A hidden gem actually. They have guide books in various languages, but all signs are in German. Animals appear to be well kept and easy enough to find your way",
          "Dortmund Zoo is a hidden gem. Out from the centre of the City, it is still only a short Drive to get there. Even nicer is to take the U-Bahn out to it. The Station is the end stop of the line, and then you have a pretty ten-minute walk along a path through a wood & past meadows",
          "This is a nicely run zoo in a beautiful setting. Although not very large, there is a wide variety of animals here. The facility is very child-friendly and our twin girls loved the visit. There are child wagons for rent that make the tour more fun for little ones and easier on",
          "Its very good and intresting place for children with their parents. But for couples, if you have another choice go ahead. Everything was clean and animals were healthy i think. Morning time is better than afternoon because most of them are sleeping in their cage.",

          "In itself very nice and worth seeing. In good weather also seen many animals. Local prices were also ok. Actually, there is only a deduction because every second enclosure is empty because they are under construction \u2026",
          "Nice there!\n\n",

          "Super Zoo! I liked best the rhinos, I could watch super! The orangutans, on two levels, were also good to marvel!\nWere there in the fall now! But I can also imagine a visit in midsummer, as it will be pleasantly shady \u2026",

        "wiki": "Dortmund (, also UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u0254\u0281tm\u028ant] (listen); Westphalian Low German: D\u00fc\u00f6rpm [\u02c8dy\u02d0\u0153\u0250\u032fpm\u0329]; Latin: Tremonia) is with a population of 603,609 inhabitants as of 2020, the third-largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany's eighth-largest city. It is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of Westphalia. On the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine), it lies in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg.\nFounded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 230% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.The region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Unionand is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries and logistics. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction, especially for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as Europe (Benelux countries), and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions, including the Technical University of Dortmund and Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, International School of Management and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities with over 49,000 students, many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. The city is known as Westphalia's \"green metropolis\". Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past.\nDortmund is home to Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund, a successful club in German football.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Sigiburg was a Saxon hillfort in the South of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by Westphalian Saxons. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni \u2013 In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the \"Ecclesiastical council\" and in 1016 the\"Imperial diet\" meets in Dortmund.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===\n\nAfter it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold's Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court (German: Freistuhl) was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the Femelinde. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - Stadtgymnasium Dortmund. The 1661 earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.\n\n\n=== 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n\nWith the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\nDuring the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch - a right military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. Radical workers formed a Red Army who fought the freikorps units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nUnder Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients for euthanasia at the Hadamar mental hospital as part of the Action T4 (an additional 229 children were killed in the \"Children's Specialist Department\", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941).\nBombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenh\u00fctte AG, the \"Hoesch-Benzin GmbH\" synthetic oil plant, and the Zeche Hansa. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped through Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\n\nPost-war, most of the ancient buildings were not restored, and large parts of the city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict H\u00f6rde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nDortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are 87 km (54 mi) long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten kreisangeh\u00f6rig (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4 million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, L\u00fcnen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills in the south of the city to the Sauerland.\nThe Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund 254.3 m (834 ft). There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at 48.9 m (160 ft).\nThe Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called Stadtbezirke), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, H\u00f6rde, Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each  Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n\nStadtzentrum (City centre)\nHafenviertel (Harbour Quarter)\nNordmarkt\nBorsigplatz\nKaiserviertel\nKronenviertel\nKreuzviertel\nKlinikviertel (Clinical Quarter)\nSaarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\nUnionviertel\nGartenstadt\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately 9 to 10 \u00b0C (48 to 50 \u00b0F), the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately 800 mm (31 in). Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as Ostflucht (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical \"loss\" of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.\nAs of 2012, Dortmund had a population of 571,403 of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has large Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 2014 the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (49.9%) and Catholicism (27.4% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4 - I.N. Ag\u00edon Apost\u00f3lon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of \"guest workers\". Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 84,944 community members.\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, H\u00f6rde and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s. Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - German Evangelical Church Assembly.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Ullrich Sierau with variable majorities between SPD, CDU and Alliance '90/The Greens\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\n\nDortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\nDortmund is often called the Herzkammer der SPD (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Hen\u00dfler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): Ullrich Sierau (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nDortmund is twinned with:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.\n\n\n=== Urban districts ===\nUnlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.\n\n\n==== Kreuzviertel ====\n\nThe Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer and players of Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42 km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the Westfalenh\u00fctte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n\n\n==== Kaiserviertel ====\n\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n\n==== Unionviertel ====\n\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.\n\n\n==== H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix ====\n\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L\u00fcnen, Unna und Schwerte. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost \u20ac;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east\u2013west and 320 meters wide in north\u2013south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\nZalando\nHSBC Trinkaus\nGerman Handball Association\nHandball-Bundesliga (HBL)\nAcademy of the German public Bank\nMircosonicThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.\nThe River Emscher flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public water board Emschergenossenschaft. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by the year 2020.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nReinoldikirche, a Protestant church (built in 1233\u20131450)\nPetrikirche, a now Protestant church (start of construction 1322). It is famous for the huge carved altar (known as \"Golden Miracle of Dortmund\"), from 1521. It consists of 633 gilt carved oak figures depicting 30 scenes about Easter.\nMarienkirche, a now Protestant church originally built in 1170\u20131200 but rebuilt after World War II. The altar is from 1420.\nPropsteikirche, Monastery of the Dominican Order in the city center (built in 1331\u20131353)\nSt. Georg, Aplerbeck, the only Romasque cross basilica of Dortmund\nGro\u00dfe Kirche Aplerbeck, a Gothic revival church\nSt. Peter in Syburg suburb, the oldest church building in the city limits\nHeilig-Kreuz-Kirche, a Protestant church (start of construction 1911)\nSt.-Margareta Chapel, a Protestant chapel built in 1348\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Castles ===\nHaus Bodelschwingh (13th century), a moated castle\nHaus Dellwig (13th century), a moated castle partly rebuilt in the 17th century. The fa\u00e7ade and the steep tower, and two half-timbered buildings, are original.\nHaus Rodenberg (13th century), a moated castle\nAltes Stadthaus, built in 1899 by Friedrich Kullrich\nRomberg Park Gatehouse (17th century), once a gatehouse to a moated castle. Now it houses an art gallery.\nHusen Castle, the tower house of a former castle, in the borough of Syburg.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrial buildings ===\nThe most industrial building in Dortmund are part of the Industrial Heritage Trail (German: Route der Industriekultur). The trail links tourist attractions related to the industrial heritage in the whole Ruhr area in Germany. It is a part of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.\n\nU-Tower, former Dortmunder Union brewery, now a museum\nZollern II/IV Colliery, now part of the Westphalian Industrial Museum and an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH)\nHansa Coking Plant\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cultural buildings ===\nKonzerthaus Dortmund\nOpernhaus Dortmund, opera house built in 1966 on the site of the old synagogue which was destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.\nThe major art museums include the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte and the more recent Museum Ostwall.\nDASA, Germany Occupational Health and Safety Exhibition (German: Deutsche Arbeitsschutzausstellung)\nBrewery Museum Dortmund\nMuseum of Art and Cultural History\nGerman Football Museum\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other important buildings ===\nFlorianturm, (television tower Florian)\nWestfalenstadion: Football ground of Borussia Dortmund, licensed until 2021 under the name Signal Iduna Park\nClose to Westfalenstadion are the Westfalenhallen, a large convention centre, the site of several major conventions, trade fairs, ice-skating competitions, concerts and other major events since the 1950s.\nSteinwache memorial\n\n\n=== High-rise structures ===\nDortmund tallest structure is the Florianturm telecommunication tower at 266 m or 873 ft. Other tall buildings are the churches around the city centre. A selection of the tallest office buildings in Dortmund is listed below.\n\nRWE Tower (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestnetz Hochhaus Dortmund (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestfalentower (88 metre-high skyscraper)\nHarenberg City-Center (86 metre-high skyscraper)\nSparkassen-Hochhaus (70 metre-high skyscraper)\nIWO-Hochhaus(70 metre-high skyscraper)\nEllipson (66 metre-high skyscraper)\nVolkswohl Bund Hochhaus (60 metre-high skyscraper)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\n\nDortmund also serves as a major European and German crossroads for the Autobahnsystem. The Ruhrschnellweg follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the Ruhr Area. It crosses the Dutch-German border as a continuation of the Dutch A67 and crosses the Rhine, leads through the Ruhr valley toward Bochum, becoming B 1 (Bundesstra\u00dfe 1) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A 44 near Holzwickede. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to Der Spiegel, it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes A1 and A2, which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the Kamener Kreuz interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn A45 to the west these form the Dortmund Beltway (Dortmunder Autobahnring).\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a Bike freeway called the Radschnellweg Ruhr (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\nThe central train station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Dortmund with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive Stadtbahn and bus system. The Stadtbahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of L\u00fcnen in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last trams on the surface.A number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system. Night buses replace Stadtbahn services between 1:30 am and 7:30 am on weekends and public holidays. The central junction for the night bus service is Reinoldikirche in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.\nThe H-Bahn at Dortmund University of Technology is a hanging monorail built specifically to shuttle passengers between the university's two campuses, which are now also flanked by research laboratories and other high-tech corporations and startups. A nearly identical monorail system transfers passengers at D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nDortmund Airport is a medium-sized, but fast growing airport 13 km (8.1 mi) east of the city centre at the city limit to Holzwickede. The airport serves the area of the Ruhrgebiet, Sauerland, Westphalia and parts of the Netherlands and features flights to Munich, London, Vienna, Porto and a lot of eastern European city and leisure destinations. The airport is served by an express bus to Dortmund main station, a shuttle bus to the nearby railway station Holzwickede/Dortmund Flughafen, a bus to the city's metro line U47, as well as a bus to the city of Unna.\nIn 2019, the airport served 2,719,563 passengers mainly used for low-cost and leisure charter flights. The closest intercontinental airport is D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\nDortmund Harbour (Hafen) is the largest canal harbour in Europe and the 11th fluvial harbour in Germany.\n\nTransport in Dortmund\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDortmund has adapted since the collapse of its century long steel, coal and beer industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, biomedical technology, micro systems technology, engineering, tourism, finance, education, services and is thus one of the most dynamic new-economy cities in Germany. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow.Hundreds of SMEs are still based in and around Dortmund (often termed Mittelstand). Dortmund is also home to a number of medium-sized information technology companies, many linked to the local university TU Dortmund at the first technology center in Germany named \"Technologiepark Dortmund\" opened in the 1980s. With around 280 companies like Boehringer Ingelheim and Verizon Communications and more than 8,500 employees, TechnologiePark Dortmund is one of the most successful technology parks in Europe. The city works closely with research institutes, private universities, and companies to collaborate on the commercialisation of science initiatives. Furthermore, 680 IT and software companies with 12,000 employees are based in Dortmund, making the city one of Germany's biggest software locations. Two of the top 10 IT service provider in Germany are based in Dortmund -  adesso SE and Materna Group.Dortmund is home to many insurance companies e.g. Signal Iduna, Continentale Krankenversicherung, Bundesinnungskrankenkasse Gesundheit (BIG direkt) and Volkswohl Bund. In recent years a service sector and high-tech industry have grown up. Some of its most prominent companies of these sectors include Amprion and RWE-Westnetz (Electricity), Rhenus Logistics (Logistics), Wilo, KHS GmbH, Elmos Semiconductor, ABP Induction Systems, Nordwest Handel AG \u2013 all of whom have their headquarters here. Companies with operations in or around Dortmund include Zalando, Daimler AG: EvoBus, RapidMiner, Gap Inc. and ThyssenKrupp.\nDortmund is also the headquarter of Century Media Records, a heavy metal record label with offices in the United States and London. In August 2015, Century Media was acquired by Sony Music for US$17 million.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism in Dortmund is a fast-growing economic factor every year: new overnight records can be announced, new hotels open and new visitor magnets are added. Starting in the mid-1990s, Dortmund, formerly an industrial centre, saw rapid development that expanded its cultural and tourism possibilities, and transformed it into a newly vibrant city. An important strategic step was the start of construction the new Konzerthaus Dortmund, the reuse of vacant old industrial buildings like the Zollern II/IV Colliery, Kokerei Hansa, Dortmund U-Tower and the strategic reorientation of the Dortmund Christmas market with over 300 stalls packed around a gigantic Christmas tree creation that stands 45 metres tall \u2013 reputed to be the biggest in the world. A new Tourist Information center right next to the U-Tower, gives visitors a quick overview of the tourist attractions in the City and Ruhr Area.

          "I had some time in Dortmund and I like football. The exhibition is pretty interesting if you love German Football. I did not like that the last WorldCup title overtook almost 30% of the entire museum. The first world cup title is also very present but I think they should have",

          "I visited with my 7 year old son and expected to take a small chunk out of the day, we ended up speaking over 3 hours here. The main floor is hugely engaging with exhibits to read through, audio visual and touch/feel. As an Englishman I loved the 1966 Geoff Hurst crime scene",
          "Very interactive experience, I enjoyed it very much even if I am not a fan of German football per say. It was fun! The 3D cinema could at least have some English subtitles - it was very interesting, but being only in German, for non-German speakers is just looking at the images.",

          "This is an excellent interactive museum. You don't need to be German to appreciate it as it appeals to football supporters of all ages of any nationality. The exhibits are all very well organized as you move in time from Germany's first World Cup win in 1954 to their trophy",

          "Visited the place with my 2 sons. Place is impressive with a lot of high tech presentations. On the negative site is that most of the exhibits/video presentations are only in German. Entrance Fee is also relatively expensive.",
          "This is where Football-Germany celebrates its successful past of international football. The main focus here is on the national team\u2019s glory, especially the recent victories of the men\u2019s and the women\u2019s team. But there is also a section dedicated to the history of club",
          "I visited here with my 9 year old son; a Football fan We had a great time. A lot of the detail is based on Germany and their football history, but it was informative and interesting. All displays have both German and English text The size of the museum is deceptive; it\u2019s much",
          "Okay I have to say it...I do not like football...but my partner is mad for it and so we had to come to this museum when we were in the area. I obviously had low expectations and at first it didn't look that great to me from the outside but this museum is huuuge and well worth",

          "It was not that impressive for me. There's only the mention of the times Germany won the championship. It would have been better if this museum also showcased all the matches played by Germany unmindful of the matches it won",
          "Interesting place. More suited to kids / families than groups of adults, but at \u20ac15 not bad at all.",

          "Awesome place for football fans! You can easily spend the whole day here, roaming around trophies, paraphernalia, pictures and videos about German national team and football.

          "Good for someone who likes football",
          "Very interesting exhibition, however squized in a relatively small space. Multimedia in the main hall were amazing. Downsize is that the place is very commercial. I understand that each needs a support of a big player at the market, but this support at the museum could be less conspicuous.",
          "Very interesting museum, it all about football but you get to see different sides of the game. There are replicas of different trophies, fan zone etc.. and you get to see the German national team buss.",

          "Really great place for any football fan.",
          "This museum includes everything what you would expect (memorabilia, movies, historic photographs of Germany football). And then there is more including trophy, 3D movie with Bastian Schweinsteiger and friends as a star, a German football team official bus and nice futsal field",

        "wiki": "Dortmund (, also UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u0254\u0281tm\u028ant] (listen); Westphalian Low German: D\u00fc\u00f6rpm [\u02c8dy\u02d0\u0153\u0250\u032fpm\u0329]; Latin: Tremonia) is with a population of 603,609 inhabitants as of 2020, the third-largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany's eighth-largest city. It is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of Westphalia. On the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine), it lies in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg.\nFounded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 230% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.The region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Unionand is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries and logistics. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction, especially for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as Europe (Benelux countries), and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions, including the Technical University of Dortmund and Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, International School of Management and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities with over 49,000 students, many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. The city is known as Westphalia's \"green metropolis\". Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past.\nDortmund is home to Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund, a successful club in German football.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Sigiburg was a Saxon hillfort in the South of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by Westphalian Saxons. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni \u2013 In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the \"Ecclesiastical council\" and in 1016 the\"Imperial diet\" meets in Dortmund.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===\n\nAfter it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold's Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court (German: Freistuhl) was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the Femelinde. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - Stadtgymnasium Dortmund. The 1661 earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.\n\n\n=== 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n\nWith the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\nDuring the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch - a right military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. Radical workers formed a Red Army who fought the freikorps units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nUnder Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients for euthanasia at the Hadamar mental hospital as part of the Action T4 (an additional 229 children were killed in the \"Children's Specialist Department\", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941).\nBombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenh\u00fctte AG, the \"Hoesch-Benzin GmbH\" synthetic oil plant, and the Zeche Hansa. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped through Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\n\nPost-war, most of the ancient buildings were not restored, and large parts of the city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict H\u00f6rde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nDortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are 87 km (54 mi) long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten kreisangeh\u00f6rig (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4 million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, L\u00fcnen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills in the south of the city to the Sauerland.\nThe Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund 254.3 m (834 ft). There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at 48.9 m (160 ft).\nThe Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called Stadtbezirke), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, H\u00f6rde, Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each  Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n\nStadtzentrum (City centre)\nHafenviertel (Harbour Quarter)\nNordmarkt\nBorsigplatz\nKaiserviertel\nKronenviertel\nKreuzviertel\nKlinikviertel (Clinical Quarter)\nSaarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\nUnionviertel\nGartenstadt\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately 9 to 10 \u00b0C (48 to 50 \u00b0F), the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately 800 mm (31 in). Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as Ostflucht (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical \"loss\" of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.\nAs of 2012, Dortmund had a population of 571,403 of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has large Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 2014 the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (49.9%) and Catholicism (27.4% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4 - I.N. Ag\u00edon Apost\u00f3lon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of \"guest workers\". Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 84,944 community members.\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, H\u00f6rde and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s. Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - German Evangelical Church Assembly.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Ullrich Sierau with variable majorities between SPD, CDU and Alliance '90/The Greens\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\n\nDortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\nDortmund is often called the Herzkammer der SPD (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Hen\u00dfler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): Ullrich Sierau (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nDortmund is twinned with:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.\n\n\n=== Urban districts ===\nUnlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.\n\n\n==== Kreuzviertel ====\n\nThe Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer and players of Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42 km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the Westfalenh\u00fctte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n\n\n==== Kaiserviertel ====\n\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n\n==== Unionviertel ====\n\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.\n\n\n==== H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix ====\n\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L\u00fcnen, Unna und Schwerte. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost \u20ac;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east\u2013west and 320 meters wide in north\u2013south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\nZalando\nHSBC Trinkaus\nGerman Handball Association\nHandball-Bundesliga (HBL)\nAcademy of the German public Bank\nMircosonicThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.\nThe River Emscher flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public water board Emschergenossenschaft. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by the year 2020.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nReinoldikirche, a Protestant church (built in 1233\u20131450)\nPetrikirche, a now Protestant church (start of construction 1322).

The Ruhrschnellweg follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the Ruhr Area. It crosses the Dutch-German border as a continuation of the Dutch A67 and crosses the Rhine, leads through the Ruhr valley toward Bochum, becoming B 1 (Bundesstra\u00dfe 1) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A 44 near Holzwickede. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to Der Spiegel, it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes A1 and A2, which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the Kamener Kreuz interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn A45 to the west these form the Dortmund Beltway (Dortmunder Autobahnring).\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.

Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a Bike freeway called the Radschnellweg Ruhr (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\nThe central train station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (Dortmund Main Station).

The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last trams on the surface.A number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system. Night buses replace Stadtbahn services between 1:30 am and 7:30 am on weekends and public holidays. The central junction for the night bus service is Reinoldikirche in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.\nThe H-Bahn at Dortmund University of Technology is a hanging monorail built specifically to shuttle passengers between the university's two campuses, which are now also flanked by research laboratories and other high-tech corporations and startups. A nearly identical monorail system transfers passengers at D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nDortmund Airport is a medium-sized, but fast growing airport 13 km (8.1 mi) east of the city centre at the city limit to Holzwickede.

          "This is a well-preserved colliery, essentially the 1950s or 1960s state of an 1890s building. I have previously visited some much older ones and some more recent collieries, but this was genuinely more interesting. There were the \"old-school\" touches such as marble insulators",
          "This museum is a must-see attraction when visiting Dortmund. Most of the buildings of the colliery were built in solid brickwork and are an impressive example of the industrialization of the early 1900s. One of the highlights is the central engine house built in iron framework",
          "A part of Germanies history wonderfully preserved at this Location. Also a wonderful spot for a wedding ceremony!",
          "Great place to see the remnants of coal mining in Germany. Today there is only open-pit mining for lignite. Mining operations below ground became much too expensive and so this industry along with its distinctive towers (pit-head frames) became redundant. Some are turned into",
          "For all the English reading folk out there, just skip the 1st building, it's all German. And not a lot to just look at. The 2nd building we went into was the centre one and all if it's displays had English. The tower that you can climb also has English displays. It's very",

          "Besides the brilliant state that Zeche Zollern presents itself in, it is also surprisingly cheap to access and has a lot to offer. Exhibitions, architecture, educational stuff and a lot of local history. Unfortunately, we had only two hours to spare, but I am sure you can easily",
          "Old refurbished mine with lots of static displays to spend an hour or two looking at. Kids would be bored in an hour I guess, and very little in English, but hey it's not England. I loved it. Nice restaurant as well, says open into the evening.",
          "If you love industrial art, like I do, this really is the place to be. It is a great experience to walk around in the various buildings and to see the exhibitions. Interestingly, one of the buildings was designed in art deco style. The volunteers are very friendly and take the",
          "We are lucky to have the opportunity to get a feeling for how life was like for steel workers, some of Germany\u00b4s heroes in the \"Economic Miricle\". The steelworks is well explained on various boards on the site and the staff are very helpful. Good brochures are available which",

          "It was a bit hard to get to - had to take the U bahn and then a bus, but the place was very impressive. The facilities were well built and they showed the glory of the industry era. Many of stations were interactions so I'm sure kids would enjoy them. Most of the exhibits were",

It is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of Westphalia. On the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine), it lies in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg.\nFounded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 230% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.The region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Unionand is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries and logistics. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction, especially for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as Europe (Benelux countries), and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions, including the Technical University of Dortmund and Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, International School of Management and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities with over 49,000 students, many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. The city is known as Westphalia's \"green metropolis\". Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past.\nDortmund is home to Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund, a successful club in German football.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Sigiburg was a Saxon hillfort in the South of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by Westphalian Saxons. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni \u2013 In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the \"Ecclesiastical council\" and in 1016 the\"Imperial diet\" meets in Dortmund.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===\n\nAfter it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold's Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court (German: Freistuhl) was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the Femelinde. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - Stadtgymnasium Dortmund. The 1661 earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.\n\n\n=== 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n\nWith the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\nDuring the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch - a right military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. Radical workers formed a Red Army who fought the freikorps units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nUnder Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients for euthanasia at the Hadamar mental hospital as part of the Action T4 (an additional 229 children were killed in the \"Children's Specialist Department\", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941).\nBombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenh\u00fctte AG, the \"Hoesch-Benzin GmbH\" synthetic oil plant, and the Zeche Hansa. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped through Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\n\nPost-war, most of the ancient buildings were not restored, and large parts of the city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict H\u00f6rde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nDortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are 87 km (54 mi) long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten kreisangeh\u00f6rig (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4 million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, L\u00fcnen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills in the south of the city to the Sauerland.\nThe Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund 254.3 m (834 ft). There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at 48.9 m (160 ft).\nThe Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called Stadtbezirke), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, H\u00f6rde, Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each  Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n\nStadtzentrum (City centre)\nHafenviertel (Harbour Quarter)\nNordmarkt\nBorsigplatz\nKaiserviertel\nKronenviertel\nKreuzviertel\nKlinikviertel (Clinical Quarter)\nSaarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\nUnionviertel\nGartenstadt\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately 9 to 10 \u00b0C (48 to 50 \u00b0F), the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately 800 mm (31 in). Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as Ostflucht (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical \"loss\" of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.\nAs of 2012, Dortmund had a population of 571,403 of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has large Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 2014 the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (49.9%) and Catholicism (27.4% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4 - I.N. Ag\u00edon Apost\u00f3lon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of \"guest workers\". Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 84,944 community members.\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, H\u00f6rde and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s. Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - German Evangelical Church Assembly.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Ullrich Sierau with variable majorities between SPD, CDU and Alliance '90/The Greens\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\n\nDortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\nDortmund is often called the Herzkammer der SPD (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Hen\u00dfler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): Ullrich Sierau (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nDortmund is twinned with:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.\n\n\n=== Urban districts ===\nUnlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.\n\n\n==== Kreuzviertel ====\n\nThe Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer and players of Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42 km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the Westfalenh\u00fctte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n\n\n==== Kaiserviertel ====\n\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n\n==== Unionviertel ====\n\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.\n\n\n==== H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix ====\n\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L\u00fcnen, Unna und Schwerte. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost \u20ac;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east\u2013west and 320 meters wide in north\u2013south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\nZalando\nHSBC Trinkaus\nGerman Handball Association\nHandball-Bundesliga (HBL)\nAcademy of the German public Bank\nMircosonicThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.\nThe River Emscher flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public water board Emschergenossenschaft. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by the year 2020.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nReinoldikirche, a Protestant church (built in 1233\u20131450)\nPetrikirche, a now Protestant church (start of construction 1322). It is famous for the huge carved altar (known as \"Golden Miracle of Dortmund\"), from 1521. It consists of 633 gilt carved oak figures depicting 30 scenes about Easter.\nMarienkirche, a now Protestant church originally built in 1170\u20131200 but rebuilt after World War II. The altar is from 1420.\nPropsteikirche, Monastery of the Dominican Order in the city center (built in 1331\u20131353)\nSt. Georg, Aplerbeck, the only Romasque cross basilica of Dortmund\nGro\u00dfe Kirche Aplerbeck, a Gothic revival church\nSt. Peter in Syburg suburb, the oldest church building in the city limits\nHeilig-Kreuz-Kirche, a Protestant church (start of construction 1911)\nSt.-Margareta Chapel, a Protestant chapel built in 1348\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Castles ===\nHaus Bodelschwingh (13th century), a moated castle\nHaus Dellwig (13th century), a moated castle partly rebuilt in the 17th century. The fa\u00e7ade and the steep tower, and two half-timbered buildings, are original.\nHaus Rodenberg (13th century), a moated castle\nAltes Stadthaus, built in 1899 by Friedrich Kullrich\nRomberg Park Gatehouse (17th century), once a gatehouse to a moated castle. Now it houses an art gallery.\nHusen Castle, the tower house of a former castle, in the borough of Syburg.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrial buildings ===\nThe most industrial building in Dortmund are part of the Industrial Heritage Trail (German: Route der Industriekultur). The trail links tourist attractions related to the industrial heritage in the whole Ruhr area in Germany.

The Ruhrschnellweg follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the Ruhr Area. It crosses the Dutch-German border as a continuation of the Dutch A67 and crosses the Rhine, leads through the Ruhr valley toward Bochum, becoming B 1 (Bundesstra\u00dfe 1) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A 44 near Holzwickede. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to Der Spiegel, it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes A1 and A2, which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the Kamener Kreuz interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn A45 to the west these form the Dortmund Beltway (Dortmunder Autobahnring).\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.

Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a Bike freeway called the Radschnellweg Ruhr (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\nThe central train station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany.

The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last trams on the surface.A number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system. Night buses replace Stadtbahn services between 1:30 am and 7:30 am on weekends and public holidays.

          "It is in the must see list of Dortmund, but it isn't real castle, just some of the ruins with nice park and great sculpture. Can you skip this place - no, because the view from the mountain is outstanding.",

        "wiki": "Dortmund (, also UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u0254\u0281tm\u028ant] (listen); Westphalian Low German: D\u00fc\u00f6rpm [\u02c8dy\u02d0\u0153\u0250\u032fpm\u0329]; Latin: Tremonia) is with a population of 603,609 inhabitants as of 2020, the third-largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany's eighth-largest city. It is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of Westphalia. On the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine), it lies in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg.\nFounded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 230% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.The region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Unionand is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries and logistics. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction, especially for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as Europe (Benelux countries), and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions, including the Technical University of Dortmund and Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, International School of Management and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities with over 49,000 students, many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. The city is known as Westphalia's \"green metropolis\". Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past.\nDortmund is home to Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund, a successful club in German football.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Sigiburg was a Saxon hillfort in the South of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by Westphalian Saxons. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni \u2013 In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the \"Ecclesiastical council\" and in 1016 the\"Imperial diet\" meets in Dortmund.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===\n\nAfter it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold's Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court (German: Freistuhl) was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the Femelinde. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - Stadtgymnasium Dortmund. The 1661 earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.\n\n\n=== 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n\nWith the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\nDuring the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch - a right military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. Radical workers formed a Red Army who fought the freikorps units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nUnder Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients for euthanasia at the Hadamar mental hospital as part of the Action T4 (an additional 229 children were killed in the \"Children's Specialist Department\", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941).\nBombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenh\u00fctte AG, the \"Hoesch-Benzin GmbH\" synthetic oil plant, and the Zeche Hansa. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped through Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\n\nPost-war, most of the ancient buildings were not restored, and large parts of the city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict H\u00f6rde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nDortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are 87 km (54 mi) long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten kreisangeh\u00f6rig (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4 million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, L\u00fcnen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills in the south of the city to the Sauerland.\nThe Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund 254.3 m (834 ft). There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at 48.9 m (160 ft).\nThe Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called Stadtbezirke), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, H\u00f6rde, Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each  Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n\nStadtzentrum (City centre)\nHafenviertel (Harbour Quarter)\nNordmarkt\nBorsigplatz\nKaiserviertel\nKronenviertel\nKreuzviertel\nKlinikviertel (Clinical Quarter)\nSaarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\nUnionviertel\nGartenstadt\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately 9 to 10 \u00b0C (48 to 50 \u00b0F), the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately 800 mm (31 in). Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as Ostflucht (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical \"loss\" of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.\nAs of 2012, Dortmund had a population of 571,403 of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has large Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 2014 the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (49.9%) and Catholicism (27.4% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4 - I.N. Ag\u00edon Apost\u00f3lon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of \"guest workers\". Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 84,944 community members.\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, H\u00f6rde and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s. Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - German Evangelical Church Assembly.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Ullrich Sierau with variable majorities between SPD, CDU and Alliance '90/The Greens\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\n\nDortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\nDortmund is often called the Herzkammer der SPD (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Hen\u00dfler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): Ullrich Sierau (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nDortmund is twinned with:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.\n\n\n=== Urban districts ===\nUnlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.\n\n\n==== Kreuzviertel ====\n\nThe Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer and players of Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42 km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the Westfalenh\u00fctte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n\n\n==== Kaiserviertel ====\n\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n\n==== Unionviertel ====\n\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.\n\n\n==== H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix ====\n\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L\u00fcnen, Unna und Schwerte. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost \u20ac;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east\u2013west and 320 meters wide in north\u2013south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\nZalando\nHSBC Trinkaus\nGerman Handball Association\nHandball-Bundesliga (HBL)\nAcademy of the German public Bank\nMircosonicThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.\nThe River Emscher flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public water board Emschergenossenschaft. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by the year 2020.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nReinoldikirche, a Protestant church (built in 1233\u20131450)\nPetrikirche, a now Protestant church (start of construction 1322). It is famous for the huge carved altar (known as \"Golden Miracle of Dortmund\"), from 1521. It consists of 633 gilt carved oak figures depicting 30 scenes about Easter.\nMarienkirche, a now Protestant church originally built in 1170\u20131200 but rebuilt after World War II. The altar is from 1420.\nPropsteikirche, Monastery of the Dominican Order in the city center (built in 1331\u20131353)\nSt. Georg, Aplerbeck, the only Romasque cross basilica of Dortmund\nGro\u00dfe Kirche Aplerbeck, a Gothic revival church\nSt. Peter in Syburg suburb, the oldest church building in the city limits\nHeilig-Kreuz-Kirche, a Protestant church (start of construction 1911)\nSt.-Margareta Chapel, a Protestant chapel built in 1348\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Castles ===\nHaus Bodelschwingh (13th century), a moated castle\nHaus Dellwig (13th century), a moated castle partly rebuilt in the 17th century. The fa\u00e7ade and the steep tower, and two half-timbered buildings, are original.\nHaus Rodenberg (13th century), a moated castle\nAltes Stadthaus, built in 1899 by Friedrich Kullrich\nRomberg Park Gatehouse (17th century), once a gatehouse to a moated castle. Now it houses an art gallery.\nHusen Castle, the tower house of a former castle, in the borough of Syburg.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrial buildings ===\nThe most industrial building in Dortmund are part of the Industrial Heritage Trail (German: Route der Industriekultur). The trail links tourist attractions related to the industrial heritage in the whole Ruhr area in Germany. It is a part of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.\n\nU-Tower, former Dortmunder Union brewery, now a museum\nZollern II/IV Colliery, now part of the Westphalian Industrial Museum and an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH)\nHansa Coking Plant\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cultural buildings ===\nKonzerthaus Dortmund\nOpernhaus Dortmund, opera house built in 1966 on the site of the old synagogue which was destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.\nThe major art museums include the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte and the more recent Museum Ostwall.\nDASA, Germany Occupational Health and Safety Exhibition (German: Deutsche Arbeitsschutzausstellung)\nBrewery Museum Dortmund\nMuseum of Art and Cultural History\nGerman Football Museum\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other important buildings ===\nFlorianturm, (television tower Florian)\nWestfalenstadion: Football ground of Borussia Dortmund, licensed until 2021 under the name Signal Iduna Park\nClose to Westfalenstadion are the Westfalenhallen, a large convention centre, the site of several major conventions, trade fairs, ice-skating competitions, concerts and other major events since the 1950s.\nSteinwache memorial\n\n\n=== High-rise structures ===\nDortmund tallest structure is the Florianturm telecommunication tower at 266 m or 873 ft. Other tall buildings are the churches around the city centre. A selection of the tallest office buildings in Dortmund is listed below.\n\nRWE Tower (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestnetz Hochhaus Dortmund (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestfalentower (88 metre-high skyscraper)\nHarenberg City-Center (86 metre-high skyscraper)\nSparkassen-Hochhaus (70 metre-high skyscraper)\nIWO-Hochhaus(70 metre-high skyscraper)\nEllipson (66 metre-high skyscraper)\nVolkswohl Bund Hochhaus (60 metre-high skyscraper)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\n\nDortmund also serves as a major European and German crossroads for the Autobahnsystem. The Ruhrschnellweg follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the Ruhr Area. It crosses the Dutch-German border as a continuation of the Dutch A67 and crosses the Rhine, leads through the Ruhr valley toward Bochum, becoming B 1 (Bundesstra\u00dfe 1) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A 44 near Holzwickede. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to Der Spiegel, it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes A1 and A2, which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the Kamener Kreuz interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn A45 to the west these form the Dortmund Beltway (Dortmunder Autobahnring).\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a Bike freeway called the Radschnellweg Ruhr (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\nThe central train station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Dortmund with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive Stadtbahn and bus system. The Stadtbahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of L\u00fcnen in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last trams on the surface.A number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system. Night buses replace Stadtbahn services between 1:30 am and 7:30 am on weekends and public holidays. The central junction for the night bus service is Reinoldikirche in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.\nThe H-Bahn at Dortmund University of Technology is a hanging monorail built specifically to shuttle passengers between the university's two campuses, which are now also flanked by research laboratories and other high-tech corporations and startups. A nearly identical monorail system transfers passengers at D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nDortmund Airport is a medium-sized, but fast growing airport 13 km (8.1 mi) east of the city centre at the city limit to Holzwickede. The airport serves the area of the Ruhrgebiet, Sauerland, Westphalia and parts of the Netherlands and features flights to Munich, London, Vienna, Porto and a lot of eastern European city and leisure destinations. The airport is served by an express bus to Dortmund main station, a shuttle bus to the nearby railway station Holzwickede/Dortmund Flughafen, a bus to the city's metro line U47, as well as a bus to the city of Unna.\nIn 2019, the airport served 2,719,563 passengers mainly used for low-cost and leisure charter flights. The closest intercontinental airport is D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\nDortmund Harbour (Hafen) is the largest canal harbour in Europe and the 11th fluvial harbour in Germany.\n\nTransport in Dortmund\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDortmund has adapted since the collapse of its century long steel, coal and beer industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, biomedical technology, micro systems technology, engineering, tourism, finance, education, services and is thus one of the most dynamic new-economy cities in Germany. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow.Hundreds of SMEs are still based in and around Dortmund (often termed Mittelstand). Dortmund is also home to a number of medium-sized information technology companies, many linked to the local university TU Dortmund at the first technology center in Germany named \"Technologiepark Dortmund\" opened in the 1980s. With around 280 companies like Boehringer Ingelheim and Verizon Communications and more than 8,500 employees, TechnologiePark Dortmund is one of the most successful technology parks in Europe. The city works closely with research institutes, private universities, and companies to collaborate on the commercialisation of science initiatives. Furthermore, 680 IT and software companies with 12,000 employees are based in Dortmund, making the city one of Germany's biggest software locations. Two of the top 10 IT service provider in Germany are based in Dortmund -  adesso SE and Materna Group.Dortmund is home to many insurance companies e.g. Signal Iduna, Continentale Krankenversicherung, Bundesinnungskrankenkasse Gesundheit (BIG direkt) and Volkswohl Bund. In recent years a service sector and high-tech industry have grown up. Some of its most prominent companies of these sectors include Amprion and RWE-Westnetz (Electricity), Rhenus Logistics (Logistics), Wilo, KHS GmbH, Elmos Semiconductor, ABP Induction Systems, Nordwest Handel AG \u2013 all of whom have their headquarters here. Companies with operations in or around Dortmund include Zalando, Daimler AG: EvoBus, RapidMiner, Gap Inc. and ThyssenKrupp.\nDortmund is also the headquarter of Century Media Records, a heavy metal record label with offices in the United States and London. In August 2015, Century Media was acquired by Sony Music for US$17 million.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism in Dortmund is a fast-growing economic factor every year: new overnight records can be announced, new hotels open and new visitor magnets are added. Starting in the mid-1990s, Dortmund, formerly an industrial centre, saw rapid development that expanded its cultural and tourism possibilities, and transformed it into a newly vibrant city. An important strategic step was the start of construction the new Konzerthaus Dortmund, the reuse of vacant old industrial buildings like the Zollern II/IV Colliery, Kokerei Hansa, Dortmund U-Tower and the strategic reorientation of the Dortmund Christmas market with over 300 stalls packed around a gigantic Christmas tree creation that stands 45 metres tall \u2013 reputed to be the biggest in the world. A new Tourist Information center right next to the U-Tower, gives visitors a quick overview of the tourist attractions in the City and Ruhr Area. Today Dortmund is with more than 1.450.528 (2017) overnight stays one of the most popular destinations in North Rhine-Westphalia.The majority of tourists are domestic visitors, coming from Germany. International travellers arrive from the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland. Dortmund also draws business tourism, having been equipped with facilities like WILO, Amprion next to Westfalenhallen and football tourism with Fans of Borussia Dortmund. The top 5 most visited attractions were the Christmas market, with more than three and a half million visitors, Signal Iduna Park, Deutsches Fu\u00dfballmuseum, Dortmund U-Tower, Zollern II/IV Colliery and Westfalenpark.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nThe Westenhellweg is a popular shopping destination and with nearly 13,000 visitors per hour it was Germany's most frequented shopping street in 2013. During the Middle Ages, Dortmund was the only free imperial city in Westphalia, having already been regarded as an important centre of trade. Today some of the most reputed shops, department stores have stores here. It is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by the Reinoldikirche in the east and U-Tower in the west. The Westenhellweg has one of the highest rents for retail and office space in North Rhine-Westphalia. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as H&M, Saturn, Esprit, Zara or NewYorker. In 2009 a new shopping mall named Thier-Galerie opened, with nearly 100 stores and chains, including; Armani, Adidas, Diesel and Hollister.\nThree more shopping malls occupy the Thier-Galerie; Galeria Kaufhof and Karstadt, as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from Peek & Cloppenburg and C&A. During the month before Christmas, the extended pedestrian-only zone is host to Dortmund Christmas Market, one of the largest and oldest Christmas markets in Germany. With more than 3.5 million visitors and 300 stalls around a gigantic Christmas tree that stands 45 metres tall, it is one of the most visited and popular market in the world.In close proximity to the Dortmund concert hall lies the Br\u00fcckstra\u00dfenviertel  - a quarter hub especially for young people. The \"Rue de Pommes Frites\", which is what the Dortmund citizens have called the Br\u00fcckstra\u00dfe, has turned into a modern shopping promenade, geared towards a younger market.\nFor a long time, the Kampstra\u00dfe had a shadowy existence as a parallel street to the Westenhellweg and Ostenhellweg, but it has become a grand boulevard containing specialist stores. Right next to the Kampstra\u00dfe is the Kleppingstra\u00dfe  \u2013 a shopping street with a high concentration of gastronomy and expensive, prestigious shops like van Laack, Lindner Fashion, Marc Cain. It is located between the Ostenhellweg and Neutor to Wallring.\n\n\n=== Port and Logistic ===\n\nDortmund is one of the most important logistic hubs in Germany, more than 900 companies working in logistics, as well as nationally and internationally recognised scientific institutes. Dortmund Port which terminates the Dortmund-Ems Canal connecting Dortmund to the North Sea is the biggest European canal port with 10 docks and a pier length of 11 km. The variety of different activities taking place at the Fraunhofer Institute Material Flow and Logistics (Fraunhofer Society) has, over the past few years, led to a bundling of skills in the areas of logistics and digitalisation in the city. Industry-based initiatives and pilot projects, such as the Hybrid Services in Logistics innovation lab, the efficiency cluster LogistikRuhr, Industrial Data Space, the Dortmund Mittelstand 4.0 Centre of Excellence, and the enterprise labs.

        "wiki": "The Museum Ostwall  (known as Museum am Ostwall until 2010) is a museum of modern and contemporary art in Dortmund, Germany.  It was founded in the late 1940s, and has been located in the Dortmund U-Tower since 2010. The collection includes paintings, sculptures, objects and photographs from the 20th century, plus over 2,500 graphics, spanning Expressionism through classic modern art to the present day.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum's original location, from 1947 until 2009, was a building on the Ostwall (a road in central Dortmund following the old city walls), including a small sculpture garden.  The previous building on the site had been the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte (MKK), a municipal art collection, from 1911 until its destruction in World War II; before 1911 it housed the old Westphalia Mining Authority.A gradual rebuilding, using construction materials from the ruins of the MKK, began in the late 1940s. The first exhibition at the Museum am Ostwall was held in 1949 \u2013 making it one of Germany's first post-war museums of 20th-century art \u2013 and it continued to be expanded until 1956. The MKK, meanwhile, was provisionally rehomed in Cappenberg Castle until its return to Dortmund in 1983.In June 2009 the original building closed its doors, and the museum began relocating into the U-Tower, where it reopened under the new, shortened name Museum Ostwall in October 2010.  The seven-storey tower, a former Dortmund Union brewery and warehouse, played a key role in the Ruhr Area's rebranding as \"Culture Capital of Europe 2010\" (RUHR.2010 \u2013 Kulturhauptstadt Europas). The museum reopened with the special exhibition \"The Museum as Power Station\" (Das Museum als Kraftwerk).\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe collection was initially compiled from works that the Nazis had classified as \"degenerate art\". The Gr\u00f6ppel Collection, containing around 200 paintings, sculptures and graphics, was acquired in 1957 and is now one of the keystones of the museum.At the heart of the collection are works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Otto Mueller, Emil Nolde and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, who founded the movement Die Br\u00fccke in Dresden in 1905. The avant-garde Blaue Reiter group, started in 1912, is represented here by the works of Wassily Kandinsky, Franz Marc, August Macke and Alexej von Jawlensky. The collection of Jawlensky is the second-largest in Germany, after that of the Museum Wiesbaden.\nThe museum also owns 26 graphics by Pablo Picasso from the 1940s and '50s, plus others by Joan Mir\u00f3, Marc Chagall and Salvador Dal\u00ed. The collection includes a single work each by Otto Dix, Lyonel Feininger, Alberto Giacometti, Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Oskar Schlemmer. Among the still lifes, the highlight is Christian Rohlfs.\nIn the early 1990s the museum acquired over 1,000 works from the collection of the artist Siegfried Cremer, by artists including Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Beuys, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, G\u00fcnther Uecker and Jean Tinguely, strengthening the museum's coverage of the Fluxus, ZERO and \"informal art\" movements.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n1962 saw the opening of a children's painting studio, one of the first such teaching projects in a museum. The \"Youth Art Club\" (Jugendkunstclub) gives youngsters the chance to visit exhibitions, meet artists, and produce their own works in the museum's studio. During the school holidays it also offers art workshops. Educational projects will continue in the new location.The exhibition is changed twice a year, in order to present as many works as possible to the public.\nThe museum's old rooms provided a venue for touring concerts and matinees. The museum also publishes art books and catalogues, partly funded by the non-profit society \"Friends of the Museum am Ostwall\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page on the city of Dortmund's website (in German)",

Since 1928 a prison next to the station was in use for detention of suspects. In 1933 the Gestapo took over the prison and imprisoned and tortured many opponents of the Nazi regime. It soon had a reputation as Die H\u00f6lle von Westdeutschland (\"The hell of western Germany\"). Between 1933 and 1945 more than 66,000 people were imprisoned in the Steinwache prison. In the early years of the regime the inmates were primarily members of the communist and social democratic opposition. During World War II foreign forced labourers made up the largest group of prisoners. Especially slave workers from eastern Europe were often badly treated and many of them were executed.\nIn contrast to most of Dortmund's city center, the Steinwache wasn't heavily damaged during the war. The conversion of the former prison into a memorial site began in the 1980s. Since 1992 it is the permanent location of the exhibition Widerstand und Verfolgung in Dortmund 1933\u20131945 (\"Resistance and Persecution in Dortmund 1933-1945\"), which demonstrates the persecution under National Socialism with many photographs, short texts and sometimes with reports from contemporary witnesses.\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1] Website of the memorial, City of Dortmund",

        "wiki": "Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund [bo\u02c8\u0281\u028asi\u032fa\u02d0 \u02c8d\u0254\u0250\u032ftm\u028ant], BVB, or simply Dortmund, is a German professional sports club based in Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia. It is best known for its men's professional football team, which plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. The club have won eight league championships, four DFB-Pokals, one UEFA Champions League, one Intercontinental Cup, and one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.\nFounded in 1909 by eighteen football players from Dortmund, the football team is part of a large membership-based sports club with more than 145,000 members, making Borussia Dortmund the second largest sports club by membership in Germany. Since 1974, Dortmund have played their home games at Westfalenstadion; the stadium is the largest in Germany, and Dortmund has the highest average attendance of any association football club in the world.Borussia Dortmund's colours are black and yellow, giving the club its nickname die Schwarzgelben. The club has active departments in other sports, namely in women's handball, and hold a long-standing rivalry with Ruhr neighbours Schalke 04, known as the Revierderby. They also compete in Der Klassiker with fellow German club, Bayern Munich.\nIn terms of Deloitte's annual Football Money League, Dortmund was ranked as the second richest sports club in Germany, and the 12th richest football team in the world. Moreover, under the directorship of Michael Zorc in the 2010s, Dortmund have cultivated a reputation for spotting and developing young talent, and have remained focused on developing a youth system. They have also received plaudits for generally adhering to an attacking footballing philosophy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and early years ===\n\nThe club was founded on 19 December 1909 by a group of young men unhappy with the Catholic church-sponsored Trinity Youth, where they played football under the stern and unsympathetic eye of the local parish priest. The priest, Father Dewald was blocked at the door when he tried to break up the organising meeting being held in a room of the local pub, Zum Wildsch\u00fctz. The founders were Franz and Paul Braun, Henry Cleve, Hans Debest, Paul Dziendzielle, Franz, Julius and Wilhelm Jacobi, Hans Kahn, Gustav M\u00fcller, Franz Risse, Fritz Schulte, Hans Siebold, August T\u00f6nnesmann, Heinrich and Robert Unger, Fritz Weber and Franz Wendt. The name Borussia is Latin for Prussia but was taken from Borussia beer from the nearby Borussia brewery in Dortmund. The team began playing in blue and white striped shirts with a red sash, and black shorts. In 1913, they donned the black and yellow stripes so familiar today.\nOver the next decades the club enjoyed only modest success playing in local leagues. They had a brush with bankruptcy in 1929 when an attempt to boost the club's fortunes by signing some paid professional footballers failed miserably and left the team deep in debt. They survived only through the generosity of a local supporter who covered the team's shortfall out of his own pocket.\nThe 1930s saw the rise of the Third Reich, which restructured sports and football organisations throughout the nation to suit the regime's goals. Borussia's president was replaced when he refused to join the Nazi Party, and a couple of members who surreptitiously used the club's offices to produce anti-Nazi pamphlets were executed in the last days of the war. The club did have greater success in the newly established Gauliga Westfalen, but would have to wait until after World War II to make a breakthrough. It was during this time that Borussia developed its intense rivalry with Schalke 04 of suburban Gelsenkirchen, the most successful side of the era (see Revierderby). Like every other organisation in Germany, Borussia was dissolved by the Allied occupation authorities after the war in an attempt to distance the country's institutions from its so-recent Nazi past. There was a short-lived attempt to merge the club with two others \u2013 Werksportgemeinschaft Hoesch and Freier Sportverein 98 \u2013 as Sportgemeinschaft Borussia von 1898, but it was as Ballspiel-Verein Borussia (BVB) that they made their first appearance in the national league final in 1949, where they lost 2\u20133 to VfR Mannheim.\n\n\n=== First national titles ===\n\nBetween 1946 and 1963, Borussia featured in the Oberliga West, a first division league which dominated German football through the late 1950s. In 1949, Borussia reached the final in Stuttgart against VfR Mannheim, which they lost 2\u20133 after extra time. The club claimed its first national title in 1956 with a 4\u20132 win against Karlsruher SC. One year later, Borussia defeated Hamburger SV 4\u20131 to win their second national title. After this coup, the three Alfredos (Alfred Prei\u00dfler, Alfred Kelbassa and Alfred Niepieklo) were legends in Dortmund. In 1963, Borussia won the last edition of the German Football Championship (before the introduction of the new Bundesliga) to secure their third national title.\n\n\n=== Bundesliga debut ===\nIn 1962, the DFB met in Dortmund and voted to establish a professional football league in Germany, to begin play in August 1963 as the Bundesliga. Borussia Dortmund earned its place among the first sixteen clubs to play in the league by winning the last pre-Bundesliga national championship. Runners-up 1. FC K\u00f6ln also earned an automatic berth. Dortmund's Friedhelm Konietzka scored the first-ever Bundesliga goal a minute into the match, which they would eventually lose 2\u20133 to Werder Bremen.\nIn 1965, Dortmund captured its first DFB-Pokal. In 1966, Dortmund won the European Cup Winners' Cup 2\u20131 against Liverpool in extra time, with the goals coming from Sigfried Held and Reinhard Libuda. In the same year, however, the team surrendered a commanding position atop the Bundesliga by losing four of their last five league games and finishing second, three points behind champions 1860 M\u00fcnchen. Ironically, much of 1860 M\u00fcnchen's success came on the strength of the play of Konietzka, recently transferred from Dortmund.\nThe 1970s were characterised by financial problems, relegation from the Bundesliga in 1972, and the opening of the Westfalenstadion, named after its home region Westphalia in 1974. The club earned its return to Bundesliga in 1976.\nDortmund continued to have financial problems through the 1980s. BVB avoided being relegated in 1986 by winning a third decisive playoff game against Fortuna K\u00f6ln after finishing the regular season in 16th place.  Dortmund did not enjoy any significant success again until a 4\u20131 DFB-Pokal win in 1989 against Werder Bremen. It was Horst K\u00f6ppel's first trophy as a manager. Dortmund then won the 1989 DFL-Supercup 4\u20133 against rivals Bayern Munich.\n\n\n=== Golden age \u2013 the 1990s ===\nAfter a tenth-place finish in the Bundesliga in 1991, manager Horst K\u00f6ppel was let go and manager Ottmar Hitzfeld was hired.\nIn 1992, Hitzfeld led Borussia Dortmund to a second-place finish in the Bundesliga and would have won the title had VfB Stuttgart not won their last game to become champions instead.\nAlong with a fourth-place finish in the Bundesliga, Dortmund made it to the 1993 UEFA Cup final, which they lost 6\u20131 on aggregate to Juventus. In spite of this result, Borussia walked away with DM25 million under the prize money pool system in place at the time for German sides participating in the Cup. Cash flush, Dortmund was able to sign players who later brought them numerous honours in the 1990s.\nUnder the captaincy of 1996 European Footballer of the Year Matthias Sammer, Borussia Dortmund won back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 1995 and 1996. Dortmund also won the DFL-Supercup against M\u00f6nchengladbach in 1995 and 1. FC Kaiserslautern in 1996.\nIn 1996\u201397 the team reached its first European Cup final. In a memorable 1997 UEFA Champions League Final at the Olympiastadion in Munich, Dortmund faced the holders Juventus. Karl-Heinz Riedle put Dortmund ahead, shooting under goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi from a cross by Paul Lambert. Riedle then made it two with a bullet header from a corner kick. In the second half, Alessandro Del Piero pulled one back for Juventus with a back heel. Then 20-year-old substitute and local boy Lars Ricken latched onto a through pass by Andreas M\u00f6ller. Only 16 seconds after coming on to the pitch, Ricken chipped Peruzzi in the Juventus goal from over 20 yards out with his first touch of the ball. With Zinedine Zidane unable to make an impression for Juventus against the close marking of Lambert, Dortmund lifted the trophy with a 3\u20131 victory.\nDortmund then went on to beat Brazilian club Cruzeiro 2\u20130 in the 1997 Intercontinental Cup Final to become world club champions. Borussia Dortmund were the second German club to win the Intercontinental Cup, after Bayern Munich in 1976.As defending champions Dortmund reached the Champions League semi-final in 1998. The team was missing key players from the start of the season when they played Real Madrid in the '98 semi. Sammer's career was cut short by injury and only played three first team games after the Champions League win. Lambert had left in November to return to play in Scotland. M\u00f6ller missed the first leg as did Kohler who missed both games in the tie. Real won the first leg 2\u20130 at home. Dortmund played better in the second leg but failed to take their chances. Dortmund went out 2\u20130 on aggregate.\n\n\n=== 21st century and Borussia \"goes public\" ===\n\nIn October 2000, Borussia Dortmund became the first\u2014and so far the only\u2014publicly traded club on the German stock market.In 2002, Borussia Dortmund won their third Bundesliga title. Dortmund had a remarkable run at the end of the season to overtake Bayer Leverkusen, securing the title on the final day. Manager Matthias Sammer became the first person in Borussia Dortmund history to win the Bundesliga as both a player and manager. In the same season, Borussia lost the final of the 2001\u201302 UEFA Cup to Dutch side Feyenoord.\nDortmund's fortunes then steadily declined for a number of years. Poor financial management led to a heavy debt load and the sale of their Westfalenstadion grounds. The situation was compounded by failure to advance in the 2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League, when the team was eliminated on penalties in the qualifying rounds by Club Brugge. In 2003, Bayern Munich loaned \u20ac2 million to Dortmund for several months to pay their payroll. Borussia was again driven to the brink of bankruptcy in 2005, the original \u20ac11 value of its shares having plummeted by over 80% on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. \nAt this time Hans-Joachim Watzke was appointed CEO and streamlined the club. The response to the crisis included a 20% pay cut for all players. In 2006, in order to reduce debt, the Westfalenstadion was renamed \"Signal Iduna Park\" after a local insurance company. The naming rights agreement runs until 2021.\nDortmund suffered a miserable start to the 2005\u201306 season, but rallied to finish seventh. The club failed to gain a place in the UEFA Cup via the Fair Play draw. The club's management recently indicated that the club again showed a profit; this was largely related to the sale of David Odonkor to Real Betis and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Rosick\u00fd to Arsenal.\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, Dortmund unexpectedly faced serious relegation trouble for the first time in years. Dortmund went through three coaches and appointed Thomas Doll on 13 March 2007 after dropping to just one point above the relegation zone. Christoph Metzelder also left Borussia Dortmund on a free transfer.\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Dortmund lost to many smaller Bundesliga clubs. Despite finishing 13th in the Bundesliga table, Dortmund reached the DFB-Pokal Final against Bayern Munich, where they lost 2\u20131 in extra time. The final appearance qualified Dortmund for the UEFA Cup because Bayern already qualified for the Champions League. Thomas Doll resigned on 19 May 2008 and was replaced by J\u00fcrgen Klopp.\n\n\n=== Return to prominence ===\n\nIn the 2009\u201310 season, Klopp's Dortmund improved on the season before to finish fifth in the Bundesliga to qualify for the UEFA Europa League. The team missed an opportunity to qualify for the Champions League by failing to beat eighth-place VfL Wolfsburg and 14th-place SC Freiburg in the final two matches of the campaign.\nEntering the 2010\u201311 season, Dortmund fielded a young and vibrant roster. On 4 December 2010, Borussia became Herbstmeister (\"Autumn Champion\"), an unofficial accolade going to the league leader at the winter break. They did this three matches before the break, sharing the record for having achieved this earliest with Eintracht Frankfurt (1993\u201394) and 1. FC Kaiserslautern (1997\u201398). On 30 April 2011, the club beat 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg 2\u20130 at home, while second-place Bayer Leverkusen lost, leaving Dortmund eight points clear with two games to play. This championship equalled the seven national titles held by rivals Schalke 04, and guaranteed a spot in the 2011\u201312 Champions League group stages.One year later, Dortmund made a successful defence of its Bundesliga title with a win over Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, again on the 32nd match day. By the 34th and final match day, Dortmund set a new record with the most points\u201481\u2014ever gained by a club in one Bundesliga season. This was surpassed the following season by Bayern Munich's 91 points. The club's eighth championship places it third in total national titles, and players will now wear two stars over their uniform crest in recognition of the team's five Bundesliga titles. Notable names from the winning roster include Lucas Barrios, Mario G\u00f6tze, Neven Suboti\u0107, Mats Hummels, Robert Lewandowski, Shinji Kagawa, \u0141ukasz Piszczek, Jakub B\u0142aszczykowski, Kevin Gro\u00dfkreutz, Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 and \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan. The club capped its successful 2011\u201312 season by winning the double for the first time by beating Bayern 5\u20132 in the final of the DFB-Pokal. Borussia Dortmund are one of four German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double, along with Bayern Munich, 1. FC K\u00f6ln and Werder Bremen. The club was voted Team of the Year 2011 at the annual Sportler des Jahres (German Sports Personality of the Year) awards.\nBorussia Dortmund ended the 2012\u201313 season in second place in the Bundesliga. Dortmund played in their second UEFA Champions League Final against Bayern Munich in the first ever all-German club final at Wembley Stadium on 25 May 2013, which they lost 2\u20131.In the 2013\u201314 season, Borussia Dortmund won the 2013 DFL-Supercup 4\u20132 against rivals Bayern Munich. The 2013\u201314 season started with a five-game winning streak for Dortmund, their best start to a season. Despite such a promising start, however, their season was hampered by injuries to several key players, seeing them stoop as low as fourth place in the table, and with a depleted squad could go only as far as the quarter-finals of the Champions League, losing 3\u20132 on aggregate to Real Madrid. Nevertheless, Dortmund managed to end their season on a high note by finishing second in the Bundesliga and reaching the 2014 DFB-Pokal Final, losing 0\u20132 to Bayern in extra time. They then began their 2014\u201315 season by defeating Bayern in the 2014 DFL-Supercup 2\u20130. However, this victory would not be enough to inspire the squad to a solid performance at the start of the ensuing season, with Dortmund recording various results such as a 0\u20131 loss to Hamburger SV and two 2\u20132 draws against VfB Stuttgart and Bundesliga newcomers Paderborn 07. During the winter, Dortmund fell to the bottom of the table on multiple occasions, but managed to escape the relegation zone after four consecutive wins in February. On 15 April 2015, J\u00fcrgen Klopp announced that after seven years, he would be leaving Dortmund. Four days later, Dortmund announced that Thomas Tuchel would replace Klopp at the end of the season. Klopp's final season, however, ended on high note, rising and finishing seventh after facing relegation, gaining a DFB-Pokal final with VfL Wolfsburg and qualifying for the 2015\u201316 Europa League.\n\n\n=== Post-Klopp Era ===\nIn the 2015\u201316 season, Dortmund started off on a high, winning 4\u20130 against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach on the opening day, followed by five-straight wins which took them to the top of the Bundesliga. After the eighth matchday, they were surpassed by Bayern Munich following an unlucky draw with 1899 Hoffenheim. Dortmund kept their performances up, winning 24 out of 34 league games and becoming the best Bundesliga runner-up team of all time. In the Europa League, they advanced to the quarter-finals, getting knocked out by a J\u00fcrgen Klopp-led Liverpool in a dramatic comeback at Anfield, where defender Dejan Lovren scored a late goal to make it 4\u20133 to the Reds and 5\u20134 on aggregate. In the 2015\u201316 DFB-Pokal, for the third-straight year Dortmund made it to the competition final, but lost to Bayern Munich on penalties.On 11 April 2017, three explosions occurred near the team's bus on its way to a Champions League match against AS Monaco at the Signal Iduna Park. Defender Marc Bartra was injured, and taken to hospital. Dortmund went on to lose the game 2\u20133 to AS Monaco. Dortmund's manager, Thomas Tuchel, blamed the loss as a result of an ignorant decision by UEFA. UEFA went on to say that the team made no objection to playing, and that the decision was made in compliance with the club and local law enforcement. In the second leg, Dortmund went on to lose 1\u20133, leaving the aggregate score at 3\u20136, and seeing them eliminated from that year's UEFA Champions League. On 26 April, Dortmund defeated Bayern Munich 3\u20132 in Munich to advance to the 2017 DFB-Pokal Final, Dortmund's fourth consecutive final and fifth in six seasons. On 27 May, Dortmund won the 2016\u201317 DFB-Pokal 2\u20131 over Eintracht Frankfurt with the winner coming from a penalty converted by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.Ahead of the 2017\u201318 season, Thomas Tuchel stepped down as manager. The Dortmund board made a decision to hire Peter Bosz as the new manager and head coach for the 2017\u201328 season. Although Bosz got off to a record-breaking start in the team's first 7 games what followed was 20 games without a win, after which he was relieved of his staff role. Peter St\u00f6ger was announced as the interim coach. During the January window of the same season, Dortmund star striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and star centre-back, Marc Bartra both left the club. Stoger bought Manuel Akanji of FC Basel for a fee of \u20ac21.5 million and bought Michy Batshuayi on a six-month loan from Chelsea. Stoger coached Dortmund for the rest of the season, granting them a fourth-place finish in the Bundesliga before stepping down at the end of the season. Michy Batshuayi also returned to Chelsea.\nIn the summer of 2018, Dortmund appointed former OGC Nice coach, Lucien Favre as their manager/head coach. After a very busy transfer window for the team, seeing eight new players arrive at the club for the first team squad, Dortmund performed strongly, chasing Bayern Munich for the title race down to the last matchday, narrowly missing out on the league title by two points and earning Lucien Favre a contract extension. A four-part Amazon Prime documentary series was created, about the same season, named \u201cInside Borussia Dortmund\u201d.\n\n\n== Crest ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Grounds ==\n\n\n=== Stadiums ===\nThe Westfalenstadion is the home stadium of Borussia Dortmund, Germany's largest stadium and the seventh-largest in Europe. The stadium is officially named \"Signal Iduna Park\" after insurance company Signal Iduna purchased the rights to name the stadium until 2021. This name, however, cannot be used when hosting FIFA and UEFA events, since these governing bodies have policies forbidding corporate sponsorship from companies that are not official tournament partners. During the 2006 World Cup, the stadium was referred to as \"FIFA World Cup Stadium, Dortmund\", while in UEFA club matches, it is known as \"BVB Stadion Dortmund\". The stadium currently hosts up to 81,359 spectators (standing and seated) for league matches and 65,829 seated spectators for international matches. For these, the characteristic southern grandstand is re-equipped with seats to conform to FIFA regulations.\nIn 1974, the Westfalenstadion replaced the Stadion Rote Erde, which is located next door and serves now as the stadium of Borussia Dortmund II. After the increasing popularity of Borussia Dortmund in the 1960s, it became obvious that the traditional ground was too small for the increasing number of Borussia Dortmund supporters. The city of Dortmund, however, was not able to finance a new stadium and federal institutions were unwilling to help. But in 1971, Dortmund was selected to replace the city of Cologne, which was forced to withdraw its plans to host games in the 1974 World Cup. The funds originally set aside for the projected stadium in Cologne were thus re-allocated to Dortmund, and a new stadium became reality.\nThe Westfalenstadion has undergone several renovations throughout the years to increase the size of the stadium, including an expansion of the stadium for the 2006 World Cup. In 2008, the Borusseum, a museum about Borussia Dortmund, opened in the stadium. In 2011, Borussia Dortmund agreed to a partnership with Q-Cells. The company installed 8,768 solar cells on the roof of the Westfalenstadion to generate up to 860,000 kWh per year.Borussia Dortmund has the highest average attendance of any football club worldwide. In 2014, it was estimated that each of the club's home games is attended by around 1,000 British spectators, drawn to the team by its low ticket prices compared to the Premier League.\n\n\n=== Training ground ===\nBorussia Dortmund's training ground and Academy base Hohenbuschei is located in Brackel, a district of Dortmund. Inside the complex, there are physical exercise training for physical fitness and rehabilitation robotics areas, physiotherapy and massage rooms, and remedial and hydrotherapy pools.

On the grounds, there are five grass pitches, two of which have under-soil heating, one artificial grass field, three small grass pitches and a multi-functional sports arena. The site covers a total area of 18,000 m2 (190,000 sq ft). In addition, the club owns a Footbonaut, a training robot which is effectively a 14 m2 (150 sq ft) training cage.The training complex and youth performance centre, located in Hohenbuschei, will be expanded in stages until 2021. In addition, the Sports Business Office will be entirely rebuilt from scratch. The planned construction, which will cost up to 20 million euros, will make BVB the best-equipped football club in the country with regards to infrastructure.In the Strobelallee Training Centre, the BVB Evonik Football Academy has an outstanding training venue exclusively at its disposal.

        "wiki": "The Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte or MKK (Museum of Art and Cultural History) is a municipal museum in Dortmund, Germany.  It is currently located in an Art Deco building which was formerly the Dortmund Savings Bank.\nThe collection includes paintings, sculptures, furniture and applied art, illustrating the cultural history of Dortmund from early times to the 20th century.  There are regular temporary exhibitions of art and culture, as well as a permanent exhibition on the history of surveying, with rare geodetic instruments.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was founded in 1883 as a collection of historical and artistic objects.  It changed location several times in the early years, and came to include archaeological finds, decorative artworks and local historical artefacts.  It was reoriented as a fine art museum in the 1930s, with the acquisition of Romantic paintings in particular.The collection was evacuated during the war, and survived almost unharmed.  The building, however, was destroyed, so the collection was moved into Cappenberg Castle in 1946.  (The ruins of the old site were rebuilt into the Museum am Ostwall.)  During this time the MKK was put in charge of artworks evacuated from various bombed Westphalian churches, including Conrad von Soest's Mary Altar from St. Mary's Church in Dortmund.\nIn the 1960s and '70s the MKK acquired examples of Westphalian furniture, documenting the history of furnishing from the Gothic to Art Nouveau.  In 1983 it moved into its present location, an Art Deco former bank built in 1924.  The director from 1982 to 1986 was Gerhard Langemeyer, the future Lord Mayor of Dortmund.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe permanent exhibitions are Kulturgeschichte im Zeitraffer (\"Cultural History in Time-Lapse\"), Die kleine Nationalgalerie (an annexe of the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin), and the exhibition on the history of surveying.  The sections are ordered chronologically, from \"Back to the Stone Age\" and \"Antiques\" through to \"The New City\".The permanent collection of 19th-century paintings includes works by Caspar David Friedrich, Max Slevogt, Lovis Corinth and Anton von Werner.  Some of the previous temporary exhibitions have been devoted to Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Friedrich Karl Waechter, Paul C\u00e9zanne, \u00c9douard Manet, and Frank Lloyd Wright and The Living City (2000).\nIn 2008, the Museumsgesellschaft zur Pflege der bildenden Kunst (Museum Society for the Protection of Visual Art), a sponsorship society for the MKK, donated an altar painting of the Holy Kinship by Jan Baegert (active c. 1505\u20131530) to the museum, to mark the society's hundredth year.  This work is part of an altarpiece that had been divided into four parts.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page (in German)",

        "wiki": "Dortmund (, also UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u0254\u0281tm\u028ant] (listen); Westphalian Low German: D\u00fc\u00f6rpm [\u02c8dy\u02d0\u0153\u0250\u032fpm\u0329]; Latin: Tremonia) is with a population of 603,609 inhabitants as of 2020, the third-largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany's eighth-largest city. It is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of Westphalia. On the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine), it lies in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg.\nFounded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 230% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.The region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Unionand is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries and logistics. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction, especially for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as Europe (Benelux countries), and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions, including the Technical University of Dortmund and Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, International School of Management and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities with over 49,000 students, many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. The city is known as Westphalia's \"green metropolis\". Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past.\nDortmund is home to Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund, a successful club in German football.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Sigiburg was a Saxon hillfort in the South of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by Westphalian Saxons. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni \u2013 In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the \"Ecclesiastical council\" and in 1016 the\"Imperial diet\" meets in Dortmund.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===\n\nAfter it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold's Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court (German: Freistuhl) was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the Femelinde. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - Stadtgymnasium Dortmund. The 1661 earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.\n\n\n=== 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n\nWith the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\nDuring the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch - a right military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. Radical workers formed a Red Army who fought the freikorps units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nUnder Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients for euthanasia at the Hadamar mental hospital as part of the Action T4 (an additional 229 children were killed in the \"Children's Specialist Department\", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941).\nBombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenh\u00fctte AG, the \"Hoesch-Benzin GmbH\" synthetic oil plant, and the Zeche Hansa. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped through Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\n\nPost-war, most of the ancient buildings were not restored, and large parts of the city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict H\u00f6rde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nDortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are 87 km (54 mi) long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten kreisangeh\u00f6rig (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4 million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, L\u00fcnen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills in the south of the city to the Sauerland.\nThe Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund 254.3 m (834 ft). There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at 48.9 m (160 ft).\nThe Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called Stadtbezirke), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, H\u00f6rde, Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each  Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n\nStadtzentrum (City centre)\nHafenviertel (Harbour Quarter)\nNordmarkt\nBorsigplatz\nKaiserviertel\nKronenviertel\nKreuzviertel\nKlinikviertel (Clinical Quarter)\nSaarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\nUnionviertel\nGartenstadt\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately 9 to 10 \u00b0C (48 to 50 \u00b0F), the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately 800 mm (31 in). Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as Ostflucht (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical \"loss\" of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.\nAs of 2012, Dortmund had a population of 571,403 of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has large Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 2014 the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (49.9%) and Catholicism (27.4% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4 - I.N. Ag\u00edon Apost\u00f3lon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of \"guest workers\". Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 84,944 community members.\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, H\u00f6rde and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s. Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - German Evangelical Church Assembly.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Ullrich Sierau with variable majorities between SPD, CDU and Alliance '90/The Greens\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\n\nDortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\nDortmund is often called the Herzkammer der SPD (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Hen\u00dfler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): Ullrich Sierau (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nDortmund is twinned with:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.\n\n\n=== Urban districts ===\nUnlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.\n\n\n==== Kreuzviertel ====\n\nThe Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer and players of Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42 km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the Westfalenh\u00fctte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n\n\n==== Kaiserviertel ====\n\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n\n==== Unionviertel ====\n\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.\n\n\n==== H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix ====\n\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L\u00fcnen, Unna und Schwerte. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost \u20ac;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east\u2013west and 320 meters wide in north\u2013south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\nZalando\nHSBC Trinkaus\nGerman Handball Association\nHandball-Bundesliga (HBL)\nAcademy of the German public Bank\nMircosonicThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.\nThe River Emscher flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public water board Emschergenossenschaft. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by the year 2020.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nReinoldikirche, a Protestant church (built in 1233\u20131450)\nPetrikirche, a now Protestant church (start of construction 1322). It is famous for the huge carved altar (known as \"Golden Miracle of Dortmund\"), from 1521. It consists of 633 gilt carved oak figures depicting 30 scenes about Easter.\nMarienkirche, a now Protestant church originally built in 1170\u20131200 but rebuilt after World War II. The altar is from 1420.\nPropsteikirche, Monastery of the Dominican Order in the city center (built in 1331\u20131353)\nSt. Georg, Aplerbeck, the only Romasque cross basilica of Dortmund\nGro\u00dfe Kirche Aplerbeck, a Gothic revival church\nSt. Peter in Syburg suburb, the oldest church building in the city limits\nHeilig-Kreuz-Kirche, a Protestant church (start of construction 1911)\nSt.-Margareta Chapel, a Protestant chapel built in 1348\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Castles ===\nHaus Bodelschwingh (13th century), a moated castle\nHaus Dellwig (13th century), a moated castle partly rebuilt in the 17th century. The fa\u00e7ade and the steep tower, and two half-timbered buildings, are original.\nHaus Rodenberg (13th century), a moated castle\nAltes Stadthaus, built in 1899 by Friedrich Kullrich\nRomberg Park Gatehouse (17th century), once a gatehouse to a moated castle. Now it houses an art gallery.\nHusen Castle, the tower house of a former castle, in the borough of Syburg.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrial buildings ===\nThe most industrial building in Dortmund are part of the Industrial Heritage Trail (German: Route der Industriekultur). The trail links tourist attractions related to the industrial heritage in the whole Ruhr area in Germany. It is a part of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.\n\nU-Tower, former Dortmunder Union brewery, now a museum\nZollern II/IV Colliery, now part of the Westphalian Industrial Museum and an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH)\nHansa Coking Plant\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cultural buildings ===\nKonzerthaus Dortmund\nOpernhaus Dortmund, opera house built in 1966 on the site of the old synagogue which was destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.\nThe major art museums include the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte and the more recent Museum Ostwall.\nDASA, Germany Occupational Health and Safety Exhibition (German: Deutsche Arbeitsschutzausstellung)\nBrewery Museum Dortmund\nMuseum of Art and Cultural History\nGerman Football Museum\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other important buildings ===\nFlorianturm, (television tower Florian)\nWestfalenstadion: Football ground of Borussia Dortmund, licensed until 2021 under the name Signal Iduna Park\nClose to Westfalenstadion are the Westfalenhallen, a large convention centre, the site of several major conventions, trade fairs, ice-skating competitions, concerts and other major events since the 1950s.\nSteinwache memorial\n\n\n=== High-rise structures ===\nDortmund tallest structure is the Florianturm telecommunication tower at 266 m or 873 ft. Other tall buildings are the churches around the city centre. A selection of the tallest office buildings in Dortmund is listed below.\n\nRWE Tower (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestnetz Hochhaus Dortmund (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestfalentower (88 metre-high skyscraper)\nHarenberg City-Center (86 metre-high skyscraper)\nSparkassen-Hochhaus (70 metre-high skyscraper)\nIWO-Hochhaus(70 metre-high skyscraper)\nEllipson (66 metre-high skyscraper)\nVolkswohl Bund Hochhaus (60 metre-high skyscraper)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\n\nDortmund also serves as a major European and German crossroads for the Autobahnsystem. The Ruhrschnellweg follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the Ruhr Area. It crosses the Dutch-German border as a continuation of the Dutch A67 and crosses the Rhine, leads through the Ruhr valley toward Bochum, becoming B 1 (Bundesstra\u00dfe 1) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A 44 near Holzwickede. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to Der Spiegel, it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes A1 and A2, which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the Kamener Kreuz interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn A45 to the west these form the Dortmund Beltway (Dortmunder Autobahnring).\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a Bike freeway called the Radschnellweg Ruhr (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\nThe central train station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Dortmund with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive Stadtbahn and bus system. The Stadtbahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of L\u00fcnen in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last trams on the surface.A number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system. Night buses replace Stadtbahn services between 1:30 am and 7:30 am on weekends and public holidays. The central junction for the night bus service is Reinoldikirche in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.\nThe H-Bahn at Dortmund University of Technology is a hanging monorail built specifically to shuttle passengers between the university's two campuses, which are now also flanked by research laboratories and other high-tech corporations and startups. A nearly identical monorail system transfers passengers at D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nDortmund Airport is a medium-sized, but fast growing airport 13 km (8.1 mi) east of the city centre at the city limit to Holzwickede. The airport serves the area of the Ruhrgebiet, Sauerland, Westphalia and parts of the Netherlands and features flights to Munich, London, Vienna, Porto and a lot of eastern European city and leisure destinations. The airport is served by an express bus to Dortmund main station, a shuttle bus to the nearby railway station Holzwickede/Dortmund Flughafen, a bus to the city's metro line U47, as well as a bus to the city of Unna.\nIn 2019, the airport served 2,719,563 passengers mainly used for low-cost and leisure charter flights. The closest intercontinental airport is D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\nDortmund Harbour (Hafen) is the largest canal harbour in Europe and the 11th fluvial harbour in Germany.\n\nTransport in Dortmund\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDortmund has adapted since the collapse of its century long steel, coal and beer industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, biomedical technology, micro systems technology, engineering, tourism, finance, education, services and is thus one of the most dynamic new-economy cities in Germany. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow.Hundreds of SMEs are still based in and around Dortmund (often termed Mittelstand). Dortmund is also home to a number of medium-sized information technology companies, many linked to the local university TU Dortmund at the first technology center in Germany named \"Technologiepark Dortmund\" opened in the 1980s. With around 280 companies like Boehringer Ingelheim and Verizon Communications and more than 8,500 employees, TechnologiePark Dortmund is one of the most successful technology parks in Europe.

        "wiki": "Dortmund (, also UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u0254\u0281tm\u028ant] (listen); Westphalian Low German: D\u00fc\u00f6rpm [\u02c8dy\u02d0\u0153\u0250\u032fpm\u0329]; Latin: Tremonia) is with a population of 603,609 inhabitants as of 2020, the third-largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany's eighth-largest city. It is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of Westphalia. On the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine), it lies in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg.\nFounded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 230% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.The region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Unionand is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries and logistics. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction, especially for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as Europe (Benelux countries), and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions, including the Technical University of Dortmund and Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, International School of Management and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities with over 49,000 students, many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. The city is known as Westphalia's \"green metropolis\". Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past.\nDortmund is home to Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund, a successful club in German football.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Sigiburg was a Saxon hillfort in the South of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by Westphalian Saxons. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni \u2013 In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the \"Ecclesiastical council\" and in 1016 the\"Imperial diet\" meets in Dortmund.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===\n\nAfter it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold's Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court (German: Freistuhl) was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the Femelinde. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - Stadtgymnasium Dortmund. The 1661 earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.\n\n\n=== 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n\nWith the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\nDuring the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch - a right military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. Radical workers formed a Red Army who fought the freikorps units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nUnder Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients for euthanasia at the Hadamar mental hospital as part of the Action T4 (an additional 229 children were killed in the \"Children's Specialist Department\", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941).\nBombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenh\u00fctte AG, the \"Hoesch-Benzin GmbH\" synthetic oil plant, and the Zeche Hansa. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped through Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\n\nPost-war, most of the ancient buildings were not restored, and large parts of the city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict H\u00f6rde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nDortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are 87 km (54 mi) long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten kreisangeh\u00f6rig (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4 million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, L\u00fcnen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills in the south of the city to the Sauerland.\nThe Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund 254.3 m (834 ft). There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at 48.9 m (160 ft).\nThe Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called Stadtbezirke), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, H\u00f6rde, Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each  Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n\nStadtzentrum (City centre)\nHafenviertel (Harbour Quarter)\nNordmarkt\nBorsigplatz\nKaiserviertel\nKronenviertel\nKreuzviertel\nKlinikviertel (Clinical Quarter)\nSaarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\nUnionviertel\nGartenstadt\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately 9 to 10 \u00b0C (48 to 50 \u00b0F), the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately 800 mm (31 in). Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as Ostflucht (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical \"loss\" of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.\nAs of 2012, Dortmund had a population of 571,403 of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has large Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 2014 the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (49.9%) and Catholicism (27.4% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4 - I.N. Ag\u00edon Apost\u00f3lon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of \"guest workers\". Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 84,944 community members.\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, H\u00f6rde and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s. Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - German Evangelical Church Assembly.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Ullrich Sierau with variable majorities between SPD, CDU and Alliance '90/The Greens\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\n\nDortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\nDortmund is often called the Herzkammer der SPD (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Hen\u00dfler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): Ullrich Sierau (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nDortmund is twinned with:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.\n\n\n=== Urban districts ===\nUnlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.\n\n\n==== Kreuzviertel ====\n\nThe Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer and players of Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42 km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the Westfalenh\u00fctte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n\n\n==== Kaiserviertel ====\n\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n\n==== Unionviertel ====\n\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.\n\n\n==== H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix ====\n\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L\u00fcnen, Unna und Schwerte. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost \u20ac;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east\u2013west and 320 meters wide in north\u2013south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\nZalando\nHSBC Trinkaus\nGerman Handball Association\nHandball-Bundesliga (HBL)\nAcademy of the German public Bank\nMircosonicThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.\nThe River Emscher flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public water board Emschergenossenschaft. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by the year 2020.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nReinoldikirche, a Protestant church (built in 1233\u20131450)\nPetrikirche, a now Protestant church (start of construction 1322). It is famous for the huge carved altar (known as \"Golden Miracle of Dortmund\"), from 1521. It consists of 633 gilt carved oak figures depicting 30 scenes about Easter.\nMarienkirche, a now Protestant church originally built in 1170\u20131200 but rebuilt after World War II. The altar is from 1420.\nPropsteikirche, Monastery of the Dominican Order in the city center (built in 1331\u20131353)\nSt. Georg, Aplerbeck, the only Romasque cross basilica of Dortmund\nGro\u00dfe Kirche Aplerbeck, a Gothic revival church\nSt. Peter in Syburg suburb, the oldest church building in the city limits\nHeilig-Kreuz-Kirche, a Protestant church (start of construction 1911)\nSt.-Margareta Chapel, a Protestant chapel built in 1348\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Castles ===\nHaus Bodelschwingh (13th century), a moated castle\nHaus Dellwig (13th century), a moated castle partly rebuilt in the 17th century. The fa\u00e7ade and the steep tower, and two half-timbered buildings, are original.\nHaus Rodenberg (13th century), a moated castle\nAltes Stadthaus, built in 1899 by Friedrich Kullrich\nRomberg Park Gatehouse (17th century), once a gatehouse to a moated castle. Now it houses an art gallery.\nHusen Castle, the tower house of a former castle, in the borough of Syburg.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrial buildings ===\nThe most industrial building in Dortmund are part of the Industrial Heritage Trail (German: Route der Industriekultur). The trail links tourist attractions related to the industrial heritage in the whole Ruhr area in Germany. It is a part of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.\n\nU-Tower, former Dortmunder Union brewery, now a museum\nZollern II/IV Colliery, now part of the Westphalian Industrial Museum and an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH)\nHansa Coking Plant\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cultural buildings ===\nKonzerthaus Dortmund\nOpernhaus Dortmund, opera house built in 1966 on the site of the old synagogue which was destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.\nThe major art museums include the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte and the more recent Museum Ostwall.\nDASA, Germany Occupational Health and Safety Exhibition (German: Deutsche Arbeitsschutzausstellung)\nBrewery Museum Dortmund\nMuseum of Art and Cultural History\nGerman Football Museum\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other important buildings ===\nFlorianturm, (television tower Florian)\nWestfalenstadion: Football ground of Borussia Dortmund, licensed until 2021 under the name Signal Iduna Park\nClose to Westfalenstadion are the Westfalenhallen, a large convention centre, the site of several major conventions, trade fairs, ice-skating competitions, concerts and other major events since the 1950s.\nSteinwache memorial\n\n\n=== High-rise structures ===\nDortmund tallest structure is the Florianturm telecommunication tower at 266 m or 873 ft. Other tall buildings are the churches around the city centre. A selection of the tallest office buildings in Dortmund is listed below.\n\nRWE Tower (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestnetz Hochhaus Dortmund (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestfalentower (88 metre-high skyscraper)\nHarenberg City-Center (86 metre-high skyscraper)\nSparkassen-Hochhaus (70 metre-high skyscraper)\nIWO-Hochhaus(70 metre-high skyscraper)\nEllipson (66 metre-high skyscraper)\nVolkswohl Bund Hochhaus (60 metre-high skyscraper)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\n\nDortmund also serves as a major European and German crossroads for the Autobahnsystem. The Ruhrschnellweg follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the Ruhr Area. It crosses the Dutch-German border as a continuation of the Dutch A67 and crosses the Rhine, leads through the Ruhr valley toward Bochum, becoming B 1 (Bundesstra\u00dfe 1) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A 44 near Holzwickede. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to Der Spiegel, it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes A1 and A2, which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the Kamener Kreuz interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn A45 to the west these form the Dortmund Beltway (Dortmunder Autobahnring).\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a Bike freeway called the Radschnellweg Ruhr (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\nThe central train station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Dortmund with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive Stadtbahn and bus system. The Stadtbahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of L\u00fcnen in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last trams on the surface.A number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system. Night buses replace Stadtbahn services between 1:30 am and 7:30 am on weekends and public holidays. The central junction for the night bus service is Reinoldikirche in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.\nThe H-Bahn at Dortmund University of Technology is a hanging monorail built specifically to shuttle passengers between the university's two campuses, which are now also flanked by research laboratories and other high-tech corporations and startups. A nearly identical monorail system transfers passengers at D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nDortmund Airport is a medium-sized, but fast growing airport 13 km (8.1 mi) east of the city centre at the city limit to Holzwickede. The airport serves the area of the Ruhrgebiet, Sauerland, Westphalia and parts of the Netherlands and features flights to Munich, London, Vienna, Porto and a lot of eastern European city and leisure destinations. The airport is served by an express bus to Dortmund main station, a shuttle bus to the nearby railway station Holzwickede/Dortmund Flughafen, a bus to the city's metro line U47, as well as a bus to the city of Unna.\nIn 2019, the airport served 2,719,563 passengers mainly used for low-cost and leisure charter flights. The closest intercontinental airport is D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\nDortmund Harbour (Hafen) is the largest canal harbour in Europe and the 11th fluvial harbour in Germany.\n\nTransport in Dortmund\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDortmund has adapted since the collapse of its century long steel, coal and beer industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, biomedical technology, micro systems technology, engineering, tourism, finance, education, services and is thus one of the most dynamic new-economy cities in Germany. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow.Hundreds of SMEs are still based in and around Dortmund (often termed Mittelstand). Dortmund is also home to a number of medium-sized information technology companies, many linked to the local university TU Dortmund at the first technology center in Germany named \"Technologiepark Dortmund\" opened in the 1980s. With around 280 companies like Boehringer Ingelheim and Verizon Communications and more than 8,500 employees, TechnologiePark Dortmund is one of the most successful technology parks in Europe. The city works closely with research institutes, private universities, and companies to collaborate on the commercialisation of science initiatives. Furthermore, 680 IT and software companies with 12,000 employees are based in Dortmund, making the city one of Germany's biggest software locations. Two of the top 10 IT service provider in Germany are based in Dortmund -  adesso SE and Materna Group.Dortmund is home to many insurance companies e.g. Signal Iduna, Continentale Krankenversicherung, Bundesinnungskrankenkasse Gesundheit (BIG direkt) and Volkswohl Bund. In recent years a service sector and high-tech industry have grown up. Some of its most prominent companies of these sectors include Amprion and RWE-Westnetz (Electricity), Rhenus Logistics (Logistics), Wilo, KHS GmbH, Elmos Semiconductor, ABP Induction Systems, Nordwest Handel AG \u2013 all of whom have their headquarters here. Companies with operations in or around Dortmund include Zalando, Daimler AG: EvoBus, RapidMiner, Gap Inc. and ThyssenKrupp.\nDortmund is also the headquarter of Century Media Records, a heavy metal record label with offices in the United States and London. In August 2015, Century Media was acquired by Sony Music for US$17 million.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism in Dortmund is a fast-growing economic factor every year: new overnight records can be announced, new hotels open and new visitor magnets are added. Starting in the mid-1990s, Dortmund, formerly an industrial centre, saw rapid development that expanded its cultural and tourism possibilities, and transformed it into a newly vibrant city. An important strategic step was the start of construction the new Konzerthaus Dortmund, the reuse of vacant old industrial buildings like the Zollern II/IV Colliery, Kokerei Hansa, Dortmund U-Tower and the strategic reorientation of the Dortmund Christmas market with over 300 stalls packed around a gigantic Christmas tree creation that stands 45 metres tall \u2013 reputed to be the biggest in the world. A new Tourist Information center right next to the U-Tower, gives visitors a quick overview of the tourist attractions in the City and Ruhr Area. Today Dortmund is with more than 1.450.528 (2017) overnight stays one of the most popular destinations in North Rhine-Westphalia.The majority of tourists are domestic visitors, coming from Germany. International travellers arrive from the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland. Dortmund also draws business tourism, having been equipped with facilities like WILO, Amprion next to Westfalenhallen and football tourism with Fans of Borussia Dortmund. The top 5 most visited attractions were the Christmas market, with more than three and a half million visitors, Signal Iduna Park, Deutsches Fu\u00dfballmuseum, Dortmund U-Tower, Zollern II/IV Colliery and Westfalenpark.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nThe Westenhellweg is a popular shopping destination and with nearly 13,000 visitors per hour it was Germany's most frequented shopping street in 2013. During the Middle Ages, Dortmund was the only free imperial city in Westphalia, having already been regarded as an important centre of trade. Today some of the most reputed shops, department stores have stores here. It is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by the Reinoldikirche in the east and U-Tower in the west. The Westenhellweg has one of the highest rents for retail and office space in North Rhine-Westphalia. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as H&M, Saturn, Esprit, Zara or NewYorker. In 2009 a new shopping mall named Thier-Galerie opened, with nearly 100 stores and chains, including; Armani, Adidas, Diesel and Hollister.\nThree more shopping malls occupy the Thier-Galerie; Galeria Kaufhof and Karstadt, as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from Peek & Cloppenburg and C&A.

        "wiki": "The Florianturm (Florian Tower, Florian for short) is a telecommunications tower and landmark of Dortmund (Germany). It is named after St. Florian, the patron saint of gardeners.\nThe Florianturm is the TV tower of Dortmund and was built in 1959 as an attraction for a federal horticultural show with a height of 219.6 metres (720 ft). At the time it was briefly the highest freestanding structure in Germany.\nThe tower was constructed similarly to a high concrete chimney. It consists of a reinforced concrete tube, which tapers off as it rises, reaching a height of 129.75 metres (425.7 ft). At 130.6 metres (428 ft) there is a building part with two floors. On the lower floor there are operation rooms and on the upper floor at 137.54 metres (451.2 ft) there is a revolving restaurant. At 141.88 metres (465.5 ft) and 144.7 metres (475 ft) there are two observation decks.\nOn the upper observation deck there are installations and aerials of Deutsche Telekom. Since 1959 it has been used for transmitting television signals.\nOn 7 September 2004, a Russian helicopter was used to replace the aerial. Since then, a 50-kilowatt transmitter has transmitted digital terrestrial television programmes for the Dortmund area.\nSince 7 September 2004, the Florianturm has a height of 208.56 metres (684.3 ft), making it the fourteenth highest structure in Germany.\nFrom 1996 to 1998, the tower was renovated and safety standards were brought up to date.\nIn 2000, a catwalk for bungee jumping was opened on the upper platform. It was closed in 2003 after a fatal accident and was removed in July 2008.\n\n\n== Data ==\narchitect: Will Schwarz, Dortmund\nconstruction time: May 1958 \u2013 April 1959\ndepth of basement: 8.10 m, the lowest part of the substructure is 110.3 m above sea level\ndiameter of basement: 25 m\nthickness of basement plate: 2.5 m\ntotal weight: approx. 7,700 t\nvolume of cement: approx. 1,385 t\ntotal weight of concrete: approx. 3,400 m\u00b3\ntotal weight of steel: approx. 660 t\nstability ratio: 3.5x\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towers\n\n\n== External links ==\nFlorian Tower at Structurae\nFernsehturm-Dortmund",

          "would be even better if the viewing platform had some explanation of the different things you are looking at (names of churches, distant towns, that sort of thing) and the caf\u00e9 was open. Still worth a visit and inexpensive (2.5 euros)",

        "wiki": "The Lutheran Protestant Church of St. Reinold (German: Reinoldikirche) is, according to its foundation date, the oldest extant church in Dortmund, Germany; it is dedicated to Reinold, also known as Renaud de Montauban, the patron of the city. The church was built as a palatine church in the Ottonian era. The present building is a late Romanesque church with  a late gothic quire. St. Reinold's was built from 1250 to 1270, and is located in the centre of the city, directly at the crossing of the Hellweg (a historic trade route) and the historic road from Cologne to Bremen. St. Reinoldi's congregation is a member of the Evangelical Church of Westphalia, an umbrella comprising Lutheran, Reformed and united Protestant congregations.\nEfforts to complete the tower of St. Reinold's were renewed in 1443. After its completion in 1454, it was 112 m (367 ft) tall and was referred to as the \"Miracle of Westphalia\". The polygonal spire was renovated the first time in 1519. On 24 June 1520, the copper roofing was completed, and on 27 July the spire was added. The apex of the church was now about seven metres higher. In 1562 the pastors and congregations of Dortmund confirmed their adoption of Lutheranism in St. Reinold's Church. In 1661, the tower collapsed after being damaged during an earthquake. The foundation for the new tower was laid 1662, and the building was completed 1701, with a baroque ornament on the top.\nThe church was heavily damaged in World War II. Since the reconstruction the tower now bears a hood with baroque features similar to the original one, but increased in height (together with the tower as a whole) to correspond with the increased height of the surrounding modern buildings in the city centre. These features supply a visual and harmonious connection between the original style of the church and its appearance after reconstruction. The tower of St. Reinold's Church (today's height: 104 m (341 ft)) can be visited, up to the first platform by the bell tower.\nOn the inside there is a large set of bells, made by the \"Bochumer Verein\" foundry (total weight: 20 t), built in 1954 with altogether 6 steel bells. Their cost at the time of creation was DM 90,500. The heaviest bell (Pitch: f\u00b0) weighing 6.500 kg, and measuring 2.50 m in diameter, is the largest cast steel bell in Westphalia.In December 2016, nine neo-Nazis from various German cities who were associated with the Die Rechte right wing group occupied the church steeple and appeared to set off fireworks from it. The members were subsequently taken into custody by police. Neo-Nazi slogans shouted from the steeple through a megaphone were drowned out by the church bells, ordered to be rung by the vicar of St. Reinold's. The illegal occupation of the church's tower was met with disbelief and anger from the church's spokespersons and the vast majority of the public.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Dortmund (, also UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u0254\u0281tm\u028ant] (listen); Westphalian Low German: D\u00fc\u00f6rpm [\u02c8dy\u02d0\u0153\u0250\u032fpm\u0329]; Latin: Tremonia) is with a population of 603,609 inhabitants as of 2020, the third-largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany's eighth-largest city. It is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of Westphalia. On the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine), it lies in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg.\nFounded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 230% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.The region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Unionand is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries and logistics. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction, especially for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as Europe (Benelux countries), and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions, including the Technical University of Dortmund and Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, International School of Management and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities with over 49,000 students, many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. The city is known as Westphalia's \"green metropolis\". Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past.\nDortmund is home to Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund, a successful club in German football.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Sigiburg was a Saxon hillfort in the South of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by Westphalian Saxons. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni \u2013 In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the \"Ecclesiastical council\" and in 1016 the\"Imperial diet\" meets in Dortmund.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===\n\nAfter it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold's Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court (German: Freistuhl) was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the Femelinde. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - Stadtgymnasium Dortmund. The 1661 earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.\n\n\n=== 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n\nWith the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\nDuring the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch - a right military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. Radical workers formed a Red Army who fought the freikorps units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nUnder Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients for euthanasia at the Hadamar mental hospital as part of the Action T4 (an additional 229 children were killed in the \"Children's Specialist Department\", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941).\nBombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenh\u00fctte AG, the \"Hoesch-Benzin GmbH\" synthetic oil plant, and the Zeche Hansa. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped through Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\n\nPost-war, most of the ancient buildings were not restored, and large parts of the city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict H\u00f6rde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nDortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are 87 km (54 mi) long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten kreisangeh\u00f6rig (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4 million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, L\u00fcnen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills in the south of the city to the Sauerland.\nThe Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund 254.3 m (834 ft). There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at 48.9 m (160 ft).\nThe Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called Stadtbezirke), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, H\u00f6rde, Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each  Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n\nStadtzentrum (City centre)\nHafenviertel (Harbour Quarter)\nNordmarkt\nBorsigplatz\nKaiserviertel\nKronenviertel\nKreuzviertel\nKlinikviertel (Clinical Quarter)\nSaarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\nUnionviertel\nGartenstadt\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately 9 to 10 \u00b0C (48 to 50 \u00b0F), the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately 800 mm (31 in). Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as Ostflucht (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical \"loss\" of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.\nAs of 2012, Dortmund had a population of 571,403 of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has large Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 2014 the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (49.9%) and Catholicism (27.4% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4 - I.N. Ag\u00edon Apost\u00f3lon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of \"guest workers\". Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 84,944 community members.\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, H\u00f6rde and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s. Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - German Evangelical Church Assembly.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Ullrich Sierau with variable majorities between SPD, CDU and Alliance '90/The Greens\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\n\nDortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\nDortmund is often called the Herzkammer der SPD (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Hen\u00dfler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): Ullrich Sierau (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nDortmund is twinned with:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.\n\n\n=== Urban districts ===\nUnlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.\n\n\n==== Kreuzviertel ====\n\nThe Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer and players of Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42 km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the Westfalenh\u00fctte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n\n\n==== Kaiserviertel ====\n\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n\n==== Unionviertel ====\n\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.\n\n\n==== H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix ====\n\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L\u00fcnen, Unna und Schwerte. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost \u20ac;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east\u2013west and 320 meters wide in north\u2013south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\nZalando\nHSBC Trinkaus\nGerman Handball Association\nHandball-Bundesliga (HBL)\nAcademy of the German public Bank\nMircosonicThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.\nThe River Emscher flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake.

        "wiki": "Dortmund (, also UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u0254\u0281tm\u028ant] (listen); Westphalian Low German: D\u00fc\u00f6rpm [\u02c8dy\u02d0\u0153\u0250\u032fpm\u0329]; Latin: Tremonia) is with a population of 603,609 inhabitants as of 2020, the third-largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany's eighth-largest city. It is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of Westphalia. On the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine), it lies in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg.\nFounded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 230% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.The region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Unionand is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries and logistics. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction, especially for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as Europe (Benelux countries), and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions, including the Technical University of Dortmund and Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, International School of Management and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities with over 49,000 students, many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. The city is known as Westphalia's \"green metropolis\". Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past.\nDortmund is home to Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund, a successful club in German football.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Sigiburg was a Saxon hillfort in the South of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by Westphalian Saxons. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni \u2013 In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the \"Ecclesiastical council\" and in 1016 the\"Imperial diet\" meets in Dortmund.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===\n\nAfter it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold's Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court (German: Freistuhl) was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the Femelinde. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - Stadtgymnasium Dortmund. The 1661 earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.\n\n\n=== 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n\nWith the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\nDuring the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch - a right military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. Radical workers formed a Red Army who fought the freikorps units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nUnder Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients for euthanasia at the Hadamar mental hospital as part of the Action T4 (an additional 229 children were killed in the \"Children's Specialist Department\", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941).\nBombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenh\u00fctte AG, the \"Hoesch-Benzin GmbH\" synthetic oil plant, and the Zeche Hansa. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped through Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\n\nPost-war, most of the ancient buildings were not restored, and large parts of the city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict H\u00f6rde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nDortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are 87 km (54 mi) long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten kreisangeh\u00f6rig (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4 million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, L\u00fcnen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills in the south of the city to the Sauerland.\nThe Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund 254.3 m (834 ft). There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at 48.9 m (160 ft).\nThe Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called Stadtbezirke), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, H\u00f6rde, Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each  Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n\nStadtzentrum (City centre)\nHafenviertel (Harbour Quarter)\nNordmarkt\nBorsigplatz\nKaiserviertel\nKronenviertel\nKreuzviertel\nKlinikviertel (Clinical Quarter)\nSaarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\nUnionviertel\nGartenstadt\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately 9 to 10 \u00b0C (48 to 50 \u00b0F), the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately 800 mm (31 in). Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as Ostflucht (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical \"loss\" of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.\nAs of 2012, Dortmund had a population of 571,403 of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has large Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 2014 the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (49.9%) and Catholicism (27.4% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4 - I.N. Ag\u00edon Apost\u00f3lon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of \"guest workers\". Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 84,944 community members.\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, H\u00f6rde and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s. Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - German Evangelical Church Assembly.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Ullrich Sierau with variable majorities between SPD, CDU and Alliance '90/The Greens\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\n\nDortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\nDortmund is often called the Herzkammer der SPD (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Hen\u00dfler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): Ullrich Sierau (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nDortmund is twinned with:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.\n\n\n=== Urban districts ===\nUnlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.\n\n\n==== Kreuzviertel ====\n\nThe Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer and players of Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42 km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the Westfalenh\u00fctte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n\n\n==== Kaiserviertel ====\n\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n\n==== Unionviertel ====\n\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.\n\n\n==== H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix ====\n\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L\u00fcnen, Unna und Schwerte. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost \u20ac;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east\u2013west and 320 meters wide in north\u2013south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\nZalando\nHSBC Trinkaus\nGerman Handball Association\nHandball-Bundesliga (HBL)\nAcademy of the German public Bank\nMircosonicThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.\nThe River Emscher flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public water board Emschergenossenschaft. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by the year 2020.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nReinoldikirche, a Protestant church (built in 1233\u20131450)\nPetrikirche, a now Protestant church (start of construction 1322). It is famous for the huge carved altar (known as \"Golden Miracle of Dortmund\"), from 1521. It consists of 633 gilt carved oak figures depicting 30 scenes about Easter.\nMarienkirche, a now Protestant church originally built in 1170\u20131200 but rebuilt after World War II. The altar is from 1420.\nPropsteikirche, Monastery of the Dominican Order in the city center (built in 1331\u20131353)\nSt. Georg, Aplerbeck, the only Romasque cross basilica of Dortmund\nGro\u00dfe Kirche Aplerbeck, a Gothic revival church\nSt. Peter in Syburg suburb, the oldest church building in the city limits\nHeilig-Kreuz-Kirche, a Protestant church (start of construction 1911)\nSt.-Margareta Chapel, a Protestant chapel built in 1348\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Castles ===\nHaus Bodelschwingh (13th century), a moated castle\nHaus Dellwig (13th century), a moated castle partly rebuilt in the 17th century. The fa\u00e7ade and the steep tower, and two half-timbered buildings, are original.\nHaus Rodenberg (13th century), a moated castle\nAltes Stadthaus, built in 1899 by Friedrich Kullrich\nRomberg Park Gatehouse (17th century), once a gatehouse to a moated castle. Now it houses an art gallery.\nHusen Castle, the tower house of a former castle, in the borough of Syburg.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrial buildings ===\nThe most industrial building in Dortmund are part of the Industrial Heritage Trail (German: Route der Industriekultur). The trail links tourist attractions related to the industrial heritage in the whole Ruhr area in Germany. It is a part of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.\n\nU-Tower, former Dortmunder Union brewery, now a museum\nZollern II/IV Colliery, now part of the Westphalian Industrial Museum and an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH)\nHansa Coking Plant\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cultural buildings ===\nKonzerthaus Dortmund\nOpernhaus Dortmund, opera house built in 1966 on the site of the old synagogue which was destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.\nThe major art museums include the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte and the more recent Museum Ostwall.\nDASA, Germany Occupational Health and Safety Exhibition (German: Deutsche Arbeitsschutzausstellung)\nBrewery Museum Dortmund\nMuseum of Art and Cultural History\nGerman Football Museum\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other important buildings ===\nFlorianturm, (television tower Florian)\nWestfalenstadion: Football ground of Borussia Dortmund, licensed until 2021 under the name Signal Iduna Park\nClose to Westfalenstadion are the Westfalenhallen, a large convention centre, the site of several major conventions, trade fairs, ice-skating competitions, concerts and other major events since the 1950s.\nSteinwache memorial\n\n\n=== High-rise structures ===\nDortmund tallest structure is the Florianturm telecommunication tower at 266 m or 873 ft. Other tall buildings are the churches around the city centre. A selection of the tallest office buildings in Dortmund is listed below.\n\nRWE Tower (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestnetz Hochhaus Dortmund (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestfalentower (88 metre-high skyscraper)\nHarenberg City-Center (86 metre-high skyscraper)\nSparkassen-Hochhaus (70 metre-high skyscraper)\nIWO-Hochhaus(70 metre-high skyscraper)\nEllipson (66 metre-high skyscraper)\nVolkswohl Bund Hochhaus (60 metre-high skyscraper)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\n\nDortmund also serves as a major European and German crossroads for the Autobahnsystem. The Ruhrschnellweg follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the Ruhr Area. It crosses the Dutch-German border as a continuation of the Dutch A67 and crosses the Rhine, leads through the Ruhr valley toward Bochum, becoming B 1 (Bundesstra\u00dfe 1) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A 44 near Holzwickede. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to Der Spiegel, it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes A1 and A2, which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the Kamener Kreuz interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn A45 to the west these form the Dortmund Beltway (Dortmunder Autobahnring).\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a Bike freeway called the Radschnellweg Ruhr (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\nThe central train station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Dortmund with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive Stadtbahn and bus system. The Stadtbahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of L\u00fcnen in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last trams on the surface.A number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system. Night buses replace Stadtbahn services between 1:30 am and 7:30 am on weekends and public holidays. The central junction for the night bus service is Reinoldikirche in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.\nThe H-Bahn at Dortmund University of Technology is a hanging monorail built specifically to shuttle passengers between the university's two campuses, which are now also flanked by research laboratories and other high-tech corporations and startups. A nearly identical monorail system transfers passengers at D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nDortmund Airport is a medium-sized, but fast growing airport 13 km (8.1 mi) east of the city centre at the city limit to Holzwickede. The airport serves the area of the Ruhrgebiet, Sauerland, Westphalia and parts of the Netherlands and features flights to Munich, London, Vienna, Porto and a lot of eastern European city and leisure destinations. The airport is served by an express bus to Dortmund main station, a shuttle bus to the nearby railway station Holzwickede/Dortmund Flughafen, a bus to the city's metro line U47, as well as a bus to the city of Unna.\nIn 2019, the airport served 2,719,563 passengers mainly used for low-cost and leisure charter flights. The closest intercontinental airport is D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\nDortmund Harbour (Hafen) is the largest canal harbour in Europe and the 11th fluvial harbour in Germany.\n\nTransport in Dortmund\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDortmund has adapted since the collapse of its century long steel, coal and beer industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, biomedical technology, micro systems technology, engineering, tourism, finance, education, services and is thus one of the most dynamic new-economy cities in Germany. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow.Hundreds of SMEs are still based in and around Dortmund (often termed Mittelstand). Dortmund is also home to a number of medium-sized information technology companies, many linked to the local university TU Dortmund at the first technology center in Germany named \"Technologiepark Dortmund\" opened in the 1980s. With around 280 companies like Boehringer Ingelheim and Verizon Communications and more than 8,500 employees, TechnologiePark Dortmund is one of the most successful technology parks in Europe. The city works closely with research institutes, private universities, and companies to collaborate on the commercialisation of science initiatives. Furthermore, 680 IT and software companies with 12,000 employees are based in Dortmund, making the city one of Germany's biggest software locations. Two of the top 10 IT service provider in Germany are based in Dortmund -  adesso SE and Materna Group.Dortmund is home to many insurance companies e.g. Signal Iduna, Continentale Krankenversicherung, Bundesinnungskrankenkasse Gesundheit (BIG direkt) and Volkswohl Bund. In recent years a service sector and high-tech industry have grown up. Some of its most prominent companies of these sectors include Amprion and RWE-Westnetz (Electricity), Rhenus Logistics (Logistics), Wilo, KHS GmbH, Elmos Semiconductor, ABP Induction Systems, Nordwest Handel AG \u2013 all of whom have their headquarters here. Companies with operations in or around Dortmund include Zalando, Daimler AG: EvoBus, RapidMiner, Gap Inc. and ThyssenKrupp.\nDortmund is also the headquarter of Century Media Records, a heavy metal record label with offices in the United States and London. In August 2015, Century Media was acquired by Sony Music for US$17 million.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism in Dortmund is a fast-growing economic factor every year: new overnight records can be announced, new hotels open and new visitor magnets are added. Starting in the mid-1990s, Dortmund, formerly an industrial centre, saw rapid development that expanded its cultural and tourism possibilities, and transformed it into a newly vibrant city. An important strategic step was the start of construction the new Konzerthaus Dortmund, the reuse of vacant old industrial buildings like the Zollern II/IV Colliery, Kokerei Hansa, Dortmund U-Tower and the strategic reorientation of the Dortmund Christmas market with over 300 stalls packed around a gigantic Christmas tree creation that stands 45 metres tall \u2013 reputed to be the biggest in the world. A new Tourist Information center right next to the U-Tower, gives visitors a quick overview of the tourist attractions in the City and Ruhr Area. Today Dortmund is with more than 1.450.528 (2017) overnight stays one of the most popular destinations in North Rhine-Westphalia.The majority of tourists are domestic visitors, coming from Germany. International travellers arrive from the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland. Dortmund also draws business tourism, having been equipped with facilities like WILO, Amprion next to Westfalenhallen and football tourism with Fans of Borussia Dortmund. The top 5 most visited attractions were the Christmas market, with more than three and a half million visitors, Signal Iduna Park, Deutsches Fu\u00dfballmuseum, Dortmund U-Tower, Zollern II/IV Colliery and Westfalenpark.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nThe Westenhellweg is a popular shopping destination and with nearly 13,000 visitors per hour it was Germany's most frequented shopping street in 2013. During the Middle Ages, Dortmund was the only free imperial city in Westphalia, having already been regarded as an important centre of trade. Today some of the most reputed shops, department stores have stores here. It is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by the Reinoldikirche in the east and U-Tower in the west. The Westenhellweg has one of the highest rents for retail and office space in North Rhine-Westphalia. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as H&M, Saturn, Esprit, Zara or NewYorker. In 2009 a new shopping mall named Thier-Galerie opened, with nearly 100 stores and chains, including; Armani, Adidas, Diesel and Hollister.\nThree more shopping malls occupy the Thier-Galerie; Galeria Kaufhof and Karstadt, as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from Peek & Cloppenburg and C&A. During the month before Christmas, the extended pedestrian-only zone is host to Dortmund Christmas Market, one of the largest and oldest Christmas markets in Germany. With more than 3.5 million visitors and 300 stalls around a gigantic Christmas tree that stands 45 metres tall, it is one of the most visited and popular market in the world.In close proximity to the Dortmund concert hall lies the Br\u00fcckstra\u00dfenviertel  - a quarter hub especially for young people. The \"Rue de Pommes Frites\", which is what the Dortmund citizens have called the Br\u00fcckstra\u00dfe, has turned into a modern shopping promenade, geared towards a younger market.\nFor a long time, the Kampstra\u00dfe had a shadowy existence as a parallel street to the Westenhellweg and Ostenhellweg, but it has become a grand boulevard containing specialist stores. Right next to the Kampstra\u00dfe is the Kleppingstra\u00dfe  \u2013 a shopping street with a high concentration of gastronomy and expensive, prestigious shops like van Laack, Lindner Fashion, Marc Cain. It is located between the Ostenhellweg and Neutor to Wallring.\n\n\n=== Port and Logistic ===\n\nDortmund is one of the most important logistic hubs in Germany, more than 900 companies working in logistics, as well as nationally and internationally recognised scientific institutes. Dortmund Port which terminates the Dortmund-Ems Canal connecting Dortmund to the North Sea is the biggest European canal port with 10 docks and a pier length of 11 km. The variety of different activities taking place at the Fraunhofer Institute Material Flow and Logistics (Fraunhofer Society) has, over the past few years, led to a bundling of skills in the areas of logistics and digitalisation in the city. Industry-based initiatives and pilot projects, such as the Hybrid Services in Logistics innovation lab, the efficiency cluster LogistikRuhr, Industrial Data Space, the Dortmund Mittelstand 4.0 Centre of Excellence, and the enterprise labs. The Digital Hub for Logistics of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy is based in Dortmund and twinned with Hamburg.\nCompanies with big logistic hubs for Germany and Europe in Dortmund include:\n\nAmazon\nIKEA\nDecathlon\nRhenus Logistics\nSchenker AG\n\n\n=== Fairs ===\nDortmund is home to Germany's twelve biggest exhibition centre, Halls of Westphalia which lies near the city center next to Dortmund Airport.

        "wiki": "Dortmund (, also UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u0254\u0281tm\u028ant] (listen); Westphalian Low German: D\u00fc\u00f6rpm [\u02c8dy\u02d0\u0153\u0250\u032fpm\u0329]; Latin: Tremonia) is with a population of 603,609 inhabitants as of 2020, the third-largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany's eighth-largest city. It is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of Westphalia. On the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine), it lies in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg.\nFounded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 230% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.The region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Unionand is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries and logistics. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction, especially for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as Europe (Benelux countries), and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions, including the Technical University of Dortmund and Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, International School of Management and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities with over 49,000 students, many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. The city is known as Westphalia's \"green metropolis\". Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past.\nDortmund is home to Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund, a successful club in German football.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Sigiburg was a Saxon hillfort in the South of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by Westphalian Saxons. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni \u2013 In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the \"Ecclesiastical council\" and in 1016 the\"Imperial diet\" meets in Dortmund.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===\n\nAfter it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold's Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court (German: Freistuhl) was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the Femelinde. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - Stadtgymnasium Dortmund. The 1661 earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.\n\n\n=== 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n\nWith the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\nDuring the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch - a right military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. Radical workers formed a Red Army who fought the freikorps units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nUnder Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients for euthanasia at the Hadamar mental hospital as part of the Action T4 (an additional 229 children were killed in the \"Children's Specialist Department\", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941).\nBombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenh\u00fctte AG, the \"Hoesch-Benzin GmbH\" synthetic oil plant, and the Zeche Hansa. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped through Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\n\nPost-war, most of the ancient buildings were not restored, and large parts of the city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict H\u00f6rde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nDortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are 87 km (54 mi) long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten kreisangeh\u00f6rig (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4 million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, L\u00fcnen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills in the south of the city to the Sauerland.\nThe Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund 254.3 m (834 ft). There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at 48.9 m (160 ft).\nThe Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called Stadtbezirke), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, H\u00f6rde, Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each  Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n\nStadtzentrum (City centre)\nHafenviertel (Harbour Quarter)\nNordmarkt\nBorsigplatz\nKaiserviertel\nKronenviertel\nKreuzviertel\nKlinikviertel (Clinical Quarter)\nSaarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\nUnionviertel\nGartenstadt\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately 9 to 10 \u00b0C (48 to 50 \u00b0F), the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately 800 mm (31 in). Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as Ostflucht (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical \"loss\" of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.\nAs of 2012, Dortmund had a population of 571,403 of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has large Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 2014 the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (49.9%) and Catholicism (27.4% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4 - I.N. Ag\u00edon Apost\u00f3lon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of \"guest workers\". Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 84,944 community members.\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, H\u00f6rde and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s. Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - German Evangelical Church Assembly.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Ullrich Sierau with variable majorities between SPD, CDU and Alliance '90/The Greens\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\n\nDortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\nDortmund is often called the Herzkammer der SPD (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Hen\u00dfler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): Ullrich Sierau (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nDortmund is twinned with:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.\n\n\n=== Urban districts ===\nUnlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.\n\n\n==== Kreuzviertel ====\n\nThe Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer and players of Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42 km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the Westfalenh\u00fctte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n\n\n==== Kaiserviertel ====\n\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n\n==== Unionviertel ====\n\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.\n\n\n==== H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix ====\n\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L\u00fcnen, Unna und Schwerte. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost \u20ac;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east\u2013west and 320 meters wide in north\u2013south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\nZalando\nHSBC Trinkaus\nGerman Handball Association\nHandball-Bundesliga (HBL)\nAcademy of the German public Bank\nMircosonicThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.\nThe River Emscher flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public water board Emschergenossenschaft. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by the year 2020.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nReinoldikirche, a Protestant church (built in 1233\u20131450)\nPetrikirche, a now Protestant church (start of construction 1322). It is famous for the huge carved altar (known as \"Golden Miracle of Dortmund\"), from 1521. It consists of 633 gilt carved oak figures depicting 30 scenes about Easter.\nMarienkirche, a now Protestant church originally built in 1170\u20131200 but rebuilt after World War II. The altar is from 1420.\nPropsteikirche, Monastery of the Dominican Order in the city center (built in 1331\u20131353)\nSt. Georg, Aplerbeck, the only Romasque cross basilica of Dortmund\nGro\u00dfe Kirche Aplerbeck, a Gothic revival church\nSt. Peter in Syburg suburb, the oldest church building in the city limits\nHeilig-Kreuz-Kirche, a Protestant church (start of construction 1911)\nSt.-Margareta Chapel, a Protestant chapel built in 1348\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Castles ===\nHaus Bodelschwingh (13th century), a moated castle\nHaus Dellwig (13th century), a moated castle partly rebuilt in the 17th century. The fa\u00e7ade and the steep tower, and two half-timbered buildings, are original.\nHaus Rodenberg (13th century), a moated castle\nAltes Stadthaus, built in 1899 by Friedrich Kullrich\nRomberg Park Gatehouse (17th century), once a gatehouse to a moated castle. Now it houses an art gallery.\nHusen Castle, the tower house of a former castle, in the borough of Syburg.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrial buildings ===\nThe most industrial building in Dortmund are part of the Industrial Heritage Trail (German: Route der Industriekultur). The trail links tourist attractions related to the industrial heritage in the whole Ruhr area in Germany. It is a part of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.\n\nU-Tower, former Dortmunder Union brewery, now a museum\nZollern II/IV Colliery, now part of the Westphalian Industrial Museum and an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH)\nHansa Coking Plant\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cultural buildings ===\nKonzerthaus Dortmund\nOpernhaus Dortmund, opera house built in 1966 on the site of the old synagogue which was destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.\nThe major art museums include the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte and the more recent Museum Ostwall.\nDASA, Germany Occupational Health and Safety Exhibition (German: Deutsche Arbeitsschutzausstellung)\nBrewery Museum Dortmund\nMuseum of Art and Cultural History\nGerman Football Museum\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other important buildings ===\nFlorianturm, (television tower Florian)\nWestfalenstadion: Football ground of Borussia Dortmund, licensed until 2021 under the name Signal Iduna Park\nClose to Westfalenstadion are the Westfalenhallen, a large convention centre, the site of several major conventions, trade fairs, ice-skating competitions, concerts and other major events since the 1950s.\nSteinwache memorial\n\n\n=== High-rise structures ===\nDortmund tallest structure is the Florianturm telecommunication tower at 266 m or 873 ft. Other tall buildings are the churches around the city centre. A selection of the tallest office buildings in Dortmund is listed below.\n\nRWE Tower (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestnetz Hochhaus Dortmund (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestfalentower (88 metre-high skyscraper)\nHarenberg City-Center (86 metre-high skyscraper)\nSparkassen-Hochhaus (70 metre-high skyscraper)\nIWO-Hochhaus(70 metre-high skyscraper)\nEllipson (66 metre-high skyscraper)\nVolkswohl Bund Hochhaus (60 metre-high skyscraper)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\n\nDortmund also serves as a major European and German crossroads for the Autobahnsystem. The Ruhrschnellweg follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the Ruhr Area. It crosses the Dutch-German border as a continuation of the Dutch A67 and crosses the Rhine, leads through the Ruhr valley toward Bochum, becoming B 1 (Bundesstra\u00dfe 1) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A 44 near Holzwickede. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to Der Spiegel, it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes A1 and A2, which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the Kamener Kreuz interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn A45 to the west these form the Dortmund Beltway (Dortmunder Autobahnring).\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a Bike freeway called the Radschnellweg Ruhr (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\nThe central train station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Dortmund with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive Stadtbahn and bus system. The Stadtbahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of L\u00fcnen in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last trams on the surface.A number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system. Night buses replace Stadtbahn services between 1:30 am and 7:30 am on weekends and public holidays. The central junction for the night bus service is Reinoldikirche in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.\nThe H-Bahn at Dortmund University of Technology is a hanging monorail built specifically to shuttle passengers between the university's two campuses, which are now also flanked by research laboratories and other high-tech corporations and startups. A nearly identical monorail system transfers passengers at D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nDortmund Airport is a medium-sized, but fast growing airport 13 km (8.1 mi) east of the city centre at the city limit to Holzwickede. The airport serves the area of the Ruhrgebiet, Sauerland, Westphalia and parts of the Netherlands and features flights to Munich, London, Vienna, Porto and a lot of eastern European city and leisure destinations. The airport is served by an express bus to Dortmund main station, a shuttle bus to the nearby railway station Holzwickede/Dortmund Flughafen, a bus to the city's metro line U47, as well as a bus to the city of Unna.\nIn 2019, the airport served 2,719,563 passengers mainly used for low-cost and leisure charter flights. The closest intercontinental airport is D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\nDortmund Harbour (Hafen) is the largest canal harbour in Europe and the 11th fluvial harbour in Germany.\n\nTransport in Dortmund\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDortmund has adapted since the collapse of its century long steel, coal and beer industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, biomedical technology, micro systems technology, engineering, tourism, finance, education, services and is thus one of the most dynamic new-economy cities in Germany. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow.Hundreds of SMEs are still based in and around Dortmund (often termed Mittelstand). Dortmund is also home to a number of medium-sized information technology companies, many linked to the local university TU Dortmund at the first technology center in Germany named \"Technologiepark Dortmund\" opened in the 1980s. With around 280 companies like Boehringer Ingelheim and Verizon Communications and more than 8,500 employees, TechnologiePark Dortmund is one of the most successful technology parks in Europe. The city works closely with research institutes, private universities, and companies to collaborate on the commercialisation of science initiatives. Furthermore, 680 IT and software companies with 12,000 employees are based in Dortmund, making the city one of Germany's biggest software locations. Two of the top 10 IT service provider in Germany are based in Dortmund -  adesso SE and Materna Group.Dortmund is home to many insurance companies e.g. Signal Iduna, Continentale Krankenversicherung, Bundesinnungskrankenkasse Gesundheit (BIG direkt) and Volkswohl Bund. In recent years a service sector and high-tech industry have grown up. Some of its most prominent companies of these sectors include Amprion and RWE-Westnetz (Electricity), Rhenus Logistics (Logistics), Wilo, KHS GmbH, Elmos Semiconductor, ABP Induction Systems, Nordwest Handel AG \u2013 all of whom have their headquarters here. Companies with operations in or around Dortmund include Zalando, Daimler AG: EvoBus, RapidMiner, Gap Inc. and ThyssenKrupp.\nDortmund is also the headquarter of Century Media Records, a heavy metal record label with offices in the United States and London. In August 2015, Century Media was acquired by Sony Music for US$17 million.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism in Dortmund is a fast-growing economic factor every year: new overnight records can be announced, new hotels open and new visitor magnets are added. Starting in the mid-1990s, Dortmund, formerly an industrial centre, saw rapid development that expanded its cultural and tourism possibilities, and transformed it into a newly vibrant city. An important strategic step was the start of construction the new Konzerthaus Dortmund, the reuse of vacant old industrial buildings like the Zollern II/IV Colliery, Kokerei Hansa, Dortmund U-Tower and the strategic reorientation of the Dortmund Christmas market with over 300 stalls packed around a gigantic Christmas tree creation that stands 45 metres tall \u2013 reputed to be the biggest in the world. A new Tourist Information center right next to the U-Tower, gives visitors a quick overview of the tourist attractions in the City and Ruhr Area. Today Dortmund is with more than 1.450.528 (2017) overnight stays one of the most popular destinations in North Rhine-Westphalia.The majority of tourists are domestic visitors, coming from Germany. International travellers arrive from the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland. Dortmund also draws business tourism, having been equipped with facilities like WILO, Amprion next to Westfalenhallen and football tourism with Fans of Borussia Dortmund. The top 5 most visited attractions were the Christmas market, with more than three and a half million visitors, Signal Iduna Park, Deutsches Fu\u00dfballmuseum, Dortmund U-Tower, Zollern II/IV Colliery and Westfalenpark.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nThe Westenhellweg is a popular shopping destination and with nearly 13,000 visitors per hour it was Germany's most frequented shopping street in 2013. During the Middle Ages, Dortmund was the only free imperial city in Westphalia, having already been regarded as an important centre of trade. Today some of the most reputed shops, department stores have stores here. It is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by the Reinoldikirche in the east and U-Tower in the west. The Westenhellweg has one of the highest rents for retail and office space in North Rhine-Westphalia. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as H&M, Saturn, Esprit, Zara or NewYorker. In 2009 a new shopping mall named Thier-Galerie opened, with nearly 100 stores and chains, including; Armani, Adidas, Diesel and Hollister.\nThree more shopping malls occupy the Thier-Galerie; Galeria Kaufhof and Karstadt, as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from Peek & Cloppenburg and C&A. During the month before Christmas, the extended pedestrian-only zone is host to Dortmund Christmas Market, one of the largest and oldest Christmas markets in Germany. With more than 3.5 million visitors and 300 stalls around a gigantic Christmas tree that stands 45 metres tall, it is one of the most visited and popular market in the world.In close proximity to the Dortmund concert hall lies the Br\u00fcckstra\u00dfenviertel  - a quarter hub especially for young people. The \"Rue de Pommes Frites\", which is what the Dortmund citizens have called the Br\u00fcckstra\u00dfe, has turned into a modern shopping promenade, geared towards a younger market.\nFor a long time, the Kampstra\u00dfe had a shadowy existence as a parallel street to the Westenhellweg and Ostenhellweg, but it has become a grand boulevard containing specialist stores. Right next to the Kampstra\u00dfe is the Kleppingstra\u00dfe  \u2013 a shopping street with a high concentration of gastronomy and expensive, prestigious shops like van Laack, Lindner Fashion, Marc Cain. It is located between the Ostenhellweg and Neutor to Wallring.\n\n\n=== Port and Logistic ===\n\nDortmund is one of the most important logistic hubs in Germany, more than 900 companies working in logistics, as well as nationally and internationally recognised scientific institutes.

        "wiki": "Dortmund (, also UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u0254\u0281tm\u028ant] (listen); Westphalian Low German: D\u00fc\u00f6rpm [\u02c8dy\u02d0\u0153\u0250\u032fpm\u0329]; Latin: Tremonia) is with a population of 603,609 inhabitants as of 2020, the third-largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany's eighth-largest city. It is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area with some 5.1 million inhabitants, as well as the largest city of Westphalia. On the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine), it lies in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg.\nFounded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund consequently was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 230% of buildings in the inner city center. These bombing raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, hold the record to a single target in World War II.The region has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Unionand is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries and logistics. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction, especially for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as Europe (Benelux countries), and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions, including the Technical University of Dortmund and Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, International School of Management and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities with over 49,000 students, many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. The city is known as Westphalia's \"green metropolis\". Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past.\nDortmund is home to Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund, commonly known as Borussia Dortmund, a successful club in German football.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Sigiburg was a Saxon hillfort in the South of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by Westphalian Saxons. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni \u2013 In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the \"Ecclesiastical council\" and in 1016 the\"Imperial diet\" meets in Dortmund.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===\n\nAfter it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold's Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court (German: Freistuhl) was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the Femelinde. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 - Stadtgymnasium Dortmund. The 1661 earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.\n\n\n=== 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n\nWith the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\nDuring the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch - a right military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. Radical workers formed a Red Army who fought the freikorps units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nUnder Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients for euthanasia at the Hadamar mental hospital as part of the Action T4 (an additional 229 children were killed in the \"Children's Specialist Department\", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941).\nBombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenh\u00fctte AG, the \"Hoesch-Benzin GmbH\" synthetic oil plant, and the Zeche Hansa. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped through Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\n\nPost-war, most of the ancient buildings were not restored, and large parts of the city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 Coalmining pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict H\u00f6rde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nDortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are 87 km (54 mi) long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten kreisangeh\u00f6rig (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4 million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, L\u00fcnen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills in the south of the city to the Sauerland.\nThe Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund 254.3 m (834 ft). There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at 48.9 m (160 ft).\nThe Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called Stadtbezirke), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, H\u00f6rde, Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each  Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n\nStadtzentrum (City centre)\nHafenviertel (Harbour Quarter)\nNordmarkt\nBorsigplatz\nKaiserviertel\nKronenviertel\nKreuzviertel\nKlinikviertel (Clinical Quarter)\nSaarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\nUnionviertel\nGartenstadt\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately 9 to 10 \u00b0C (48 to 50 \u00b0F), the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately 800 mm (31 in). Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as Ostflucht (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical \"loss\" of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.\nAs of 2012, Dortmund had a population of 571,403 of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has large Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 2014 the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (49.9%) and Catholicism (27.4% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4 - I.N. Ag\u00edon Apost\u00f3lon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of \"guest workers\". Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia with more than 84,944 community members.\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, H\u00f6rde and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s. Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 Mosques.\nIn June 2019 Dortmund is hosting the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag - German Evangelical Church Assembly.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDortmund's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Ullrich Sierau with variable majorities between SPD, CDU and Alliance '90/The Greens\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\n\nDortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\nDortmund is often called the Herzkammer der SPD (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Hen\u00dfler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): Ullrich Sierau (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nDortmund is twinned with:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.\n\n\n=== Urban districts ===\nUnlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.\n\n\n==== Kreuzviertel ====\n\nThe Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer and players of Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42 km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the Westfalenh\u00fctte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n\n\n==== Kaiserviertel ====\n\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n\n==== Unionviertel ====\n\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.\n\n\n==== H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix ====\n\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L\u00fcnen, Unna und Schwerte. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost \u20ac;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east\u2013west and 320 meters wide in north\u2013south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\nZalando\nHSBC Trinkaus\nGerman Handball Association\nHandball-Bundesliga (HBL)\nAcademy of the German public Bank\nMircosonicThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.\nThe River Emscher flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public water board Emschergenossenschaft. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by the year 2020.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nReinoldikirche, a Protestant church (built in 1233\u20131450)\nPetrikirche, a now Protestant church (start of construction 1322). It is famous for the huge carved altar (known as \"Golden Miracle of Dortmund\"), from 1521. It consists of 633 gilt carved oak figures depicting 30 scenes about Easter.\nMarienkirche, a now Protestant church originally built in 1170\u20131200 but rebuilt after World War II. The altar is from 1420.\nPropsteikirche, Monastery of the Dominican Order in the city center (built in 1331\u20131353)\nSt. Georg, Aplerbeck, the only Romasque cross basilica of Dortmund\nGro\u00dfe Kirche Aplerbeck, a Gothic revival church\nSt. Peter in Syburg suburb, the oldest church building in the city limits\nHeilig-Kreuz-Kirche, a Protestant church (start of construction 1911)\nSt.-Margareta Chapel, a Protestant chapel built in 1348\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Castles ===\nHaus Bodelschwingh (13th century), a moated castle\nHaus Dellwig (13th century), a moated castle partly rebuilt in the 17th century. The fa\u00e7ade and the steep tower, and two half-timbered buildings, are original.\nHaus Rodenberg (13th century), a moated castle\nAltes Stadthaus, built in 1899 by Friedrich Kullrich\nRomberg Park Gatehouse (17th century), once a gatehouse to a moated castle. Now it houses an art gallery.\nHusen Castle, the tower house of a former castle, in the borough of Syburg.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrial buildings ===\nThe most industrial building in Dortmund are part of the Industrial Heritage Trail (German: Route der Industriekultur). The trail links tourist attractions related to the industrial heritage in the whole Ruhr area in Germany. It is a part of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.\n\nU-Tower, former Dortmunder Union brewery, now a museum\nZollern II/IV Colliery, now part of the Westphalian Industrial Museum and an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH)\nHansa Coking Plant\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cultural buildings ===\nKonzerthaus Dortmund\nOpernhaus Dortmund, opera house built in 1966 on the site of the old synagogue which was destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.\nThe major art museums include the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte and the more recent Museum Ostwall.\nDASA, Germany Occupational Health and Safety Exhibition (German: Deutsche Arbeitsschutzausstellung)\nBrewery Museum Dortmund\nMuseum of Art and Cultural History\nGerman Football Museum\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other important buildings ===\nFlorianturm, (television tower Florian)\nWestfalenstadion: Football ground of Borussia Dortmund, licensed until 2021 under the name Signal Iduna Park\nClose to Westfalenstadion are the Westfalenhallen, a large convention centre, the site of several major conventions, trade fairs, ice-skating competitions, concerts and other major events since the 1950s.\nSteinwache memorial\n\n\n=== High-rise structures ===\nDortmund tallest structure is the Florianturm telecommunication tower at 266 m or 873 ft. Other tall buildings are the churches around the city centre. A selection of the tallest office buildings in Dortmund is listed below.\n\nRWE Tower (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestnetz Hochhaus Dortmund (100 metre-high skyscraper)\nWestfalentower (88 metre-high skyscraper)\nHarenberg City-Center (86 metre-high skyscraper)\nSparkassen-Hochhaus (70 metre-high skyscraper)\nIWO-Hochhaus(70 metre-high skyscraper)\nEllipson (66 metre-high skyscraper)\nVolkswohl Bund Hochhaus (60 metre-high skyscraper)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\n\nDortmund also serves as a major European and German crossroads for the Autobahnsystem. The Ruhrschnellweg follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the Ruhr Area. It crosses the Dutch-German border as a continuation of the Dutch A67 and crosses the Rhine, leads through the Ruhr valley toward Bochum, becoming B 1 (Bundesstra\u00dfe 1) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A 44 near Holzwickede. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to Der Spiegel, it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes A1 and A2, which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the Kamener Kreuz interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn A45 to the west these form the Dortmund Beltway (Dortmunder Autobahnring).\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a Bike freeway called the Radschnellweg Ruhr (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\nThe central train station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Dortmund with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive Stadtbahn and bus system. The Stadtbahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of L\u00fcnen in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last trams on the surface.A number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system. Night buses replace Stadtbahn services between 1:30 am and 7:30 am on weekends and public holidays. The central junction for the night bus service is Reinoldikirche in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.\nThe H-Bahn at Dortmund University of Technology is a hanging monorail built specifically to shuttle passengers between the university's two campuses, which are now also flanked by research laboratories and other high-tech corporations and startups. A nearly identical monorail system transfers passengers at D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nDortmund Airport is a medium-sized, but fast growing airport 13 km (8.1 mi) east of the city centre at the city limit to Holzwickede. The airport serves the area of the Ruhrgebiet, Sauerland, Westphalia and parts of the Netherlands and features flights to Munich, London, Vienna, Porto and a lot of eastern European city and leisure destinations. The airport is served by an express bus to Dortmund main station, a shuttle bus to the nearby railway station Holzwickede/Dortmund Flughafen, a bus to the city's metro line U47, as well as a bus to the city of Unna.\nIn 2019, the airport served 2,719,563 passengers mainly used for low-cost and leisure charter flights. The closest intercontinental airport is D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\nDortmund Harbour (Hafen) is the largest canal harbour in Europe and the 11th fluvial harbour in Germany.\n\nTransport in Dortmund\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDortmund has adapted since the collapse of its century long steel, coal and beer industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, biomedical technology, micro systems technology, engineering, tourism, finance, education, services and is thus one of the most dynamic new-economy cities in Germany. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a Node city in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow.Hundreds of SMEs are still based in and around Dortmund (often termed Mittelstand). Dortmund is also home to a number of medium-sized information technology companies, many linked to the local university TU Dortmund at the first technology center in Germany named \"Technologiepark Dortmund\" opened in the 1980s. With around 280 companies like Boehringer Ingelheim and Verizon Communications and more than 8,500 employees, TechnologiePark Dortmund is one of the most successful technology parks in Europe. The city works closely with research institutes, private universities, and companies to collaborate on the commercialisation of science initiatives. Furthermore, 680 IT and software companies with 12,000 employees are based in Dortmund, making the city one of Germany's biggest software locations. Two of the top 10 IT service provider in Germany are based in Dortmund -  adesso SE and Materna Group.Dortmund is home to many insurance companies e.g. Signal Iduna, Continentale Krankenversicherung, Bundesinnungskrankenkasse Gesundheit (BIG direkt) and Volkswohl Bund. In recent years a service sector and high-tech industry have grown up. Some of its most prominent companies of these sectors include Amprion and RWE-Westnetz (Electricity), Rhenus Logistics (Logistics), Wilo, KHS GmbH, Elmos Semiconductor, ABP Induction Systems, Nordwest Handel AG \u2013 all of whom have their headquarters here. Companies with operations in or around Dortmund include Zalando, Daimler AG: EvoBus, RapidMiner, Gap Inc. and ThyssenKrupp.\nDortmund is also the headquarter of Century Media Records, a heavy metal record label with offices in the United States and London. In August 2015, Century Media was acquired by Sony Music for US$17 million.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism in Dortmund is a fast-growing economic factor every year: new overnight records can be announced, new hotels open and new visitor magnets are added. Starting in the mid-1990s, Dortmund, formerly an industrial centre, saw rapid development that expanded its cultural and tourism possibilities, and transformed it into a newly vibrant city. An important strategic step was the start of construction the new Konzerthaus Dortmund, the reuse of vacant old industrial buildings like the Zollern II/IV Colliery, Kokerei Hansa, Dortmund U-Tower and the strategic reorientation of the Dortmund Christmas market with over 300 stalls packed around a gigantic Christmas tree creation that stands 45 metres tall \u2013 reputed to be the biggest in the world. A new Tourist Information center right next to the U-Tower, gives visitors a quick overview of the tourist attractions in the City and Ruhr Area. Today Dortmund is with more than 1.450.528 (2017) overnight stays one of the most popular destinations in North Rhine-Westphalia.The majority of tourists are domestic visitors, coming from Germany. International travellers arrive from the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland. Dortmund also draws business tourism, having been equipped with facilities like WILO, Amprion next to Westfalenhallen and football tourism with Fans of Borussia Dortmund. The top 5 most visited attractions were the Christmas market, with more than three and a half million visitors, Signal Iduna Park, Deutsches Fu\u00dfballmuseum, Dortmund U-Tower, Zollern II/IV Colliery and Westfalenpark.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nThe Westenhellweg is a popular shopping destination and with nearly 13,000 visitors per hour it was Germany's most frequented shopping street in 2013. During the Middle Ages, Dortmund was the only free imperial city in Westphalia, having already been regarded as an important centre of trade. Today some of the most reputed shops, department stores have stores here. It is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by the Reinoldikirche in the east and U-Tower in the west. The Westenhellweg has one of the highest rents for retail and office space in North Rhine-Westphalia. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as H&M, Saturn, Esprit, Zara or NewYorker. In 2009 a new shopping mall named Thier-Galerie opened, with nearly 100 stores and chains, including; Armani, Adidas, Diesel and Hollister.\nThree more shopping malls occupy the Thier-Galerie; Galeria Kaufhof and Karstadt, as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from Peek & Cloppenburg and C&A. During the month before Christmas, the extended pedestrian-only zone is host to Dortmund Christmas Market, one of the largest and oldest Christmas markets in Germany. With more than 3.5 million visitors and 300 stalls around a gigantic Christmas tree that stands 45 metres tall, it is one of the most visited and popular market in the world.In close proximity to the Dortmund concert hall lies the Br\u00fcckstra\u00dfenviertel  - a quarter hub especially for young people. The \"Rue de Pommes Frites\", which is what the Dortmund citizens have called the Br\u00fcckstra\u00dfe, has turned into a modern shopping promenade, geared towards a younger market.\nFor a long time, the Kampstra\u00dfe had a shadowy existence as a parallel street to the Westenhellweg and Ostenhellweg, but it has become a grand boulevard containing specialist stores. Right next to the Kampstra\u00dfe is the Kleppingstra\u00dfe  \u2013 a shopping street with a high concentration of gastronomy and expensive, prestigious shops like van Laack, Lindner Fashion, Marc Cain. It is located between the Ostenhellweg and Neutor to Wallring.\n\n\n=== Port and Logistic ===\n\nDortmund is one of the most important logistic hubs in Germany, more than 900 companies working in logistics, as well as nationally and internationally recognised scientific institutes. Dortmund Port which terminates the Dortmund-Ems Canal connecting Dortmund to the North Sea is the biggest European canal port with 10 docks and a pier length of 11 km. The variety of different activities taking place at the Fraunhofer Institute Material Flow and Logistics (Fraunhofer Society) has, over the past few years, led to a bundling of skills in the areas of logistics and digitalisation in the city. Industry-based initiatives and pilot projects, such as the Hybrid Services in Logistics innovation lab, the efficiency cluster LogistikRuhr, Industrial Data Space, the Dortmund Mittelstand 4.0 Centre of Excellence, and the enterprise labs. The Digital Hub for Logistics of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy is based in Dortmund and twinned with Hamburg.\nCompanies with big logistic hubs for Germany and Europe in Dortmund include:\n\nAmazon\nIKEA\nDecathlon\nRhenus Logistics\nSchenker AG\n\n\n=== Fairs ===\nDortmund is home to Germany's twelve biggest exhibition centre, Halls of Westphalia which lies near the city center next to Dortmund Airport.

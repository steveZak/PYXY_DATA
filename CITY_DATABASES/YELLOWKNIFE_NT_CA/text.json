        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9. However, the population is slightly disproportionate in terms of age distribution compared to the national average of 41.0. As of the 2016 figures, 13.9% of residents were 9 or under, 6.0% were from 10 to 14 years old, 13.1% were from 15 to 24, 34.1.2% were from 25 to 44, 22.0% were from 45 to 59, and 10.9% were 60 or older.\n\nIn 2016, the average household size was 2.7 and the majority of the population with children had either one or two. In 2015 the average income in the city was C$73,500, and the average income for a family was C$160,394, with 7.9% of all families earning less than $30,000. Minimum wage in Yellowknife and the NWT is C$13.46 (2018). Average household expenditures were C$125,783 in 2015. In 2016, the unemployment rate was at 5.9%; the employment rate for males was 80.1%, for females it was 75.2%.The crime rate in Yellowknife for 2016 was 46.7 (per 1,000 persons) for violent crimes, and 167.2 (per 1,000 persons) for property crimes. There were 299 births and 62 deaths in 2014.English was the mother tongue of 80.0% of residents and 3.2% spoke French.

In total 3.0% of the population said that an Indigenous language was their mother tongue.Not including the 11 official languages there are over 70 different languages that Yellowknifers stated were their mother tongue. These include Indo-European languages (4.2%); Austronesian languages (3.9%); Indo-Iranian languages and Germanic languages (1.1% each); Sino-Tibetan languages and Chinese languages and Indo-Aryan languages (1.0% each). The five main individual languages are Tagalog (3.2%); Vietnamese (0.8%); German (0.6%); Cantonese and Spanish (0.5% each).Yellowknife is home to 695 recent immigrants (arriving between 2011 and 2016) who now make up 3.7% of the population. Of the recent immigrants 70.5% came from Asia; 15.1% from Africa and 7.2% from both the Americas and Europe. Of the recent immigrants 40.0% came from the Philippines, while 10.8% came from several African countries, 5.8% each from India, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, 4.3% from each of Japan and South Korea and 2.2% from IsraelYellowknife is primarily populated by European with a population of 11,680 (60.6% of total). The total Indigenous peoples population 4,375 representing 22.7% of the population (12.7% First Nations, 7.0% M\u00e9tis), and 3.0% Inuit.

For specific denominations Statistics Canada found that 36% of residents identified as Roman Catholic, 11% as Anglican, 10% for the United Church, about 2% each as Baptists, Lutheran, and Pentecostal, and more than 1% for The Salvation Army. There were also 135 Buddhists, 125 Muslims, and 15 Jews.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nFolk on the Rocks is a local music festival that has been an annual occurrence since 1980. The event features a wide variety of musical acts; it is not limited to only Folk. In the past, it has drawn acts such as Buffy Sainte-Marie, the Trailer Park Boys, The Weakerthans, African Guitar Summit, Corb Lund, Fred Penner, Stan Rogers, Gord Downie, Tanya Tagaq, Dan Mangan, Sam Roberts Band, Sloan, The Strumbellas, Joel Plaskett, Ron Sexsmith and Hawksley Workman.\nThe Midnight Sun Golf Tournament, with games played through the city's well-lit summer nights, is also a significant cultural event.\nDuring the winter, there is the Snowking Winter Festival, featuring a snow castle on Great Slave Lake which hosts a month of cultural activities\nThe Long John Jamboree, a new winter festival, took place 23\u201325 March 2012 on the frozen Yellowknife Bay next to the Snowking castle, in Yellowknife's Old Town neighbourhood. Events include an ice sculpture contest sponsored by De Beers Canada, cultural events like Dene hand games, games, live music, a beer garden, food vendors, skating rink, artist's market, and much more.\nYellowknife hosted the inaugural 1970 Arctic Winter Games, and has since hosted athletes and artists from circumpolar regions at the biennial multi-sport and multi-cultural event in 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2008 Arctic Winter Games.\nThe Old Town Ramble & Ride Festival started in 2006 and happens every summer for three days on the August long weekend.

The popular restaurant still operates in its original building during the summer, which was moved to its current location after being saved from demolition in the late 1970s. The Wildcat Cafe has been renovated from 2011 to 2013, and during these times there were a few ups and downs to get the place ready for open. The City hosted a grand opening of the new Wildcat Cafe on 16 June 2013.\nThe Gold Range Bar, (also known as The Strange Range and listed in the circa 1989 phonebook as such) one of the oldest and most colourful drinking establishments in the Northwest Territories and featured in Elizabeth Hay's novel \"Late Nights On Air\" and Mordecai Richler's novel Solomon Gursky Was Here.\nDowntown contains the Capital Area Park, a short but pleasant stroll by City Hall, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, the Legislature.\nThe Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre is a museum containing exhibits of the history and culture of Inuit, Inuvialuit, Dene, M\u00e9tis and non-aboriginal peoples of the NWT.

          "A few stairs up and you have a beautiful view of Yellowknife and the lake. It's a little breezy up there so be better prepared than I was. Dress warm. I was there in December.",
          "The monument is atop a hill, so you have a great view of the town and the Great Slave Lake. A must do for some panoramic photos.",
          "We were staying in Old Town and this was recommended for both historical reasons and also a convenient way to spot an Aurora without heading out of town. We headed up around 9pm after peaking at the AuroraMax camera and sure enough there was a streak right across the sky.",
          "It gives a great view of the lake and the town. Unfortunately, the abundant graffiti made it seem slightly dodgy. Easy stairs make the climb suitable for most people",
          "Lots of stairs to climb but gives a good view of Yellowknife and especially where the float planes land. If you are there from Sept until end of May make sure you are properly bundled up and have mitts and hats. It can get windy and cold up there.",
          "Great view of Yellowknife. Can see the city and house boats. Nice to sit and watch the float planes. Not easily accessible for people with wheelchairs.",
          "If the weather is no good or cloudy in Yellowknife, it is impossible to watch Aurora. But if you rent a car from airport, you can spend one day in town area to have fun!",
          "This is one of 'the' sights to see in Yellowknife. The monument is very simple. It's a wonderful tribute to the pilots who gave their lives in a high risk job to help develop Canada's northern territories. The big feature here is the incredible view of the city, lake areas,",
          "It is a bit of a climb ( about 70 steps I was told by my grandson) but certainly the view is worth the effort! One can see the harbour with the houseboats, as well as the main section of the old town. Float planes were landing as we watched. It was interesting to read the",
          "Can have a birds-eye view of the lake and the town from there. A bit tired to climb up to the top in snow but worth visiting.",
          "My parents came for a visit to Yellowknife and we took them to the pilots monument. It is not too hard of a visit physically. It is a climb of approximately 70 steps. Once you reach the top the view is breathtaking. You can see the harbour with all the houseboats, as well as",
          "We were interested to see this because our son had shown us a photo taken from it in winter conditions. The plaque was informative. Of course, we did not see the winter road to Dettah on the frozen lake.",
          "There are some steps to get to the top, but it is probably the best bird-eye view of Yellowknife. There is the monument, but if you want to look like you hike up a mountain... there are exposed natural rocks just a few steps away for some cool pictures. Overall, easy to get to",
          "There are a few steps leading up to this lookout so be warned that you will need to climb up. The 360 view you get of Yellowknife from above is fantastic. You can see the old town along with the new part of Yellowknife, and enjoy the planes coming in for a landing. If you have",
          "The City of Yellowknife began around this Rock and how appropriate to put a monument to the pilots' that made living in the far north possible. This is not handicap accessible but there are a couple of \"rest landings\" on the way up. Pick a sunny day for the exceptional views.",
          "There were many steps to climb to get to the top, but this is worth it for the view of the city and lake area. I saw float planes and houseboats from this spot.",
          "A climb up about 100 stairs. The view is incredible. Well worth the walk. Resting stations on the way up.",
          "Whether geocaching, taking photos, or getting a piece of history... This is a Yellowknife must. Take a photo of boats, eagles, house boats, sunsets or even sunrises. Read the various plaques or try to solve the nearby geocache. :) Welcome to our beautiful city.",
          "Short walk up to the top. Was snowing at the time and the view was great. I really enjoyed the monument and would recommend travellers to Yellowknife to visit it.",
          "Well worth the flight of stairs to see the 360 degree view of the back bays, houseboats and of course Yellowknife! Almost all the posted pics I see in the shops if Yellowknife are from this advantage! If you miss this spot you have missed Yellowknife!",
          "This is a place you have to see. You can see all of the Old Town and most of the lake. All around you are gorgeous views whether it is the bay with boat houses or it is the scenic forest. This monument also gives you the ability to walk all around Old Town which is so worth",
          "Always bring your camera. The short climb up the stairs affords a great vista where there is always lots going on all around you. The experience changes with the seasons and weather so it is always a good time to go. Bundle up if it is windy. Plenty of free parking is across the",
          "Great view of old town Yellowknife. Very short climb up some stairs. Worth checking out if you're in town.",
          "The monument sits high above Yellowknife and allows a wonderful view of the lake and the city. in the summer time you can see all he house boats and in the winter you can see the ice road and the ice castle. I go up every time I am in YK",
          "While you are in Old Town it is a nice walk for a splendid view of the city. You are able to have a good 360 degree look of the area",
          "What a beautiful place for this monument. We trekked up the hill in the middle of winter and we stayed here for a good hour just admiring the views, reading about the monument and enjoying the snow fall. We are also fans of Ice Lake Rebels so it was cool to see some of the",
          "A short walk up the stairs gives you a great view of Yellowknife. Located in the old town you get a 360 degree view of the surrounds. Make sure you spend some time reading the plaques and wonder how did we ever really explore the north",
          "If you visit or live in Yellowknife, you must make one visit to this spot. It is easy to get to. There is a parking lot at the base. An easy climb by stairs (careful at one flight, where the stair heights are shorter). This place will give you a very good look at",
          "I loved being on top of the monument. It offers a wonderful 360\u00b0 view encompassing the city, lakeshore, the colourful floating houses, etc. This is especially a must for first-time visitors and photographers. On the whole, it is calm other than the noise coming from the roads",
          "Sixty three stairs but well worth the climb. Once you reach the top the view is amazing. You can see 360 degrees, Back Bay, Yellowknife Bay, Old town etc.",
          "The monument is disappointing but the view of the area is well worth the climb up the steps. This is a must do activity.",
          "walking up the stairs you feel like you can't wait to see the view, and when you finally get to the top, its jaw dropping. lots to look at",
          "This is one of my favourite spots in Yellowknife. First because it pays tribute to the many bush pilots who helped open the north. Second because if is high enough to offer a spectacular view of the city and Great Slave Lake. There are quite a few stairs to climb so please",
          "Really worth to go up because you can see the panarama! But keep warm! Make sure you come back before dark ...",
          "This monument is at the highest spot around, and is easily accessible. The views in all directions are great, and if you are lucky you will see planes taking off and landing. Not to be missed if you are visiting Yellowknife.",
          "The walk up isn't as bad as it looks. My husband is almost 70 and he managed ok. Best all round view of area. Especially the lake . Info signs show great history.",
          "Must be able to climb stairs but the 360 degrees view is wonderful of Yellowknife...Old Town and New Town!",
          "I highly recommend to stop by this place. You can have very clear view from the top(even if there is nothing much to see). Just cool down and take a picture!",
          "Visited here a couple of times for fabulous views across all of Yellowknife. Fairly easy to get to via a wooden staircase but as with everywhere there is obviously some ice about so wear good footwear. Worth the climb to watch the town for a while. Take it in as part of a walk",
          "Good views of the city and frozen lake, but nothing spectacular. You can just walk to it from the old town and get done with it in less than 30 min.",
          "Amazing history and view of Latham Island and Back Bay. Clear view of new town and Old town. Loved it.",
          "If you walk to the Old Town, you will not miss the Bush Pilot Monument as this is the highest point in the Old Town. It seems the stairs have recently been renovated and it is not difficult to walk up the stairs to the top, where you will have the panaramic view of the Old Town,",
          "Parking lot on Ingraham road. An easy walk from anywhere in Old Town. A great 360 degree view of the area",
          "the monument is on the highest point overlooking Yellowknife Bay. It is a must-visit place if you are in Yellowknife.",
          "It was a little difficult for us to find our way up to Bush Pilot's Monument, but worth it to see a panoramic view of Yellowknife and we even ran into a group of ptarmigans on our way to the monument.",
          "Stairs make it easy to get to the top, and the view is pretty good! You can look back at Yellowknife, see the houseboats, and basically anything else! It's the spot in the Knife to capture a good photo.",
          "The view is spectacular! It is a climb but easy steps, not tiny straight up ones. Great pictures from the deck. Worth the time and the climb!",
          "It was bitter cold with a slight wind when we visited but still enjoyed the view of the lake and the new town.",
          "Gorgeous view, easy steps up, and worth taking the time to do. You'll get great pictures no matter what time of year.",
          "We arrived in Yellowknife and went straight to Bullocks for lunch. Just up the hill was the Bush Pilots monument and decided to walk up. It is a beautiful spot on a high point over looking the bay. In January understand that it is snow covered and the bay and all water is",
          "This is a great place to see Yellowknife, the Old Town and the Great Slave Lake. The place is small and easy to access. A few stairs too get you to the top. It has historical significance too highlighted on a number of plaques along the way to the top.",

          "a very good peak to look the whole old town and the lake and photo taking point. not a long walk the nearby attractions as well",
          "Awesome views of the lake and city from this point. It was early January when we visited and we got a great view of the ice road to Dettah as well. Just be careful going up and down the access stairways when they are covered with snow.",
          "It's really just a set of stairs, but the view from the top is a 360 panorama of Yellowknife and Great Slave Lake. This was our first stop when we arrived at sunset, a great way to start a visit to YK.",
          "Bush Pilot's Monument is the highest point of Yellowknife and provides a great view of both old town and new town. We were there both during the day and night. A great place to view the city and the Great Slave lake.",
          "It was pretty good. If you go see this go through old town too. It is a short walk up a staircase and you are there. Stairs can be slippery in the winter. The view isn't spectacular but it is worth seeing.",
          "Easy to climb stairs with a few landings to stop and take in different views on the way up. Once at the top of the monument you have great views all around. Some interesting history of the area is written on the different brass plaques around the site as well. Definitely worth",

          "As a life long resident of Yellowknife, no matter how many times I visit the Pilots Monument that it is loved anew each time I go there. My favorite time is at sunset or sun down or a nice day in winter or summer that permits us to see the plans landing and taking off. It is a",
          "this monument offers the best view of the city, for photo lovers this is a must visit place, suggest to drive there otherwise it would be a 10 minutes uphill walk",
          "this is a really impressive place. Not only do you see the monument, but you also have an incredible 360 degree view of Yelowknife and surroundings. The one downside: the stairs go on forever. Take your time if you have bad knees!",
          "360 view of Yellowknife and the surrounding area. Stop in at Wild Cat Cafe for good fish and cold Canadian beer.",
          "Different view between winter season and fall season. The best way to admire the Great Slave Lake. It is a very easy access walking distance from old town. Winter time will be a bit slippery",

          "we visit the monument every time we have visitors from out of town. It is a favourite spot of mine. Unfortunately, there are a few steps to climb, not very accessible if you are not very fit or have strollers with you. But if you manage to get up, you get rewarded with the most",
          "Long hike up the stairs but worth it to me. I was advised to go there when I stopped at the 60th Parallel visitor's center. I enjoy history and flying so of course it was of interest. The view was outstanding.",
          "Neat hill and views. Great to climb after dinner and watch the sunset. Also helpful just to get oriented to the area a little bit. Views of the water and houseboats are neat.",

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous.

The event features a wide variety of musical acts; it is not limited to only Folk. In the past, it has drawn acts such as Buffy Sainte-Marie, the Trailer Park Boys, The Weakerthans, African Guitar Summit, Corb Lund, Fred Penner, Stan Rogers, Gord Downie, Tanya Tagaq, Dan Mangan, Sam Roberts Band, Sloan, The Strumbellas, Joel Plaskett, Ron Sexsmith and Hawksley Workman.\nThe Midnight Sun Golf Tournament, with games played through the city's well-lit summer nights, is also a significant cultural event.\nDuring the winter, there is the Snowking Winter Festival, featuring a snow castle on Great Slave Lake which hosts a month of cultural activities\nThe Long John Jamboree, a new winter festival, took place 23\u201325 March 2012 on the frozen Yellowknife Bay next to the Snowking castle, in Yellowknife's Old Town neighbourhood.

The popular restaurant still operates in its original building during the summer, which was moved to its current location after being saved from demolition in the late 1970s. The Wildcat Cafe has been renovated from 2011 to 2013, and during these times there were a few ups and downs to get the place ready for open. The City hosted a grand opening of the new Wildcat Cafe on 16 June 2013.\nThe Gold Range Bar, (also known as The Strange Range and listed in the circa 1989 phonebook as such) one of the oldest and most colourful drinking establishments in the Northwest Territories and featured in Elizabeth Hay's novel \"Late Nights On Air\" and Mordecai Richler's novel Solomon Gursky Was Here.\nDowntown contains the Capital Area Park, a short but pleasant stroll by City Hall, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, the Legislature.\nThe Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre is a museum containing exhibits of the history and culture of Inuit, Inuvialuit, Dene, M\u00e9tis and non-aboriginal peoples of the NWT.

          "Lots of neat exhibits of animals, art, and culture. We spent an hour, but you could easily spend two or more. No gift shop, so you have to go to the visitor's center for that.",
          "We were expecting more culture when we planned our trip to Yellowknife. So when we went to the museum it was nice to experience culture, history and the northern life.",
          "This museum was great! Free entrance to the museum which is great since Yellowknife is so expensive. The exhibits were fantastic and interactive. Highly recommend. The museum cafe we stopped to have a coffee and dessert- also worth doing (cheap).",

          "By donation. Several amazing exhibits, including that of the Steppe Bison. It was buried in permafrost for more than 13,000 years, so when it came out, it still had some skin, flesh and hair. Professional interpretive panels explain this animal and compares to modern bison.",
          "Theres some pretty interesting stuff here but wasn't blown away. I was in and out in just over 30 minutes and that was enough. I heard the food here is really good, but a Pepsi runs you 3$...",
          "This is a very interesting place with all sorts of exhibits covering a wide range of Yellowknife/NWT history and life. It is well worth the visit even if you only have a short amount of time to walk through. Art, sculptures, videos, a moose skin canoe, mining, aviation, winter",

          "We went last year, in October 2013, and visited for an hour. This year, returning to Yellowknife in September, 2014, we didn't bother. There just wasn't much there. It's worth a quick trip, I don't recall a fee, but don't expect to spend a long time.",
          "A very interesting museum, that provides the visitor with an in depth view of what was, and to some degree is, Canada's last frontier. Unique displays, and a very good restaurant - and to top it off - admission is free. I have visited on 4 occasions and found each visit both",
          "This is a great little museum that is packed with all sorts of things for all ages. It's free. It's interactive and there are hundreds of little tidbits of information. There is a long walking path around Framers Lake near the museum entrance that you can save for another day",

        "wiki": "Around midday on October 22, 2014, a passing motorist saw an Asian woman walking north along the Ingraham Trail on the outskirts of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Several days later, after seeing stories in the local media that Atsumi Yoshikubo (\u5409\u7aaa\u660c\u7f8e), 45, who had been visiting the city from her home in southern Japan, had gone missing, she reported the sighting. It was the last time she was seen alive.\nYoshikubo's absence was first noted five days after that sighting, when staff at her hotel noticed she had not checked out two days after her stay was due to have ended. In her room they found her luggage, still packed; she had apparently never boarded her flight home. Footage from the hotel's security camera showed her leaving shortly before she was last seen along the road. When that sighting was reported in the news, it suggested to many residents that she might have gotten lost in the vast expanse of taiga surrounding the city, and they augmented official search efforts with their own ventures into the bush.The case attracted considerable media interest not only across Canada but also in Japan, where Yellowknife is a popular destination for those seeking to view the northern lights. A week after Yoshikubo's disappearance, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) announced that they were calling off the search, as their investigation, in cooperation with Japanese police, had led them to believe that she had intended to take her own life. Her family, from whom she had been estranged for some time, doubted that conclusion, pointing to evidence that suggested she intended to return.Over the next ten months, police continued searching for the body they expected to find, using areas she may have visited for training exercises. On August 31, 2015, a hiker found some of her personal effects, along with human remains, in a wooded area north of the city. The RCMP confirmed that the items belonged to Yoshikubo, and began to identify the DNA from the bone fragments. In April 2016 they were matched to Yoshikubo, and the investigation has been officially closed.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nSince the early 1990s, Yellowknife, capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, has become a popular destination for tourists from Japan. Many come to see the northern lights; while it is locally believed that Japanese folklore holds that a child conceived under them will enjoy good luck and good health, this is an urban legend resulting from a joke on an episode of the American television series Northern Exposure. Although Alaska and Scandinavia are also attractive for their auroral displays, Yellowknife is a particularly desirable location for Japanese aurora tourism due to its generally flat and undeveloped surrounding terrain and predominantly clear (albeit cold) weather during its long winter nights. It is estimated that 20% of the city's tourists come from Japan; many hotels publish their restaurant menus in both Japanese and English.\n \nUnaccompanied, Yoshikubo arrived in Yellowknife from her home in the city of Uto, on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu, on October 17, 2014, a trip she had arranged through a tour operator in Toronto. She checked into the Explorer Hotel, the city's largest, for a week's stay. After doing so, she asked if she could book a seat on an aurora tour and was told they had shut down for the season.October and November are off-peak times for Japanese tourism in Yellowknife. The northern lights are not as visible as they are at other times of the year and there is usually not enough snow cover for dogsledding, another activity popular with tourists who visit the city in winter. There is, however, enough to make walking on the trails through the boreal forest and bedrock outcrops in and around the city potentially dangerous for unprepared, unguided visitors. The trails themselves become icy and swampy, and the snow makes it harder to distinguish them from the surrounding bush.\n\n\n== Disappearance ==\nIn the absence of an organized tour\u2014the way 95% of Japanese visitors see Yellowknife; the rest generally come in groups\u2014Yoshikubo apparently set her own itinerary, keeping to herself. She had travelled alone before, and it is not unusual for Japanese women to do so. However, Japanese women who travel unaccompanied to popular tourist destinations typically congregate informally with other tourists when they get there; Yoshikubo, though, continued to keep to herself.\n\nSecurity cameras at the Gallery of the Midnight Sun, a popular local gift and souvenir shop in the city's Old Town, recorded her visiting, by herself, and buying some items, apparently meant as gifts for others, on October 19. At another time that day cameras at the city's tourist information centre recorded her visit, again alone. In both she was wearing a pink coat and a darker pink hat with black pants and white shoes.Yoshikubo's actions over the next two days are unknown. During the morning hours of October 22, the Explorer's security cameras recorded her leaving the building, wearing the same clothing she had been seen in the two days previous. Later, around 11:30 a.m., Jessica Riehl, a retired constable with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), saw Yoshikubo walking along the Ingraham Trail between Niven and Jackfish lakes near the city's northern limits, a largely undeveloped area. She reported the sighting, the last time Yoshikubo is known to have been seen, several days later when news of the Japanese woman's disappearance broke (although she was not completely confident as to the date, since she said she takes that route regularly).Yoshikubo never returned to her hotel. Three days later, when the staff realized she had either left without checking out or overstayed her reservation, they entered her room. Inside they found her luggage, all packed. They reported her missing to the RCMP, who checked at Yellowknife's airport, where they learned she had not boarded her flight home, either.\n\n\n== Search ==\nThe RCMP began an intense search effort, using both personnel on the ground and aerial assets to cover the expanses of taiga north and west of the city near where Yoshikubo had last been seen, or could have been reasonably expected to have walked to from her hotel. Residents, fearing that she had met with foul play on the trails and motivated by concern for her distant family, joined in the search with their own informal efforts. The search was given extra urgency by the onset of colder wintry weather and lengthening nights.\n\nThe disappearance and search became a national news story, with five Japanese news outlets flying crews to Yellowknife to cover it for audiences in their country. There were concerns that the incident could result in less Japanese tourism in the city. Of the 60,000 Japanese who had come to Yellowknife to see the northern lights since 2008, she was the first one ever to be reported missing, according to the country's consulate in Calgary.On November 4, however, the RCMP called off the search. Based on what they had found in Yoshikubo's hotel room, and information developed by Japanese police investigating in Uto, they believed she had \"arrived in Yellowknife with a plan to go into the wilderness alone and become a missing person\". Further, they claimed, she had \"taken steps to avoid detection\"; however, they declined to give specifics as the case was still open and her body remained undiscovered.In Japan, Fuji Television reported that Yoshikubo's brother said he had been contacted by the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and told that his sister had sent a letter to a female friend before she left suggesting she was planning to end her life in Canada. While her brother believed that the letter existed, he admitted he had not read it. He also doubted that his sister, who had been out of contact with him and their father for ten years, truly intended to die in Yellowknife, pointing to the souvenirs she had been shown purchasing and her return ticket.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\"They're continuing to still search and conduct different investigations and follow leads they're getting,\" an RCMP spokeswoman told Northern News Services a week after the search was called off. \"It's just that the search and rescue is done. Just because that part is over, doesn't mean we're giving up.\" Searchers were concentrating on an area north of the city, using dogs and thermal imaging equipment to supplement their legwork.Many residents had been profoundly moved by the incident, whether they took part in the search or not. One resident had a condolence card set up for residents to sign at city hall to be sent to Yoshikubo's family in Japan. \"I know there was a tremendous amount of local support for the search and I think it's a way for Yellowknifers to let Atsumi's family in Japan know our thoughts are with her family,\" said city councilman Dan Wong, who announced it at the council's November 10 meeting.\nJessica Riehl, the retired RCMP constable who was the last person known to have seen Yoshikubo, recalled how she had considered asking her if she needed any help. [A]s I drove past her[,] I thought it might not be the best idea for her being alone.\" She had considered turning around and going back to offer help, but decided against it. \"I thought, it was only 11:30 a.m., she'll be OK ... She looked like she was sightseeing and it was close to zero, it wasn't freezing cold, and her pink coat was knee-length and she had on mitts and a hat\u2014she was dressed for that temperature.\nAfter learning several days later that the woman had been reported missing, Riehl said \"I just felt terrible. I didn't sleep much that night. We talked about it at work the next day and how important it is to listen to that little voice on your shoulder ... I will always wonder what happened or if I had stopped, if it would have made a difference in any way.\"Recovery efforts continued in warmer weather, albeit on a smaller scale. For its exercises and training sessions, the RCMP's search and rescue team chose areas of the taiga where Yoshikubo might have gone. They kept those locations confidential to ensure that only trained personnel who knew how to process the scene found the body if there was one to be found.\n\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThere was some speculation about why Yoshikubo might have chosen to die by walking into the bush around Yellowknife. Simon Hatcher, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Ottawa, said that most long wilderness sojourns are a form of temporary suicide, from which people return feeling better. \"People who are suicidal can have this fantasy where they can have a temporary escape\u2014a temporary suicide,\" he told the National Post. \"And maybe that way they will stand out, and somebody will come along and save them. Maybe this was some form of this woman testing fate.\"Others wondered why, given popular locations in Japan such as the Aokigahara forest near Mount Fuji, where there are many suicides each year due to the intense seclusion, for that sort of wilderness suicide, Yoshikubo had traveled so far for hers. \"Sometimes people romanticize about how they might control their death, and they can become fixated on a place,\" the director of a Toronto suicide prevention centre told the Post. \"Maybe this woman came to Canada to create some distance from her family, and to spare them from it.\"\n\n\n=== Possible effect on tourism ===\nIn the immediate aftermath, concerns were expressed that the incident would result in a drop in Japanese tourism to Yellowknife, although it would not be known what impact there would be until wintertime, the next most popular time to see the auroras. \"This will frighten the Japanese culture that a person has gone missing,\" said the director of the territorial tourism information centre that Yoshikubo had been videotaped visiting. However, Colin Dempsey, president of the Northern Frontier Visitors' Association, said that while he was sad for her family that she had apparently met her end in the area, among member businesses, \"there is also a sense of relief that foul play has been ruled out in her disappearance.\"Similarly, he also believed that the elimination of the possibility of an accidental death would allay any potential concerns. He said the information centre had not received any inquiries from Japan about whether people should reconsider going to Yellowknife as a result of the disappearance. The manager of two local tour operators said, likewise, that there had been no cancellations by Japanese tourists.Among the small Japanese Canadian community in the city, most of whom make their living in businesses serving that particular tourist market, there was some concern that similarly suicidally inclined Japanese would try to emulate her. One tour operator doubted the possibility, noting that the costs of traveling to Yellowknife were too high. But, he said, he and his colleagues needed to be more vigilant in dissuading Japanese visitors from going out alone at night into the bush, since they could get lost as he feared Yoshikubo had done.By December, these concerns proved unfounded. Tour operators said that, in fact, not only were numbers not down, they had actually increased from the year before. \"It didn't have any impact,\" said one kennel owner, who estimated that half his business came from Japan.\n\n\n== Discovery of remains and identification ==\nAt the beginning of September 2015, the RCMP announced that a hiker in an area off the Ingraham north of the city had found personal effects that were confirmed to be Yoshikubo's. Along with the effects were human remains. However, the agency said, it could take months of forensic testing before it could be determined whether or not those remains were hers. In April 2016 the RCMP confirmed they were, and announced that the case was closed. Since only bone fragments were left, they would not be able to perform an autopsy.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of people who disappeared\nTimeline of Yellowknife history\nTourism in Canada\n\n\n== References ==",

It is the only performing arts centre in the NWT.The 313 seat Centre opened May 3, 1984. Created by Yellowknife residents with major support from The Globe and Mail newspaper,  the Centre was built with government, business, foundation and individual contributions from across Canada. Since then, with a mandate to \u201cencourage the development of the performing arts from all cultural traditions\", the institution has become the central point in the territory for community, territorial, national and international performing artists.\nNACC is led by a volunteer Board of Directors. It engages in NWT community and educational activities, supporting programs for emerging and established NWT artists and outreach programmes for NWT schools, community and performing arts groups.\n\n\n== Facility ==\nIn 2003 the Centre modernized its technical facilities and was integrated with the Sir John Franklin High School building.  The upgraded facilities are now one of the most technically sound theatres, for its size, in North America. The stage has been described as, \u201can intimate space upon which anything is possible\".The Northern Arts and Cultural Centre held a \"Children's Festival of Silliness\" in January 2012.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website62\u00b027\u203209\u2033N 114\u00b021\u203242\u2033W",

        "wiki": "A Mars rover is a motor vehicle that travels across the surface of the planet Mars upon arrival. Rovers have several advantages over stationary landers: they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control.\nThere have been four successful robotically operated Mars rovers, all managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory: Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit and Curiosity. On January 24, 2016, NASA reported that current studies on Mars by Curiosity and Opportunity (the latter now defunct) would be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on Mars is now a primary NASA objective. In June 2018, Opportunity went out of contact after going into hibernation mode in a dust storm. NASA declared the end of the Opportunity mission on February 13, 2019, after numerous failures to wake up the rover.Mars 2, Mars 3 were physically tethered probes; Sojourner was dependent on the Mars Pathfinder base station for communication with Earth; MER-A & B and Curiosity were on their own. As of September 2020, Curiosity is still active, while Spirit, Opportunity, and Sojourner completed their missions before losing contact.\n\n\n== Missions ==\n\nSix rovers have been dispatched to Mars:\n\n Mars 2, Prop-M rover, 1971, Mars 2 landing failed taking Prop-M with it. The Mars 2 and 3 spacecraft from the Soviet Union had identical 4.5 kg Prop-M rovers. They were to move on skis while connected to the landers with cables.\n Mars 3, Prop-M rover, 1971, lost when Mars 3 lander stopped communicating about 20 seconds after landing.\n Sojourner rover, Mars Pathfinder, landed successfully on July 4, 1997. Communications were lost on September 27, 1997.\n Spirit (MER-A), Mars Exploration Rover, launched on June 10, 2003, and landed on January 4, 2004. Nearly 6 years after the original mission limit, Spirit had covered a total distance of 7.73 km (4.80 mi) but its wheels became trapped in sand. The last communication received from the rover was on March 22, 2010, and NASA ceased attempts to re-establish communication on May 25, 2011.\n Opportunity (MER-B), Mars Exploration Rover, launched on July 7, 2003 and landed on January 25, 2004. Opportunity surpassed the previous records for longevity at 5,352 sols (5498 Earth days from landing to mission end; 15 Earth years or 8 Martian years) and coverance of 45.16 km (28.06 mi). The rover sent its last status on 10 June 2018 when a global 2018 Mars dust storm blocked the sunlight needed to recharge its batteries. After hundreds of attempts to reactivate the rover, NASA declared the mission complete on February 13, 2019.\n Curiosity of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission by NASA, was launched November 26, 2011 and landed at the Aeolis Palus plain near Aeolis Mons (informally \"Mount Sharp\") in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012. The Curiosity rover is still operational as of September 2020.\n\n\n=== En-route ===\nTianwen-1, a Chinese project, launched on Thursday 23rd July 2020 and is currently en-route to Mars following a successful launch.\nPerseverance, a NASA rover, based on the successful Curiosity design launched on Thursday 30th July 2020 and is currently en-route to Mars following a successful launch.\n\n\n=== Planned ===\nThe European-Russian ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin is planned to launch in 2022.\n\n\n=== Undeveloped ===\n\nAstrobiology Field Laboratory, proposed in the 2000-2010 period as a follow on to MSL.\nMars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher (MAX-C), cancelled 2011\nMars Surveyor 2001 rover,\nZephyr rover, would use a rigid sail for wind propulsion.\nMars Tumbleweed Rover, a spherical wind-propelled rover.\nIn 2018, a kind of cushion-air rover was proposed, which in contrast with traditional hovercrafts does not use blowers to pressurize the gas in the chamber but rather uses stored pressurized CO2 obtained from a freezing process which does not require mechanical compression.\n\n\n== Examples of instruments ==\n\nExamples of instruments onboard landed rovers include:\n\nAlpha particle X-ray spectrometer (MPF + MER + MSL)\nCheMin (MSL)\nChemistry and Camera complex (MSL)\nDynamic Albedo of Neutrons (MSL)\nHazcam (MER + MSL)\nMarsDial (MER + MSL)\nMaterials Adherence Experiment (MPF)\nMIMOS II (MER)\nMini-TES (MER)\nMars Hand Lens Imager (MSL)\nNavcam (MER + MSL)\nPancam (MER)\nRock Abrasion Tool (MER)\nRadiation assessment detector (MSL)\nRover Environmental Monitoring Station (MSL)\nSample Analysis at Mars (MSL)\n\n\n== Locations of Mars rovers, in context ==\n\n\n== NASA Mars rover goals (circa 2010s) ==\nNASA distinguishes between \"mission\" objectives and \"science\" objectives. Mission objectives are related to progress in space technology and development processes. Science objectives are met by the instruments during their mission in space.\nThe science instruments are chosen and designed based on the science objectives and goals. The primary goal of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers was to investigate \"the history of water on Mars\".The four science goals of NASA's long-term Mars Exploration Program are:\n\nDetermine whether life ever arose on Mars\nCharacterize the climate of Mars\nCharacterize the geology of Mars\nPrepare for human exploration of Mars\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNASA official Mars Rover website\nMars Pathfinder Gallery (NASA)",

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9. However, the population is slightly disproportionate in terms of age distribution compared to the national average of 41.0. As of the 2016 figures, 13.9% of residents were 9 or under, 6.0% were from 10 to 14 years old, 13.1% were from 15 to 24, 34.1.2% were from 25 to 44, 22.0% were from 45 to 59, and 10.9% were 60 or older.\n\nIn 2016, the average household size was 2.7 and the majority of the population with children had either one or two. In 2015 the average income in the city was C$73,500, and the average income for a family was C$160,394, with 7.9% of all families earning less than $30,000. Minimum wage in Yellowknife and the NWT is C$13.46 (2018). Average household expenditures were C$125,783 in 2015. In 2016, the unemployment rate was at 5.9%; the employment rate for males was 80.1%, for females it was 75.2%.The crime rate in Yellowknife for 2016 was 46.7 (per 1,000 persons) for violent crimes, and 167.2 (per 1,000 persons) for property crimes. There were 299 births and 62 deaths in 2014.English was the mother tongue of 80.0% of residents and 3.2% spoke French.

The event features a wide variety of musical acts; it is not limited to only Folk. In the past, it has drawn acts such as Buffy Sainte-Marie, the Trailer Park Boys, The Weakerthans, African Guitar Summit, Corb Lund, Fred Penner, Stan Rogers, Gord Downie, Tanya Tagaq, Dan Mangan, Sam Roberts Band, Sloan, The Strumbellas, Joel Plaskett, Ron Sexsmith and Hawksley Workman.\nThe Midnight Sun Golf Tournament, with games played through the city's well-lit summer nights, is also a significant cultural event.\nDuring the winter, there is the Snowking Winter Festival, featuring a snow castle on Great Slave Lake which hosts a month of cultural activities\nThe Long John Jamboree, a new winter festival, took place 23\u201325 March 2012 on the frozen Yellowknife Bay next to the Snowking castle, in Yellowknife's Old Town neighbourhood. Events include an ice sculpture contest sponsored by De Beers Canada, cultural events like Dene hand games, games, live music, a beer garden, food vendors, skating rink, artist's market, and much more.\nYellowknife hosted the inaugural 1970 Arctic Winter Games, and has since hosted athletes and artists from circumpolar regions at the biennial multi-sport and multi-cultural event in 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2008 Arctic Winter Games.\nThe Old Town Ramble & Ride Festival started in 2006 and happens every summer for three days on the August long weekend. This free outdoor festival promotes local art, culture, music, artisans, dance, storytelling, workshops, tours, children's area and more.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\nSome notable places to visit in Yellowknife include:\n\nThe Wildcat Cafe, which first opened in 1937. The popular restaurant still operates in its original building during the summer, which was moved to its current location after being saved from demolition in the late 1970s. The Wildcat Cafe has been renovated from 2011 to 2013, and during these times there were a few ups and downs to get the place ready for open. The City hosted a grand opening of the new Wildcat Cafe on 16 June 2013.\nThe Gold Range Bar, (also known as The Strange Range and listed in the circa 1989 phonebook as such) one of the oldest and most colourful drinking establishments in the Northwest Territories and featured in Elizabeth Hay's novel \"Late Nights On Air\" and Mordecai Richler's novel Solomon Gursky Was Here.\nDowntown contains the Capital Area Park, a short but pleasant stroll by City Hall, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, the Legislature.\nThe Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre is a museum containing exhibits of the history and culture of Inuit, Inuvialuit, Dene, M\u00e9tis and non-aboriginal peoples of the NWT. It's found just north of downtown on an attractive location overlooking Frame Lake.\nNear the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, the Northwest Territories Legislative Building houses the territory's legislative assembly.\nThe Northern Arts and Cultural Centre, which is located in Sir John Franklin High School and is the city's largest indoor stage for theatre and musical presentations.\nElon the Muskox (Elon Muskox), a mosaiculture horticultural living sculpture of a muskox exhibited in front of City Hall.Other notable attractions include the Ingraham Trail, local fishing lodges, bush plane tours, the unique architecture of Old Town with the Bush Pilots monument, and any of the numerous lakes surrounding Yellowknife, many of which include beaches.\n\n\n==== Historical sites ====\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Print ===\nThe Yellowknifer, published by Northern News Services, is the major newspaper serving Yellowknife, published twice weekly on Wednesday and Friday. Northern News Services also publishes Northwest Territories News/North every Monday, which serves the entire NWT. As well, there is L'Aquilon, a French language newspaper published weekly. Edge Magazine is also based in Yellowknife where it began it 2011 and covers arts, events, people, culture and economy around the City.\nTwo magazines are based in Yellowknife: Above&Beyond and Up Here, both offering northern-related news and lifestyle articles.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\nNo part of the Northwest Territories is designated as a mandatory market for digital television conversion; only CFYK-DT converted its main transmitter in Yellowknife to digital.\nOn 10 August 2012, NASA announced that the section of Mars where the Curiosity of the Mars Science Laboratory mission landed would be renamed Yellowknife, in recognition of the city of Yellowknife. Yellowknife is usually where scientists start geological mapping expeditions when researching the oldest known rocks in North America.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nReno, Nevada, United States\nFairbanks, Alaska, United States\nYakutsk, Sakha Republic, Russia\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city.

The popular restaurant still operates in its original building during the summer, which was moved to its current location after being saved from demolition in the late 1970s. The Wildcat Cafe has been renovated from 2011 to 2013, and during these times there were a few ups and downs to get the place ready for open. The City hosted a grand opening of the new Wildcat Cafe on 16 June 2013.\nThe Gold Range Bar, (also known as The Strange Range and listed in the circa 1989 phonebook as such) one of the oldest and most colourful drinking establishments in the Northwest Territories and featured in Elizabeth Hay's novel \"Late Nights On Air\" and Mordecai Richler's novel Solomon Gursky Was Here.\nDowntown contains the Capital Area Park, a short but pleasant stroll by City Hall, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, the Legislature.\nThe Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre is a museum containing exhibits of the history and culture of Inuit, Inuvialuit, Dene, M\u00e9tis and non-aboriginal peoples of the NWT.

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9.

The popular restaurant still operates in its original building during the summer, which was moved to its current location after being saved from demolition in the late 1970s. The Wildcat Cafe has been renovated from 2011 to 2013, and during these times there were a few ups and downs to get the place ready for open. The City hosted a grand opening of the new Wildcat Cafe on 16 June 2013.\nThe Gold Range Bar, (also known as The Strange Range and listed in the circa 1989 phonebook as such) one of the oldest and most colourful drinking establishments in the Northwest Territories and featured in Elizabeth Hay's novel \"Late Nights On Air\" and Mordecai Richler's novel Solomon Gursky Was Here.\nDowntown contains the Capital Area Park, a short but pleasant stroll by City Hall, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, the Legislature.\nThe Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre is a museum containing exhibits of the history and culture of Inuit, Inuvialuit, Dene, M\u00e9tis and non-aboriginal peoples of the NWT.

          "Old town is ok. Sort of another funky neighborhood. But compared with the other things to see in Yellowknife, it drops to the bottom of my list. Go to the museum and take the legislature tour at 10:30 a.m. Go out on the lake on a boat. Get out of town or into a park and see the",

          "Old Town is interesting to see. Weaver & Devore has high quality winter clothing inventories and lots of unique general merchandise. Bullock\u2019s has good fish, poor service and is very expensive. They seem to consider the poor service as \u201cOld Town charm\u201d. For their prices, that\u2019s",
          "The old town has quite a variety of restaurants and stores that you really need to see. We ended up coming down here everyday that we were in Yellowknife. Walking on the Great Slave Lake is an awesome feeling in the winter knowing you have 4 feet of ice below you.",

          "I know I am a tourist but I feel the shops there are only for sales and not letting you absorb the culture and history. But it was nice and in some cases novel. Perhaps if I had spent longer there or if more places had been open I would have got more out of it. It was -32 when I",
          "Mix of original & modernist architectures, interesting businesses. We especially enjoyed Gallery of the Midnight Sun, Bullock's Bistro, Weaver & Devore (an original outfitter & general store in a quonset hut). Don't miss the small trail, just below Pilot Monument) with signs",

          "Old Town is an interesting section of Yellowknife - old-style houses, restaurants and shops. Keep in mind Yellowknife is a very small town (20,000 pop) so this isn\u2019t equivalent to a substantial walking quarter like you might find in a major city, but just a small neighborhood",
          "The old town is a must see. Although it has lost a lot of its original history there are some unique shops down there and a lot of very interesting people. The pilots monument is a place you have to go at sun rise or sun down any time of year. There is also some very unique",

          "If you don't want to walk there is a bus that goes to Old Town. Enjoyed looking at all the old buildings which give you a history of the area. Pilots monument gives you a good view of the city. Also wandered over to Lantham Island to look at the houses.",

          "Highly recommend walking through old town on an afternoon in the summer, or driving through slowly in the winter. Visit the galleries, the dancing moose for lunch, or Bullocks/Wildcat for lunch/supper for SURE! Lovely waterfront area with a busy houseboat bay, and serene quiet",
          "Great place to go for a walk and experience the old Yellowknife. A few unique stores to visit and browse the local made items. A couple of very unique restaurants, like the Wildcat Caf\u00e9 and Bullocks Bistro. The Pilots Monument is also located in this area. If you come to",

          "We took a city tour and went to the old town area. It was ok to learn about its history, but I am not necessarily jumping up and down. The houses built on stilts to prevent foundation cracking was interesting, but there wasn't anyone on the road during our entire drive. I",
          "Not much to do in Yellowknife, so it was a good 15 min walking destination to the ice road and see the ice castle. Unfortunately, Bullocks Fish and Chips only opens at 4pm on Sunday. There was a fun fur shop and a gift shop to visit.",
          "I joined a City Tour together with Ice Road Tour. The City Tour included an outlook tour + village tour. The tour was worth 1 visit. It was interesting to know that the houses at Yellow Knife do not have water pipes.",

          "I was driving there. The buildings are great, but its difficult to park since the road is one way, and there are other tourists coming. There is a road bypass to the great slave lake itself. And it is great to see the whole Yellowknife when you drive to Pilots Monument. But when",
          "The best part of being in old town in the winter for me was access to the ice road. I walked along it 3 mornings in a row for hours and loved the expansive feeling of the frozen lake. The morning sunrise and light was gorgeous. Met some friendly people along the way, even got",
          "Yellowknife is definitely an interesting place to visit, and for us Old Town was the most interesting part.

          "I think Old Town is the original site of Yellowknife and has the most ecclectic mix of architecture. Some unique shops and homes to see. Check out the one of a kind shop, Weaver & Devore, a small old fashioned northern/outfitter store. Gallery of the Midnight Sun has northern",
          "Old town was worth the walk out of town to kill a few hours in between nightly aurora chasing. Not a lot of attractions but taking in the lakeside aspects was nice. Go up to the lookout for a great view of the surrounds and particularly the rockiness of the terrain, Check out",

          "The best things about Old Town are the galleries with northern art, although there are not as many of these as there are in other old towns we have visited. We particularly like the monument as you enter old town and reading about its meaning. Also there was a hardware/general",

          "I really liked the feel for Old Town, colorful buildings and even painted dumpsters. We didn't do any shopping, but walked around and took in the sights.",
          "You have to take the time to walk this unplanned quirky community which is full of local colour and northern stereotypes. If you do, you will love it, if you just pass through, you won't be impressed. Floating boat houses, float planes where ever you look, modern corrugated",

          "We walked around town and took in all the local features. Very different from big city life and interesting to see the original background featured on walls, on garbage cans etc. Very clean town, people were very friendly.",
          "Definitely a must to visit while in YK. It is fun to see the various shops and restaurants -- a great place to walk around -- also, be sure to head up to Pilot's Monument for a great vista overlooking Yellowknife. If I was short on time, I would be tempted to miss Wildcat",
          "Well the prices in the eateries were high but there was LOTS to see and LOTS to buy. Very authenic souvenires!",
          "Once you notice details like the painted dumpsters & decorated houses & entire apartments made of corrugated steel... you fall more & more in love with it. The waterfronts are privately owned, so don't expect a boardwalk, but you can see a nice view of both bays from the roads.",
          "Not much is terribly old in this old town, and it must be called this because it was the first part of the town to be settled, but it's fun to walk around (doesn't take long!), and it's worth driving across to look at some of the unique architecture in the adjacent Latham Island",
          "After a weeks stay,Old Town started to feel like home.There is such a collection of homes and businesses there that it never gets boring.The roads are quite bumpy,but it does keep the traffic slowed down.",

          "This part of The 'Knife gives a good \"look back\" to how things were in the North back when it was a sleepy mining town. Not surprisingly it was founded and grew around the lake as this was the key point for the float planes of the day. Planes are still a major component of the",

          "We stayed 3 out of 4 nights in Old Town. There's so much to see in March. We stayed at Bayside Bed & Breakfast right on the water so we could see the planes taking off and landing on the ice runway. We drove on the 6km ice road to Dettah and back. Went to see the Ice Castle - $5",
          "This town has many cute houses. That make beautiful view. The center of town has the hill. If you climb the hill.You could see old town and yellowknife from there.",
          "I am a resident and do not live in Old Town, but do much business there. It is best experienced by walking and dropping into the local stores, galleries, restaurants, aviation hangars and talking to folks. If you are lucky, you might even get a tour of a houseboat!",
          "A very unique place to tour around and live! Interesting contrasts between old and new architecture, the local life and history. Leave yourself a few hours to walk around, you don't want to miss anything.",
          "Old Town consists of a handful of relatively old (1930s) and some dilapidated buildings. Compared to a typical 5 star historical town, like Virginia City in Nevada,, Tombstone, Az, or the old town of Quebec city, this is a 1 star attraction. . . If you are coming to see",
          "Awesome! If you can't or don't want to go on a tour group to see the northern lights, there's a great place to see them in town. Just walk or head over to Pilot's Monument in Old Town (there's parking for about 10 cars there) and climb to the top and see it in the open sky. A",
          "This part of town deserves a fair amount of time and walking to really enjoy. Walk to the top of the hill to see the views and memorials to pilots of years gone by. Check out the old restaurants but be prepared to pay to enjoy them. Lots to see and do.",
          "good galleries, lots of choices. Fun old stores. Parking was a bit of a hassle but we managed, its probably easier if you know your way around. Went on a boat tour for an hour of the lake immediately around the city - it was fun to see the houseboats.",

          "Well, the Canadian Shield, in your face. What a strange place. The houses are nuts, everything from big mansions on stilts to shacks on the Aborginal reservation with pickup trucks that run on tracks. A very unique piece of Canadiana. Go to the pilot monument for a great",
          "Old town is real and funky and full of artists. Northern glass studio/Down to Earth gallery is a wonderful place to stop. It's a cooperative of northern artists, many of them local. Right next to gallery of the midnight sun, which is nice but more production art, an high end",
          "There is so much in Old Town, you MUST see this if you go to Yellowknife. A lot of great restaurants and museums. I would highly recommend going to pilot's monument as well to get a great view of the lake and old town. Hit up Bullock's and the Smoke House too!",
          "Loved the Old Town Glassworks workshop. They recycle wine and some liquor bottles into beautiful glasses, vases, some jewelry. The workshop teaches you how to take a bottle and transform it into the item you choose, prep it and sand blast a design onto it for a very unique",

          "A tour of the Old Town, whether on foot, or in a vehicle (stopping and getting out of course) provides many interesting buildings to view and photograph. The sculptures and items of interest around 'Yellowknife Cultural Crossroads' were particularly interesting.",
          "Lots of galleries and a few cafe's and B&B's. But they're all spread out around this small old town area. The best way to see it is to walk. Don't forget to check out the Pilot's Monument at the top of the hill.",

          "Old Town is a beautiful area of Yellowknife that is situated on rock that stretches out into Great Slave Lake. The views are everywhere and it feels like being in a quaint, fisherman's village on the coast somewhere and not on a lake! Albeit a massive, beautiful lake in the",

          "It's worth a drive thru. The drive itself is average since most of the view and houses are hidden but there are some good little shops down there. Gallery of the Midnight Sun is the best 'souvenir' shop in town. It has classy northern gifts...no cheap cheesy trinkets to be found",

          "This park is a welcome place to camp,there are showers,flush toilets,a hiking trail and a beautiful Lake. The unfortunate thing is this park is accessed by locals and \"day use\" traffic. We had site 54 and were right on the main thoroughfare with trucks pulling boats in all day",
          "The campground is spacious and some sites offer lake views or woods views. However there is much noise from the adjacent airport-so don't expect a quiet wilderness experience. Also some of the bathrooms were non functional due to not being pumped. we asked for a spot for best",
          "Went out and had a great evening out there with my son and his family. It was lovely! The camping spot was good. The fire pit was good. The bugs were not bad! All in all we had a wonderful time!",
          "Stayed here for a month while on business in Yellowknife. No water on site - toilets ok but often closed for a day or 2 because septic not pumped out. Basically a site to boondock so make sure you don't need water or septic. Firewood $1 per log - very tiny kindling logs.",
          "Love this park, I often head down to the dockside beach to relax and swim on warm days. The beach near the dock is part of a rent-out zone for parties/events, which sucks because the people will often assume the beach is theirs to rent/control. The main beach and campsites are",
          "Nice place to go paddling and take prospectors walk. You can go in the water and its shallow, there are mosquitos. The area is pleasant and by taking prospectors walk you get good views of the city skyline and nature.",
          "An excellent campground right on the edge of Yellowknife and right under the flight path of the airport. . which is surprising busy! Water had to be boiled when we were there and the showers were broken. . but we were camping and bought bottled water. .no worries!",
          "Excellent camping!!!! Clean bathrooms with hot water and the place was very clean and was very nice and close to town!",
          "Although the park was closed for the season, you are allowed to walk in and do the hike which we did, We parked down the highway near the road that leads to the airport and walked over to the entrance. We started to do the hike in the park but lost the markers somewhere along"

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9. However, the population is slightly disproportionate in terms of age distribution compared to the national average of 41.0. As of the 2016 figures, 13.9% of residents were 9 or under, 6.0% were from 10 to 14 years old, 13.1% were from 15 to 24, 34.1.2% were from 25 to 44, 22.0% were from 45 to 59, and 10.9% were 60 or older.\n\nIn 2016, the average household size was 2.7 and the majority of the population with children had either one or two. In 2015 the average income in the city was C$73,500, and the average income for a family was C$160,394, with 7.9% of all families earning less than $30,000. Minimum wage in Yellowknife and the NWT is C$13.46 (2018). Average household expenditures were C$125,783 in 2015. In 2016, the unemployment rate was at 5.9%; the employment rate for males was 80.1%, for females it was 75.2%.The crime rate in Yellowknife for 2016 was 46.7 (per 1,000 persons) for violent crimes, and 167.2 (per 1,000 persons) for property crimes. There were 299 births and 62 deaths in 2014.English was the mother tongue of 80.0% of residents and 3.2% spoke French. Of the nine official languages of the Northwest Territories 0.4% spoke Chipewyan (Dene); 0.1% spoke a Cree language; 0.1% spoke Gwich\u2019in; 0.4% spoke Inuktitut; 0.1% spoke Inuinnaqtun or Inuvialuktun; 0.6% spoke North or South Slavey and 1.2% spoke T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb (Dogrib). In total 3.0% of the population said that an Indigenous language was their mother tongue.Not including the 11 official languages there are over 70 different languages that Yellowknifers stated were their mother tongue. These include Indo-European languages (4.2%); Austronesian languages (3.9%); Indo-Iranian languages and Germanic languages (1.1% each); Sino-Tibetan languages and Chinese languages and Indo-Aryan languages (1.0% each). The five main individual languages are Tagalog (3.2%); Vietnamese (0.8%); German (0.6%); Cantonese and Spanish (0.5% each).Yellowknife is home to 695 recent immigrants (arriving between 2011 and 2016) who now make up 3.7% of the population. Of the recent immigrants 70.5% came from Asia; 15.1% from Africa and 7.2% from both the Americas and Europe. Of the recent immigrants 40.0% came from the Philippines, while 10.8% came from several African countries, 5.8% each from India, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, 4.3% from each of Japan and South Korea and 2.2% from IsraelYellowknife is primarily populated by European with a population of 11,680 (60.6% of total). The total Indigenous peoples population 4,375 representing 22.7% of the population (12.7% First Nations, 7.0% M\u00e9tis), and 3.0% Inuit. Other ethnic groups include Filipino with 1,065 residents (5.5% of total), Black with 610 residents (3.2% of total) and South Asian with 510 residents (2.6% of total) with a total visible minority population of 3,230 (16.7% of total).In the 2001 Census almost 73% of residents identified as Christian while 24% said they had no religious affiliation.. For specific denominations Statistics Canada found that 36% of residents identified as Roman Catholic, 11% as Anglican, 10% for the United Church, about 2% each as Baptists, Lutheran, and Pentecostal, and more than 1% for The Salvation Army. There were also 135 Buddhists, 125 Muslims, and 15 Jews.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nFolk on the Rocks is a local music festival that has been an annual occurrence since 1980. The event features a wide variety of musical acts; it is not limited to only Folk. In the past, it has drawn acts such as Buffy Sainte-Marie, the Trailer Park Boys, The Weakerthans, African Guitar Summit, Corb Lund, Fred Penner, Stan Rogers, Gord Downie, Tanya Tagaq, Dan Mangan, Sam Roberts Band, Sloan, The Strumbellas, Joel Plaskett, Ron Sexsmith and Hawksley Workman.\nThe Midnight Sun Golf Tournament, with games played through the city's well-lit summer nights, is also a significant cultural event.\nDuring the winter, there is the Snowking Winter Festival, featuring a snow castle on Great Slave Lake which hosts a month of cultural activities\nThe Long John Jamboree, a new winter festival, took place 23\u201325 March 2012 on the frozen Yellowknife Bay next to the Snowking castle, in Yellowknife's Old Town neighbourhood. Events include an ice sculpture contest sponsored by De Beers Canada, cultural events like Dene hand games, games, live music, a beer garden, food vendors, skating rink, artist's market, and much more.\nYellowknife hosted the inaugural 1970 Arctic Winter Games, and has since hosted athletes and artists from circumpolar regions at the biennial multi-sport and multi-cultural event in 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2008 Arctic Winter Games.\nThe Old Town Ramble & Ride Festival started in 2006 and happens every summer for three days on the August long weekend. This free outdoor festival promotes local art, culture, music, artisans, dance, storytelling, workshops, tours, children's area and more.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\nSome notable places to visit in Yellowknife include:\n\nThe Wildcat Cafe, which first opened in 1937. The popular restaurant still operates in its original building during the summer, which was moved to its current location after being saved from demolition in the late 1970s.

          "This is is a secluded non commercial village where the grills are not part of the attraction . Great igloos and it will only get better as the owner is developing the concept by the day and is very hands on . Staff are amazing . Central meeting and eating place is brilliant",

          "This place is too expansive and there are just too many people around! You can take a nice picture without 3 people walking in front of the camera. The guide was friendly and tried to advise the guest to be careful with other, but still... We did see a beautiful aurora display,",

          "I stayed for four nights in Yellowknife. The first night I joined Aurora Village. Waste money. This is the most expensive tour among the aurora viewing tours. I just saw slight glimpse of aurora. Other company will bring you to the places where aurora can be seen.",
          "While the restaurant has only two choices, fish and bison, the food was quite good. Getting to the village before dark was very helpful to get a lay of the land. Having one of the warm tepees with hot drinks to come to if you're cold while watching the aurora is a real plus.",
          "I booked with Aurora Village because I thought they would offer a great experience since they are the largest tour operator in Yellowknife, and were recommended to us. Turns out, it's just an overly commercialized company that cater to a particular type of tourist. They pick",

          "This is a mass bus tour to a big site out on the lake where they have heated tipis. If you don't mind being with a million other people, this is a good option, as it is a lovely spot to see the aurora. However its a bit of a cattle call with so many people and our guide insisted",
          "Pro: - The teepee(camp) is warm and hot drinks are provided - Nice location to view the aurora if you want to stay warm - Dogsledding is lots of fun Cons: - Definitely overpriced. You are better off booking your own hotel and find other cheaper packages with more flexbility. -",

          "Everything was extra at night for the viewing. Very commercial. We went dog sledding in the afternoon which was good but only took 15 minutes. Had a lot of free time with nothing to do. They invited everyone to roast marshmallows but you were limited to one marshmallow.",
          "We had a relaxed night here, hanging out in the teepee and taking walks. The weather was mild for february, which brought the clouds in so no aurora was visible. Because of that it was probably much less crowded than it would be on a clear night. The guide and stove monitor",
          "It is difficult to give a rating to Aurora Village. Some things were quite good, others not so good. I can't blame them for the first two nights of my trip when the skies were overcast, with nothing to see. Likewise I can't give them credit for the third night when it was",

          "I would give a zero rating for customer service if I could. We called the office on the morning of our aurora viewing to find out when our rental winter wear would be delivered. The lady said she had no idea. When told we have an aurora viewing booked with them the same night,",
          "No shops or cafes for tourists to patronize. Snowmobile, dog sledding, snowshoeing and Snowmobile are the activities available at the village. If you take only an activty there then you can spend the rest of your waiting in the tipi before you return to town.",
          "They have an area around prosperous lake, with many tents. Unlimited coffe/tea/hot chocolate inside, and bathrooms WITH HEAT (if you have ever been to YK for tours, you know how important that is in winter). They also have firepits where you can toast marshmallows. A ice slop",
          "We went to Yellowknife to see the Northern Lights, and on the first night we visited the Aurora Village: it was the best decision we could have made! After booking online, a bus picked us on the hotel and took us to the village. It was approx. 1 hour away, but totally worth it.",
          "That's the minimum that you're likely to spend for a few days on Aurora Village tour package (with airfare). The promotion for Aurora Village is extensive, but don't count on seeing the Northern Lights. When you do they're spectacular. When the clouds cover Yellowknife, as",

          "Aurora Village is a bit pricey, but so worth it. Dinner at the Lodge is an amazing experience. The service is at times lacking, but the food is AMAZING! You will not find cuisine like this anywhere else in the North. Worth every cent. The Aurora Viewing facilities are second to",
          "First time in my life I saw aurora, thank God I saw it at last after so much searching around the world. My friend said some people are yelling and some are weeping because of it. We joined the Aurora Village for 2 consecutive nights in sept 2014, everything is well organized",

          "We spent our 2nd Aurora-Viewing night there. Aurora Village was very organized, the facilities are great. Unfortunately, it was overcrowded. We couldn't imagine they assigned more than 30 people in a teepee. There were not enough seat and we could hear someone complaining",
          "I had a really wonderful time at the Aurora Village. I do agree with others though, they don't cater very much to the non-Asian visitors. The facilities are great, very clean, and when the lights are out it's stunning. I was lucky with some great aurora action, but I can imagine",

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city.

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9. However, the population is slightly disproportionate in terms of age distribution compared to the national average of 41.0. As of the 2016 figures, 13.9% of residents were 9 or under, 6.0% were from 10 to 14 years old, 13.1% were from 15 to 24, 34.1.2% were from 25 to 44, 22.0% were from 45 to 59, and 10.9% were 60 or older.\n\nIn 2016, the average household size was 2.7 and the majority of the population with children had either one or two. In 2015 the average income in the city was C$73,500, and the average income for a family was C$160,394, with 7.9% of all families earning less than $30,000. Minimum wage in Yellowknife and the NWT is C$13.46 (2018). Average household expenditures were C$125,783 in 2015. In 2016, the unemployment rate was at 5.9%; the employment rate for males was 80.1%, for females it was 75.2%.The crime rate in Yellowknife for 2016 was 46.7 (per 1,000 persons) for violent crimes, and 167.2 (per 1,000 persons) for property crimes. There were 299 births and 62 deaths in 2014.English was the mother tongue of 80.0% of residents and 3.2% spoke French. Of the nine official languages of the Northwest Territories 0.4% spoke Chipewyan (Dene); 0.1% spoke a Cree language; 0.1% spoke Gwich\u2019in; 0.4% spoke Inuktitut; 0.1% spoke Inuinnaqtun or Inuvialuktun; 0.6% spoke North or South Slavey and 1.2% spoke T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb (Dogrib). In total 3.0% of the population said that an Indigenous language was their mother tongue.Not including the 11 official languages there are over 70 different languages that Yellowknifers stated were their mother tongue. These include Indo-European languages (4.2%); Austronesian languages (3.9%); Indo-Iranian languages and Germanic languages (1.1% each); Sino-Tibetan languages and Chinese languages and Indo-Aryan languages (1.0% each). The five main individual languages are Tagalog (3.2%); Vietnamese (0.8%); German (0.6%); Cantonese and Spanish (0.5% each).Yellowknife is home to 695 recent immigrants (arriving between 2011 and 2016) who now make up 3.7% of the population. Of the recent immigrants 70.5% came from Asia; 15.1% from Africa and 7.2% from both the Americas and Europe.

          "This trail around the Frame lake is quite lovely and retain a bit of the wild at the same time that connects with the city. You can walk the whole trail in an afternoon with a relax pace (3hr-4hr) Starting from the Legislative Assembly Building there is a a parking lot that",
          "On the Frame Lake Trail you\u2019ll come across the Fireweed Studio. The studio is open on a Saturday and during the Tuesday market when I visited. The gallery has a range of locally made arts and crafts and they are exceptionally well priced. Apparently this is because many of the",
          "Just completed the Frame Lake trail. It was awesome but harder than you would think. Parts of the trail are paved and very easy. Other parts are more challenging and I would advise people with mobility issues not to complete the entire trail. What makes the trail so special",
          "With some light jogging in certain sections we did the loop in 1hr. and 15 minutes. I highly recommend this walk as it is absolutely a spectacular trail to take in some incredible scenery and tranquillity. The hike is very technical in nature and may not be ideal for all as",
          "I actually went around this last summer during a trip in August. The bike trail is quite good for about half of the distance - until you hit the legislative assembly (if you go around counter-clockwise, as I did). After that, it is pretty rugged, and I had to carry my bike as",
          "The trail is more like a walk in the park, but you have to climb a rock here and there, so it's not wheelchair/ stroller accessible. The city views aren't so special from the trail (at least not in the fall season), so don't waste your time and go outside the city for real",
          "A very scenic diverse trail that you can start and go part way and exit onto a road or go all the way around. Some sections are like a wide paved trail, to dirt track to scrambling along solid rock and muddy sections.",

          "I enjoyed my walk around the lake. It is pretty well marked so you can't get lost. There is one side that is challenging as you need to climb over rocks, butI am not young and I did fine. Also a part of the paths were flooded which was more of a challenge. The views are",
          "You can get on the trail just off 49th and follow it around to the museum and legislature. See mining monument along the way. The trail is a bit muddy in sections, others sections have boardwalk. Look for the white and red poles that mark the trail on the rocky sections.",

          "This trail circles Frame lake. The South portion is fairly easy access with flat, well groomed trails. As you continue around the last half of the lake, the topography changes and it gets quite rocky and you need to be fairly agile to maneuver your way around.",
          "It is nice and peaceful to walk around Frame Lake following the trail. Frame Lake has a nice metal sculpture at its bank behind City Hall and it is one of the iconic pictures of Yellowknife.",
          "Three of us walked along this trail all around Frame Lake. It is beautiful! It is about 9 km long, but relatively easy hiking as long as you are wearing appropriate footwear. Stopped along the way to admire the Yk skyline, have a quick bite to eat, and then we were off again.",
          "I recently stayed up here for 4 nights and truly enjoyed my walks around Frame Lake each evening. It's very doable and safe during daylight hours but the town side can attract a different element come darkness so be aware. Wear good shoes and there is lots of rock along the side",

          "This is a great trail that takes just under an hour to do. It varies from a paved trail near the city, to a more rugged trail around the back of the lake. It is well-marked and easy to follow. There are stairs and boardwalks to make it easier. Great views of the city.",
          "Having lived there for 18 years and coming back as a visitor, I have a weakness for Frame Lake. SPECTACULAR",
          "It was still frozen, so you see nothing but snow. We only walked a bit on the trail and on the lake. Picture would be better if it were sunny. Still love the walk.",
          "Because it was frozen, we took a shortcut across the frozen lake! The south shore is the most well groomed and good for a easy walk. We were told that the north part was tougher (more hills, trail not as well groomed, more difficult to follow the trail)",
          "We were told we could bike the trail which runs along the perimeter; we ended carrying our bikes up and down too many hills to count, but it was beautiful the whole way. Would definitely do it again (without bikes!).",
          "Beautiful beautiful trail but a third of the way in we were stalked by a wolf and it was pretty frightening. We walked the path side a few times with no bother but the off roading is very secluded and the trail is thigh deep snow in places right now.",
          "An excellent way to see more of Yellowknife. The trail on the city side, between the Legislative Assembly and the hospital is nicely plowed and easy. If you're adventurous in the winter, the far side past the hospital isn't maintained, but there seem to be enough regulars to",
          "the trail was near our hotel and we took the walk along during day time and sunset, a very nice walk around to see the frozen lake. not a bad choice if you are nearby",
          "We started from the Prince of Wales Heritage center and headed North. The trail is a good hike on the North side of the lake. Not paved. We did it right after a large snowfall which made it that much more fun. At times you need to really look for the next marker - especially",
          "Did this hike through the snow. The rocks can be slippery and the snow quite deep in parts. Otherwise it is a great trail. Part of it was plowed but most of it wasn't. Would be a tough walk with kids through snow. It was about 6.5km. Trail was tough to navigate at some",
          "A beautiful spot for hiking and biking. Check out Frame Lake in sunrise or sunset. Easy trails to get around on. Great spots for pictures.",
          "A nice walk in town. Simple rolling terrain on rocks with some neat views of Yellowknife from across the lake. Worth the hour.",
          "Planned a city run today. This is not your average city jog. It runs up and down shield rock and across boardwalks, with beautiful views of the city. Ran 7 miles total, but it was more energy expending than the usual 7 mile run",
          "This trail is fun because the path isn't always a path.. there are many sections where you need to climb rocks and spot the next post (indicating the path). You don't need to be fit (I'm not!) but you do need to have some adventurous spirit. There are some great scenic photo",
          "Easy to get to since right in Yellowknife proper. It gets really fun when you hike over the rocks for the back half of the trail. Easy to follow markers, Great hiking over the Canadian Shield. We did it twice, while staying in Yellowknife.",
          "If you plan to hike around, don't be fooled by the nice walking path to the hospital. The route from the park, going counter clockwise is more challenging. Often the path ends and one needs to follow the white and red markers to stay on the path over very rocky areas. Well",
          "We started out from near the Explorer Hotel, and found suddenly the pavement ends half way around - route finding becomes a challenge at that point no/little signage...in Summer the black flies and mosquitos are horrible - be warned! Nice views but do it outside of bug season!",
          "My daughter was in her fiinal month of pregnancy and staying in Yellowknife awaiting birth at the local hospital. We walked and walked various parts of Yellowknife during the two week wait. Frame Lake Trail is a gem in the city. We loved hiking the main trail and also going on",
          "We are visiting family in Yellowknife and have spent many enjoyable hours walking the trail along Frame Lake. Lots of waterfowl throughout the lake and some great scenery. The trails are accessible for everyone.",
          "This trail is very beautiful! I saw lots of birds and wilderness scenery. The trail is kept up very well and was not muddy. It is paved in some areas and in other areas, you hike on rocks. It is an easy hike around the lake.",
          "A 4-5 km trail right in Yellowknife. . get a free bike rental from the visitor center and enjoy the place!",
          "Take a walk on the section just past the Legislative Assembly. many spots to sit and take in the beauty that is right at the heart of the city. Wear good shoes as some sections and rocky.",
          "Great trail, beautiful views, good for the heart, better to commute on the trail to work too! Took us about 55mins to walk around the whole thing on the snow in -39C and we loved it. Hope to run it in the spring and summer too, but it's much more rocky and slower going at parts.",
          "I love this trail. It is wonderful for joggers/ walkers. I jog this trail quite often. So many people use this trail. On any given day you can talk along this trail and you will be sure to pass someone out walking along the trail as well. I also pleased we have this trail in",
          "A lake and trail just next to downtown, you can start by visiting the Northern Frontier Visitor Center and / or Prince of Wales Heritage Center and then hiking around the lake, you may also select to walk around the lake or go to Bristol Monument",
          "This is a hike around the lake in town past the Museum and around. The hike is nicely marked and you feel like you are out in the bush yet so close to town.",
          "We had a wonderful warm and calm day for our hike. We took our time so we could take in the views and also talked to some locals along the way. We found the rock that we hiked over interesting and beautiful as well as the birch trees which were turning colour. If we had time",
          "I had city shoes on and assumed that the entire trail was essentially a city pathway. When we got to the boulders, we thought we'd just climb over them and be back on the path...sure, about an hour later! My shoes had rubber soles, so they were OK, but did not bargain for a hike",
          "This is a good walk. Part of the trail is paved near the city. Had heard that there had been some issues (muggings) so was a bit worried, but we didn't have any problems.",
          "The information center info does not give the real info on this hike. Somehow, they have determined it to be a \"medium\" 1.5 hour walk. I consider myself moderately fit, and I am not sure how I could have completed this walk in less than 2 hours (more like 3). It is scenic,",
          "Longer than we expected but we loved the exercise! A beer tasted very good when we finished! Beautiful vistas!",
          "It was a great hike, about 2 hours and relatively easy. It has some really nice views of downtown Yellowknife, and the mosquitoes weren't too bad.",
          "Had a chance to walk the wonderful Frame Lake trail. I will say that it give the most beautiful view of the lake. The trail was very well maintained. No litter problems and what I did found I placed in a raccoon proof container on the trail. Nice bridges at the Community",
          "Or just walking, or cross-country skiing. Even though it is cold, you can jog in -30 as long as you are dressed properly. There are marked and groomed trails across the lake, with markers to help at night. Around the lake is an excellent trail which goes for about 10 miles.",
          "This easy trail around Frame Lake is spectacular on a 'warm' winter day. The trails are wide and the views are fantastic. The walk can be cut in half if the trail through the centre of the lake is taken.",
          "I am a resident and hike, run, ski, and snowshoe the trail. South side is paved and suitable for cycling. North side meanders through taiga forest with interesting vegetation and wildlife. Good location for birdwatchers in the summer. Be aware of others on the trail.",
          "I love this little trail. Its a wonderful 5km in Yellowknife. At some points you are hiking over rocky Canadian Sheild, trying to find the next trail marker, the next minute you are in low, grassy lands or on boardwalks or paved trail. There are bike paths that stem from this",
          "If you love to hike or run this trail is a must do. Geo cacher's will be pleased as well, as there are a few caches sprinkled along the trail.",
          "You can stick to the paved part that takes you from the hospital to downtown or you can keep going around the rugged area to complete the loop. For the inexperienced, finding the orange markers can be a little tricky but if you just follow the lake, you can't go too far wrong.",
          "A great way to get downtown avoiding traffic, getting some fresh air and solitude, and being outside with nature. I've walked this trail many times. It's very popular with joggers, cyclists and dogwalkers. There have been reports of muggings, but I have never encountered any",
          "The locals love this trail and walk/run it regularly. It actually took us about 2 1/2 hours to get all the way around because of everything we were looking at. It is really nice that such a large trail is right in the city and easy access to it from many areas. We even had a",
          "This trail is about half paved and goes through a bit of downtown and out to the hospital. The whole walk goes around the lake with nice views a lot of the time. The paved part is very easy walking/meandering. However when you get to the end of the paved trail, there is no",
          "We hiked the Frame LAke and Prospectors trail. Both were well marked, and booklets providede a great introduction to local geology.",
          "This trail circles Frame Lake and can be started downtown. It is a good hour to hour and a half walk to do the whole loop, but is a beautiful walk with several places to visit on the way such as the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, the Frontier Visitors Centre, the",
          "Beautiful trail. What more can I say, It's a trail! Nice to walk/bike ride/ jog on. Trees, flowers, natural beauty, by the water. :)",
          "Our family loved this trail. Lots to see and not very challenging. Many sites along the way as well such as the Prince of Wales museum, visitor centre, and Lesiglative Assembly (highly recommend!!). Great scenery and a must-do in Yellowknife!",
          "This trail is nice to walk on. It offers a pathed trail around the city with woods and lake surroundings. The only downfall is that it is not safe to travel alone or at night. There have been many attacks along this trail as well as the occational person \"camping\" out.",
          "Frame Lake Trail is nice but along the trail their have been a few incidents. Best bet is to always walk with someone.",
          "This trail gives nice views of the city and of the lake in town. It is a lovely walk. It loops the whole lake. Most people just walk the paved city side. Many people use the trail for their commute to work or for daily exercise. There is usually a fair amount of people on the",
          "This trail is kept in very good condition. I visited it in November and it was well plowed and even in the evening it was well lit. I was able to go for a relatively long walk. Since its is protected by the trees it was comfortable walking even when it was more than -20 and",
          "Frame lake hike is a mix of paved path, gravel path and a scramble over well marked rocky trail. There are great viewing points for views to Downtown and across Yellowknife. It's around 7 km and it's best to start around the northern heritage centre or visitor information"

        "wiki": "Chan Lake Territorial Park is a small territorial park in the Northwest Territories of Canada, one of six such parks on Yellowknife Highway (Hwy #3), and one of 34 parks maintained by the Northwest Territories government under the Territorial Parks Act of 1988. \nThe park is positioned between the road and the lake, 123 km north of the intersection between the Yellowknife Highway and the Waterfall Highway (Hwy #1), and is located at the north end of the Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary. It provides facilities for people travelling between Fort Providence and Yellowknife. The community nearest to the park is Behchoko (Rae-Edzo).The park is for day use only, and has picnic tables, pit toilets and a kitchen shelter, designed to afford a sheltered place to light a small cooking fire. Pets are welcome on a leash. It is open during the summer from May 15 to September 15.Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary is under twenty minutes from the park and bison can be encountered both on the highway and in the park itself. The lake is on the migration path of several birds; ducks, geese, loons, swans, and sandhill cranes may be seen.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Canadian provincial parks\nList of protected areas of the Northwest Territories\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site\nGoogle Street View of the park",

          "There is no gate and no security so vehicles can come and go off the highway or to cabins bordering the campground 24hrs a day. I took my family camping at prelude last weekend (weekend of June 4). There were partyers riding around on ATV's and in the back of trucks from about",

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9.

The popular restaurant still operates in its original building during the summer, which was moved to its current location after being saved from demolition in the late 1970s. The Wildcat Cafe has been renovated from 2011 to 2013, and during these times there were a few ups and downs to get the place ready for open. The City hosted a grand opening of the new Wildcat Cafe on 16 June 2013.\nThe Gold Range Bar, (also known as The Strange Range and listed in the circa 1989 phonebook as such) one of the oldest and most colourful drinking establishments in the Northwest Territories and featured in Elizabeth Hay's novel \"Late Nights On Air\" and Mordecai Richler's novel Solomon Gursky Was Here.\nDowntown contains the Capital Area Park, a short but pleasant stroll by City Hall, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, the Legislature.\nThe Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre is a museum containing exhibits of the history and culture of Inuit, Inuvialuit, Dene, M\u00e9tis and non-aboriginal peoples of the NWT.

          "You have to walk up wood steps to the top. However they are not difficult and there is a bench about midway up. The steps are even cleared of snow and ice. From the top you can get a 360 degree view of the surrounding area.",
          "A definite must if at all possible to check out the view from the top. It's not too bad a walk up a steeper street and then a few flights of stairs. The view is so worth it. We had a really lovely sunny day and could see all the frozen lakes. It was quite a sight to see. And",

          "Im ex airforce so memorials to pilots like this one mean a lot to me. It excels. A steep climb to the top of the hill gives you an unparalleled view of the frozen lake and Yellowknife. I would imagine the view in summer would be just as good. Right on the flight path of the ski",
          "Definitely worth the climb to see this monument to acknowledge all of those pilots who helped to develop this area. This is not a tourist amusement, but rather a recognition of skills of those particular individuals. Standing at the top, you get an unbroken panoramic view of",

          "Although I am not sure if this is highest point in the old town, but climbing the stairs to get up there will give you a great view of the region and it is worth it!",
          "Great views once you make it to the top of the stairs. There are places to stop and catch your breath if you are out of shape.",
          "It will only take a minute or two to get to the top, but it is worth the climb to get the view. If you are walking around Old Town, it is definitely worth a visit.",

          "I've been to YK countless times, but this was my first time to climb the steps up to the pilot's monument. It's a wonderful way to understand YK a little better- and truly appreciate the different neighbourhoods, landscapes, activities, and ways of life that can be experienced",
          "The monument itself is quite plain, but since it's situated on the top of a rocky hill, it gives you a unique and unforgettable view of Yellowknife and Great Slave Lake. I would not have wanted to miss that! There are many colourful houseboats and small islands in view and",
          "Located in the old part of town, there isn't much to see at this monument other than a beautiful vista of Yellowknife and surrounding area. If you are looking for a little walk and on your way to the Wild Cat Cafe, it's worth taking the stairs up and having a look around.",
          "Beautiful views of Great Slave Lake and old town. Nice monument to bush pilots who opened the north.",

          "The day we went up to see the monument was so cold however once we got up there it was worth it and more. The views from the top were out of this world. We got up there in time to see the sunset. You can see Great Slave Lake right to downtown. It is one of my favorites. We hope",

          "Easy walk up a hill and some steps to reach the top of this monument but worth it for the 360 deg vista over Yellowknife.",
          "We went twice on the top to see the view. It has an amazing 360 degree view from the top. You can take the car half way through and then climb the stairs.",

          "A good place to visit for the views of the town and bay. Climbing the snow covered steps can be a bit of an adventure, but it doesn't take too long. A monument and plaque to the bush pilots who bolstered the economy of the Northwest, and good views. Worth the 10 minutes you'll",
          "Even in -15C degree weather I'd recommend climbing up the stairs to the monument to check out the view. The viewing platforms at the top of this hill around the monument offer 360 degree views of lake and city. In our visit in February, you could see the ice landing strip for",
          "I wasn't planning on going to the monument but had nothing else to do while waiting for a table -- so glad we went up there, it doesn't look high the but the views are worth the effort. It is more windy up there so be prepared at the bottom to bundle up at the top.",

          "Worth the climb to the top. You get rewarded with the most panoramic and beautiful view of Yellowknife and the frozen lakes. Dress warm if you're there in winter. It is windy and really cold.",
          "I went there to see sun rise and I saw pink sky and sun came up from mountain that I could take the best shot photos",

          "We were staying in Old Town and this was recommended for both historical reasons and also a convenient way to spot an Aurora without heading out of town. We headed up around 9pm after peaking at the AuroraMax camera and sure enough there was a streak right across the sky.",

          "This is one of 'the' sights to see in Yellowknife. The monument is very simple. It's a wonderful tribute to the pilots who gave their lives in a high risk job to help develop Canada's northern territories. The big feature here is the incredible view of the city, lake areas,",
          "It is a bit of a climb ( about 70 steps I was told by my grandson) but certainly the view is worth the effort! One can see the harbour with the houseboats, as well as the main section of the old town. Float planes were landing as we watched. It was interesting to read the",

          "There are some steps to get to the top, but it is probably the best bird-eye view of Yellowknife. There is the monument, but if you want to look like you hike up a mountain... there are exposed natural rocks just a few steps away for some cool pictures. Overall, easy to get to",
          "There are a few steps leading up to this lookout so be warned that you will need to climb up. The 360 view you get of Yellowknife from above is fantastic. You can see the old town along with the new part of Yellowknife, and enjoy the planes coming in for a landing. If you have",
          "The City of Yellowknife began around this Rock and how appropriate to put a monument to the pilots' that made living in the far north possible. This is not handicap accessible but there are a couple of \"rest landings\" on the way up. Pick a sunny day for the exceptional views.",

          "A short walk up the stairs gives you a great view of Yellowknife. Located in the old town you get a 360 degree view of the surrounds. Make sure you spend some time reading the plaques and wonder how did we ever really explore the north",
          "If you visit or live in Yellowknife, you must make one visit to this spot. It is easy to get to. There is a parking lot at the base. An easy climb by stairs (careful at one flight, where the stair heights are shorter). This place will give you a very good look at",
          "I loved being on top of the monument. It offers a wonderful 360\u00b0 view encompassing the city, lakeshore, the colourful floating houses, etc. This is especially a must for first-time visitors and photographers. On the whole, it is calm other than the noise coming from the roads",

          "This is one of my favourite spots in Yellowknife. First because it pays tribute to the many bush pilots who helped open the north. Second because if is high enough to offer a spectacular view of the city and Great Slave Lake. There are quite a few stairs to climb so please",
          "Really worth to go up because you can see the panarama! But keep warm! Make sure you come back before dark ...",

          "Visited here a couple of times for fabulous views across all of Yellowknife. Fairly easy to get to via a wooden staircase but as with everywhere there is obviously some ice about so wear good footwear. Worth the climb to watch the town for a while. Take it in as part of a walk",

      "name": "Giant Mine",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Giant Mine was a gold mine located on the Ingraham Trail, 5 km (3.1 mi) north of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Giant Mine is within the Kam Group, which is part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt. Gold was discovered on the property and mineral claims staked in 1935 by Johnny Baker, but the true extent of the gold deposits was not known until 1944, when a massive gold-bearing shear zone was uncovered beneath the drift-filled Baker Creek Valley.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe discovery led to a massive post-war staking boom in Yellowknife. Giant Mine entered production in 1948 and ceased operations in 2004. It produced over 7,000,000 ozt (220,000 kg) of gold. Owners of the mine have included Falconbridge (1948\u20131986 through subsidiary Giant Yellowknife Mines Limited), Pamour of Australia (1986\u20131990 through subsidiary Giant Yellowknife Mines Limited), and Royal Oak Mines (1990\u20131999). When Royal Oak went bankrupt in 1999 the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) took over responsibility for cleaning up the Giant mine site. Miramar Mining Corporation subsequently entered into an arrangement with the government whereby Miramar held the mine operation in care and maintenance, continued underground dewatering operations, and removed the remaining ore from underground for treatment at the nearby Con Mine process facility (1999\u20132004) . \nAccording to an article published in The Star in 2006, there were 15 sealed underground storage chambers 250 feet below ground containing a total of 237,000 tonnes (233,000 long tons; 261,000 short tons) of deadly arsenic trioxide dust, containing up to 60% organic and inorganic arsenic. The dust was a byproduct of extracting gold from the mineral and was collected and stored in sealed underground chambers from 1951 to 1999. Prior to legislated collection and underground storage in 1951 arsenic was released directly into the atmosphere during the roasting process. Arsenic trioxide readily dissolves in water; in 2006 underground flooding around Giant Mine's Mill Pond's underground chamber which contained 16,946 tonnes (16,678 long tons; 18,680 short tons) of arsenic trioxide dust threatened to migrate out of the chamber if it was flooded and dump large amounts of arsenic into Yellowknife Bay.\n\n\n=== Bombing ===\nOn September 18, 1992, at the height of a labour dispute during the tenure of Royal Oak Mines ownership, an explosion in a drift of the mine, 750 ft (230 m) underground, killed nine men riding through a transport tunnel in a man-car. The strikebreakers who lost their lives were Chris Neill, 29, Joe Pandev, 55, Norm Hourie, 53, David Vodnoski, 25, Shane Riggs, 27, and Vern Fullowka, 36. The remaining three men were replacement workers Robert Rowsell, 37, Malcolm Sawler, 38, and Arnold Russell, 41. Mine employee Roger Warren was later convicted of placing the bomb. The strike/lockout ended in 1993, pursuant to an order by the (then) Canada Labour Relations Board. A civil suit also resulted on behalf of the families of the replacement workers killed in the explosion (Fullowka v. Royal Oak Ventures Inc.) In 2008, the nine Giant Mine widows lost their $10-million civil judgment when the Northwest Territories Supreme Court overturned an earlier ruling.\n\n\n== Contamination ==\nMining operations over five decades have created a massive environmental liability, a problem which the mine's previous owners left to the Government of Canada and Government of the Northwest Territories to sort out. The site's 950 ha (2,300 acres) footprint includes 8 open pits, 4 tailing ponds, 325,000 m3 (11,500,000 cu ft) of contaminated soils, and approximately 100 buildings including a roaster/bag house complex that is highly contaminated with arsenic trioxide dust and fibrous asbestos. The remediation plan proposed by the SRK Consulting Inc. and SENES Consultants Limited, the leading technical advisors since 2000 to Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada on the Giant Mine Remediation Project, includes underground issues such as dust that contains arsenic trioxide, and remediation of the surface, water and Baker Creek.\n\n\n=== Remediation ===\nAboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada reported that the \"greatest challenge associated with the remediation of Giant Mine\" is the safe long term storage 237,000 t (233,000 long tons; 261,000 short tons) of the arsenic trioxide dust, the lethal byproduct of extracting gold from the mineral arsenopyrite ore stored underground. Their top priority for the Giant Mine site remediation is an \"effective, long-term management\" of arsenic trioxide. Arsenic trioxide dust, which contains approximately 60% arsenic, is highly lethal even in small doses. It is odourless, tasteless and water-soluble.The taxpayer-funded (c. $900m to about a billion dollars) remediation plan to permanently freeze the underground arsenic trioxide dust chambers was approved by the Canadian federal government in August 2014. According to the federal civil servant in charge of the clean-up, Jane Amphlett, using technology like that used in ice-hockey rinks, coolants will permanently freeze the storage chambers containing the arsenic trioxide dust to keep groundwater seepage out in what is called the \"Frozen Block Method.\"A Yellowknife community museum is envisioned for part of the former Giant Mine townsite.\n\n\n== Film ==\nThe events and aftermath of the Giant Mine labour dispute and explosion were dramatized in the 1996 CBC television movie Giant Mine. Additionally the contamination is the topic of the interactive documentary \"Shadow of a Giant\" by Saskatchewan filmmaker Clark Ferguson who was artist in residence with Western Arctic Moving Pictures (WAMP) in 2013.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mines in the Northwest Territories\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Giant Mine 10 Years Later\".

          "Some rather simplistic information about diamonds and their importance to the NWT. Building is very basic, little in the way of charm or attractiveness. Video was brief, more like an introductory training video for new mine workers. Staff were not very engaged. Missing an",
          "Very interesting. Gem cutter works in display area and was very informative. Short video explains the mine operation",
          "We stopped by to learn a little more about the diamond mining process, and to look at local jewelry. The employees/owner were warm and welcoming without being overbearing. When we began looking at the jewelry, they didn't follow us around or ask incessantly if they could show",
          "This was a great place to visit! Even got to polish a diamond! Learned a lot! The owners are very kind, gracious people.",
          "Mr. Henry Zhang of the NWT Diamond Center was exceptionally helpful and provided me with great advice in choosing a diamond ring as a Christmas Gift for my wife.",
          "I was excited about visiting the NWT Diamond Centre to learn about the mine and also about the diamonds. They have a scheduled demonstration of diamond polishing. I went in prior to the demo and read about the mine and looked at the exhibits. It was all very nicely displayed,",
          "There was room to park. The centre was small but pleasing. They had excellent large aerial photos of the main Diamond mines and the receptionist could explain some of the details, though not all. We were lucky to meet someone who works at Diavik who pointed out various details",
          "Interesting place to visit. A short video shows how the Canadian diamond industry developed in Canada till today. A demonstration of how diamonds are cut and polished. You can even purchase diamond jewellery on site. Canada has become number 3 in the world in mining diamonds.",
          "Diamond mining is an economic force in Yellowknife. I think the mine is the 3rd largest in the world. There are photos and a short video showing the interaction between town and the mine. Diamonds are displayed for purchase.",
          "Diamonds on display, a video about diamonds and diamond mining. Then one of the staff showed us how he cut and polished the diamonds. Very interesting.",
          "This is a missed opportunity to create something educational and interesting. Instead, there were a few photos and artifacts on display and a video first promoting the company's diamonds (think cheesy jewelry commercial) followed by employees talking about how much they loved",
          "Interesting pictures of the diamond mines in NWT and a short video on diamonds is available for viewing. Can watch the artisian and try polishing a diamond yourself! Jewelry available for sale",
          "Opportunity to try polishing a diamond was fun and educational. Explanation of grading and certification process was interesting. Some beautiful sparkles for sale!",
          "Very simple set up. Pictures of the mines were nice the video just ok. Hard to understand the fellow doing the polishing display. Really appreciated that they were not pushing us to buy diamonds!",
          "There is a lot of information about the formation and mining of Canadian diamonds. There was a short video and demonstration of polishing diamonds.",
          "We enjoyed reviewing the time line and history. The short film was very informative. I got to try polishing a diamond, very neat experience",
          "This exhibit plus the gentleman sharing information was super.The video also gave a lot of info about diamond mining",
          "Not much here but a place to look around and get out of the cold. There were no restaurants open inside which is strange.",
          "The NWT Diamond centre has a diamond mining exhibit, polishing demonstrations and actual diamonds you can look at and touch (up to $40,000 value). One block off of Franklin (the main street), across from the liquor store"

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9. However, the population is slightly disproportionate in terms of age distribution compared to the national average of 41.0. As of the 2016 figures, 13.9% of residents were 9 or under, 6.0% were from 10 to 14 years old, 13.1% were from 15 to 24, 34.1.2% were from 25 to 44, 22.0% were from 45 to 59, and 10.9% were 60 or older.\n\nIn 2016, the average household size was 2.7 and the majority of the population with children had either one or two. In 2015 the average income in the city was C$73,500, and the average income for a family was C$160,394, with 7.9% of all families earning less than $30,000. Minimum wage in Yellowknife and the NWT is C$13.46 (2018). Average household expenditures were C$125,783 in 2015. In 2016, the unemployment rate was at 5.9%; the employment rate for males was 80.1%, for females it was 75.2%.The crime rate in Yellowknife for 2016 was 46.7 (per 1,000 persons) for violent crimes, and 167.2 (per 1,000 persons) for property crimes. There were 299 births and 62 deaths in 2014.English was the mother tongue of 80.0% of residents and 3.2% spoke French. Of the nine official languages of the Northwest Territories 0.4% spoke Chipewyan (Dene); 0.1% spoke a Cree language; 0.1% spoke Gwich\u2019in; 0.4% spoke Inuktitut; 0.1% spoke Inuinnaqtun or Inuvialuktun; 0.6% spoke North or South Slavey and 1.2% spoke T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb (Dogrib). In total 3.0% of the population said that an Indigenous language was their mother tongue.Not including the 11 official languages there are over 70 different languages that Yellowknifers stated were their mother tongue. These include Indo-European languages (4.2%); Austronesian languages (3.9%); Indo-Iranian languages and Germanic languages (1.1% each); Sino-Tibetan languages and Chinese languages and Indo-Aryan languages (1.0% each). The five main individual languages are Tagalog (3.2%); Vietnamese (0.8%); German (0.6%); Cantonese and Spanish (0.5% each).Yellowknife is home to 695 recent immigrants (arriving between 2011 and 2016) who now make up 3.7% of the population. Of the recent immigrants 70.5% came from Asia; 15.1% from Africa and 7.2% from both the Americas and Europe. Of the recent immigrants 40.0% came from the Philippines, while 10.8% came from several African countries, 5.8% each from India, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, 4.3% from each of Japan and South Korea and 2.2% from IsraelYellowknife is primarily populated by European with a population of 11,680 (60.6% of total). The total Indigenous peoples population 4,375 representing 22.7% of the population (12.7% First Nations, 7.0% M\u00e9tis), and 3.0% Inuit. Other ethnic groups include Filipino with 1,065 residents (5.5% of total), Black with 610 residents (3.2% of total) and South Asian with 510 residents (2.6% of total) with a total visible minority population of 3,230 (16.7% of total).In the 2001 Census almost 73% of residents identified as Christian while 24% said they had no religious affiliation.. For specific denominations Statistics Canada found that 36% of residents identified as Roman Catholic, 11% as Anglican, 10% for the United Church, about 2% each as Baptists, Lutheran, and Pentecostal, and more than 1% for The Salvation Army. There were also 135 Buddhists, 125 Muslims, and 15 Jews.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nFolk on the Rocks is a local music festival that has been an annual occurrence since 1980. The event features a wide variety of musical acts; it is not limited to only Folk.

          "Very interesting Centr\u00e9. One learns how NWT diamonds are mined. How excavation areas will be returned to their natural state after each site has been mined. The care taken for the employees was very impressive. In addition, the staff was very helpful, professional and kind.",

        "wiki": "Around midday on October 22, 2014, a passing motorist saw an Asian woman walking north along the Ingraham Trail on the outskirts of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Several days later, after seeing stories in the local media that Atsumi Yoshikubo (\u5409\u7aaa\u660c\u7f8e), 45, who had been visiting the city from her home in southern Japan, had gone missing, she reported the sighting. It was the last time she was seen alive.\nYoshikubo's absence was first noted five days after that sighting, when staff at her hotel noticed she had not checked out two days after her stay was due to have ended. In her room they found her luggage, still packed; she had apparently never boarded her flight home. Footage from the hotel's security camera showed her leaving shortly before she was last seen along the road. When that sighting was reported in the news, it suggested to many residents that she might have gotten lost in the vast expanse of taiga surrounding the city, and they augmented official search efforts with their own ventures into the bush.The case attracted considerable media interest not only across Canada but also in Japan, where Yellowknife is a popular destination for those seeking to view the northern lights. A week after Yoshikubo's disappearance, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) announced that they were calling off the search, as their investigation, in cooperation with Japanese police, had led them to believe that she had intended to take her own life. Her family, from whom she had been estranged for some time, doubted that conclusion, pointing to evidence that suggested she intended to return.Over the next ten months, police continued searching for the body they expected to find, using areas she may have visited for training exercises. On August 31, 2015, a hiker found some of her personal effects, along with human remains, in a wooded area north of the city. The RCMP confirmed that the items belonged to Yoshikubo, and began to identify the DNA from the bone fragments. In April 2016 they were matched to Yoshikubo, and the investigation has been officially closed.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nSince the early 1990s, Yellowknife, capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, has become a popular destination for tourists from Japan. Many come to see the northern lights; while it is locally believed that Japanese folklore holds that a child conceived under them will enjoy good luck and good health, this is an urban legend resulting from a joke on an episode of the American television series Northern Exposure. Although Alaska and Scandinavia are also attractive for their auroral displays, Yellowknife is a particularly desirable location for Japanese aurora tourism due to its generally flat and undeveloped surrounding terrain and predominantly clear (albeit cold) weather during its long winter nights. It is estimated that 20% of the city's tourists come from Japan; many hotels publish their restaurant menus in both Japanese and English.\n \nUnaccompanied, Yoshikubo arrived in Yellowknife from her home in the city of Uto, on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu, on October 17, 2014, a trip she had arranged through a tour operator in Toronto. She checked into the Explorer Hotel, the city's largest, for a week's stay. After doing so, she asked if she could book a seat on an aurora tour and was told they had shut down for the season.October and November are off-peak times for Japanese tourism in Yellowknife. The northern lights are not as visible as they are at other times of the year and there is usually not enough snow cover for dogsledding, another activity popular with tourists who visit the city in winter. There is, however, enough to make walking on the trails through the boreal forest and bedrock outcrops in and around the city potentially dangerous for unprepared, unguided visitors. The trails themselves become icy and swampy, and the snow makes it harder to distinguish them from the surrounding bush.\n\n\n== Disappearance ==\nIn the absence of an organized tour\u2014the way 95% of Japanese visitors see Yellowknife; the rest generally come in groups\u2014Yoshikubo apparently set her own itinerary, keeping to herself. She had travelled alone before, and it is not unusual for Japanese women to do so. However, Japanese women who travel unaccompanied to popular tourist destinations typically congregate informally with other tourists when they get there; Yoshikubo, though, continued to keep to herself.\n\nSecurity cameras at the Gallery of the Midnight Sun, a popular local gift and souvenir shop in the city's Old Town, recorded her visiting, by herself, and buying some items, apparently meant as gifts for others, on October 19. At another time that day cameras at the city's tourist information centre recorded her visit, again alone. In both she was wearing a pink coat and a darker pink hat with black pants and white shoes.Yoshikubo's actions over the next two days are unknown. During the morning hours of October 22, the Explorer's security cameras recorded her leaving the building, wearing the same clothing she had been seen in the two days previous. Later, around 11:30 a.m., Jessica Riehl, a retired constable with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), saw Yoshikubo walking along the Ingraham Trail between Niven and Jackfish lakes near the city's northern limits, a largely undeveloped area. She reported the sighting, the last time Yoshikubo is known to have been seen, several days later when news of the Japanese woman's disappearance broke (although she was not completely confident as to the date, since she said she takes that route regularly).Yoshikubo never returned to her hotel. Three days later, when the staff realized she had either left without checking out or overstayed her reservation, they entered her room. Inside they found her luggage, all packed. They reported her missing to the RCMP, who checked at Yellowknife's airport, where they learned she had not boarded her flight home, either.\n\n\n== Search ==\nThe RCMP began an intense search effort, using both personnel on the ground and aerial assets to cover the expanses of taiga north and west of the city near where Yoshikubo had last been seen, or could have been reasonably expected to have walked to from her hotel. Residents, fearing that she had met with foul play on the trails and motivated by concern for her distant family, joined in the search with their own informal efforts. The search was given extra urgency by the onset of colder wintry weather and lengthening nights.\n\nThe disappearance and search became a national news story, with five Japanese news outlets flying crews to Yellowknife to cover it for audiences in their country. There were concerns that the incident could result in less Japanese tourism in the city. Of the 60,000 Japanese who had come to Yellowknife to see the northern lights since 2008, she was the first one ever to be reported missing, according to the country's consulate in Calgary.On November 4, however, the RCMP called off the search. Based on what they had found in Yoshikubo's hotel room, and information developed by Japanese police investigating in Uto, they believed she had \"arrived in Yellowknife with a plan to go into the wilderness alone and become a missing person\". Further, they claimed, she had \"taken steps to avoid detection\"; however, they declined to give specifics as the case was still open and her body remained undiscovered.In Japan, Fuji Television reported that Yoshikubo's brother said he had been contacted by the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and told that his sister had sent a letter to a female friend before she left suggesting she was planning to end her life in Canada. While her brother believed that the letter existed, he admitted he had not read it. He also doubted that his sister, who had been out of contact with him and their father for ten years, truly intended to die in Yellowknife, pointing to the souvenirs she had been shown purchasing and her return ticket.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\"They're continuing to still search and conduct different investigations and follow leads they're getting,\" an RCMP spokeswoman told Northern News Services a week after the search was called off. \"It's just that the search and rescue is done. Just because that part is over, doesn't mean we're giving up.\" Searchers were concentrating on an area north of the city, using dogs and thermal imaging equipment to supplement their legwork.Many residents had been profoundly moved by the incident, whether they took part in the search or not. One resident had a condolence card set up for residents to sign at city hall to be sent to Yoshikubo's family in Japan. \"I know there was a tremendous amount of local support for the search and I think it's a way for Yellowknifers to let Atsumi's family in Japan know our thoughts are with her family,\" said city councilman Dan Wong, who announced it at the council's November 10 meeting.\nJessica Riehl, the retired RCMP constable who was the last person known to have seen Yoshikubo, recalled how she had considered asking her if she needed any help. [A]s I drove past her[,] I thought it might not be the best idea for her being alone.\" She had considered turning around and going back to offer help, but decided against it. \"I thought, it was only 11:30 a.m., she'll be OK ... She looked like she was sightseeing and it was close to zero, it wasn't freezing cold, and her pink coat was knee-length and she had on mitts and a hat\u2014she was dressed for that temperature.\nAfter learning several days later that the woman had been reported missing, Riehl said \"I just felt terrible. I didn't sleep much that night. We talked about it at work the next day and how important it is to listen to that little voice on your shoulder ... I will always wonder what happened or if I had stopped, if it would have made a difference in any way.\"Recovery efforts continued in warmer weather, albeit on a smaller scale. For its exercises and training sessions, the RCMP's search and rescue team chose areas of the taiga where Yoshikubo might have gone. They kept those locations confidential to ensure that only trained personnel who knew how to process the scene found the body if there was one to be found.\n\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThere was some speculation about why Yoshikubo might have chosen to die by walking into the bush around Yellowknife. Simon Hatcher, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Ottawa, said that most long wilderness sojourns are a form of temporary suicide, from which people return feeling better. \"People who are suicidal can have this fantasy where they can have a temporary escape\u2014a temporary suicide,\" he told the National Post. \"And maybe that way they will stand out, and somebody will come along and save them. Maybe this was some form of this woman testing fate.\"Others wondered why, given popular locations in Japan such as the Aokigahara forest near Mount Fuji, where there are many suicides each year due to the intense seclusion, for that sort of wilderness suicide, Yoshikubo had traveled so far for hers. \"Sometimes people romanticize about how they might control their death, and they can become fixated on a place,\" the director of a Toronto suicide prevention centre told the Post. \"Maybe this woman came to Canada to create some distance from her family, and to spare them from it.\"\n\n\n=== Possible effect on tourism ===\nIn the immediate aftermath, concerns were expressed that the incident would result in a drop in Japanese tourism to Yellowknife, although it would not be known what impact there would be until wintertime, the next most popular time to see the auroras. \"This will frighten the Japanese culture that a person has gone missing,\" said the director of the territorial tourism information centre that Yoshikubo had been videotaped visiting. However, Colin Dempsey, president of the Northern Frontier Visitors' Association, said that while he was sad for her family that she had apparently met her end in the area, among member businesses, \"there is also a sense of relief that foul play has been ruled out in her disappearance.\"Similarly, he also believed that the elimination of the possibility of an accidental death would allay any potential concerns. He said the information centre had not received any inquiries from Japan about whether people should reconsider going to Yellowknife as a result of the disappearance. The manager of two local tour operators said, likewise, that there had been no cancellations by Japanese tourists.Among the small Japanese Canadian community in the city, most of whom make their living in businesses serving that particular tourist market, there was some concern that similarly suicidally inclined Japanese would try to emulate her. One tour operator doubted the possibility, noting that the costs of traveling to Yellowknife were too high. But, he said, he and his colleagues needed to be more vigilant in dissuading Japanese visitors from going out alone at night into the bush, since they could get lost as he feared Yoshikubo had done.By December, these concerns proved unfounded. Tour operators said that, in fact, not only were numbers not down, they had actually increased from the year before. \"It didn't have any impact,\" said one kennel owner, who estimated that half his business came from Japan.\n\n\n== Discovery of remains and identification ==\nAt the beginning of September 2015, the RCMP announced that a hiker in an area off the Ingraham north of the city had found personal effects that were confirmed to be Yoshikubo's. Along with the effects were human remains. However, the agency said, it could take months of forensic testing before it could be determined whether or not those remains were hers. In April 2016 the RCMP confirmed they were, and announced that the case was closed. Since only bone fragments were left, they would not be able to perform an autopsy.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of people who disappeared\nTimeline of Yellowknife history\nTourism in Canada\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Google Street View was first introduced in the United States on May 25, 2007, and until November 26, 2008, featured camera icon markers, each representing at least one major city or area (such as a park), and usually the other nearby cities, towns, suburbs, and parks. Many areas that had coverage were represented by icons.\n\n\n== Key additions ==\n\nOn May 25, 2007, Street View was announced.\nOn May 30, 2007, at the Where 2.0 Conference, Immersive Media was identified as the contractor that captured the imagery for four of the five cities initially mapped by Street View, using its patented dodecahedral camera array on a moving car. Immersive Media continued to do image capture for Street View until Google developed its own capability to do so. Since July 2007, Google has used imagery that belongs exclusively to Google.\nOn April 16, 2008, Street View was fully integrated into Google Earth 4.3.\nOn May 12, 2008, Google announced that it was testing face-blurring technology on its photos of the busy streets of Manhattan. The technology uses a computer algorithm to search Google's image database for faces and blurs them, according to John Hanke, director of Google Earth and Google Maps.\nOn June 10, 2008, two other features included in the update were an effective mask of the \"Google Car\" and the application of face-blurring technology on all photos, which effectively lowered the resolution across all photos, even the formerly impressive high resolution images of San Francisco. Also, many nearby metro areas were included, but they did not receive their own camera icons.\nOn July 2, 2008, Google Street View was introduced in France and Italy, providing the first service outside the United States and the debut of Google's new 4th Generation Cameras. On this day, 19 camera icons were added, mostly showing small towns and areas along the Tour de France route and part of northwestern Italy.\nOn August 4, 2008, 28 icons of major metropolitan areas of both Australia and Japan were added to Google Street View. Included in the update were approximately 40 new U.S. hub cities.\nOn November 26, 2008, the Street View button and all the camera icons were deleted. Instead of clicking the \"Street View\" button, this is now accessed using the \"pegman\" button in the left hand corner. When the \"pegman\" icon is dragged over the map blue polylines appear where Street View is available and a small window will show the current Street View. If this is dropped on the map the Street View opens and takes over the whole map window.\nOn December 1, 2008, New Zealand was added to Google Street View. Faces were blurred upon recommendation by the New Zealand Privacy Commission, but vehicle registration plates were not obscured.\nOn April 9, 2009, Street View became available with a full-screen option.\nOn June 5, 2009, Smart Navigation was introduced which allows users to navigate around the panoramas by double-clicking with their cursor on any place or object they want to see.\nIn mid-June 2010, Google added blue dots to its maps that display user-submitted images in all locations around the world, including land areas where Street View is not available and bodies of water. These images can be pulled up on the screen in the same manner as a Street View image with the pegman by dragging it onto the blue dot.\nOn October 30, 2012, Google announced that users could contribute to Street View by creating a panorama-like image from the Galaxy Nexus smartphone to share on Google Maps.\nOn February 14, 2013, Wii Street U was released for the Wii U.\nOn June 27, 2013, Google announced that users could contribute to Street View by creating a panorama-like image from the Galaxy non-Nexus smartphone to share on Google Maps.\nOn April 23, 2014, a new historical Street View option was introduced to new Google Maps. The date of panoramas can be selected from the timeline.\nStarting in August 2017, Google allows users to create their own street view-like blue paths, for the connected photospheres that are sufficiently close to one another.\n\n\n== Timeline of introductions ==\n\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2009 ===\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\n\n\n=== 2011 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2013 ===\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\n\n\n=== 2015 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2017 ===\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n* Limited coverage.\n\n\n== Coverage by country \u03bfr territory ==\nBelow is a table showing the countries available on Street View and the year they were first added. Plain text indicates that a country has only views of certain businesses and/or tourist attractions.\n\n\n=== Current coverage ===\nBold with an asterisk (*) indicates countries with public street view available\n\n\n=== Future coverage ===\nBelow is list of the countries that do not currently have official coverage where Street View vehicles are currently driving, where Street View is officially planned, or have reported by media to be driving.\nPublic streets in Guernsey and India (Bangalore), as well more places in Germany were filmed but at this time the images are not online due to some privacy concerns.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTawanda Kanhema, Zimbabwean photographer who made significant additions to Street View coverage of Africa\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStreet View coverage map and current driving locations\nAvailable indoor views of public transportation facilities as airports and railway stations and transportation museums\nAvailable inside views of university campuses",

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9.

The popular restaurant still operates in its original building during the summer, which was moved to its current location after being saved from demolition in the late 1970s. The Wildcat Cafe has been renovated from 2011 to 2013, and during these times there were a few ups and downs to get the place ready for open. The City hosted a grand opening of the new Wildcat Cafe on 16 June 2013.\nThe Gold Range Bar, (also known as The Strange Range and listed in the circa 1989 phonebook as such) one of the oldest and most colourful drinking establishments in the Northwest Territories and featured in Elizabeth Hay's novel \"Late Nights On Air\" and Mordecai Richler's novel Solomon Gursky Was Here.\nDowntown contains the Capital Area Park, a short but pleasant stroll by City Hall, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, the Legislature.\nThe Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre is a museum containing exhibits of the history and culture of Inuit, Inuvialuit, Dene, M\u00e9tis and non-aboriginal peoples of the NWT.

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9. However, the population is slightly disproportionate in terms of age distribution compared to the national average of 41.0. As of the 2016 figures, 13.9% of residents were 9 or under, 6.0% were from 10 to 14 years old, 13.1% were from 15 to 24, 34.1.2% were from 25 to 44, 22.0% were from 45 to 59, and 10.9% were 60 or older.\n\nIn 2016, the average household size was 2.7 and the majority of the population with children had either one or two. In 2015 the average income in the city was C$73,500, and the average income for a family was C$160,394, with 7.9% of all families earning less than $30,000. Minimum wage in Yellowknife and the NWT is C$13.46 (2018). Average household expenditures were C$125,783 in 2015. In 2016, the unemployment rate was at 5.9%; the employment rate for males was 80.1%, for females it was 75.2%.The crime rate in Yellowknife for 2016 was 46.7 (per 1,000 persons) for violent crimes, and 167.2 (per 1,000 persons) for property crimes. There were 299 births and 62 deaths in 2014.English was the mother tongue of 80.0% of residents and 3.2% spoke French. Of the nine official languages of the Northwest Territories 0.4% spoke Chipewyan (Dene); 0.1% spoke a Cree language; 0.1% spoke Gwich\u2019in; 0.4% spoke Inuktitut; 0.1% spoke Inuinnaqtun or Inuvialuktun; 0.6% spoke North or South Slavey and 1.2% spoke T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb (Dogrib). In total 3.0% of the population said that an Indigenous language was their mother tongue.Not including the 11 official languages there are over 70 different languages that Yellowknifers stated were their mother tongue. These include Indo-European languages (4.2%); Austronesian languages (3.9%); Indo-Iranian languages and Germanic languages (1.1% each); Sino-Tibetan languages and Chinese languages and Indo-Aryan languages (1.0% each). The five main individual languages are Tagalog (3.2%); Vietnamese (0.8%); German (0.6%); Cantonese and Spanish (0.5% each).Yellowknife is home to 695 recent immigrants (arriving between 2011 and 2016) who now make up 3.7% of the population. Of the recent immigrants 70.5% came from Asia; 15.1% from Africa and 7.2% from both the Americas and Europe. Of the recent immigrants 40.0% came from the Philippines, while 10.8% came from several African countries, 5.8% each from India, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, 4.3% from each of Japan and South Korea and 2.2% from IsraelYellowknife is primarily populated by European with a population of 11,680 (60.6% of total). The total Indigenous peoples population 4,375 representing 22.7% of the population (12.7% First Nations, 7.0% M\u00e9tis), and 3.0% Inuit. Other ethnic groups include Filipino with 1,065 residents (5.5% of total), Black with 610 residents (3.2% of total) and South Asian with 510 residents (2.6% of total) with a total visible minority population of 3,230 (16.7% of total).In the 2001 Census almost 73% of residents identified as Christian while 24% said they had no religious affiliation.. For specific denominations Statistics Canada found that 36% of residents identified as Roman Catholic, 11% as Anglican, 10% for the United Church, about 2% each as Baptists, Lutheran, and Pentecostal, and more than 1% for The Salvation Army. There were also 135 Buddhists, 125 Muslims, and 15 Jews.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nFolk on the Rocks is a local music festival that has been an annual occurrence since 1980.

          "Walking through old town you can really get a feel for what life must have been like 100 years ago in the north. You can get an appreciation for what it must have been like to live in a small wooden structure year round right next to life today. Look for the Ragged A** road.",
          "I really enjoyed walking through Old Town each time I have gone. The large shops are great (be sure you are buying local if you want a true souvenir). However I really enjoyed the small shops (some out of homes) and found many handmade local treasures. View from the top of the",

          "Old Town is good for walking and chilling, but it looks pretty run down. It definitely needs a coat of paint or two, and it would be nice if someone can run a lawn mower and perhaps plant some flowers --- just to make it look a little prettier.",
          "A very cool area. Charming at times. We rated all the restaurants 3 or 4 stars. Climbing up to the monument is a must--amazing views of Back Bay and Yellowknife/Houseboat Bay.",

          "We downloaded the Balado walking tour which was excellent - it was like having a personal guide that made for a wonderful and fascinating few hours. I think there are other good guides. It really helps understand Old Town and appreciate it much more. This was very worthwhile",

          "We did a drive through and around the town. Stopped by a few places. It is an interesting place, but nothing spectacular. The ice road next to it on the frozen Great Slave Lake we found it more exciting and interesting.",

          "I had heard of Old Town and was excited to go, but I wish I didn't. You could see all the signs that during tourist season it might be a happening place, but in October it was a complete waste of time. I spent three hours walking around and don't believe I missed 'the exciting",
          "We booked an BnB for a week in the Old town. It is your best way to experience life on ice lake, the old building and sights around the area. Taxi to main dining areas and shopping is between $7 - $13 depending on where in Yellowknife.",

          "Our hotel was up in the New Town area, and people told us to walk down to Old Town. It was about a 20-25 min walk down there (which mean uphill back to New Town). In fairness, it was a holiday, so not everything was open -- but I was not overly impressed with Old Town. In",
          "I have lived in Yellowknife for more than 50 years. I have seen many, many changes there in my life time! It still holds a uniqueness that only Yellowknife could boast of. Although it is advertised as historic I think that this is not as much important as is its unique",

          "Most of the buildings a older than me and very historical. There are some good views and interesting shops and places to eat. I like history so anything old, like me, is of interest. How could a person go to Yellowknife without visiting the old historical part is beyond me.",
          "There is a lot to see in the Old Town section of YK. Things such as the Wildcat Caf\u00e9, Bulloch's Bistro, the Pilot's Monument and so very much more. Old Town is easy to access from Franklin Avenue (the parking is pretty tight in places).",

          "The best way to see Old Town is to walk it on your own. There is an app you can download that can help guide you. Information on the app is at the Visitor Centre or you can pick up a brochure at your hotel. The Wildcat Caf\u00e9 and Bullock's, two famous restaurants are in the",
          "A must to see! So many wonderful things to see by foot. Walking is the way to go! Take a bike if you wish, but just be aware that is very hilly, so you will get tired. Bring a snack for a picnic and water. Amazing",
          "If you want to visit the mall or a resturant even a bar you must go to old town the wildcat cafe is a must do!",

          "If you don't want to walk there is a bus that goes to Old Town. Enjoyed looking at all the old buildings which give you a history of the area. Pilots monument gives you a good view of the city. Also wandered over to Lantham Island to look at the houses.",

          "Highly recommend walking through old town on an afternoon in the summer, or driving through slowly in the winter. Visit the galleries, the dancing moose for lunch, or Bullocks/Wildcat for lunch/supper for SURE! Lovely waterfront area with a busy houseboat bay, and serene quiet",
          "Great place to go for a walk and experience the old Yellowknife. A few unique stores to visit and browse the local made items. A couple of very unique restaurants, like the Wildcat Caf\u00e9 and Bullocks Bistro. The Pilots Monument is also located in this area. If you come to",
          "A must see when visiting Yellowknife. A few really nice shops, excellent scenery and includes the Wild Cat Cafe. You can't say you've been to Yellowknife unless the Wild Cat was on your itinerary",

          "Loved walking down to Old Town and back in -31 deg, snowing, frozen lake, rustic buildings, designer new buildings.... fantastic",
          "We took a city tour and went to the old town area. It was ok to learn about its history, but I am not necessarily jumping up and down. The houses built on stilts to prevent foundation cracking was interesting, but there wasn't anyone on the road during our entire drive. I",
          "Not much to do in Yellowknife, so it was a good 15 min walking destination to the ice road and see the ice castle. Unfortunately, Bullocks Fish and Chips only opens at 4pm on Sunday. There was a fun fur shop and a gift shop to visit.",
          "I joined a City Tour together with Ice Road Tour. The City Tour included an outlook tour + village tour. The tour was worth 1 visit. It was interesting to know that the houses at Yellow Knife do not have water pipes.",

          "Everyone should take the time to enjoy the view from pilots monument (as well as the goings and comings of seaplanes and house-boaters.) a multitude of good restaurants scattered about the base (iconic bullocks / wildcat ranging to contemporary moose cafe). A bit daunting on",
          "I was driving there. The buildings are great, but its difficult to park since the road is one way, and there are other tourists coming. There is a road bypass to the great slave lake itself. And it is great to see the whole Yellowknife when you drive to Pilots Monument. But when",
          "The best part of being in old town in the winter for me was access to the ice road. I walked along it 3 mornings in a row for hours and loved the expansive feeling of the frozen lake. The morning sunrise and light was gorgeous. Met some friendly people along the way, even got",

          "I think Old Town is the original site of Yellowknife and has the most ecclectic mix of architecture. Some unique shops and homes to see. Check out the one of a kind shop, Weaver & Devore, a small old fashioned northern/outfitter store. Gallery of the Midnight Sun has northern",
          "Old town was worth the walk out of town to kill a few hours in between nightly aurora chasing. Not a lot of attractions but taking in the lakeside aspects was nice. Go up to the lookout for a great view of the surrounds and particularly the rockiness of the terrain, Check out",

          "The best things about Old Town are the galleries with northern art, although there are not as many of these as there are in other old towns we have visited. We particularly like the monument as you enter old town and reading about its meaning. Also there was a hardware/general",

          "We walked around town and took in all the local features. Very different from big city life and interesting to see the original background featured on walls, on garbage cans etc. Very clean town, people were very friendly.",
          "Definitely a must to visit while in YK. It is fun to see the various shops and restaurants -- a great place to walk around -- also, be sure to head up to Pilot's Monument for a great vista overlooking Yellowknife. If I was short on time, I would be tempted to miss Wildcat",
          "Well the prices in the eateries were high but there was LOTS to see and LOTS to buy. Very authenic souvenires!",
          "Once you notice details like the painted dumpsters & decorated houses & entire apartments made of corrugated steel... you fall more & more in love with it. The waterfronts are privately owned, so don't expect a boardwalk, but you can see a nice view of both bays from the roads.",
          "Not much is terribly old in this old town, and it must be called this because it was the first part of the town to be settled, but it's fun to walk around (doesn't take long!), and it's worth driving across to look at some of the unique architecture in the adjacent Latham Island",

          "This part of The 'Knife gives a good \"look back\" to how things were in the North back when it was a sleepy mining town. Not surprisingly it was founded and grew around the lake as this was the key point for the float planes of the day. Planes are still a major component of the",

          "We stayed 3 out of 4 nights in Old Town. There's so much to see in March. We stayed at Bayside Bed & Breakfast right on the water so we could see the planes taking off and landing on the ice runway. We drove on the 6km ice road to Dettah and back. Went to see the Ice Castle - $5",

          "Old Town consists of a handful of relatively old (1930s) and some dilapidated buildings. Compared to a typical 5 star historical town, like Virginia City in Nevada,, Tombstone, Az, or the old town of Quebec city, this is a 1 star attraction. . . If you are coming to see",

          "This part of town deserves a fair amount of time and walking to really enjoy. Walk to the top of the hill to see the views and memorials to pilots of years gone by. Check out the old restaurants but be prepared to pay to enjoy them. Lots to see and do.",
          "good galleries, lots of choices. Fun old stores. Parking was a bit of a hassle but we managed, its probably easier if you know your way around. Went on a boat tour for an hour of the lake immediately around the city - it was fun to see the houseboats.",

          "Old town is real and funky and full of artists. Northern glass studio/Down to Earth gallery is a wonderful place to stop. It's a cooperative of northern artists, many of them local. Right next to gallery of the midnight sun, which is nice but more production art, an high end",
          "There is so much in Old Town, you MUST see this if you go to Yellowknife. A lot of great restaurants and museums. I would highly recommend going to pilot's monument as well to get a great view of the lake and old town. Hit up Bullock's and the Smoke House too!",
          "Loved the Old Town Glassworks workshop. They recycle wine and some liquor bottles into beautiful glasses, vases, some jewelry. The workshop teaches you how to take a bottle and transform it into the item you choose, prep it and sand blast a design onto it for a very unique",

        "wiki": "Les Stroud (born October 20, 1961) is a Canadian survival expert, filmmaker and musician best known as the creator, writer, producer, director, cameraman and host of the television series Survivorman.  After a short career behind the scenes in the music industry, Stroud became a full-time wilderness guide, survival instructor and musician based in Huntsville, Ontario. Stroud has produced survival-themed programming for The Outdoor Life Network, The Discovery Channel, The Science Channel, and YTV.  The survival skills imparted from watching Stroud's television programs have been cited by several people as the reason they lived through harrowing wilderness ordeals.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStroud was born in the Mimico neighbourhood of Toronto and graduated from Mimico High School. Stroud went on to complete the Music Industry Arts program at Fanshawe College in London, Ontario. Stroud worked for several years at the Toronto-based music video channel MuchMusic, and as a songwriter for the band New Regime before a Temagami canoe trip sparked a career change. During this time he also worked as garbage collector for the City of Toronto.In 1990 Stroud became a guide for Black Feather Wilderness Adventures leading canoe excursions into the Northern Ontario wilds. It was also during this time while on a survival course he met his future wife, photographer Sue Jamison. They married in 1994 and together left for a year-long honeymoon in the remote Wabakimi area of Ontario which was to become the basis of the documentary Snowshoes and Solitude. Afterwards, the couple moved to Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories where Stroud was employed as an outdoor instructor to special needs individuals of aboriginal descent. Stroud and Jamison then settled in Huntsville, Ontario where they had two children and started both the outdoor instructional outfit Wilderness Voice and the media company Wilderness Spirit Productions.Inspired by the popularity of the television show Survivor, Stroud pitched a more authentic version of the show to The Discovery Channel Canada. Stroud produced two programs titled One Week in the Wilderness  and Winter in the Wilderness for @discovery.ca in 2001. The success of these specials led to the development of Survivorman, a show that followed a similar format of leaving Stroud on his own, with minimal equipment, in the wilderness to videotape his survival experience.\n\n\n== Film and television ==\nAfter his marriage to  Jamison in 1994, the two of them spent one year in the Canadian wilderness to attempt a paleolithic existence. They travelled to Goldsborough Lake (50\u00b041\u203255\u2033N 89\u00b020\u203246\u2033W) deep in the Wabakimi, first building a tipi then an attached A-frame while using no metal, plastic, or otherwise manufactured tools. For the first half of the year, they took a store of traditional foods such as wild rice, squash, beaver and moose meat, bear fat, and maple sugar. In late September, Stroud's friends Doug Getgood and Fred Rowe brought in food for the next six months and chopped firewood for the couple. Stroud and Jamison built and equipped a winter cabin using an axe, a modern bow saw, and a trapper's tin wood stove left by Getgood and Rowe, along with a metal pot they found.\nFamily and medical emergencies brought them out of the bush on three occasions. Once when Stroud's father was dying from cancer, another when they both went to be treated for giardiasis, and again when Jamison had a miscarriage. Stroud filmed their primitive living experience and released the 50 minute documentary, Snowshoes and Solitude, which was named Best Documentary at the Muskoka Film Festival and Best Film at the Waterwalker Film Festival.In 2001 Stroud produced two one-hour specials for the science news show @discovery.ca. These segments follow the same format as Survivorman with Stroud filming his own survival in the wilderness. They were originally broadcast as daily segments over the course of one week but were repackaged as two one-hour specials titled Stranded. The popularity of these pilots spawned the show Survivorman. Stroud produced 23 episodes of the show which began airing in 2004. Stroud also composed and performed the opening theme music of Survivorman.In 2006, Stroud produced a 90-minute special documenting his family's journey to building an off-the-grid home. The show, Off the Grid with Les Stroud, chronicled the process of buying property and refitting an old farm house with solar and wind power, a raincatcher and well, as well as the adjustments the Stroud family had to make to adapt to this style of living. Stroud has made multiple television appearances including on  The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, The View, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and Larry King Live.Stroud has also hosted an episode of the Discovery channel show I Shouldn't Be Alive titled Lost In The Snow, which aired during its first season and the TV program Surviving Urban Disasters, which aired on the Science Channel and the 20th annual Shark Week on the Discovery Channel.In 2010, Stroud hosted and produced the Gemini nominated hit kids TV series Survive This and Survive This 2 (YTV, Cartoon Network) that takes teens into the wilderness to teach them how to survive by giving them some instruction and challenging them with survival scenarios. Stroud's follow-up show to Survivorman was titled Beyond Survival with Les Stroud and debuted in 2010.\n\n\n== Music ==\nIn addition to film making and wilderness survival, Stroud has also worked in the music industry as a professional musician. After graduation, Stroud worked both as an associate producer for the nascent music channel MuchMusic as well as production manager on music videos for artists such as Rush and Corey Hart. During this time Stroud also played in the David Bowie cover band Diamond Dogs and played lead guitar and composed music for his band New Regime which signed with RCA Records shortly after Stroud left the band.As frequently illustrated in his show Survivorman, Stroud is considered an exceptional blues harmonica player.\nThis instrument is featured prominently in his self-titled debut CD which has been described as \"a collection of diverse roots/blues and traditional folk, acoustic music that reflects the uniquely northern spirit of freedom and adventure.\" Several songs off of this album can be downloaded from his official site. Stroud has performed in and around the Muskoka area and at the Orillia Blues Festival and Toronto Beaches International Jazz Festival.\nStroud and The Northern Pikes have struck up a musical collaboration under the name Les Stroud and the Pikes. Throughout 2005 and 2006 they performed together live several times, and an EP born from this collaboration entitled Long Walk Home that was released in the spring of 2007.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nStroud has received several accolades as a musician.  He has won \"Best Acoustic/Folk Act\", \"Best Blues Act\" and \"Best Overall\" awards at the Spirit of the North music festival in New Liskeard, Ontario.Stroud's documentary Snowshoes and Solitude was named Best Documentary at the Muskoka Film Festival and Best Film at the Waterwalker Film Festival.Stroud was nominated for six Gemini Awards for his work on Survivorman.

        "wiki": "Highway 4, known as the Ingraham Trail, extends from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories to Tibbitt Lake, approximately 70 km (43 mi) east of Yellowknife. It was built in the mid-1960s as the first leg of a 'road to resources' with the original intention of circulating Great Slave Lake.\nThe highway is designated as a northern/remote route of Canada's National Highway System.\nThe Ingraham Trail serves as both an industrial and recreational highway. In February and March each year, the trail is the initial section of the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road to three diamond mines located {300 km (190 mi) northeast of Yellowknife. The trail is also known as Yellowknife's cottage country, with the bulk of seasonal and year-round cabins located between Cassidy Point and Prelude Lake Territorial Park. During the winter road program, B-train tractor trailers travel the road, four loads every 20 minutes, 24 hours a day.\nAlthough the highway serves primarily recreational activities and area residences in this lake-dotted country it is, after the ice break-up on Great Slave Lake, the only access to Dettah from Yellowknife. The small Dene community is about 6.5 km (4.0 mi) from Yellowknife by ice road in winter or 27 km (17 mi) using the Ingraham Trail.\nFor about a month in late winter, a winter road to Lac de Gras is opened to trucking of mining supplies, the junction being along the Ingraham Trail. The road condition has suffered due to its frequent use by heavy trucks. This is shown on the first season of the American reality television series, Ice Road Truckers, which airs on History. The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road also extends from the end of the Ingraham Trail to Contwoyto Lake in Nunavut, forming Nunavut's only connection to the road network in the rest of Canada.\nThe Ingraham Trail is named after Vic Ingraham, a pioneer Yellowknife businessman of the 1930s\u201340s.\nYellowknife has experienced an aurora borealis tourism boom the last few years and the Ingraham Trail is the prime viewing location. It is common to come across aurora rush after midnight during the peak aurora season, November to March.\n\n\n== Details ==\n\nSince January 2014, the road bypasses Giant Mine through a realignment that originates off Highway 3, approximately 2 km (1.2 mi) from the Old Airport Road turnoff. At 7.6 km (4.7 mi) the road crosses the Yellowknife River followed by the Dettah turnoff at 9.8 km (6.1 mi). After this the road passes several territorial parks:\nYellowknife River Territorial Park  (7.7 km (4.8 mi))\nDettah turnoff (9.8 km (6.1 mi))\nProsperous Lake Territorial Park (19.7 km (12.2 mi))\nMadeline Lake Territorial Park (24 km (15 mi))\nPontoon Lake Territorial Park (26.4 km (16.4 mi))\nPrelude Lake Territorial Park (28 km (17 mi)\nHidden Lake Territorial Park (44 km (27 mi))\nPowder Point Day Use Area 44 km (27 mi))\nCameron River Falls Day Use Area/Hiking Trail Access (45.8 km (28.5 mi))\nCameron River Crossing (54.5 km (33.9 mi))\nReid Lake Territorial Park  (59 km (37 mi))before reaching Tibbitt Lake (69.2 km (43.0 mi)).\nThe trail is chipsealed to Reid Lake, leaving the last 10 km (6.2 mi) as gravel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n1934 Vic Ingraham and Speed II NWT Historical Timeline, Prince of Wales Northern Heritage CentreIngraham Trail History",

          "We joined the japanese group and it was awesome ! The weather is nice and the tour guide is kind .we hike until the falls and its was great!",
          "This is easy to find and you should visit. There are washrooms in the parking lot and the trail is well marked. This is uphill with rock and it was slippery due to rain. This walk is moderate in my opinion and is not suitable for anyone with limited mobility.",
          "This trail starts about 50 km outside of Yellowknife, at Hidden Lake Territorial Park. It's an easy drive to get there. The trail is very well marked, and the scenery is stunning. There are some areas where you need to clamber up some rocky terrain, and others where you need",
          "Happen to be in Yellowknife? Then I highly recommend this hike. The trails are well-maintained and somewhat easy to navigate. With Yellowknife being on the Canadian Shield, there are rockier areas where you will need to watch your step. Would also highly recommend bringing",

          "The falls are a must see if you live, or visit Yellowkife. They are not far from the city (about 47km). The parking lot has washrooms, and can accommodate several cars. I found the trail marking quite interesting (different from the south, and what we are used to seeing in",
          "A nice easy hike to the falls. We were looking forward to swimming but it's was somewhat difficult to find a place to get in unless you went downstream. We continued on down this highway to the end of Ingraham Trail when we were done which was cool to get to the end of the",
          "Definitely worth the drive! The falls are impressive. Great lookouts and well maintained trail. May want to bring some bug spray, mosquitoes could be annoying.",

          "The walk in is moderately difficult, but well worth it. Sturdy walking shoes are a must. Should be visited by anyone able to do the walk.",
          "We were lucky a great sunny day with no bugs. 3.7Km road trip. There are boardwalks and stairs on the tough bits of the trail. It\u2019s well marked with blue markers.",

          "I came here in February for a winter hike and it was a very refreshing hike. The paths are well marked, but be warned some of the stairways are not cleaned. They were filled with packed snow, so you should take care going down them. I was expecting to see the Cameron Falls with",

          "As others have mentioned...the trail to see Cameron Falls was fairly easy and beautiful. Having said that going at the end of October there was already some snow and ice patches that you really need to be careful of. Definitely at this time of year you will want good sturdy",

          "The fact that this is a bit of a hike over uneven terrain keeps the crowds away. Any healthy person with good shoes can do this hike in about 45 minutes one way. Reward at the end is a beautiful pristine falls that you can go right down to and stand in the cold water.",
          "Hike to a nice waterfall, some rocks are in the way and you have to climb a little bit. So it is not a very easy walk but worth it.",
          "Great trail to take in the YK scenary. Wear good shoes, you often walk on rock. The trail is well maintained, and the view of the falls at the end is beautiful.",
          "The drive out to Cameron River Falls is full of amazing view and well worth the trip the fall themselves are close to the road and easy to access. The area is beautiful",

          "This trail is very well maintained however you need to be agile as parts of the trail see you scrambling across some rock. It's a short trail that takes you to a waterfall and then you return the way you came.",
          "Apparently we missed the falls but saw the falls ramparts about 10km down the road. No trail maps on site but there were toilets. Would have been nice for a map since we started out but could not hear the falls or see them on my phone gps, so we left for the falls we could see",
          "Awesome views! Great place to visit for a picnic or just a hike! The hike to the falls is short enough for kids and there aren\u2019t too many bugs.",

          "Although the falls are mostly frozen and parts of the trail are a bit slippery, it is still a nice 3hrs winter activity (including the drive from Yellowknife). There is a small flowing section on the right hand side of the falls even in -30C temperatures.",
          "We hiked this early in the morning so we had the trail to ourselves. The trail itself was well marked but there are some steep parts that get pretty treacherous since the trail was covered in ice and snow. If you do this, plan on channeling your inner mountain goat. The views",
          "If here for a short or long visit make time for this spot. It\u2019s more than an average hiking ability however. With steep slopes that can be very slippery if wet and steep stairs. The views and hike are terrific.",

          "This was a great way to spend a few hours, from the drive out and the trail in. There are a few ups and downs and the rocks could possibly be slippery at times but it was definitely time well spent. The place is beautiful and getting to the falls is the icing on the cake. I was",
          "Took a tour, visited the falls and the ramparts. Good to be able to get so close to nature. Bridges very well done and kept up.walkways boardwalk in some areas, rocks to climb in others, Wear good shoes",
          "I had the pleasure of joining Rosie for a 5 hour Cameron Falls experience. She's a great guide and made the hike come alive. I learned a ton from her and her bag of tricks she carries to provide great value and context. Leave town by 0900 to avoid the crowds. Have her pack",
          "The views of the fall absolutely blew us away! It far exceeded our expectations! Wish we packed a picnic lunch and stayed for longer! The walk is not too bad! Easy 20min if you're in good shape! We had someone very out of shape in our group and it took her about 45 min",
          "Trail is accessible with a few spots that need extra care if person has sore knees. Nice views of the falls.",
          "A short drive on the Ingraham Trail takes you to the trail to Cameron River Falls. It takes about 20-25 minutes to hike to the falls over a well marked trail. There is some steep climbing over large rocks but most fit people should be able to make it. There are boardwalks across",
          "I hiked this trail twice while staying in a cabin near Prelude Lake. I am fairly fit and was able to complete the round trip in less than 1 hour. On day one, we were the first ones on the trail at 9am and had a peaceful tranquil hike. The second day, I arrived around 2pm and",
          "Easy trail to ramparts. Steep in some spots, but worth it. Had a picnic by the ramparts. There are stairs.",
          "This was the second of two hikes we did the same day. The Cameron Falls Trail is 2 km return, but it's up and down over smooth rocky trails, some on quite an incline. We are young seniors and managed, but if you're not fit or sure footed, you may find it hard. I'd be careful",
          "A bit of a jaunt out of Yellowknife, but a couple hours well spent. The hike was good; a bit of up and down - got the blood pumping in sections. The payoff at the end was pretty nice too! Well worth a visit if staying in Yellowknife for a couple days. Some how managed to miss",
          "Take a short hike to see these falls. They are worth the hike& there are seats along the trail that you can take a rest on. Would of loved to go in the spring as that would give you lots more water rushing through & make them that much more spectacular.",
          "About 40 min out the Ingraham Highway. The walk is of intermedient difficulty over the Sheild. Kids can do it",
          "Cameron falls trail, a nice quiet hike! Went there solo with my dog, a westie. It's a challenging hike as the trail is naturally paved. Trail consist of gravel & rocks. Trail is located 50km from Yellowknife on the Ingraham trail Hwy. Washroom facilities located at the",
          "I drove out with some friends while visiting Yellowknife. It's an easy drive from the city; we went around 10 pm. It's a bit of a hike in, about half an hour, and I wasn't in the best shape so it was tough, but for an average person in shape it shouldn't be too difficult. The",
          "This is an in-and-out trail. We thought it was full-circle, but it is not. While there are bridges, stairs, etc., most of the trail is ungroomed and some areas are a bit challenging if you're not in shape. There was still quite a bit of snow in the sheltered parts of the",
          "Beautiful hike. My 4 year old could manage it but he isn't a complainer. Beware of potential mosquitoes.",
          "After driving for miles ,almost a day, through wilderness, we came upon a beautiful city,Yellowknife! People come from all over so are very friendly and are one big happy family! If you love being out in the wild, Cameron Falls is the best place to visit Well marked trails and",
          "There are 2 sets of falls in this great northern park. The first(short) hike is by the bridge and is about a 10 - 15 hike in and has a small wooden walkway to get close to the falls to get some great pictures and memories. There is an outhouse by the entrance. Depending on when",
          "We did the Cameron Falls Hike end of December. Takes a bit longer as covered in snow. It was beautiful though and looked like you were hiking in a postcard of a Winter Wonderland. There are markers above the snow to help keep you on the trail. A few spots where need to kinda",
          "Path is marked and easy to navigate. Uneven parts at times. Usually busy on weekends. Great way to get out of the city and get some exercise.",
          "Beginning of the Cameron Rive Trail is located on km 47 of the Ingraham Trail by Hidden lake territorial park. Parking lot is available there. Most of the hike leads over stones and rocks, but it\u00b4s not too difficult to get to the waterfalls. Even so, I\u2019d recommend to wear some",
          "Beautiful park located about 3/4's of the way down the Ingraham Trail. Ample parking with outhouse (bring paper in case it is empty). Starting portion of trail very easy but becomes more difficult with incline over rock and terrain. We attempted to go before with parents but",
          "I am not sure why you need a tour to this place if you have a rental car. We drove to the trail head and hiked up to the waterfall. It is a busy trail through boreal forest and granite hills. Wildlife tends to stay way (though not always). The waterfalls at the end are a nice",
          "Short distance to drive out of Yellowknife. About 2 km round trip over rocks and well marked trail, some stairs, some biardwalk to beautiful 17 metre falls, river and canyon. .Gorgeous scenery! I also appreciated the benches to sit on at the top to enjoy the view and a snack.",
          "You will access it from Hidden Lake, about 50 minutes drive on Ingraham Trail. The hike to the waterfall is about 25 minutes from parking lot. It is not a very easy hike, a lot of rocks and steep steps, do wear proper shoes. Once you reach to Cameron Fall, the view is",
          "We drove there in our rental car and it was well worth it. The hike was intermediate in terms of difficulty and the scenery was great. One can get right next to the fall and I even saw people having a picnic on the rocks at the bottom near the fall. I would however think twice",
          "This is a very pleasant trail with amazing scenery, including the beautiful waterfalls. We brought a small picnic and dined in the sunshine on the rocks beside the falls.",
          "We had a guide on our walk to the Falls. It is fairly easy to navigate, even for seniors, if you have no mobility issues. Also wear proper shoes. The well groomed trail lasts only a couple of hundred metres, then the trail climbs over large boulders. Neither the trail nor",
          "Nice moderately difficult walk. Nice views of the falls but last time we were there there were tour buses so it may get too bus quickly.",
          "The trail is easy and a nice little hike. The falls are beautiful and the fishing is pretty good. Ok for swimming and picnic area.",
          "Definitely worth the 50 min drive and 20 min walk, a great piece of nature to visit. The canadian Shield scenery was very nice with the falls.",
          "The falls were magnificent, the rock passages were a little complex for this novice hiker. I wouldn't suggest small children unless you keep them in hand there is no guard rail at the falls.",
          "About 45 minutes outside of Yellowknife. The road is pretty good although gravel in many areas. The trail to the falls is well marked and moderately challenging. The falls are lovely to look at. A nice way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "About 50 km from Yellowknife. Nice trail for a hike to the falls. Cool places to have a picnic. Part of a portage between lakes.",
          "We went with Backyard Tours. We did the Ramparts section. The walk was quite gentle, the scenery and views were excellent. We had a picnic in the park which was a beautiful experience.",
          "Worth the drive out of town. A good way to see the landscape. Better to visit in the summer! Probably one of the best hiking trails in Yellowknife.",
          "It was a little farther out of Yellowknife than we realized and had no bars on the cellphones to confirm we were on the right track - likely about 45 out of Yellowknife.....we were afraid of bears but saw none - sprayed ourselves with OFF Deepwoods and we were fine. It's a",
          "Wow this was truly an amazing climb. And what a gorgeous view from the top. Definitely worth the climb lol. You will not regret this trip. Watch out for bears yes there are bears roaming so just be careful when carrying food if you don't need to carry food with you it's safer.",
          "Getting to the actual falls is a good little workout. When there is lots of water, the falls are quite spectacular.",
          "This trail is well-marked and easy to follow. It traverses typical Northern Territory. The falls are a great spot for a picnic. By September the days are still long, but the mosquitos have largely disappeared.",
          "Located around 50 km from downtown Yellowknife, this is a fantastic place for outdoor enthusiasts. Even in a thick snow cover, we were able to navigate the trail comfortable using our hiking boots. The falls were frozen which were a good sight, but nothing outstanding. The trail",
          "The trail starts from the parking lot and runs about 2 km into the bush. There are stairs placed where the steepness of the trail warrants and the trail is well marked. The falls are well frozen but the water still gushes out at the base of the falls. You can also see \"windows\"",
          "This was a really nice walk although a little difficult with an infant in a carrier. I'd recommend waiting til the kids are a bit older and bring a small first aid kit for knee scrapes on the plenty of rocks you cross. If I went again I'd wait til the rainy season as the",
          "Gorgeous scenery: eroded rock, trees, river, waterfalls (spectacular). At times the elevation is fairly high and the views are magnificent.",
          "Cameron falls is a cool place to take a short hike on the Ingraham Trail. I wouldn't call it mind blowing by any means, but definitely worth checking out the natural beauty of the NWT if you're in the area. Even though it's not a long, treacherous hike by any means, you",
          "You don't need to be a regular hiker. Is about 30 minutes out of town. Trail actually begins at the \"Hidden Lake\" parking area and will take about 45 minutes until you get to the falls. Well worth it... Watch for bears in the summer. Just travel as a group.",
          "My wife and I hiked to the falls last week following a large snowfall. The trees were covered in snow making it quite the serene walk. We were the first and only ones out there that day so we had the trail to ourselves. What a beautiful site the river is in the winter. There are",
          "We did this hike in about 6\" of snow. Was a lot of fun though. About 4km round trip. What a beautiful hike! There are lots of stairs and fairly steep slopes to climb. A little slippery in spots.",
          "The view of the falls and the trek over the rocky terrain is worth the mosquito bites. Be sure to wear good hiking shoes.",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit. It is quite a drive, but well worth it. It's a very long walk, & not very well maked but the scenery makes it all worth while.",
          "Plan an hour and a half; bring a picnic to eat at the top of the falls.Make sure to take the left trail from the parking lot and go all the way, crossing the bridge to the north side",
          "We have joined My Backyard Tours for the visit. As there are bears in the days before, we have a visit to another trail nearby. Our tour guide, John is extremely friendly, experienced and knowledgeable. Margaret's lunch box is also fantastic and delicious for picnic in such a",
          "The colours of the fall, which are abundant on this trail in the middle of September, makes this hike great. The trail is easy, well marked with little gain elevation. Don't forget to bring your bear bell, as recently a bear has been spotted around the Cameron falls.",
          "A very pretty hike, but lots of up and down, and the trail is uneven (2 of the 7 in our group fell on the hike). If you do go, you should at least make it to the bridge that spans the river. Very pretty views. The water was very low in Sept. 2015, and the waterfall was just a",
          "Even though the water levels were low, this was an excellent hike. Beautiful scenery, well cared for trail, and a great destination! The road was gravel for the last bit and we worried a little about the rental car getting dinged but no problems.",
          "Hiked this trail with my son-in-law, husband and pregnant daughter (final trimester). It is well marked and a good work out. The falls are very pretty and offer opportunities for great photos. Make the effort to travel the Ingram Trail and hike this trail. Well worth it.",
          "Reasonable hike with two children aged 11 and 8. Marked trial. About 30 minutes each way. Easy to fine on Ingram Trail. About 45 minute drive from Yellowknife.",
          "This is a walk into the bush and over rocky terrain with a moderate level of difficulty, well-marked paths, and excellent views. The river area is breathtakingly beautiful. Although the trails are marked, it can be confusing. Go with a guide for the best experience.",
          "A trip every one that visit must do great views and good for expending your morning better in summer than with the snow hey!",
          "This is a pretty area to see and to hike in. My wife and I hiked into it and the trail was doable for people not in the best of shape. The view of the waterfall was superb",
          "The falls are located on a hiking trail on the Ingraham Trail about 35 - 40 km outside Yellowknife. I was blown away by the sense of wilderness on the drive out! The trail itself is a fairly easy hike; one can also walk down to the base of the falls.",
          "Short hike into trail which is well marked and maintained. Perfect place to enjoy a picnic and falls. Can dip your toes into the water, it's cold.",
          "great hike... quite far but worth it. the trail marker is very useful. I possibly got lost without the markers.",
          "Great 2.5 km hike in - beautiful falls - nice pic nick spot - there is even a bridge so you can cross the river and see the falls from the other side. We loved the 'wild roses' everywhere.",
          "Nice easy hike in for most people under 65 years, and fit people over this age. Nice swimming at the lake/river above and below the falls in the summer. Have fun, but watch the bugs along the trail in summer.",
          "There are well marked trails that cross a hump of the Canadian shield on the way to the falls. Nice view once you get to the falls and there are many opportunities for exploring",
          "This is a well marked trail that leads to the Falls. The trail is well marked and gives you a \"Canadian Shield\" hiking experience. We started our hike at about 9:15 P.M. Yes the land of the midnight sun. We were back at the parking lot around 10:30 and back in town at 11 P.",
          "Whats not to like. It is a surprise at the end of the tunnel. Make it into an afternoon or day picnic. The trail is very nice and well marked",
          "this trail is a must see, particularly in the spring when the waterfall is magnificent. The trail is easy and can be done by most people in a very short time.",
          "Slipped several times as the trail is not well maintained. It was icy and could not finish the trail (Didn't want to break any bones)",
          "Yellowknife is one of the most beautiful and amazing places I've ever been. I was there in February so the snow covered everything! I did this around 4km hike in about -20 degrees, it was spectacular. My uncle and two friends of ours who live here took us on this hike. The snow",
          "beautiful hike.gorgeous road trip there.fabulous fauna.easy to get to. roads are excellent.no places to stop en route",
          "When you are bored living in Yellowknife, this is the ONE excursion that is worthwhile.... take a picnic and take your time... if the weather is nice it will e a day to remember",
          "We did the trail in the winter (March 2015) and it was very pleasant. However, we are very glad we did it with snowshoes - there are many slippery sections and you want good traction. Note too, that in the whole time we did not see anyone else so you are on your own. Cell phone",

          "The trail is nice and you better have running shoes or hiking shoes. Bring water and a sandwich if you want to stay long. Beautiful views of the River and Falls. Natural setting; ideal to escape the city and enjoy nature. Be careful of bears. The trail is pretty easy but",
          "I went to cameron falls to have a bit of an immersion in the Canadian shield country. That was the ideal spot to get a feel for it. About 45 minutes to go from Yellowknife. Drive 15 minutes further and you will reach the end of highway 4 where the ice road starts in winter. That",
          "Trick with Cameron falls is to take your time. There is no rush and you will miss interesting things on your way if you go too fast. The path is well marked and is sometimes difficult on rock so make sure you have good shoes on when you go",
          "The drive might seem to go on forever but its worth it. The falls aren't huge but the trail and surrounding area are beautiful. Also, in true northern style, there is a lot of freedom in where you can roam and explore. You'll be doing some easy climbs over boulders/rocks so I",
          "Fun hike, not too long, in beautiful surroundings, with a gorgeous waterfall. About a 1 hour drive from town. You need a car.",
          "One has to rent a car (read: NOT CHEAP) or join some sort of tour in order to get to the falls - it's about an hour's drive along a not-very-busy highway, but the driving is pleasant and their are lots of lakes to break up the view. If you run into car trouble, you might have to",
          "It will take you about half hour from parking place to the falls but is worth. Nice view and many animals and birds you will see. Preparing your camera and come.",
          "Amazing afternoon at the falls. This is a bit of a varied terrain hike, so be careful on the rocks if it's wet. Just follow the markers and you can't get lost. Make sure you cross the bridge and check out the other side. Might not be suitable for frail seniors, but lots of",
          "This hike won't take you long (about an hour round trip) but the falls are beautiful especially in the fall when the leaves are turning color. The flies can be troublesome but if you keep moving they don't seem to bother you. Plan to eat lunch in your car or you will be",
          "This is a very pleasant hike. The falls are beautiful and you've probably put on a little weight during your stay in Yellowknife so a little exercise sure couldn't hurt!",
          "This short hike gives visitors a good idea of what the taiga is like with the bonus of a lovely, cascading waterfall at the end of it. The route is will marked and has the added bonus of stairs where they are most needed. Hike upstream once you get there and you will find a",
          "We saw mixed reviews and wondered whether it would be worth the trip. It was! The views are beautiful. On the way, there was road construction and in a few places it was a little rough for a minute or two, but nothing to worry about. The trail was well marked and not too",
          "The road to hidden lake is under construction and it takes a while to get here but it worth the trip. Beautiful view at the end of a 2km easy hike. Well marked trails take you in and you can spend some time on both sides of the falls.",
          "Nice wilderness trail to a gorgeous waterfall with unique rock formations (wide stretches of rock to sun on or spread out a picnic) and not too strenuous for people whose knees are what they used to be. Two hours round trip max.",
          "I went out to this hiking trail today. First, there is 4km of road that is under construction, and you have to drive over a road covered in \"fist sized\" rock. A lot of the rest of the road is gravel. When you get there, the beginning of the trail is very deceiving. It starts",
          "Cool to see- but getting there was a pain, as Ingraham trail is under construction currently. We rented a car and I'm not sure if the money (~$150) was worth the sight! If you have your own car, as long as it's a truck or SUV, I would go see it though.",
          "The trail was easy to follow even in the winter.Good area to park and not a long hike to get to the Falls.",
          "I did this hike in mid-July about two years ago. It's a great place to catch the sunset (or just visit when the sun is low in the sky.) It's really well marked and we didn't see another soul on it. We did two-nights in row. We had a local friend show us the cliff jumping spot.",
          "Hiking or snowshoeing on this lovely trail. The snow was crisp and even, the sky blue, the air fresh and brisk. The falls themselves of course were frozen, but that did not matter. You can still hear the rushing water underneath. You might be lucky to see ptarmigan and even a",
          "We must be slow hikers - we took much longer than others indicate, but we were leisurely & stopped often to admire & photograph the scenery & flora along the trail. We packed a lunch - ate by the river on the smooth washed rocks. Serene. Then over the amazing bridge & we",
          "I have been to the falls twice and it is such a great experience. The walk is well marked and there are steps over the rougher spots. The scenery at the falls is amazing. Remember to wear good walking or hiking shoes and take water and the trip will be well worth it.",
          "Enjoyed my hike into Cameron Falls. Trail can be slippery in spots, but overall it's in excellent shape over varied terrain. Falls payoff at the end is worth it...you'll easily spend an hour or more lingering around and exploring the various points and levels of the Falls.",
          "I'm amazed at the work that has gone into this trail to make it navigable for pretty much anyone. You still have to climb some but the boardwalks and stairways give opportunity to many more to enjoy the spectacular view of the falls.",
          "It is a nice hike, but it will take about 2.5-3 hours altogether as it does take a while (45 mins) to drive out there. Once there however it is very beautiful.",
          "It was a short hike from the parking lot. The trail is marked and worn well enough that you have no trouble finding your way back. The falls are very nice and you might even see some wild life. I would recommend this trip to anyone visiting Yellowknife.",
          "We went on a sunny day in early September and the temperature was comfortable for the hike. A nice trail with areas for breaks and well marked. We suggest driving there yourself and taking the time to hike to the falls and spend some time there for great pictures. Pack a",
          "About a 45-kilometre drive outside Yellowknife lies a sparkling waterfall that's easily accessible along a well-marked trail. Take a picnic lunch and sit beside the pristine waters of the Cameron River before it plunges over the rocky precipice. The 30-minute trail winds",
          "For those who are in even reasonable shape, this is a quick hike that rewards you with a nice view. Bugs are bad at the beginning but got better quickly. Clearly marked trail.",
          "we cam out here at 9 o clock at night, due to the fact that sunset would not be until 11 30 we had ample time to enjoy the hike into the Falls themselves. Breathtaking views along the way and a final destination of absolute beauty made it an amazing adventure.",
          "A business colleague suggested we go here and do the hike to go see the falls, and was I ever glad we did. It was a lovely sunny day and we did the hike at a decent pace, it takes 15-20 minutes to hit the falls and another 10-15 to go over the bridge to the other side. The",
          "About 45km from yellowknife. The hike is only about 30 minutes. Amazing area. Beautiful scenery. Great for picnics and hiking. Would recommend this for everyone.",
          "This is a great short hike, even the icy winter. Beautiful view of the falls and natural scenery. I would recommend going to the visitor's center to get a self-guided Cameron Falls geological tour book to get the most out of the hike.",
          "I have done this trail twice. Once in the Spring and once in the Fall. Both times the trail was really fun. It is a little rugged but easy to do, an average person who does not excercise much will find it a little challenging however will still be able to do it no problem.",
          "Our group was in Yellowknife hunting aurora for 4 nights. I had researched and researched for other activities to do. This is a short and very scenic winter hike! Take your time and enjoy the scenery and take lots of pictures. Make sure you leave yourself time to come back",
          "The walk is quite a long one in bear country so I would recommend to be prepared with bear mace but once the walking is done there is a lot of things to see and do as far as picnic and fishing and or camping if thats your thing, just expect to see people on and off.",
          "I love hikes with waterfalls at the end--they are so rewarding! The hike is quite easy, not strenuous at all. Appropriate for any level. The trail has undergone a lot of improvements over the last few years and there are new stairs and boardwalks across the muckier parts of the",
          "This hike actually took about 40min's to hike- but was fantastic once you got there - take a snack and water because we could have stayed all day.There is actually another water falls that only takes under 10min's to get to at Hidden Lake and you can hike right up to the base of",
          "The road from Yellowknife is pretty bumpy and the hike takes a bit of effort, but that's part of the fun. Cameron Falls is pretty scenic and there are several vantage points along the trail. It was a good experience on a nice Fall day.",
          "very beautiful view on the way to the falls, also the same as the falls. have a rest when you get there, sit on the cliff, watch the falls, the trees, very peaceful.",
          "This is a lovely trail and the falls themselves are beautiful. However there are maps to show how the trail goes before you head out (we had hoped it looped). Also, you are climbing over some good-sized rocks to anyone with knee problems going up or down might have some",
          "fast and great if you have kids in tow. It's a short distance and I would have liked to see more of a picnic area set up for people who do go as it's really just walkways and damp rocks.",
          "A nice brief easy hike to the beautiful waterfalls. You are able to find other little trails around the falls to explore on and you are able to get very close to the falls which is pretty neat.",
          "Outdoors, great scenery, just the right amount of challenge, nice to put your feet in the water at the end!",
          "This is another must for visitors to Yellowknife. The best that YK has to offer is its untouched wilderness and natural beauty. The trail which is about 35km outside of town might as well be in another world as there is no development around it at all. The waters coming off",
          "The area, the trail and the atmosphere is gorgeous. This is a fairly easy trail, but younger children or older adults may find it a slight challenge. You are able to go at your own pace and there is plenty of places to just stop and enjoy the area. The drive out is sadly",
          "It is a good walk, beautiful and excellent for families!",
          "The closest Yellowknife comes to a \"made for visitors attraction\". The views when you get there are spectacular. Beware that the path could be wet, or icy in the spring!",
          "This is a great trail that takes you about 45 minutes to an hour to get to the Falls. They aren't the most spectacular falls in the NWT but it is worth the trip. BRING LOTS OF MOSQUITO REPELLANT. They will eat you alive. The trail can get a little confusing at times but as long",
          "Great hiking trail. Spectacular Falls. Best as group activity as bears are a common sight in summer all around the Ingraham Trail and lakes.",
          "We were not sure if this was a walk that could be done in winter - it was! The drive out was easy and beautiful (we saw a fox) and the hike was very manageable. The waterfall was not huge or spectacular but the hike was a nice way to spend the morning.",
          "If you're into hiking, or even just admiring the scenery, and you have some free time while you're in Yellowknife, take a drive up the Ingraham Trail and stop to see Cameron Falls. Within a few metres, the parking lot disappears behind a screen of trees, and the rest of the",
          "beautiful walk, be prepared to spend the day pack a lunch so nice you wont want o leave",
          "This hike has a lot of ups and downs. To some it is an easy hike...to others it is difficult. If you are out of shape or have difficulty with walking and stairs this may be too tough. It's worth it! I've never hiked the whole thing. You can go to the top of the falls, cross over",
          "We've been to Cameron River Falls probably half a dozen times. In the winter it can be special because of the frozen scenery witnessed at the falls. In the summer the falls are beautiful and easy to access. Take a stroll across the foot bridge to reach the other side. You'll",
          "Great hike for the family. A decent drive along the Ingram trail, the last part on gravel roads gets you to a well sign posted carpark and marked trail to Cameron falls. The trail is predominately path with some boardwalk and rock scrambles. There are several sets of stairs. The",
          "Cameron Falls are a great hike to wear out the kids and teach them what beautiful views are about! There's a pretty steep cliff on one side, so you need to prepare your kids to stay on the path and follow directions. There's also lots of teachable moments I still remember from",
          "The Cameron Falls are a 45 minute drive outside of the city, and then a rocky, fly-infested 25 minute hike in. Once you get there, the view is impressive, but not spectacular. Not tops on my list of things I've done in my fine city!"

        "wiki": "Highway 4, known as the Ingraham Trail, extends from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories to Tibbitt Lake, approximately 70 km (43 mi) east of Yellowknife. It was built in the mid-1960s as the first leg of a 'road to resources' with the original intention of circulating Great Slave Lake.\nThe highway is designated as a northern/remote route of Canada's National Highway System.\nThe Ingraham Trail serves as both an industrial and recreational highway. In February and March each year, the trail is the initial section of the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road to three diamond mines located {300 km (190 mi) northeast of Yellowknife. The trail is also known as Yellowknife's cottage country, with the bulk of seasonal and year-round cabins located between Cassidy Point and Prelude Lake Territorial Park. During the winter road program, B-train tractor trailers travel the road, four loads every 20 minutes, 24 hours a day.\nAlthough the highway serves primarily recreational activities and area residences in this lake-dotted country it is, after the ice break-up on Great Slave Lake, the only access to Dettah from Yellowknife. The small Dene community is about 6.5 km (4.0 mi) from Yellowknife by ice road in winter or 27 km (17 mi) using the Ingraham Trail.\nFor about a month in late winter, a winter road to Lac de Gras is opened to trucking of mining supplies, the junction being along the Ingraham Trail. The road condition has suffered due to its frequent use by heavy trucks. This is shown on the first season of the American reality television series, Ice Road Truckers, which airs on History. The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road also extends from the end of the Ingraham Trail to Contwoyto Lake in Nunavut, forming Nunavut's only connection to the road network in the rest of Canada.\nThe Ingraham Trail is named after Vic Ingraham, a pioneer Yellowknife businessman of the 1930s\u201340s.\nYellowknife has experienced an aurora borealis tourism boom the last few years and the Ingraham Trail is the prime viewing location. It is common to come across aurora rush after midnight during the peak aurora season, November to March.\n\n\n== Details ==\n\nSince January 2014, the road bypasses Giant Mine through a realignment that originates off Highway 3, approximately 2 km (1.2 mi) from the Old Airport Road turnoff. At 7.6 km (4.7 mi) the road crosses the Yellowknife River followed by the Dettah turnoff at 9.8 km (6.1 mi). After this the road passes several territorial parks:\nYellowknife River Territorial Park  (7.7 km (4.8 mi))\nDettah turnoff (9.8 km (6.1 mi))\nProsperous Lake Territorial Park (19.7 km (12.2 mi))\nMadeline Lake Territorial Park (24 km (15 mi))\nPontoon Lake Territorial Park (26.4 km (16.4 mi))\nPrelude Lake Territorial Park (28 km (17 mi)\nHidden Lake Territorial Park (44 km (27 mi))\nPowder Point Day Use Area 44 km (27 mi))\nCameron River Falls Day Use Area/Hiking Trail Access (45.8 km (28.5 mi))\nCameron River Crossing (54.5 km (33.9 mi))\nReid Lake Territorial Park  (59 km (37 mi))before reaching Tibbitt Lake (69.2 km (43.0 mi)).\nThe trail is chipsealed to Reid Lake, leaving the last 10 km (6.2 mi) as gravel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n1934 Vic Ingraham and Speed II NWT Historical Timeline, Prince of Wales Northern Heritage CentreIngraham Trail History",

          "Such a fun hike! Pretty short, easy to do. So beautiful. Took some wonderful photos and had a great time. Very popular area",
          "The fact that this is a bit of a hike over uneven terrain keeps the crowds away. Any healthy person with good shoes can do this hike in about 45 minutes one way. Reward at the end is a beautiful pristine falls that you can go right down to and stand in the cold water.",
          "Hike to a nice waterfall, some rocks are in the way and you have to climb a little bit. So it is not a very easy walk but worth it.",
          "Great trail to take in the YK scenary. Wear good shoes, you often walk on rock. The trail is well maintained, and the view of the falls at the end is beautiful.",
          "The drive out to Cameron River Falls is full of amazing view and well worth the trip the fall themselves are close to the road and easy to access. The area is beautiful",
          "This is a great hike in the summer although I know of people who enjoy it year round although the trail is not maintained or shovelled in the winter. You need a vehicle to get there though.",
          "This trail is very well maintained however you need to be agile as parts of the trail see you scrambling across some rock. It's a short trail that takes you to a waterfall and then you return the way you came.",
          "Apparently we missed the falls but saw the falls ramparts about 10km down the road. No trail maps on site but there were toilets. Would have been nice for a map since we started out but could not hear the falls or see them on my phone gps, so we left for the falls we could see",
          "Awesome views! Great place to visit for a picnic or just a hike! The hike to the falls is short enough for kids and there aren\u2019t too many bugs.",
          "This is a beautiful hike. It\u2019s a bit of a challenge to get a there but so worth it! The falls and trail is beautiful and so peaceful!",
          "Although the falls are mostly frozen and parts of the trail are a bit slippery, it is still a nice 3hrs winter activity (including the drive from Yellowknife). There is a small flowing section on the right hand side of the falls even in -30C temperatures.",
          "We hiked this early in the morning so we had the trail to ourselves. The trail itself was well marked but there are some steep parts that get pretty treacherous since the trail was covered in ice and snow. If you do this, plan on channeling your inner mountain goat. The views",
          "If here for a short or long visit make time for this spot. It\u2019s more than an average hiking ability however. With steep slopes that can be very slippery if wet and steep stairs. The views and hike are terrific.",
          "Gorgeous waterfalls at almost any time of year (although during parts of the winter you might be looking at just snow); beginner/easy walk/hike.",
          "The most amazing views and the place is a great walk. The waterfalls are just so beautiful. I do recommend to go",
          "What a fabulous guide! Rosie picked us up at our hotel, then entertained us with all kinds of local lore, history and her phenomenal background before getting to the parking lot leading to the spectacular Cameron Falls. She was sure to remind us of appropriate behaviour should",
          "This was a great way to spend a few hours, from the drive out and the trail in. There are a few ups and downs and the rocks could possibly be slippery at times but it was definitely time well spent. The place is beautiful and getting to the falls is the icing on the cake. I was",
          "Took a tour, visited the falls and the ramparts. Good to be able to get so close to nature. Bridges very well done and kept up.walkways boardwalk in some areas, rocks to climb in others, Wear good shoes",
          "I had the pleasure of joining Rosie for a 5 hour Cameron Falls experience. She's a great guide and made the hike come alive. I learned a ton from her and her bag of tricks she carries to provide great value and context. Leave town by 0900 to avoid the crowds. Have her pack",
          "The views of the fall absolutely blew us away! It far exceeded our expectations! Wish we packed a picnic lunch and stayed for longer! The walk is not too bad! Easy 20min if you're in good shape! We had someone very out of shape in our group and it took her about 45 min",
          "Trail is accessible with a few spots that need extra care if person has sore knees. Nice views of the falls.",
          "A short drive on the Ingraham Trail takes you to the trail to Cameron River Falls. It takes about 20-25 minutes to hike to the falls over a well marked trail. There is some steep climbing over large rocks but most fit people should be able to make it. There are boardwalks across",
          "I hiked this trail twice while staying in a cabin near Prelude Lake. I am fairly fit and was able to complete the round trip in less than 1 hour. On day one, we were the first ones on the trail at 9am and had a peaceful tranquil hike. The second day, I arrived around 2pm and",
          "Easy trail to ramparts. Steep in some spots, but worth it. Had a picnic by the ramparts. There are stairs.",
          "This was the second of two hikes we did the same day. The Cameron Falls Trail is 2 km return, but it's up and down over smooth rocky trails, some on quite an incline. We are young seniors and managed, but if you're not fit or sure footed, you may find it hard. I'd be careful",
          "A bit of a jaunt out of Yellowknife, but a couple hours well spent. The hike was good; a bit of up and down - got the blood pumping in sections. The payoff at the end was pretty nice too! Well worth a visit if staying in Yellowknife for a couple days. Some how managed to miss",
          "Take a short hike to see these falls. They are worth the hike& there are seats along the trail that you can take a rest on. Would of loved to go in the spring as that would give you lots more water rushing through & make them that much more spectacular.",
          "About 40 min out the Ingraham Highway. The walk is of intermedient difficulty over the Sheild. Kids can do it",
          "Cameron falls trail, a nice quiet hike! Went there solo with my dog, a westie. It's a challenging hike as the trail is naturally paved. Trail consist of gravel & rocks. Trail is located 50km from Yellowknife on the Ingraham trail Hwy. Washroom facilities located at the",
          "I drove out with some friends while visiting Yellowknife. It's an easy drive from the city; we went around 10 pm. It's a bit of a hike in, about half an hour, and I wasn't in the best shape so it was tough, but for an average person in shape it shouldn't be too difficult. The",
          "This is an in-and-out trail. We thought it was full-circle, but it is not. While there are bridges, stairs, etc., most of the trail is ungroomed and some areas are a bit challenging if you're not in shape. There was still quite a bit of snow in the sheltered parts of the",
          "Beautiful hike. My 4 year old could manage it but he isn't a complainer. Beware of potential mosquitoes.",
          "After driving for miles ,almost a day, through wilderness, we came upon a beautiful city,Yellowknife! People come from all over so are very friendly and are one big happy family! If you love being out in the wild, Cameron Falls is the best place to visit Well marked trails and",
          "There are 2 sets of falls in this great northern park. The first(short) hike is by the bridge and is about a 10 - 15 hike in and has a small wooden walkway to get close to the falls to get some great pictures and memories. There is an outhouse by the entrance. Depending on when",
          "We did the Cameron Falls Hike end of December. Takes a bit longer as covered in snow. It was beautiful though and looked like you were hiking in a postcard of a Winter Wonderland. There are markers above the snow to help keep you on the trail. A few spots where need to kinda",
          "Path is marked and easy to navigate. Uneven parts at times. Usually busy on weekends. Great way to get out of the city and get some exercise.",
          "Beginning of the Cameron Rive Trail is located on km 47 of the Ingraham Trail by Hidden lake territorial park. Parking lot is available there. Most of the hike leads over stones and rocks, but it\u00b4s not too difficult to get to the waterfalls. Even so, I\u2019d recommend to wear some",
          "Beautiful park located about 3/4's of the way down the Ingraham Trail. Ample parking with outhouse (bring paper in case it is empty). Starting portion of trail very easy but becomes more difficult with incline over rock and terrain. We attempted to go before with parents but",
          "I am not sure why you need a tour to this place if you have a rental car. We drove to the trail head and hiked up to the waterfall. It is a busy trail through boreal forest and granite hills. Wildlife tends to stay way (though not always). The waterfalls at the end are a nice",
          "Short distance to drive out of Yellowknife. About 2 km round trip over rocks and well marked trail, some stairs, some biardwalk to beautiful 17 metre falls, river and canyon. .Gorgeous scenery! I also appreciated the benches to sit on at the top to enjoy the view and a snack.",
          "You will access it from Hidden Lake, about 50 minutes drive on Ingraham Trail. The hike to the waterfall is about 25 minutes from parking lot. It is not a very easy hike, a lot of rocks and steep steps, do wear proper shoes. Once you reach to Cameron Fall, the view is",
          "We drove there in our rental car and it was well worth it. The hike was intermediate in terms of difficulty and the scenery was great. One can get right next to the fall and I even saw people having a picnic on the rocks at the bottom near the fall. I would however think twice",
          "This is a very pleasant trail with amazing scenery, including the beautiful waterfalls. We brought a small picnic and dined in the sunshine on the rocks beside the falls.",
          "We had a guide on our walk to the Falls. It is fairly easy to navigate, even for seniors, if you have no mobility issues. Also wear proper shoes. The well groomed trail lasts only a couple of hundred metres, then the trail climbs over large boulders. Neither the trail nor",
          "Nice moderately difficult walk. Nice views of the falls but last time we were there there were tour buses so it may get too bus quickly.",
          "The trail is easy and a nice little hike. The falls are beautiful and the fishing is pretty good. Ok for swimming and picnic area.",
          "Definitely worth the 50 min drive and 20 min walk, a great piece of nature to visit. The canadian Shield scenery was very nice with the falls.",
          "The falls were magnificent, the rock passages were a little complex for this novice hiker. I wouldn't suggest small children unless you keep them in hand there is no guard rail at the falls.",
          "About 45 minutes outside of Yellowknife. The road is pretty good although gravel in many areas. The trail to the falls is well marked and moderately challenging. The falls are lovely to look at. A nice way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "About 50 km from Yellowknife. Nice trail for a hike to the falls. Cool places to have a picnic. Part of a portage between lakes.",
          "We went with Backyard Tours. We did the Ramparts section. The walk was quite gentle, the scenery and views were excellent. We had a picnic in the park which was a beautiful experience.",
          "Worth the drive out of town. A good way to see the landscape. Better to visit in the summer! Probably one of the best hiking trails in Yellowknife.",
          "It was a little farther out of Yellowknife than we realized and had no bars on the cellphones to confirm we were on the right track - likely about 45 out of Yellowknife.....we were afraid of bears but saw none - sprayed ourselves with OFF Deepwoods and we were fine. It's a",
          "Wow this was truly an amazing climb. And what a gorgeous view from the top. Definitely worth the climb lol. You will not regret this trip. Watch out for bears yes there are bears roaming so just be careful when carrying food if you don't need to carry food with you it's safer.",
          "Getting to the actual falls is a good little workout. When there is lots of water, the falls are quite spectacular.",
          "This trail is well-marked and easy to follow. It traverses typical Northern Territory. The falls are a great spot for a picnic. By September the days are still long, but the mosquitos have largely disappeared.",
          "Located around 50 km from downtown Yellowknife, this is a fantastic place for outdoor enthusiasts. Even in a thick snow cover, we were able to navigate the trail comfortable using our hiking boots. The falls were frozen which were a good sight, but nothing outstanding. The trail",
          "The trail starts from the parking lot and runs about 2 km into the bush. There are stairs placed where the steepness of the trail warrants and the trail is well marked. The falls are well frozen but the water still gushes out at the base of the falls. You can also see \"windows\"",
          "This was a really nice walk although a little difficult with an infant in a carrier. I'd recommend waiting til the kids are a bit older and bring a small first aid kit for knee scrapes on the plenty of rocks you cross. If I went again I'd wait til the rainy season as the",
          "Gorgeous scenery: eroded rock, trees, river, waterfalls (spectacular). At times the elevation is fairly high and the views are magnificent.",
          "Cameron falls is a cool place to take a short hike on the Ingraham Trail. I wouldn't call it mind blowing by any means, but definitely worth checking out the natural beauty of the NWT if you're in the area. Even though it's not a long, treacherous hike by any means, you",
          "You don't need to be a regular hiker. Is about 30 minutes out of town. Trail actually begins at the \"Hidden Lake\" parking area and will take about 45 minutes until you get to the falls. Well worth it... Watch for bears in the summer. Just travel as a group.",
          "My wife and I hiked to the falls last week following a large snowfall. The trees were covered in snow making it quite the serene walk. We were the first and only ones out there that day so we had the trail to ourselves. What a beautiful site the river is in the winter. There are",
          "We did this hike in about 6\" of snow. Was a lot of fun though. About 4km round trip. What a beautiful hike! There are lots of stairs and fairly steep slopes to climb. A little slippery in spots.",
          "The view of the falls and the trek over the rocky terrain is worth the mosquito bites. Be sure to wear good hiking shoes.",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit. It is quite a drive, but well worth it. It's a very long walk, & not very well maked but the scenery makes it all worth while.",
          "Plan an hour and a half; bring a picnic to eat at the top of the falls.Make sure to take the left trail from the parking lot and go all the way, crossing the bridge to the north side",
          "We have joined My Backyard Tours for the visit. As there are bears in the days before, we have a visit to another trail nearby. Our tour guide, John is extremely friendly, experienced and knowledgeable. Margaret's lunch box is also fantastic and delicious for picnic in such a",
          "The colours of the fall, which are abundant on this trail in the middle of September, makes this hike great. The trail is easy, well marked with little gain elevation. Don't forget to bring your bear bell, as recently a bear has been spotted around the Cameron falls.",
          "A very pretty hike, but lots of up and down, and the trail is uneven (2 of the 7 in our group fell on the hike). If you do go, you should at least make it to the bridge that spans the river. Very pretty views. The water was very low in Sept. 2015, and the waterfall was just a",
          "Even though the water levels were low, this was an excellent hike. Beautiful scenery, well cared for trail, and a great destination! The road was gravel for the last bit and we worried a little about the rental car getting dinged but no problems.",
          "Hiked this trail with my son-in-law, husband and pregnant daughter (final trimester). It is well marked and a good work out. The falls are very pretty and offer opportunities for great photos. Make the effort to travel the Ingram Trail and hike this trail. Well worth it.",
          "Reasonable hike with two children aged 11 and 8. Marked trial. About 30 minutes each way. Easy to fine on Ingram Trail. About 45 minute drive from Yellowknife.",
          "This is a walk into the bush and over rocky terrain with a moderate level of difficulty, well-marked paths, and excellent views. The river area is breathtakingly beautiful. Although the trails are marked, it can be confusing. Go with a guide for the best experience.",
          "A trip every one that visit must do great views and good for expending your morning better in summer than with the snow hey!",
          "This is a pretty area to see and to hike in. My wife and I hiked into it and the trail was doable for people not in the best of shape. The view of the waterfall was superb",
          "The falls are located on a hiking trail on the Ingraham Trail about 35 - 40 km outside Yellowknife. I was blown away by the sense of wilderness on the drive out! The trail itself is a fairly easy hike; one can also walk down to the base of the falls.",
          "Short hike into trail which is well marked and maintained. Perfect place to enjoy a picnic and falls. Can dip your toes into the water, it's cold.",
          "great hike... quite far but worth it. the trail marker is very useful. I possibly got lost without the markers.",
          "Great 2.5 km hike in - beautiful falls - nice pic nick spot - there is even a bridge so you can cross the river and see the falls from the other side. We loved the 'wild roses' everywhere.",
          "Nice easy hike in for most people under 65 years, and fit people over this age. Nice swimming at the lake/river above and below the falls in the summer. Have fun, but watch the bugs along the trail in summer.",
          "There are well marked trails that cross a hump of the Canadian shield on the way to the falls. Nice view once you get to the falls and there are many opportunities for exploring",
          "This is a well marked trail that leads to the Falls. The trail is well marked and gives you a \"Canadian Shield\" hiking experience. We started our hike at about 9:15 P.M. Yes the land of the midnight sun. We were back at the parking lot around 10:30 and back in town at 11 P.",
          "Whats not to like. It is a surprise at the end of the tunnel. Make it into an afternoon or day picnic. The trail is very nice and well marked",
          "this trail is a must see, particularly in the spring when the waterfall is magnificent. The trail is easy and can be done by most people in a very short time.",
          "Slipped several times as the trail is not well maintained. It was icy and could not finish the trail (Didn't want to break any bones)",
          "Yellowknife is one of the most beautiful and amazing places I've ever been. I was there in February so the snow covered everything! I did this around 4km hike in about -20 degrees, it was spectacular. My uncle and two friends of ours who live here took us on this hike. The snow",
          "beautiful hike.gorgeous road trip there.fabulous fauna.easy to get to. roads are excellent.no places to stop en route",
          "When you are bored living in Yellowknife, this is the ONE excursion that is worthwhile.... take a picnic and take your time... if the weather is nice it will e a day to remember",
          "We did the trail in the winter (March 2015) and it was very pleasant. However, we are very glad we did it with snowshoes - there are many slippery sections and you want good traction. Note too, that in the whole time we did not see anyone else so you are on your own. Cell phone",
          "Enjoyed every trip here, beautiful and so peaceful, would highly recommend everyone visits here when visiting Yellowknife. never been in winter but heard its just as beautifull",
          "The trail is nice and you better have running shoes or hiking shoes. Bring water and a sandwich if you want to stay long. Beautiful views of the River and Falls. Natural setting; ideal to escape the city and enjoy nature. Be careful of bears. The trail is pretty easy but",
          "I went to cameron falls to have a bit of an immersion in the Canadian shield country. That was the ideal spot to get a feel for it. About 45 minutes to go from Yellowknife. Drive 15 minutes further and you will reach the end of highway 4 where the ice road starts in winter. That",
          "Trick with Cameron falls is to take your time. There is no rush and you will miss interesting things on your way if you go too fast. The path is well marked and is sometimes difficult on rock so make sure you have good shoes on when you go",
          "The drive might seem to go on forever but its worth it. The falls aren't huge but the trail and surrounding area are beautiful. Also, in true northern style, there is a lot of freedom in where you can roam and explore. You'll be doing some easy climbs over boulders/rocks so I",
          "Fun hike, not too long, in beautiful surroundings, with a gorgeous waterfall. About a 1 hour drive from town. You need a car.",
          "One has to rent a car (read: NOT CHEAP) or join some sort of tour in order to get to the falls - it's about an hour's drive along a not-very-busy highway, but the driving is pleasant and their are lots of lakes to break up the view. If you run into car trouble, you might have to",
          "It will take you about half hour from parking place to the falls but is worth. Nice view and many animals and birds you will see. Preparing your camera and come.",
          "Amazing afternoon at the falls. This is a bit of a varied terrain hike, so be careful on the rocks if it's wet. Just follow the markers and you can't get lost. Make sure you cross the bridge and check out the other side. Might not be suitable for frail seniors, but lots of",
          "This hike won't take you long (about an hour round trip) but the falls are beautiful especially in the fall when the leaves are turning color. The flies can be troublesome but if you keep moving they don't seem to bother you. Plan to eat lunch in your car or you will be",
          "This is a very pleasant hike. The falls are beautiful and you've probably put on a little weight during your stay in Yellowknife so a little exercise sure couldn't hurt!",
          "This short hike gives visitors a good idea of what the taiga is like with the bonus of a lovely, cascading waterfall at the end of it. The route is will marked and has the added bonus of stairs where they are most needed. Hike upstream once you get there and you will find a",
          "We saw mixed reviews and wondered whether it would be worth the trip. It was! The views are beautiful. On the way, there was road construction and in a few places it was a little rough for a minute or two, but nothing to worry about. The trail was well marked and not too",
          "The road to hidden lake is under construction and it takes a while to get here but it worth the trip. Beautiful view at the end of a 2km easy hike. Well marked trails take you in and you can spend some time on both sides of the falls.",
          "Nice wilderness trail to a gorgeous waterfall with unique rock formations (wide stretches of rock to sun on or spread out a picnic) and not too strenuous for people whose knees are what they used to be. Two hours round trip max.",
          "I went out to this hiking trail today. First, there is 4km of road that is under construction, and you have to drive over a road covered in \"fist sized\" rock. A lot of the rest of the road is gravel. When you get there, the beginning of the trail is very deceiving. It starts",
          "Cool to see- but getting there was a pain, as Ingraham trail is under construction currently. We rented a car and I'm not sure if the money (~$150) was worth the sight! If you have your own car, as long as it's a truck or SUV, I would go see it though.",
          "The trail was easy to follow even in the winter.Good area to park and not a long hike to get to the Falls.",
          "I did this hike in mid-July about two years ago. It's a great place to catch the sunset (or just visit when the sun is low in the sky.) It's really well marked and we didn't see another soul on it. We did two-nights in row. We had a local friend show us the cliff jumping spot.",
          "Hiking or snowshoeing on this lovely trail. The snow was crisp and even, the sky blue, the air fresh and brisk. The falls themselves of course were frozen, but that did not matter. You can still hear the rushing water underneath. You might be lucky to see ptarmigan and even a",
          "We must be slow hikers - we took much longer than others indicate, but we were leisurely & stopped often to admire & photograph the scenery & flora along the trail. We packed a lunch - ate by the river on the smooth washed rocks. Serene. Then over the amazing bridge & we",
          "I have been to the falls twice and it is such a great experience. The walk is well marked and there are steps over the rougher spots. The scenery at the falls is amazing. Remember to wear good walking or hiking shoes and take water and the trip will be well worth it.",
          "Enjoyed my hike into Cameron Falls. Trail can be slippery in spots, but overall it's in excellent shape over varied terrain. Falls payoff at the end is worth it...you'll easily spend an hour or more lingering around and exploring the various points and levels of the Falls.",
          "I'm amazed at the work that has gone into this trail to make it navigable for pretty much anyone. You still have to climb some but the boardwalks and stairways give opportunity to many more to enjoy the spectacular view of the falls.",
          "It is a nice hike, but it will take about 2.5-3 hours altogether as it does take a while (45 mins) to drive out there. Once there however it is very beautiful.",
          "It was a short hike from the parking lot. The trail is marked and worn well enough that you have no trouble finding your way back. The falls are very nice and you might even see some wild life. I would recommend this trip to anyone visiting Yellowknife.",
          "We went on a sunny day in early September and the temperature was comfortable for the hike. A nice trail with areas for breaks and well marked. We suggest driving there yourself and taking the time to hike to the falls and spend some time there for great pictures. Pack a",
          "About a 45-kilometre drive outside Yellowknife lies a sparkling waterfall that's easily accessible along a well-marked trail. Take a picnic lunch and sit beside the pristine waters of the Cameron River before it plunges over the rocky precipice. The 30-minute trail winds",
          "For those who are in even reasonable shape, this is a quick hike that rewards you with a nice view. Bugs are bad at the beginning but got better quickly. Clearly marked trail.",
          "we cam out here at 9 o clock at night, due to the fact that sunset would not be until 11 30 we had ample time to enjoy the hike into the Falls themselves. Breathtaking views along the way and a final destination of absolute beauty made it an amazing adventure.",
          "A business colleague suggested we go here and do the hike to go see the falls, and was I ever glad we did. It was a lovely sunny day and we did the hike at a decent pace, it takes 15-20 minutes to hit the falls and another 10-15 to go over the bridge to the other side. The",
          "About 45km from yellowknife. The hike is only about 30 minutes. Amazing area. Beautiful scenery. Great for picnics and hiking. Would recommend this for everyone.",
          "This is a great short hike, even the icy winter. Beautiful view of the falls and natural scenery. I would recommend going to the visitor's center to get a self-guided Cameron Falls geological tour book to get the most out of the hike.",
          "I have done this trail twice. Once in the Spring and once in the Fall. Both times the trail was really fun. It is a little rugged but easy to do, an average person who does not excercise much will find it a little challenging however will still be able to do it no problem.",
          "Our group was in Yellowknife hunting aurora for 4 nights. I had researched and researched for other activities to do. This is a short and very scenic winter hike! Take your time and enjoy the scenery and take lots of pictures. Make sure you leave yourself time to come back",
          "The walk is quite a long one in bear country so I would recommend to be prepared with bear mace but once the walking is done there is a lot of things to see and do as far as picnic and fishing and or camping if thats your thing, just expect to see people on and off.",
          "I love hikes with waterfalls at the end--they are so rewarding! The hike is quite easy, not strenuous at all. Appropriate for any level. The trail has undergone a lot of improvements over the last few years and there are new stairs and boardwalks across the muckier parts of the",
          "This hike actually took about 40min's to hike- but was fantastic once you got there - take a snack and water because we could have stayed all day.There is actually another water falls that only takes under 10min's to get to at Hidden Lake and you can hike right up to the base of",
          "The road from Yellowknife is pretty bumpy and the hike takes a bit of effort, but that's part of the fun. Cameron Falls is pretty scenic and there are several vantage points along the trail. It was a good experience on a nice Fall day.",
          "very beautiful view on the way to the falls, also the same as the falls. have a rest when you get there, sit on the cliff, watch the falls, the trees, very peaceful.",
          "This is a lovely trail and the falls themselves are beautiful. However there are maps to show how the trail goes before you head out (we had hoped it looped). Also, you are climbing over some good-sized rocks to anyone with knee problems going up or down might have some",
          "fast and great if you have kids in tow. It's a short distance and I would have liked to see more of a picnic area set up for people who do go as it's really just walkways and damp rocks.",
          "A nice brief easy hike to the beautiful waterfalls. You are able to find other little trails around the falls to explore on and you are able to get very close to the falls which is pretty neat.",
          "Outdoors, great scenery, just the right amount of challenge, nice to put your feet in the water at the end!",
          "This is another must for visitors to Yellowknife. The best that YK has to offer is its untouched wilderness and natural beauty. The trail which is about 35km outside of town might as well be in another world as there is no development around it at all. The waters coming off",
          "The area, the trail and the atmosphere is gorgeous. This is a fairly easy trail, but younger children or older adults may find it a slight challenge. You are able to go at your own pace and there is plenty of places to just stop and enjoy the area. The drive out is sadly",
          "It is a good walk, beautiful and excellent for families!",
          "The closest Yellowknife comes to a \"made for visitors attraction\". The views when you get there are spectacular. Beware that the path could be wet, or icy in the spring!",
          "This is a great trail that takes you about 45 minutes to an hour to get to the Falls. They aren't the most spectacular falls in the NWT but it is worth the trip. BRING LOTS OF MOSQUITO REPELLANT. They will eat you alive. The trail can get a little confusing at times but as long",
          "Great hiking trail. Spectacular Falls. Best as group activity as bears are a common sight in summer all around the Ingraham Trail and lakes.",
          "We were not sure if this was a walk that could be done in winter - it was! The drive out was easy and beautiful (we saw a fox) and the hike was very manageable. The waterfall was not huge or spectacular but the hike was a nice way to spend the morning.",
          "If you're into hiking, or even just admiring the scenery, and you have some free time while you're in Yellowknife, take a drive up the Ingraham Trail and stop to see Cameron Falls. Within a few metres, the parking lot disappears behind a screen of trees, and the rest of the",

          "This hike has a lot of ups and downs. To some it is an easy hike...to others it is difficult. If you are out of shape or have difficulty with walking and stairs this may be too tough. It's worth it! I've never hiked the whole thing. You can go to the top of the falls, cross over",
          "We've been to Cameron River Falls probably half a dozen times. In the winter it can be special because of the frozen scenery witnessed at the falls. In the summer the falls are beautiful and easy to access. Take a stroll across the foot bridge to reach the other side. You'll",
          "Great hike for the family. A decent drive along the Ingram trail, the last part on gravel roads gets you to a well sign posted carpark and marked trail to Cameron falls. The trail is predominately path with some boardwalk and rock scrambles. There are several sets of stairs. The",
          "Cameron Falls are a great hike to wear out the kids and teach them what beautiful views are about! There's a pretty steep cliff on one side, so you need to prepare your kids to stay on the path and follow directions. There's also lots of teachable moments I still remember from",
          "The Cameron Falls are a 45 minute drive outside of the city, and then a rocky, fly-infested 25 minute hike in. Once you get there, the view is impressive, but not spectacular. Not tops on my list of things I've done in my fine city!"

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9. However, the population is slightly disproportionate in terms of age distribution compared to the national average of 41.0. As of the 2016 figures, 13.9% of residents were 9 or under, 6.0% were from 10 to 14 years old, 13.1% were from 15 to 24, 34.1.2% were from 25 to 44, 22.0% were from 45 to 59, and 10.9% were 60 or older.\n\nIn 2016, the average household size was 2.7 and the majority of the population with children had either one or two. In 2015 the average income in the city was C$73,500, and the average income for a family was C$160,394, with 7.9% of all families earning less than $30,000. Minimum wage in Yellowknife and the NWT is C$13.46 (2018). Average household expenditures were C$125,783 in 2015. In 2016, the unemployment rate was at 5.9%; the employment rate for males was 80.1%, for females it was 75.2%.The crime rate in Yellowknife for 2016 was 46.7 (per 1,000 persons) for violent crimes, and 167.2 (per 1,000 persons) for property crimes. There were 299 births and 62 deaths in 2014.English was the mother tongue of 80.0% of residents and 3.2% spoke French. Of the nine official languages of the Northwest Territories 0.4% spoke Chipewyan (Dene); 0.1% spoke a Cree language; 0.1% spoke Gwich\u2019in; 0.4% spoke Inuktitut; 0.1% spoke Inuinnaqtun or Inuvialuktun; 0.6% spoke North or South Slavey and 1.2% spoke T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb (Dogrib). In total 3.0% of the population said that an Indigenous language was their mother tongue.Not including the 11 official languages there are over 70 different languages that Yellowknifers stated were their mother tongue. These include Indo-European languages (4.2%); Austronesian languages (3.9%); Indo-Iranian languages and Germanic languages (1.1% each); Sino-Tibetan languages and Chinese languages and Indo-Aryan languages (1.0% each). The five main individual languages are Tagalog (3.2%); Vietnamese (0.8%); German (0.6%); Cantonese and Spanish (0.5% each).Yellowknife is home to 695 recent immigrants (arriving between 2011 and 2016) who now make up 3.7% of the population. Of the recent immigrants 70.5% came from Asia; 15.1% from Africa and 7.2% from both the Americas and Europe. Of the recent immigrants 40.0% came from the Philippines, while 10.8% came from several African countries, 5.8% each from India, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, 4.3% from each of Japan and South Korea and 2.2% from IsraelYellowknife is primarily populated by European with a population of 11,680 (60.6% of total). The total Indigenous peoples population 4,375 representing 22.7% of the population (12.7% First Nations, 7.0% M\u00e9tis), and 3.0% Inuit. Other ethnic groups include Filipino with 1,065 residents (5.5% of total), Black with 610 residents (3.2% of total) and South Asian with 510 residents (2.6% of total) with a total visible minority population of 3,230 (16.7% of total).In the 2001 Census almost 73% of residents identified as Christian while 24% said they had no religious affiliation.. For specific denominations Statistics Canada found that 36% of residents identified as Roman Catholic, 11% as Anglican, 10% for the United Church, about 2% each as Baptists, Lutheran, and Pentecostal, and more than 1% for The Salvation Army.

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city.

        "wiki": "Around midday on October 22, 2014, a passing motorist saw an Asian woman walking north along the Ingraham Trail on the outskirts of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Several days later, after seeing stories in the local media that Atsumi Yoshikubo (\u5409\u7aaa\u660c\u7f8e), 45, who had been visiting the city from her home in southern Japan, had gone missing, she reported the sighting. It was the last time she was seen alive.\nYoshikubo's absence was first noted five days after that sighting, when staff at her hotel noticed she had not checked out two days after her stay was due to have ended. In her room they found her luggage, still packed; she had apparently never boarded her flight home. Footage from the hotel's security camera showed her leaving shortly before she was last seen along the road. When that sighting was reported in the news, it suggested to many residents that she might have gotten lost in the vast expanse of taiga surrounding the city, and they augmented official search efforts with their own ventures into the bush.The case attracted considerable media interest not only across Canada but also in Japan, where Yellowknife is a popular destination for those seeking to view the northern lights. A week after Yoshikubo's disappearance, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) announced that they were calling off the search, as their investigation, in cooperation with Japanese police, had led them to believe that she had intended to take her own life. Her family, from whom she had been estranged for some time, doubted that conclusion, pointing to evidence that suggested she intended to return.Over the next ten months, police continued searching for the body they expected to find, using areas she may have visited for training exercises. On August 31, 2015, a hiker found some of her personal effects, along with human remains, in a wooded area north of the city. The RCMP confirmed that the items belonged to Yoshikubo, and began to identify the DNA from the bone fragments. In April 2016 they were matched to Yoshikubo, and the investigation has been officially closed.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nSince the early 1990s, Yellowknife, capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, has become a popular destination for tourists from Japan. Many come to see the northern lights; while it is locally believed that Japanese folklore holds that a child conceived under them will enjoy good luck and good health, this is an urban legend resulting from a joke on an episode of the American television series Northern Exposure. Although Alaska and Scandinavia are also attractive for their auroral displays, Yellowknife is a particularly desirable location for Japanese aurora tourism due to its generally flat and undeveloped surrounding terrain and predominantly clear (albeit cold) weather during its long winter nights. It is estimated that 20% of the city's tourists come from Japan; many hotels publish their restaurant menus in both Japanese and English.\n \nUnaccompanied, Yoshikubo arrived in Yellowknife from her home in the city of Uto, on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu, on October 17, 2014, a trip she had arranged through a tour operator in Toronto. She checked into the Explorer Hotel, the city's largest, for a week's stay. After doing so, she asked if she could book a seat on an aurora tour and was told they had shut down for the season.October and November are off-peak times for Japanese tourism in Yellowknife. The northern lights are not as visible as they are at other times of the year and there is usually not enough snow cover for dogsledding, another activity popular with tourists who visit the city in winter. There is, however, enough to make walking on the trails through the boreal forest and bedrock outcrops in and around the city potentially dangerous for unprepared, unguided visitors. The trails themselves become icy and swampy, and the snow makes it harder to distinguish them from the surrounding bush.\n\n\n== Disappearance ==\nIn the absence of an organized tour\u2014the way 95% of Japanese visitors see Yellowknife; the rest generally come in groups\u2014Yoshikubo apparently set her own itinerary, keeping to herself. She had travelled alone before, and it is not unusual for Japanese women to do so. However, Japanese women who travel unaccompanied to popular tourist destinations typically congregate informally with other tourists when they get there; Yoshikubo, though, continued to keep to herself.\n\nSecurity cameras at the Gallery of the Midnight Sun, a popular local gift and souvenir shop in the city's Old Town, recorded her visiting, by herself, and buying some items, apparently meant as gifts for others, on October 19. At another time that day cameras at the city's tourist information centre recorded her visit, again alone. In both she was wearing a pink coat and a darker pink hat with black pants and white shoes.Yoshikubo's actions over the next two days are unknown. During the morning hours of October 22, the Explorer's security cameras recorded her leaving the building, wearing the same clothing she had been seen in the two days previous. Later, around 11:30 a.m., Jessica Riehl, a retired constable with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), saw Yoshikubo walking along the Ingraham Trail between Niven and Jackfish lakes near the city's northern limits, a largely undeveloped area. She reported the sighting, the last time Yoshikubo is known to have been seen, several days later when news of the Japanese woman's disappearance broke (although she was not completely confident as to the date, since she said she takes that route regularly).Yoshikubo never returned to her hotel. Three days later, when the staff realized she had either left without checking out or overstayed her reservation, they entered her room. Inside they found her luggage, all packed. They reported her missing to the RCMP, who checked at Yellowknife's airport, where they learned she had not boarded her flight home, either.\n\n\n== Search ==\nThe RCMP began an intense search effort, using both personnel on the ground and aerial assets to cover the expanses of taiga north and west of the city near where Yoshikubo had last been seen, or could have been reasonably expected to have walked to from her hotel. Residents, fearing that she had met with foul play on the trails and motivated by concern for her distant family, joined in the search with their own informal efforts. The search was given extra urgency by the onset of colder wintry weather and lengthening nights.\n\nThe disappearance and search became a national news story, with five Japanese news outlets flying crews to Yellowknife to cover it for audiences in their country. There were concerns that the incident could result in less Japanese tourism in the city. Of the 60,000 Japanese who had come to Yellowknife to see the northern lights since 2008, she was the first one ever to be reported missing, according to the country's consulate in Calgary.On November 4, however, the RCMP called off the search. Based on what they had found in Yoshikubo's hotel room, and information developed by Japanese police investigating in Uto, they believed she had \"arrived in Yellowknife with a plan to go into the wilderness alone and become a missing person\". Further, they claimed, she had \"taken steps to avoid detection\"; however, they declined to give specifics as the case was still open and her body remained undiscovered.In Japan, Fuji Television reported that Yoshikubo's brother said he had been contacted by the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and told that his sister had sent a letter to a female friend before she left suggesting she was planning to end her life in Canada. While her brother believed that the letter existed, he admitted he had not read it. He also doubted that his sister, who had been out of contact with him and their father for ten years, truly intended to die in Yellowknife, pointing to the souvenirs she had been shown purchasing and her return ticket.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\"They're continuing to still search and conduct different investigations and follow leads they're getting,\" an RCMP spokeswoman told Northern News Services a week after the search was called off. \"It's just that the search and rescue is done. Just because that part is over, doesn't mean we're giving up.\" Searchers were concentrating on an area north of the city, using dogs and thermal imaging equipment to supplement their legwork.Many residents had been profoundly moved by the incident, whether they took part in the search or not. One resident had a condolence card set up for residents to sign at city hall to be sent to Yoshikubo's family in Japan. \"I know there was a tremendous amount of local support for the search and I think it's a way for Yellowknifers to let Atsumi's family in Japan know our thoughts are with her family,\" said city councilman Dan Wong, who announced it at the council's November 10 meeting.\nJessica Riehl, the retired RCMP constable who was the last person known to have seen Yoshikubo, recalled how she had considered asking her if she needed any help. [A]s I drove past her[,] I thought it might not be the best idea for her being alone.\" She had considered turning around and going back to offer help, but decided against it. \"I thought, it was only 11:30 a.m., she'll be OK ... She looked like she was sightseeing and it was close to zero, it wasn't freezing cold, and her pink coat was knee-length and she had on mitts and a hat\u2014she was dressed for that temperature.\nAfter learning several days later that the woman had been reported missing, Riehl said \"I just felt terrible. I didn't sleep much that night. We talked about it at work the next day and how important it is to listen to that little voice on your shoulder ... I will always wonder what happened or if I had stopped, if it would have made a difference in any way.\"Recovery efforts continued in warmer weather, albeit on a smaller scale. For its exercises and training sessions, the RCMP's search and rescue team chose areas of the taiga where Yoshikubo might have gone. They kept those locations confidential to ensure that only trained personnel who knew how to process the scene found the body if there was one to be found.\n\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThere was some speculation about why Yoshikubo might have chosen to die by walking into the bush around Yellowknife. Simon Hatcher, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Ottawa, said that most long wilderness sojourns are a form of temporary suicide, from which people return feeling better. \"People who are suicidal can have this fantasy where they can have a temporary escape\u2014a temporary suicide,\" he told the National Post. \"And maybe that way they will stand out, and somebody will come along and save them. Maybe this was some form of this woman testing fate.\"Others wondered why, given popular locations in Japan such as the Aokigahara forest near Mount Fuji, where there are many suicides each year due to the intense seclusion, for that sort of wilderness suicide, Yoshikubo had traveled so far for hers. \"Sometimes people romanticize about how they might control their death, and they can become fixated on a place,\" the director of a Toronto suicide prevention centre told the Post. \"Maybe this woman came to Canada to create some distance from her family, and to spare them from it.\"\n\n\n=== Possible effect on tourism ===\nIn the immediate aftermath, concerns were expressed that the incident would result in a drop in Japanese tourism to Yellowknife, although it would not be known what impact there would be until wintertime, the next most popular time to see the auroras. \"This will frighten the Japanese culture that a person has gone missing,\" said the director of the territorial tourism information centre that Yoshikubo had been videotaped visiting. However, Colin Dempsey, president of the Northern Frontier Visitors' Association, said that while he was sad for her family that she had apparently met her end in the area, among member businesses, \"there is also a sense of relief that foul play has been ruled out in her disappearance.\"Similarly, he also believed that the elimination of the possibility of an accidental death would allay any potential concerns. He said the information centre had not received any inquiries from Japan about whether people should reconsider going to Yellowknife as a result of the disappearance. The manager of two local tour operators said, likewise, that there had been no cancellations by Japanese tourists.Among the small Japanese Canadian community in the city, most of whom make their living in businesses serving that particular tourist market, there was some concern that similarly suicidally inclined Japanese would try to emulate her. One tour operator doubted the possibility, noting that the costs of traveling to Yellowknife were too high. But, he said, he and his colleagues needed to be more vigilant in dissuading Japanese visitors from going out alone at night into the bush, since they could get lost as he feared Yoshikubo had done.By December, these concerns proved unfounded. Tour operators said that, in fact, not only were numbers not down, they had actually increased from the year before. \"It didn't have any impact,\" said one kennel owner, who estimated that half his business came from Japan.\n\n\n== Discovery of remains and identification ==\nAt the beginning of September 2015, the RCMP announced that a hiker in an area off the Ingraham north of the city had found personal effects that were confirmed to be Yoshikubo's. Along with the effects were human remains. However, the agency said, it could take months of forensic testing before it could be determined whether or not those remains were hers. In April 2016 the RCMP confirmed they were, and announced that the case was closed. Since only bone fragments were left, they would not be able to perform an autopsy.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of people who disappeared\nTimeline of Yellowknife history\nTourism in Canada\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9. However, the population is slightly disproportionate in terms of age distribution compared to the national average of 41.0. As of the 2016 figures, 13.9% of residents were 9 or under, 6.0% were from 10 to 14 years old, 13.1% were from 15 to 24, 34.1.2% were from 25 to 44, 22.0% were from 45 to 59, and 10.9% were 60 or older.\n\nIn 2016, the average household size was 2.7 and the majority of the population with children had either one or two. In 2015 the average income in the city was C$73,500, and the average income for a family was C$160,394, with 7.9% of all families earning less than $30,000. Minimum wage in Yellowknife and the NWT is C$13.46 (2018). Average household expenditures were C$125,783 in 2015. In 2016, the unemployment rate was at 5.9%; the employment rate for males was 80.1%, for females it was 75.2%.The crime rate in Yellowknife for 2016 was 46.7 (per 1,000 persons) for violent crimes, and 167.2 (per 1,000 persons) for property crimes. There were 299 births and 62 deaths in 2014.English was the mother tongue of 80.0% of residents and 3.2% spoke French. Of the nine official languages of the Northwest Territories 0.4% spoke Chipewyan (Dene); 0.1% spoke a Cree language; 0.1% spoke Gwich\u2019in; 0.4% spoke Inuktitut; 0.1% spoke Inuinnaqtun or Inuvialuktun; 0.6% spoke North or South Slavey and 1.2% spoke T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb (Dogrib). In total 3.0% of the population said that an Indigenous language was their mother tongue.Not including the 11 official languages there are over 70 different languages that Yellowknifers stated were their mother tongue. These include Indo-European languages (4.2%); Austronesian languages (3.9%); Indo-Iranian languages and Germanic languages (1.1% each); Sino-Tibetan languages and Chinese languages and Indo-Aryan languages (1.0% each). The five main individual languages are Tagalog (3.2%); Vietnamese (0.8%); German (0.6%); Cantonese and Spanish (0.5% each).Yellowknife is home to 695 recent immigrants (arriving between 2011 and 2016) who now make up 3.7% of the population. Of the recent immigrants 70.5% came from Asia; 15.1% from Africa and 7.2% from both the Americas and Europe. Of the recent immigrants 40.0% came from the Philippines, while 10.8% came from several African countries, 5.8% each from India, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, 4.3% from each of Japan and South Korea and 2.2% from IsraelYellowknife is primarily populated by European with a population of 11,680 (60.6% of total). The total Indigenous peoples population 4,375 representing 22.7% of the population (12.7% First Nations, 7.0% M\u00e9tis), and 3.0% Inuit. Other ethnic groups include Filipino with 1,065 residents (5.5% of total), Black with 610 residents (3.2% of total) and South Asian with 510 residents (2.6% of total) with a total visible minority population of 3,230 (16.7% of total).In the 2001 Census almost 73% of residents identified as Christian while 24% said they had no religious affiliation..

          "Since the trail was updated I haven\u2019t enjoyed walking around it as much. There was something special about having to walk over the rocks and not knowing exactly where the trail was that made it more special, not it just feels like a racetrack around a lake.",

          "Hoped to see a few birds, but too not many around in February. Easy, quiet walk and likely to run into some friendly local folk.",
          "The whole idea around this trail is to view nature, but I liked looking at the architecture of the houses along the lake as well. It was interesting to see how some had been built to fit into the rock and also how some had planted \"rock gardens\" behind their houses.",
          "This is a short walk around a small lake in a residential neighborhood. Definitely worth it to get a little exercise, but not too much to see.",
          "This is a beautiful walk, a great place to see birds and other wildlife, but you definitely need protection from the mosquitoes. The entrances to the trail are not that well marked. We had to ask for directions, but the Yellowknife residents we spoke to were all friendly and",
          "This is a very pretty trail.Although it was winter,the trail was very easy to walk on.A lot of people seem to use it.",
          "There are lots of viewing points along this trail which added to the enjoyment of the scenery. Even though it backs onto a lot of private homes there was still evidence of bears. Only one rock to climb over, anyone can do this one."

It was known as Frobisher Bay from 1942 to 1987, after the large bay on the coast of which the city is situated. In 1987, its traditional Inuktitut name was restored.\nIn 1999, Iqaluit was designated the capital of Nunavut after the division of the Northwest Territories into two separate territories. Before this event, Iqaluit was a small city and not well known outside the Canadian Arctic or Canada, with population and economic growth highly limited. This is due to the city's isolation and heavy dependence on expensively imported supplies, as the city, like the rest of Nunavut, has no road or rail, and only has ship connections for part of the year to the rest of Canada. The city has a polar climate, influenced by the cold deep waters of the Labrador Current just off Baffin Island; this makes the city of Iqaluit cold, although it is well south of the Arctic Circle.\nAs of the 2016 census, the population was 7,740 (population centre: 7,082), an increase of 15.5 percent from the 2011 census. Iqaluit has the lowest population of any capital city in Canada. Inhabitants of Iqaluit are called Iqalummiut (singular: Iqalummiuq).\n\n\n== History ==\nIqaluit has been a traditional fishing location used by Inuit for thousands of years. The name, Iqaluit, comes from Inuktitut Iqaluit (\u1403\u1583\u14d7\u1403\u1466) which means place of many fish.World War II resulted in an influx of non-Inuit to the area in 1942, when the United States built Frobisher Bay Air Base there, on a long-term lease from the Government of Canada, in order to provide a stop-over and refuelling site for the short-range aircraft being ferried to Europe to support the war effort. Iqaluit's first permanent resident was Nakasuk, an Inuk guide who helped United States Army Air Forces planners to choose a site with a large flat area suitable for a landing strip. The wartime airstrip was known as Crystal Two, was part of the Crimson Route and operates today as Iqaluit Airport.\nIt had long been used as a campsite and fishing spot by the Inuit, who called it Iqaluit \u2013 \"place of many fish\" in Inuktitut. The US and Canadian authorities named it Frobisher Bay, after the name of the body of water it borders.\n\nIn 1949, after the war, the Hudson's Bay Company moved its south Baffin operations to the neighbouring valley of Niaqunngut, officially called Apex, in order to use the airfield. In the mid-1950s, the population of Frobisher Bay increased rapidly during the construction of the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW line), a system of defensive radar stations\u2014see North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).\nHundreds of mostly non-Inuit construction workers, military personnel, and administrative staff moved into the community, and several hundred Inuit followed, to take advantage of the access to jobs and medical care provided by the base operations. By 1957, 489 of the town's 1,200 residents were reported to be Inuit. After 1959, the Canadian government established permanent services at Frobisher Bay, including full-time doctors, a school, and social services. The Inuit population grew rapidly in response, as the government encouraged Inuit to settle permanently in communities supported by government services.\nNaval Radio Station (NRS) Frobisher Bay (HMCS Frobisher Bay), callsign CFI, was established in July 1954 as a result of the closure of NRS Chimo, Quebec. Station CFI was part of the Supplementary Radio network. Because of its remoteness and size, it was very expensive to operate. Renamed CFS Frobisher Bay in 1966, advancing technology eventually forced the closure of CFI later that year.The American military left Iqaluit in 1963, as their development of the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) diminished the strategic value of the DEW line and Arctic airbases. Canada continued to operate an administrative and logistical centre for much of the eastern Arctic at Frobisher Bay. In 1964, the first local elections were held for a community council, and in 1979 for the first mayor. The founding of the Gordon Robertson Educational Centre, now Inuksuk High School, in the early 1970s at Iqaluit confirmed the government's commitment to the community as an administrative centre. At the time of its founding, this was the sole high school operating in what constituted more than one-seventh of Canadian territory.\nOn 1 January 1987, the name of the municipality was changed from \"Frobisher Bay\" to \"Iqaluit\" \u2013 aligning official usage with the name that the Inuit population had always used. (Many documents were made that referred to Iqaluit as Frobisher Bay for several years after 1987). In December 1995, Iqaluit was selected by a territory-wide referendum to serve as Nunavut's future capital; it was chosen over Rankin Inlet. On 19 April 2001, it was designated a city.\nCanada designated Iqaluit as the host city for the 2010 meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers, held on 5\u20136 February. The requirements for the international meeting strained the northern communications technology infrastructure and required supplemental investment.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n1576 \u2013 Englishman Martin Frobisher sails into Frobisher Bay believing he has found the westward route to China. He held the first Anglican/Episcopalian church service in North America here.\n1861 \u2013 Charles Francis Hall, an American, camps at the Sylvia Grinnell River and explores the waters of Koojesse Inlet, which he names after his Inuit guide.\n1942 \u2013 The United States Army Air Forces selects this area as the site of a major air base to support war efforts in the United Kingdom and Europe.\n1949 \u2013 The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) moves its trading post from Ward Inlet to nearby Apex.\n1955 \u2013 Frobisher Bay becomes the centre for United States/Canada DEW Line construction operations.

It is well to the east of Nunavut's mainland, and northeast of Hudson Bay.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nIqaluit has a tundra climate (K\u00f6ppen: ET) typical of the Arctic region, although it is well outside the Arctic Circle. The city features very long, cold winters and brief, cool summers. Average monthly temperatures are below freezing for eight months of the year. Iqaluit averages just over 400 mm (16 in)  of precipitation annually, much wetter than many other localities in the Arctic Archipelago, with the summer being the wettest season. Temperatures of the winter months are comparable to other northern communities further west on the continent such as Yellowknife and to some extent even Fairbanks, Alaska, even though Iqaluit is a few degrees colder than the latter. Summer temperatures are, however, much colder due to its easterly maritime position affected by the waters of the cold Baffin Island Current. This means that the tree line is much further south in the eastern part of Canada, being as southbound, in spite of low elevation, as northern Labrador.Although it is north of the natural tree line, there are some short, south-facing imported black spruce (Picea mariana) specimens protected by snowdrifts in the winter, in addition to a few shrubs, which are woody plants. These include the Arctic willow (Salix arctica), which is hard to recognize as a tree because of its low height. The Arctic willow may be up to around 7.6 m (25 ft) horizontally, but only 150 mm (6 in) tall.\nThe climate of Iqaluit is also colder than Gulf Stream locations on the same latitude. For example, the Norwegian city of Trondheim has an annual mean temperature that is 15.2 \u00b0C (27.4 \u00b0F) milder.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Iqaluit was 26.7 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F) on 21 July 2008. The lowest temperature ever recorded was \u221245.6 \u00b0C (\u221250 \u00b0F) on 10 February 1967.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Neighbourhoods ===\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nApex, officially and functionally part of the City of Iqaluit, is a small community about 5 km (3.1 mi) southeast (63\u00b043\u203247\u2033N 068\u00b026\u203248\u2033W) from Iqaluit's centre and is known in Inuktitut as Niaqunngut. It is located on a small peninsula separating Koojesse Inlet from Tarr Inlet. There is a women's shelter, a church, a primary school (Nanook Elementary School), a design shop and a bed and breakfast in the community. Apex was where most Inuit lived when Iqaluit was a military site, and as such the suburb was off-limits to anyone not working at the base.\n\n\n=== Architecture and attractions ===\n\nMuch of Iqaluit's architecture is functional \u2013 designed to minimize material costs, while retaining heat and withstanding the climate. Early architecture runs from the 1950s military barracks of the original DEW line installation, through the 1970s white hyper-modernist fibreglass block of the Nakasuk School and Municipal Offices and Arena, to the lines of the steel-reinforced concrete high-rise complex on the hill above it. A number of older Hudson's Bay Company and early 1950s buildings have been retained and restored in Apex (the former nursing station has been revived as the Rannva Bed and Breakfast, the HBC buildings as an art gallery). The newer buildings are more colourful and diverse, and closer to the norms of southern architecture.\nThe principal exception is the Nunavut Legislative Assembly Building, which is remarkable for its colourful interior, adorned with some of the very best in Inuit art. A new legislative building is in planning to be developed and built outside the city on the Apex Road.\n\nAnother distinctive building was St. Jude's Anglican Cathedral, see of the Anglican Diocese of The Arctic, which was a white building shaped like an igloo. The altar was built by the parishioners, under the guidance of Markoosie Peter, a traditional master carpenter. It was shaped like a traditional Inuit sled, and the cross composed of two crossed narwhal tusks. An incident of arson severely affected the Cathedral structure and interior on 5 November 2005, and it was demolished on 1 June 2006. The cathedral is slowly being rebuilt (foundation 2008 superstructure 2010) and fund-raising continues locally and internationally. In December 2010, the exterior of a similarly shaped replacement cathedral was completed, and interior work was planned for 2011 with a potential opening for Christmas 2011. The current building, informally referred to as the Igloo Cathedral, was opened on 3 June 2012. The unique building, in the shape of an igloo, has traditionally been a landmark and tourist attraction in Iqaluit, besides its important spiritual role for Iqalummiut (people of Iqaluit).\nOn a ridge overlooking the city is the distinctive blue and white Inuksuk High School. The school is made up of four square sections joined together that give a cloverleaf shape when viewed from the air.\nThe city is also the location of the Nunatta Sunakkutaangit Museum, which houses a large collection of Inuit and Arctic objects. The museum is housed in a restored and extended Hudson's Bay Company building, clad in the HBC signature red and white, transported to Iqaluit from its original site on the Apex Beach.\n\nJust west of Iqaluit is the Sylvia Grinnell Territorial Park. This park is dominated by the valley of the Sylvia Grinnell River. A small visitor's centre with viewing platform is located on top of a hill overlooking scenic waterfalls, tidal flats and traditional fishing sites.\nNearby on an island near Peterhead Inlet, is the Qaummaarviit Territorial Park. It is a site with a long Inuit history and numerous artifacts have been recovered, including the remains of 11 semi-buried sod houses.\nA little farther, across Frobisher Bay, are the Katannilik Territorial Park Reserve and the Soper River, a Canadian Heritage River, forming a park corridor linking Iqaluit along traditional overland travel routes with Kimmirut (formerly Lake Harbour). Frobisher Bay extends for almost 110 kilometres (70 mi) to the east, with moderate hills, glaciers and traditional and summer camp sites, opening into the Davis Strait which divides Nunavut from Greenland.\nIqaluit, like many Nunavut communities, has a volunteer-run annual spring festival. Called Toonik Tyme it involves a combination of traditional Inuit activities combined with more modern events, while the Alianait Music and Arts Festival is held for a week each 21 June. The festival has attracted Canadian and international artists such as Joshua Haulli, Quantum Tangle, Washboard Hank and Namgar.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe 2016 census reported that there were 7,740, people living in Iqaluit, a 15.5% increase from 2011 census. The land area of the city is 52.50 km2 (20.27 sq mi), therefore a population density of 147.4/km2 (382/sq mi). Iqaluit has 3,419 private dwellings, 2,749 of which are occupied by usual residents. The median value of these dwellings is $376,639, quite a bit higher than the national median at $280,552. The average household has about 2.8 people living in it, and the average family has 1.4 children living at home with them. The median (after-tax) household income in Iqaluit is quite high, $98,921, almost double the national rate at $54,089. The median income for an individual in the city, is also high, $60,688. 5.9% of people (over 15 years old) are either divorced or separated, which is quite a bit lower than the national rate at 8.6%. Also, 53.3% of the population is either married or living with a common law partner.\nIqaluit has quite a young population, the median age of the population is more than 10 years younger than the national rate, 30.1 years old compared to 40.6 years old.\nIqaluit has the most Inuit people in both numbers (3,900) and percentages (59.1%), of all Canadian cities with populations greater than 5,000. The racial make up is:\n\nThere is no \"majority mother tongue\" in Iqaluit, as 45.4% reported their mother tongue as being English, and 45.4% also reported their mother tongue as Inuktitut. 97.2% of Iqalummiuts can speak English, however, whereas only 53.1% can speak Inuktitut. French was the mother tongue of 4.8% of the population, which is the same figure of the population who can speak the language. As of 2012, \"Pirurvik, Iqaluit\u2019s Inuktitut language training centre, has a new goal: to train instructors from Nunavut communities to teach Inuktitut in different ways and in their own dialects when they return home.\"74.9% of the population practise some form of Christianity (Anglican is the most popular at 42.6%), and 22.9% of the population identify as having no religious affiliation. There are other religions practised in the city, just not in large numbers.\nFor those over the age of 25:\n\n75.7% are high school educated (15.9% as their highest level of education)\n59.8% are post-secondary school educated\n24.3% have no certificate, diploma or degree\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Qikiqtani School Operations based in Pond Inlet operates five schools in the area. Nanook Elementary School, located in Apex, Nakasuk School and Joamie Ilinniarvik School offer kindergarten to grade 5. Aqsarniit Ilinniarvik School offers grades 6 to 8 and Inuksuk High School offers grades 9 to 12.The Commission scolaire francophone du Nunavut runs \u00c9cole des Trois-Soleils and offers kindergarten to grade 8.At the post-secondary level there are two, Nunavut Arctic College (Nunatta Campus) and Akitsiraq Law School.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nEmergency services (fire and ambulance) are provided by city from a single station on Niaqunngusiariaq.The emergency services fleet consists of:\n\n1 engine\n1 ladder\n2 staff vehicles\n3 ambulancesIqaluit Airport Emergency Services is responsible for fire services at the airport. Following a fire at the airport in 1998, the Government of Nunavut re-opened the fire station at the airport. Their fleet consists of:\n\nWaltek C-5500 ARFF\nOshkosh T3000 ARFFPolicing in Iqaluit, as with the rest of Nunavut is contracted to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) V Division.\n\n\n=== Medical services ===\nQikiqtani General Hospital is the primary care facility in the city. There is also a Family Practice Clinic providing primary care services by Nurse Practitioners. There are two dental clinics in the city.\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nIqaluit features two arenas, the Arctic Winter Games Arena and Arnaitok, the Iqaluit Aquaplex, a curling rink, the Timmianut Pikiuqarvik disc golf course, the Frobisher Inn Fitness Centre, in the W.G. Brown Building/Astro Hill Complex, a golf course, outdoor basketball courts, soccer nets, seasonal outdoor ice rinks, a shooting range, a skatepark, and more.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nIqaluit is the smallest Canadian capital in terms of population, and the only capital that is not connected to other settlements by a highway. Located on an island remote from the Canadian highway system, Iqaluit is generally only accessible by aircraft and, subject to ice conditions, by boat.\n\nIqaluit Airport is a modern facility with a runway long enough for most modern jet aircraft. A new, larger passenger terminal building north of the old terminal was completed in 2018.\nCanadian North serves Iqaluit from Ottawa, Yellowknife, and several communities in Nunavut. Locally based airlines Air Nunavut, Canadian Helicopters, Nunasi Helicopters, and Unaalik Aviation provide air charters, and Air Nunavut and Keewatin Air provide MEDIVAC/air ambulance service. Air Canada Jazz provided daily service to Iqaluit from Ottawa in 2010 and 2011, but cancelled service due to rising fuel costs, which prevented the route from being profitable.Iqaluit shared its runway with the Royal Canadian Air Force until the Canadian Forces stopped using Iqaluit as a Canadian NORAD Region Forward Operating Locations. The barracks and CF-188 hangars are maintained. The airport was a centre for cold-weather testing of new aircraft, such as the Airbus A380 in February 2006.\nRumours that Iqaluit was an emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle are false.In the middle of summer, a few ships\u2014generally no larger than a Liberty-class vessel\u2014transport bulk and heavy goods to the city. Cargo is currently off-loaded onto barges as the harbour is not deep enough, however the city is currently constructing a deepwater port which is expected to open in 2020. The port, which will cost approximately $72 million dollars, will provide all-tide access to ships and will have space for one ship to dock and unload, with the ability to offload a second using a barge-and-ramp method. Initial plans for the port included facilities for a vehicle ferry connection to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, however these plans were dropped due to high cost.  Experienced locals also cross the Hudson Strait from the Canadian mainland when it freezes over, either on foot or by dog sled or snowmobile, a distance of over 100 km (62 mi).\n\nIqaluit has a local road system only stretching from the nearby community of Apex to the Sylvia Grinnell Territorial Park, 1 km (0.62 mi) west of town. Iqaluit has no public transportation, although there is citywide taxi service. Iqaluit Public Transit used to offer bus service in the city, but the service was cancelled due to low ridership. Motor cars are increasing in number, to the extent of causing occasional traffic jams known locally as \"the rush minute\". However, the cost of shipping automobiles and the wear-and-tear of the harsh Arctic climate combined with its notoriously rough roadways mean that snowmobiles remain the preferred form of personal transportation. All-terrain vehicles are also common in most of the Canadian Arctic. Snowmobiles are used to travel within the city and in the surrounding area. In winter, dog sleds are still used, but primarily for recreation. In winter, the nearby Qaummaarviit Territorial Park and the more remote Katannilik Territorial Park Reserve are only accessible by snowmobile, dog sled or foot. In the summer, both are accessible by boat. Most major roads within Iqaluit are paved with asphalt, but local and smaller roads are gravel. Roads do not have traffic signals, but use stop signs to control intersections.\nResidents and businesses identify their locations mostly by building number, and occasionally by the name of a prominent structure. Residents know where in the city certain series of building numbers are located; numbers tend to be aggregated in blocks, so someone might say that they live in the 2600s. Around 2003, street names were developed, although there were delays in finalizing them and posting the signs. Street numbers have not been assigned, and building numbers continue to be used. Iqaluit is the only Canadian capital city not to have traffic signals, although some have been installed on a temporary basis.\n\n\n=== Waste and water treatment ===\nThe city's infrastructure is stressed by growth and lack of means to upgrade. Waste from the city is disposed of into an open air dump on Akilliq Drive (West 40) located south of the city.Although the city has water treatment facilities, raw sewage from the city is often dumped untreated into nearby Frobisher Bay.As the dump has reached capacity, the city plans to open a second dump 9 km (5.6 mi) north of the city. Iqaluit does not have a recycling program in place; all recyclable materials are sent into the waste stream.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Communications ===\nLandline services in Iqaluit, and throughout northern Canada, are provided by Northwestel.Cell service is provided by Ice Wireless, Bell Mobility and Qiniq.Internet service is available through Northwestel, Ice Wireless, Qiniq, Xplornet and Meshnet. Meshnet Community WiFi is a free community WiFi and paid service available in most areas of city. Free services include access to Isuma.tv, and many other resources.\n\n\n=== Press ===\nNunatsiaq News\nNews/North\n\n\n=== Radio ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\nIqaluit was served by CFFB-TV channel 8, a CBC Television/CBC North repeater of CFYK-DT (Yellowknife) until 31 July 2012 when it was closed because of budget cuts at the CBC.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of municipalities in Nunavut\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9.

The popular restaurant still operates in its original building during the summer, which was moved to its current location after being saved from demolition in the late 1970s. The Wildcat Cafe has been renovated from 2011 to 2013, and during these times there were a few ups and downs to get the place ready for open. The City hosted a grand opening of the new Wildcat Cafe on 16 June 2013.\nThe Gold Range Bar, (also known as The Strange Range and listed in the circa 1989 phonebook as such) one of the oldest and most colourful drinking establishments in the Northwest Territories and featured in Elizabeth Hay's novel \"Late Nights On Air\" and Mordecai Richler's novel Solomon Gursky Was Here.\nDowntown contains the Capital Area Park, a short but pleasant stroll by City Hall, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, the Legislature.\nThe Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre is a museum containing exhibits of the history and culture of Inuit, Inuvialuit, Dene, M\u00e9tis and non-aboriginal peoples of the NWT.

        "wiki": "Thaidene N\u00ebn\u00e9 National Park Reserve (from the Dene, this Chipewyan name means land of our ancestors) is a protected area in the vicinity of the east arm of Great Slave Lake, located on the northern edge of the boreal forest of Canada in the North Slave Region of the Northwest Territories. The National Park Reserve  consists of a national park administered by Parks Canada and an adjacent protected area administered by the Government of the Northwest Territories. The current land withdrawal covers an area of approximately 33,690 km2 (13,008 sq mi).\nThe area has been subject to interim land withdrawals by which \"no new mining claims or oil and gas rights will be issued for the affected area\" while decisions are being made. Some areas of potentially high mineral content have been excluded from the proposals, such that certain industrial and commercial activities will likely be approved to continue in those areas. Designation as a national park would prevent the expansion of uranium and diamond mines into the park's boundaries, and works to protect caribou and pelt animals such as \"lynx, wolf, red fox, wolverine, marten, moose and black bear\". Other mammals inhabiting this park reserve include Arctic fox, beaver, muskox, grizzly bear and barren-ground caribou. The area features red granite cliffs, as well as \"a spectacular array of peninsulas, canyons and waterfalls as the forests give way to northern tundra\". Various migratory bird species also stage and nest in the area, including ducks and songbirds.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nConsideration for the creation a 7,340 km2 (2,830 sq mi) national park in the region was withdrawn in 1970 under the Territorial Lands Act, but in 2001 the \u0141uts\u00ebl K'\u00e9 Dene First Nation (previously Snowdrift) re-considered the proposal. Consultations for a feasibility study proceeded from 2002 to 2004, which drew the inclusion of the M\u00e9tis Nation to the process. By 2005, the \u0141utselk'e produced a Band Council Resolution \"supporting consideration of a national park as part of a broader protection initiative for their traditional territory\", in cooperation with other Akaitcho First Nations. In 2006, the \u0141utselk'e Dene First Nation and the Minister of Environment and Minister Responsible for Parks Canada signed a Memorandum of Understanding which expanded the land withdrawal area for consideration for the national park by an additional 26,350 km2 (10,170 sq mi) and defined a process for working together on matters pertaining to establishing a national park. Originally expected to be designated in 2009, negotiations have yet to be finalized.\nBy 2014, the government of the Northwest Territories through the Northwest Territories Devolution Act took administrative control of the 33,690 km2 (13,010 sq mi) park study area, and by the following year initiated a \"matrix of protected area designations\" that included a scaled-down National Park Reserve of 14,000 km2 (5,400 sq mi) in combination with a range of territorial designations, conserving 75 percent of the 33,690 km2 (13,010 sq mi) area. Public consultations on the smaller proposed boundaries finished in 2016. The federal government's 2016 budget named the Thaidene N\u00ebn\u00e9 proposal in its allocation of funds to help the National Park Reserve to realization.On June 10, 2015, Parks Canada and the Northwest Territory M\u00e9tis Nation negotiators reached an agreement in principle on most elements of an Impact and Benefit Agreement. The agreement is subject to internal review and consultation by both the NWTMN and Parks Canada.\nThe Government of Canada announced its proposed boundary for a national park reserve in the Thaidene N\u00ebn\u00e9 area on July 29, 2015 and launched formal consultations on the boundary.On February 15, 2019, the \u0141utselk'e Dene First Nation voted to approve the creation of Thaidene N\u00ebn\u00e9 National Park Reserve. On 21 August 2019, an agreement was signed by Parks Canada, the Government of the Northwest Territories, and three First Nations (Lutsel K\u2019e Dene First Nation, Deninu K'ue First Nation, and Yellowknives Dene First Nation) establishing a protected area consisting of a 14,305 km2 (5,523 sq mi) national park administered by Parks Canada, and a 12,220 km2 (4,720 sq mi) area administered by the territorial government that includes a wildlife conservation area.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThaidene N\u00ebn\u00e9 National Park Reserve map\nWebsite for the proposed park, maintained by the community of Lutsel K\u2019e",

          "It's a little further out the Ingram Trail than Cameron Falls, but not nearly as far off the road. Cameron Falls is a good hike into a large falls. The Ramparts are a short walk into a large rapids. If your energy level is an issue, the Ramparts are for you and well worth the",

          "It's a short walk and an easy hike, and a lovely spot to sit and enjoy the scenery and the breezes. A very nice little waterfall, lots of eddies and pools, just far enough off the road to have it mostly all to yourself.",
          "Not too difficult, the trail provides enough spots to meander off the trail a bit for great pictures. The views are spectacular. Try taking off your socks and shoes, and dangling your feet in the Cameron River below the falls. Well worth the drive fromYellowknife.",
          "The short walk and beautiful scenery once you got about 8 minutes into the bush after the short walk, what a beautiful place to spend an afternoon.",

          "After about a 20 minute hike in beautiful county you come upon a huge waterfall. Lots of opportunity for photos. Came across a flock of Ptarmagin. Well marked trail and not too hard.",
          "You can see these from the road/bridge. There is a small parking area and a little trail away from the ramparts. Good alternative if you are not able to walk the Cameron Falls Trail",
          "Lovely views, close to the carpark. Very easy to get to. Wonderful place to visit in summer and lots of Northern Pike below the falls."

        "wiki": "Highway 4, known as the Ingraham Trail, extends from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories to Tibbitt Lake, approximately 70 km (43 mi) east of Yellowknife. It was built in the mid-1960s as the first leg of a 'road to resources' with the original intention of circulating Great Slave Lake.\nThe highway is designated as a northern/remote route of Canada's National Highway System.\nThe Ingraham Trail serves as both an industrial and recreational highway. In February and March each year, the trail is the initial section of the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road to three diamond mines located {300 km (190 mi) northeast of Yellowknife. The trail is also known as Yellowknife's cottage country, with the bulk of seasonal and year-round cabins located between Cassidy Point and Prelude Lake Territorial Park. During the winter road program, B-train tractor trailers travel the road, four loads every 20 minutes, 24 hours a day.\nAlthough the highway serves primarily recreational activities and area residences in this lake-dotted country it is, after the ice break-up on Great Slave Lake, the only access to Dettah from Yellowknife. The small Dene community is about 6.5 km (4.0 mi) from Yellowknife by ice road in winter or 27 km (17 mi) using the Ingraham Trail.\nFor about a month in late winter, a winter road to Lac de Gras is opened to trucking of mining supplies, the junction being along the Ingraham Trail. The road condition has suffered due to its frequent use by heavy trucks. This is shown on the first season of the American reality television series, Ice Road Truckers, which airs on History. The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road also extends from the end of the Ingraham Trail to Contwoyto Lake in Nunavut, forming Nunavut's only connection to the road network in the rest of Canada.\nThe Ingraham Trail is named after Vic Ingraham, a pioneer Yellowknife businessman of the 1930s\u201340s.\nYellowknife has experienced an aurora borealis tourism boom the last few years and the Ingraham Trail is the prime viewing location. It is common to come across aurora rush after midnight during the peak aurora season, November to March.\n\n\n== Details ==\n\nSince January 2014, the road bypasses Giant Mine through a realignment that originates off Highway 3, approximately 2 km (1.2 mi) from the Old Airport Road turnoff. At 7.6 km (4.7 mi) the road crosses the Yellowknife River followed by the Dettah turnoff at 9.8 km (6.1 mi). After this the road passes several territorial parks:\nYellowknife River Territorial Park  (7.7 km (4.8 mi))\nDettah turnoff (9.8 km (6.1 mi))\nProsperous Lake Territorial Park (19.7 km (12.2 mi))\nMadeline Lake Territorial Park (24 km (15 mi))\nPontoon Lake Territorial Park (26.4 km (16.4 mi))\nPrelude Lake Territorial Park (28 km (17 mi)\nHidden Lake Territorial Park (44 km (27 mi))\nPowder Point Day Use Area 44 km (27 mi))\nCameron River Falls Day Use Area/Hiking Trail Access (45.8 km (28.5 mi))\nCameron River Crossing (54.5 km (33.9 mi))\nReid Lake Territorial Park  (59 km (37 mi))before reaching Tibbitt Lake (69.2 km (43.0 mi)).\nThe trail is chipsealed to Reid Lake, leaving the last 10 km (6.2 mi) as gravel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n1934 Vic Ingraham and Speed II NWT Historical Timeline, Prince of Wales Northern Heritage CentreIngraham Trail History",

It replaced Niagara Falls Transit's Falls Shuttle, as well as the Niagara Parks Commission People Mover. Originally scheduled to launch on June 29, 2012, the service's inauguration was postponed due to delays in its buses' intelligent transportation system. WEGO launched its preview service on August 13, 2012, then finally began official operations, a week later, on August 20WEGO is a pairing of the words \"we\" and \"go\", conveying the meaning of friendship and social activity, as well as adventure and exploration.\n\n\n== Fares and Connections ==\n\n\n=== Fares ===\n\n\n==== Adventure and Magic Passes ====\nThe Adventure Pass (for peak season) and the Magic Pass (for off-peak season) contain a free 48-hour pass for WEGO. Since the \"actual\" passes can only be redeemed at the welcome centres, authorized sellers of the Adventure and Magic Passes outside the welcome centres instead give vouchers to each paid customer, allowing them to ride the WEGO bus for free to finally redeem their Adventure or Magic Pass at the nearest welcome centre. Online buyers of these passes also undergo the same procedure: they must show their printed vouchers to ride the WEGO bus for free to get their respective passes at the nearest welcome centre.\n\n\n=== Connections and Transfers ===\nThere is partial fare integration between WEGO and the regular local Niagara Falls Transit service. Monthly passholders of regular local Niagara Falls Transit service are allowed to connect to WEGO for free. However, 10-ride passholders, day passholders, and single-ride passengers must pay a separate WEGO fare. Passengers connecting from Niagara Region Transit must also pay a separate WEGO fare. On the other hand, both WEGO passes (24-hour and 48-hour) are accepted at local Niagara Falls Transit buses, but not at Niagara Region buses.\nWEGO also connects with inter-regional transit customers using GO Transit, VIA Rail, Greyhound Canada and Coach Canada via the Green Line. GO Transit stations along the Niagara excursion train sell WEGO passes when the train is in operation.\nAt Fort George National Historic Site, passengers can connect to Niagara-on-the-Lake Transit's Heritage-Old Town route. Passengers can also connect to GO Transit's Route 11 at King and Pitcon Streets, which is a short distance from Fort George.\n\n\n== Routes ==\n\n\n=== Route Details ===\n\n\n=== Service Details ===\n\n\n=== Blue Line ===\nDespite its convoluted routing, the Blue Line serves the most popular attractions in the city. At the northern half of the route, the Blue Line runs as a counter-clockwise semi-loop serving Clifton Hill as well as Victoria Avenue. Once it reaches Murray Street, the route becomes a north-south route serving the Fallsview tourist area, running along Fallsview Boulevard, Stanley Avenue, and Portage Road. The Blue Line also serves the city's major hotels and landmarks, as well as its two major casinos. During the peak season, it also extends service to Marineland. The route is operated by Niagara Falls Transit.\nBetween the end of June and Labour Day, Blue Line runs every 15 minutes until approximately 9:30 pm, shortly after Marineland closes, then performs a short-turn at the Socitabank Convention Centre, running every 20 minutes until the end of service. During the shoulder peak season, it runs every 30 minutes during weekends until 7 pm coinciding with Marineland's operating hours, every 20 minutes during weekdays, and every 40 minutes during evenings when Marineland is not in operation. During the off-peak season, it only services the convention centre, running every 20 minutes during the day and 40 minutes during the evening.\n\n\n==== Stops ====\n\n\n=== Red Line ===\nThe Red Line serves the Lundy's Lane corridor, which hosts many hotels, campsites and retail stores, the most notable being Canada One Factory Outlets. Like the Blue Line, this route is also operated by Niagara Falls Transit.\nBetween the end of June and Labour Day, Red Line runs every 30 minutes until past midnight. During the rest of the year, it runs every 30 minutes during the day and every 60 minutes during the evening.\n\n\n==== Stops ====\n\n\n=== Green Line ===\nThe Green Line encompasses the former route of Niagara Parks Commission People Mover, running along the Niagara Parkway corridor. It is operated by Niagara Parks Commission. Green Line is the only route that crosses the municipal boundary, allowing service to Queenston at the neighbouring Niagara-on-the-Lake. During the peak season, it runs between the Rapidsview Parking Lot and the Queenston Heights Park. Meanwhile, during the fall, winter, and early spring, southbound service ends at Table Rock and northbound service ends at the Floral Clock, just like its predecessor route.\nGreen Line runs every 12 minutes between the end of June and Labour Day and every 20 minutes during the rest of the year. No evening service is provided throughout the year.\n\n\n==== Stops ====\n\n\n=== Niagara-on-the-Lake Shuttle ===\nThe Niagara-on-the-Lake Shuttle is an additional route implemented during the 2013 peak season, running along the northern segment of the Niagara Parkway corridor between Fort George and the Floral Clock, which becomes the most direct route between Niagara-on-the-Lake and Niagara Falls. Like the Green Line, it is also operated by Niagara Parks Commission.\nThe NOTL shuttle runs every 90 minutes during the peak season only, and is subject to a fare surcharge (see Fares section).\n\n\n==== Stops ====\nFloral Clock\nQueenston Heights Park\nMackenzie Printery\nLaura Secord Homestead\nMcFarland House\nFort George\n\n\n== Terminals ==\nCampark Resorts Loop\nQueenston Heights Terminal and Loop\n#3 - Table Rock Terminal and loop\nRapidsview Terminal and Loop\n\n\n== Fleet ==\nWEGO has a fleet of 20 articulated (60 ft) and 7 standard (40 ft) buses. All vehicles are owned by Niagara Falls Transit, who also operates 16 of them on the Blue and Red Lines. The remaining 11 are leased to Niagara Parks Commission for the Green Line.WEGO incorporates intelligent transportation systems (ITS) to its bus operations, which allows the following:\nreal-time bus arrivals by scanning a QR code at the bus stop,\nsignal priority to minimize intersection delays,\nautomated stop announcements (in compliance of AODA),\nautomated fare collection, and\ntelevision screens that feature the city's weather conditions, local events, tourist attractions and local hotels.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to WEGO Niagara Falls Visitor Transportation at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "The Wildcat Cafe is a vintage log cabin structure in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada and represents the mining camp style of early Yellowknife. The structure, which houses a summer restaurant, is located in what was then the central business district of the city. It is a City of Yellowknife Heritage Building, designated in 1992. First opened in 1937 by owners Willie Wylie and Smokey Stout, it is the oldest restaurant in Yellowknife. Subsequent owners were Carl and Dorothy Jensen (1939\u20131942) and Mah Gow (1942\u20131951), Yellowknife's first recorded Chinese resident. The cafe closed in 1951 with the illness of Mr. Gow. The building was saved from demolition in the late 1950s when a small group of Yellowknifers fought to have it protected as a heritage site. By 1970 no work had been done to restore the abandoned cabin and it was in poor shape when a new generation of concerned citizens lobbied for its protection. It was soon renovated and reopened as a functional restaurant in 1979. The Old Stope Association, a non-profit heritage society, was responsible for its operation in the 1970s\u20131980s, and today it is managed by the Wildcat Cafe Advisory Committee. In 1992, the cabin was declared a heritage site as an important old building in Yellowknife and the city took ownership. It is one of Yellowknife's most popular tourist attractions.\n\nIn 2011, the city of Yellowknife decided to completely renovate the log building, which had settled far into the ground and was leaning dangerously in several directions at once.  The City engaged Rick Muyres, the premier log cabin builder in the NWT to oversee the rebuild. The dis-assembly process, including cataloguing and numbering the pieces, started on May 11, 2011. Reconstruction and repair continued during the summer of 2012 and the opening was delayed due to a number of unforeseen problems; however, the Wildcat Cafe reopened on June 22, 2013.The Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec, exhibited a replica of the cabin. This replica is being removed as part of a larger renovation to the museum's Canada Hall.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9. However, the population is slightly disproportionate in terms of age distribution compared to the national average of 41.0. As of the 2016 figures, 13.9% of residents were 9 or under, 6.0% were from 10 to 14 years old, 13.1% were from 15 to 24, 34.1.2% were from 25 to 44, 22.0% were from 45 to 59, and 10.9% were 60 or older.\n\nIn 2016, the average household size was 2.7 and the majority of the population with children had either one or two.

There were also 135 Buddhists, 125 Muslims, and 15 Jews.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nFolk on the Rocks is a local music festival that has been an annual occurrence since 1980. The event features a wide variety of musical acts; it is not limited to only Folk. In the past, it has drawn acts such as Buffy Sainte-Marie, the Trailer Park Boys, The Weakerthans, African Guitar Summit, Corb Lund, Fred Penner, Stan Rogers, Gord Downie, Tanya Tagaq, Dan Mangan, Sam Roberts Band, Sloan, The Strumbellas, Joel Plaskett, Ron Sexsmith and Hawksley Workman.\nThe Midnight Sun Golf Tournament, with games played through the city's well-lit summer nights, is also a significant cultural event.\nDuring the winter, there is the Snowking Winter Festival, featuring a snow castle on Great Slave Lake which hosts a month of cultural activities\nThe Long John Jamboree, a new winter festival, took place 23\u201325 March 2012 on the frozen Yellowknife Bay next to the Snowking castle, in Yellowknife's Old Town neighbourhood.

The popular restaurant still operates in its original building during the summer, which was moved to its current location after being saved from demolition in the late 1970s. The Wildcat Cafe has been renovated from 2011 to 2013, and during these times there were a few ups and downs to get the place ready for open. The City hosted a grand opening of the new Wildcat Cafe on 16 June 2013.\nThe Gold Range Bar, (also known as The Strange Range and listed in the circa 1989 phonebook as such) one of the oldest and most colourful drinking establishments in the Northwest Territories and featured in Elizabeth Hay's novel \"Late Nights On Air\" and Mordecai Richler's novel Solomon Gursky Was Here.\nDowntown contains the Capital Area Park, a short but pleasant stroll by City Hall, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, the Legislature.\nThe Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre is a museum containing exhibits of the history and culture of Inuit, Inuvialuit, Dene, M\u00e9tis and non-aboriginal peoples of the NWT.

          "The park was covered in snow-but don't miss the musk ox. We went to the Visitors Center to get information, ask questions and warm up. Wonderful, helpful people there and lots of brochures and maps. They give you an explorer's certificate for above 60 degrees N Lat.",
          "From this park you can look across the lake to the museum (and walk there by following the lakeside trail). In the summer the farmers market finds its home here too. You'll find claim post #1 close to the waterfront here, where the gold rush started off.",
          "The two staff at the visitor's centre, located in the basement of City Hall were so sweet and helpful. Gave us great information recommendations for meals and activities. Greatly appreciated the help.",
          "City Hall is the current home of the visitors centre which has an arctic fox and polar bear display which is as close as a tourist will get to one, so worth the visit. The trail from city hall connects to the museum and to the legislative assembly in a short 1-2 km paved walk.",
          "Great place to take a walk and great view of Frame Lake. Was here when it was cold but it would be a great place for a picnic.",
          "Although I did see the beautiful Christmas lights in the park driving by at night, I didn't spend a lot of time outside. I just wanted people to know that if you go to the visitor's center you can get a certificate that you were above the 60th parallel and a Yellowknife pin to",
          "With colourful lights decoration it is really beautiful at night. You can just walk by and take good pictures and enjoy a quiet night for yourself.",
          "Yellowknife City Hall is one of the local attractions that you have to visit downtown. The building is small and simple, with a fairly big \"Welcome to Yellowknife\" sign outside that is good for taking pictures with. Inside is a small visitors centre where you can pick up",
          "This Farmers Market is held every Tuesday afternoon from 5:15 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. It is situated in the Park beside City Hall. Although it is called a farmers market, there are only a few stands with produce. The majority are food stalls selling all sorts of dishes from India,",
          "As a fan of farmers market, I was excited to find out that we managed to catch the farmers market at Yellowknife just a week before it stopped for the year. They only run from early June to mid Sept on Tuesdays from 5:15pm to 7:15pm at Somba K'e Civic Plaza, which is in front of",
          "This was a good place to stop to gather a lot of local information. Staff were friendly, helpful. Thank you!",
          "We ran out of things to do so on our last day we went here...managed to spend over an hour here between the beautiful park, Garden of Hope and City Hall. There are a few exhibits in City Hall. Look for the ground level entrance if the stairs aren't for you. The view is",
          "Loved this well kept park on the shores of the lake, in the downtown, We saw a free community BBQ here on Labor Day, and visited the Farmer's market (Tuesdays through summer, and into Sept) This is also where we went to see the Northern lights, and view the stars.",
          "I was very impressed with this park. The flowers, the greenery, so clean and beautiful. We loved to sit on the benches relaxing overlooking the water. A must if you visit Yellowknife.",
          "Over the years the park has been developing and has become quite nice since it's more modest beginnings as a lawn outside city hall. The beginning of August was a good time to wander as many trees had ripe berries and lots of flowers were in bloom. Of course, the waterfront",
          "The park is right downtown near the other site and is off the Frame Lake Trail. We did not go in City Hall, But did enjoy the tanning demonstration that was going on the week we were there.",
          "City Hall and the park, with music pavilion, with farmers market, and numerous other events, with so much going on. Yellowknife City Hall Park is second to none in my books. Always so many people relaxing and smiling in the sun.",
          "The grounds surrounding City Hall are welcoming. There are several monuments in the park area making this a a nice for a picnic or some quiet time to reflect. IT face Frame Lake and there is a trail that circles the lake (9KM).",
          "City hall and park is on the way to visitor center and heritage center. The lake was frozen which was pretty awesome, and they decorated all the trees with small lights.",
          "We visited in early January. The snow covered park and frozen lake lit by the holiday lights (up Nov. through Feb.) were quite beautiful after sundown.",
          "I was in Yellowknife for business but took advantage of this lovely park during an extended lunch hours. I was most impressed that although it had snowed the night before, the pathway had been cleared.",
          "I would recommend to walk in groups through the line of flags and take a picture there, the scenery is nice. It's a landmark there.",
          "We stopped in here on Canada Day right after the parade and I think nearly half the city was here. There was a farmers market and some musical events and some craft booths to look at. We came back on another day when they had just the farmers market going a week or so later and",
          "We went for a walk on our HHT and really enjoyed it. Seemed clean and well kept. Dogs were allowed and the sunsets were pretty here. We enjoyed the celebration circle statue too.",

        "wiki": "Yellowknife (; Dogrib: S\u01eb\u01eb\u0300mbak\u2019\u00e8) is the capital, only city, and largest community in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.\nYellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe at one time known as the \"Copper Indians\" or \"Yellowknife Indians\", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as S\u01eb\u0300mbak'\u00e8 (Som-ba Kay) (\"where the money is\"). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndil\u01eb and Dettah.\nThe Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTraditionally, First Nations people of the Yellowknives Dene culture occupied this region. By the 1930s, they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.\n\nThe following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936\u20131937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.\nThe population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945\u20131946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated 81 kilometres (50 mi) to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light\u2014an attempt to retrieve it\u2014was only partially successful.A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the city in 1991. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYellowknife has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than 300 millimetres (12 in) of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.\nYellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around \u221226 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was \u221251.2 \u00b0C (\u221260 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1947, and the highest was 32.5 \u00b0C (90.5 \u00b0F) on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas further east in Canada on similar parallels.\nIn 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season of any city in Canada, while also experiencing the sunniest spring and summer of any city in Canada.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nYellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.\n\n\n==== Houseboats ====\nJolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city's tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nYellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was 12,618,000 carats (2,523.6 kg; 5,563.6 lb), valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on September 20, 2016 and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.\n\nThe major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.\nDuring winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.\nTourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004\u20132005, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Former regional mines ===\n\nYellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nPolicing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.\nThe City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.\n\n\n=== Utilities and services ===\n\n\n==== Communications ====\nYellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.\nYellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.\n\n\n==== Electricity ====\n\nElectricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.\n\n\n==== Solid waste services ====\nResidential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three 77 litres (17 imp gal; 20 US gal) garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.\n\n\n==== Water and sewage treatment ====\nThe City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nYellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one 7,500 feet (2,300 m) strip and another of 5,000 feet (1,500 m); while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.\nYellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from 9 to 13.5 metres (30 to 44 ft). Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are 45 kilometres per hour (28 mph) on most roads, 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) in school zones, and 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.\nUntil 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a 27 kilometres (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2016 Census, there were 19,569 people and 7,130 households in the city. The population density was 185.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (480/sq mi). The 2016 Census found that 22.7% of residents identified as Indigenous. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 20,834 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.In Yellowknife, the population is slightly younger at 34.6 than the average age for the rest of the NWT which is 34.9. However, the population is slightly disproportionate in terms of age distribution compared to the national average of 41.0. As of the 2016 figures, 13.9% of residents were 9 or under, 6.0% were from 10 to 14 years old, 13.1% were from 15 to 24, 34.1.2% were from 25 to 44, 22.0% were from 45 to 59, and 10.9% were 60 or older.\n\nIn 2016, the average household size was 2.7 and the majority of the population with children had either one or two. In 2015 the average income in the city was C$73,500, and the average income for a family was C$160,394, with 7.9% of all families earning less than $30,000. Minimum wage in Yellowknife and the NWT is C$13.46 (2018). Average household expenditures were C$125,783 in 2015.

          "Went with a group of friends for a weekend and had a ton of fun! Julian added to the already amazing experience by keeping everyone engaged and added a few laughs along the way. 10/10 experience, highly recommended by others and I can see why",
          "We had 2 nights tour package. I was uncertained before getting there because I lost contact with Julian. Though it was difficult to contact with him via email, but you can be sure that someone will show up and take you to the hotel. All tours include transportation so you don't",
          "My girlfriend and I attended this tour in March and had a wonderful time. Peter, our tour guide was very engaging and conducted the tour in both English and Chinese to meet the needs of the group--he was very friendly. The tour ran smoothly and we had great conditions for Aurora",
          "We went ahead with the fishing tour to fill up our day itinerary. The tour itself was average but we learnt alot from talking to the fishermen. However, that was pretty much it other. We were being transported to a house for lunch where we got to try different fish. We felt that",
          "I went to Yellowknife without thorough research - my bad and just got this tour contact from Yellowknife visitor center. The reason why I opted for this operator as they're the cheapest option. I was picked up timely by Julian and his assistance. I must admit that Julian was",
          "I went there by myself, but I could really enjoy. I'd already told about that, so the guide was kind to me and treated a lot. There are many Chinese participants, so the guide sometimes spoke in Chinese. I did't care about that because he explained in English too. The second day",
          "The price of the Aurora Borealis Expereince is very competitive and value for money. Julain, a very friendly young guide konws very well on where is the best place to see the northern light. He is professional and taking a lot of photos for us giving us a fantastic northern",
          "We had a fantastic Aurora Borealis experience on Sept 20 & 21. Thanks to our guide Julian who led us to the best locations for viewing. In addition to being a knowledgeable guide with passion, he is a professional photographer. He took amazing pictures for us with a background",
          "It was so cloudy in yellowknife. But Julian led us to good place to see aurora. 1 day later, when i visited aurora village, they said that they could not see aurora yesterday. Julian is so friendly and gave me a tip to take photo with aurora. If i go yellowknife again, I",
          "I really like this tour. Julian, the owner is so kind and I think he is a kind of perfect guy. He can take many pictures of us beautifully. He knows everything about Yellowknife and once he took us to local fish shop and we made a dinner together. After that, we also enjoyed",
          "We paid for 2-night aurora viewing together with winter clothing on Feb 7 and 8. The local guide, Julian, is so nice, kind, and talkative. He picked us up from our accommodation in the city center and drove us to the viewpoint. During the first night, we arrived there at around",
          "The \"private cabin\" advertised on their website looks like it was built last week and could fall over any second! The tour was very disorganized. They picked us up from our hotel 20 minutes late, then we had to wait at another hotel for 30 minutes. The drive was almost an hour,",
          "My and my girlfriend booked 2 nights with Julian for an Aurora tour. It was one of the best experiences of my life. Staff was friendly and professional. They take pictures for you.",
          "The tour was amazing!!!!! Julian is a great guide and owner. He was always checking to make sure everything was okay. He took pictures for us and sent them to us the next day for free. Very nice touch when you don't have a professsional camera. Price was the best in town",
          "Day 1 : Julian mixed flight details up he thought it was a pm pick up not a am so no airport transport as stated. JULIAN JUST SAID \" Get a cab your staying at Yellow knife inn \" cab cost $23.we booked a queen suite when arrived at Inn no room was ready had to wait 2hrs then",
          "While planning a visit to Yellowknife we booked an aurora viewing tour online. Communication via email to setup the trip was great. On the day of our tour (December 31st, 2015) Julian called and asked if he could pick us up early (8pm). The aurora forecast was very favorable",
          "What a fantastic company to deal with. Julian Jerry and Jeoff the three Js as we like to think of them took care of us and any questions we had and we do like to ask ... sorry quys. Love the fact that we got a chance to sit and talk. Too find out more about the traditions of",
          "I had a fantastic time. The team took us to places with the least amount of cloud cover (it was a bit of a challenge to find some that evening) Once there, they help us with our camera settings - which was a life saver for me, a person who always used the \"auto\" setting! I"

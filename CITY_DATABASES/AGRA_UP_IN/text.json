        "wiki": "Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.\nIt had been used by the early mughal rulers. The Fort stands on an ancient site and was traditionally known as Badalgarh. It was captured by Ghaznavi for some time but in the 15th century A.D. the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487\u20131517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556\u20131605).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli (step well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri's general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.\n\nRealising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, Abul Fazl, recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in Rajasthan. Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.It was only during the reign of Akbar's grandson, Shah Jahan, that the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the beautiful Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from white marble. He destroyed some of the earlier buildings inside the fort to make his own.The fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 Years. In the fort, they built the Ratan Singh ki haveli. The fort was invaded and captured by the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century. Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at Third Battle of Panipat by Ahmad Shah Abdali in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next decade. Finally Mahadji Shinde took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, in 1803.The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857, which caused the end of the British East India Company's rule in India, and led to a century of direct rule of India by Britain.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe 380,000 m2 (94-acre) fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river Yamuna and its walls are seventy feet high. Double ramparts have massive circular bastions at intervals, with battlements, embrasures, machicolations and string courses. Four gates were provided on its four sides, one Khizri gate opening on to the river.Two of the fort's gates are notable: the \"Delhi Gate\" and the \"Lahore Gate.\" The Lahore Gate is also popularly also known as the \"Amar Singh Gate,\" for Amar Singh Rathore.The monumental Delhi Gate, which faces the city on the western side of the fort, is considered the grandest of the four gates and a masterpiece of Akbar's time. It was built circa 1568 both to enhance security and as the king's formal gate, and includes features related to both. It is embellished with intricate inlay work in white marble. A wooden drawbridge was used to cross the moat and reach the gate from the mainland; inside, an inner gateway called Hathi Pol (\"Elephant Gate\") \u2013 guarded by two life-sized stone elephants with their riders \u2013 added another layer of security. The drawbridge, slight ascent, and 90-degree turn between the outer and inner gates make the entrance impregnable. During a siege, attackers would employ elephants to crush a fort's gates. Without a level, straight run-up to gather speed, however, that thing is prevented by this layout.Because the Indian military (the Parachute Brigade in particular) is still using the northern portion of the Agra Fort, the Delhi Gate cannot be used by the public. Tourists enter via the Amar Singh Gate.The site is very important in terms of architectural history. Abul Fazal recorded that five hundred buildings in the beautiful designs of Bengal and Gujarat were built in the fort. Some of them were demolished by Shah Jahan to make way for his white marble palaces. Most of the others were destroyed by the British troops of East India Company between 1803 and 1862 for raising barracks. Hardly thirty Mughal buildings have survived on the south-eastern side, facing the river, such as the Delhi Gate and Akbar Gate and one palace \u2013 \"Bengali Mahal\".\nAkbar Darwazza (Akbar Gate) was renamed Amar Singh Gate by Shah Jahan.  The gate is similar in design to the Delhi Gate. Both are built of red sandstone.The Bengali Mahal is built of red sandstone and is now split into Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal.\n\n\n== Other Historic sites inside Agra Fort ==\nJahangir's Hauz (tank) A.D. 1610: This monolithic tank (hauz) was used for bathing. It is 5 feet high, 8 feet in diameter and 25 feet in circumference. On the external side of the rim there is an inscription in Persian which mentions it as 'Hauz-e-Jahangir'. It was first discovered near the courtyard of Akbar's palace. In A.D. 1843 and later it was placed in front of Diwan-e-Am. In 1862, it was shifted to public garden (Company Bagh) where it suffered much damage. Later, Sir John Marshall brought it back to Agra Fort and placed there. Due to this hauz, the palace became famous as Jahangiri Mahal though it is part of Akbar's Bengali mahal.\nShahjahani Mahal (1628-35 A.D.): It is situated in between the white marble Khas Mahal and the red stone Jahangiri Mahal and is set transitionally in between these two residential complexes of two different ages. It is the earliest attempt of the Mughal emperor Shahjahan to convert an existing red stone building in accordance with his taste and it was his earliest palace in Agra Fort. It has a large hall, side rooms and an octagonal tower on the riverside. The skeletal construction of brick and red stone was all redone with a thick white stucco plaster and colourfully painted in floral designs. The whole palace once glistened white like white marble. On the face towards the Khas Mahal, is a large spacious white marble dalan, composed of five arches, supported on double pillars and protected externally by a chhajja. Its closed western bay houses, the Ghaznin gate, Babur's baoli and a well are situated beneath it.\nGhaznin Gate (1030 A.D.): The gate originally belonged to the tomb of Mahmud Ghaznavi at Ghazni. It was brought from there by the British in1842. Lord Ellenborough, the Governor General, in historic proclamation claimed, that these were the sandalwood gates of Somnath which Mahmud had taken to Ghazni in 1025, and the British had thus avenged an insult of 800 years back. This false claim was made just to win the goodwill of the Indian people. The gate is, in fact, made of local deodar wood of Ghazni and not of sandalwood. The style of decoration bears no resemblance to ancient Gujrati woodwork. There is also an Arabic inscription carved on the upper part. It mentions Mahmud with his epithets. Sir John Marshall had placed here a notice-board which described the whole episode about this gate. It is 16.5 feet high and 13.5 feet broad and its wight is about half a ton. It is made up of geometrical, hexagonal and octagonal panels which have been fixed, one with the help of the other into the frame without rivets. The idea to restore it at Somnath was ultimately given up and the gate was abandoned. Since then, it is stored in a room.\nJahangir's Chain of Justice (C. 1605 A.D.): This is the spot where Mughal king Jahangir instituted his 'chain of justice'(Zanjir-i-Adl) in c. 1605 A.D. He records in his memoir that after his accession, the first order he gave, \"was for the fastening up of the chain of justice so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practice hypocrisy, the aggrieved might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract my attention.\" It was made of pure gold. It was 80' in length and had 60 bells. Its weight was 1 Quintal. One end was fastened to the battlements of the Shah-Burj and the other end to a stone post on the bank of the river. This is not a myth. Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins personally saw it. It has also been depicted in a contemporary painting made in 1620 A.D. This was a way to redress the grievances of the people who could approach the king, the highest judicial authority of the empire, directly, without fee, fear or formality for immediate relief. There was no distinction of caste or creed or between poor and rich. Jahangir's administration of justice 'Adl-i-Jahangir' became a legend in Indian history.\nThe Muthamman Burj (Shah-Burj) & Jharokha (1632 -1640 A.D.): This beautiful palace surmounts the largest bastion of Agra Fort on the riverside, facing the East. It was originally built of red stone by Akbar who used it for jharokha darshan, as well as for sun worship, everyday at sunrise. Jehangir also used it as jharokha, as is faithfully shown in his painting made in 1620. He also instituted his 'Adl-i-Janjir'(the chain of justice) on its south side. Owing to its octagonal plan, it was called 'Muthamman Burj'. It has also been mentioned as 'Shah-Burj'(the imperial or king's tower) by Persian historians and foreign travellers. Its name jasmine tower or 'Samman-Burj' as recorded by the contemporary historian Lahauri is a misnomer. It was rebuilt with white marble by Shah Jehan around 1632-1640 A.D. He also used it for jharokha darshan which was an indispensable a Mughal institution as was 'Durbar'. It is an octagonal building, five external sides of which make a dalan overlooking the river. Each side has pillar and bracket openings, the eastern most side projects forward and accommodates a jharokha majestically. On the western side of this palace is a spacious dalan with Shah-Nasin (alcoves). A shallow water-basin (kunda) is sunk in its pavement. It is profusely inlaid. This dalan opens on a court which has a chabutara projected by a jali screen, on its northern side, a series of rooms leading to Shish Mahal on its western side; and a colonnade (dalan) with a room attached to its on the southern side. It is, thus, a large complex entirely built of white marble. It has deep niches on the walls, to break the monotony. Dados have repetitive stylized creepers inlaid on borders and carved plants on the centre pillars, brackets and lintels also bear exquisitely inlaid designs and it is one of the most ornamented buildings of Shah Jehan. This palace is directly connected to the Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas Mahal, and other palaces. and it was from here that the Mughal emperor governed the whole country. This burj offers full and majestic view of Taj Mahal and Shah Jehan spent eight years (1658-1666 A.D.) of his imprisonment in this complex, and it is said that he died here. His body was taken by boat to the Taj Mahal and buried.\nShish Mahal (A.D. 1631-40): It was built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan as a part of summer palace. Its most distinctive feature is glass mosaic work done on its walls and ceiling. These glass pieces have high mirror quality which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways in semi-dark interior. The glass was imported from Haleb of Syria. Shahjahan built glass palace also at Lahore and Delhi, but this is the finest of all.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Agra Fort won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2004. India Post issued a stamp to commemorate this event.\nThe Agra Fort plays a key role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery The Sign of the Four, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\nThe Agra Fort was featured in the music video for Habibi Da, a hit song of Egyptian pop star Hisham Abbas.\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj came to Agra in 1666 as per the \"Treaty of Purandar (1665)\" entered into with Mirza Raje Jaisingh to meet Aurangzeb in the Diwan-i-Khas. In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. Insulted, he stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nJama Masjid\nFatehpur Sikri\nLahore Fort\nRed Fort\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAgra Fort (1983), Uttar Pradesh \u2013 Archaeological Survey of India\nAgra Fort map (from Murray's travel guide, 1909)\n Geographic data related to Agra Fort at OpenStreetMap",
        "brit": "Agra Fort, also called Red Fort,  large 16th-century fortress of red sandstone located on the Yamuna River in the historic city of Agra, west-central Uttar Pradesh, north-central India. It was established by the Mughal emperor Akbar and, in its capacity as both a military base and a royal residence, served as the seat of government when the Mughal capital was in Agra. The structure, a contemporary of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s Tomb in Delhi (about 125 miles [200 km] to the northwest), reflects the architectural grandeur of the Mughal reign in India. The fort complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.Agra Fort (Red Fort), Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.Frederick M. AsherAgra Fort, Agra, IndiaAgra Fort (Red Fort), Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.Agra Fort gateAmar Singh Gate, Agra Fort (Red Fort), Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.\u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)Situated on the site of earlier fortifications, it lies on the right bank of the Yamuna River and is connected to another of Agra\u2019s renowned monuments, the Taj Mahal (downstream, around a bend in the Yamuna), by a swath of parkland and gardens. The fort was commissioned by Akbar in 1565 and reportedly took eight years to construct. The walls of the roughly crescent-shaped structure have a circumference of about 1.5 miles (2.5 km), rise 70 feet (21 metres) high, and are surrounded by a moat. There are two access points in the walls: the Amar Singh Gate facing south (now the only means in or out of the fort complex) and the Delhi Gate facing west, the original entrance, which is richly decorated with intricate marble inlays. Many structures within the walls were added later by subsequent Mughal emperors, notably Shah Jah\u0101n and Jah\u0101ng\u012br. The complex of buildings\u2014reminiscent of Persian- and Timurid-style architectural features\u2014forms a city within a city.Among the major attractions in the fort is Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s Palace (Jah\u0101ng\u012bri Mahal), built by Akbar as a private palace for his son Jah\u0101ngir. It is the largest residence in the complex. The Pearl Mosque (Moti Masjid), constructed by Shah Jah\u0101n, is a tranquil and perfectly proportioned structure made entirely of white marble. The Hall of Private Audience (Diwan-i-Khas) was used for receiving distinguished visitors. The famous Peacock Throne was once kept there, before Aurangzeb took it to Delhi. Near the Hall of Private Audience stands the tall Octagonal Tower (Musamman Burj), the residence of Shah Jah\u0101n\u2019s favourite empress, Mumt\u0101z Ma\u1e25al. In the Hall of Public Audience (Diwan-i-\u02bfAm), the emperor would listen to public petitions and meet state officials. The elegant marble walls of the Khas Mahal (the emperor\u2019s private palace) were once adorned with flowers depicted by precious gems. Located to its northeast is the splendid Palace of Mirrors (Sheesh Mahal), its walls and ceilings inlaid with thousands of small mirrors. The structure\u2019s two dazzling chambers were probably used as baths and possibly as a boudoir by the queens.Agra Fort: Jah\u0101ng\u012br's PalaceJah\u0101ng\u012br's Palace (Jah\u0101ng\u012bri Mahal) inside Agra Fort (Red Fort), Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.\u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)Agra Fort: Hall of Public AudienceThe Hall of Public Audience (Diwan-i-\u02bfAm) in Agra Fort (Red Fort), Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.\u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)Agra Fort: Octagonal TowerInterior room of the marble Octagonal Tower (Musamman Burj) in Agra Fort (Red Fort), Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.\u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)In addition to its other functions, the fort also served as a prison for Shah Jah\u0101n.

          "We liked this Fort better than the Red Fort, but both were amazing. If you\u2019re in Agra, definitely take the time to stop for a visit.",
          "Following our visit to Taj Mahal our guide took us to the Agra Fort. Again Arif was most knowledgeable and gave us a super tour ..It is important to visit the Fort in conjunction with the Taj to understand the history of it and what a wonderful place this is too see",
          "If u see the monument as a building, you will get to know vastness and grandeur of mugal era. But if you are a imaginative kind of person, u will witness the portrait of entire mugal clan. It was home to all mugals but less imprints of two of them. Akbar who built his own fort",
          "This is kind of a place that looks good, but if you have seen forts before then it's just another fort for you. However, if you have a guide, then he/she will uncover very interesting stories about different parts of the fort - so the place is a good to go if you have a good",
          "We had already visited a number of forts on our tour by the time we got to this one, but the sheer scale and workmanship on display is different and impressive in every single one, so don\u2019t get into the way of thinking \u2018oh, no, another Indian fort\u2019. Go and admire the work of men",
          "It seems that we all visit Agra for the Taj Mahal and that's fair enough but please don't skip the fort. It's a truly amazing building with an equally amazing history. Also, it's absolutely massive and offers great views on the Taj Mahal which is a nice bonus. As for many places",
          "An amazing structure, or series of structures, but it does require a knowledgeable guide to understand much of it. For those that love fortresses it is a castle, with still intact defences, crenulations, and guard towers still in place. For those that can only imagine the",
          "Apparently only 30% of the site is open to the public, but even then what you get to see is a massively impressive structure. This is another 'must see' in Agra, fantastic architecture with distant views of the Taj Mahal.",
          "AGRA FORT is the one of the must visit for travellers or local people. You could enjoy the luxury of the palace and could see Taj Mahal from here. I am so impressive with the Palace of the King of India( in the past).",
          "Besides the Taj Mahal this is a MUST SEE in Agra. The sheer size and layout for a 400 yr old building makes today's architects look amateurish !!!! That it is a functioning building used by the army explains a lot about it's design. Please allow at least 2-3 hours to appreciate",
          "A wonderful surprise since all the focus (at least ours) was on the main attraction that is the Taj Mahal. Crowdy, but you still enjoy the beauty of the site and the history present everywhere...if only those walls could tell their stories. A must see.",
          "This place is so much more than a fort. It was also a palace. It is spectacular. There are also some great views from there. It will take at least an hour and a half to see it, but it is really worth it. For any of the forts in India, it is a good idea to have a good pair",
          "This is the home of the Shah Jahan, who built the Taj Mahal for his wife. It\u2019s right across from the Taj Mahal so he could see it. A beautiful fort in its own right. Partially (80%) closed off as it\u2019s still in use by the Indian Army but what you see is really amazing! We enjoyed",
          "This was the first fort I visited in India, and at the time I thought it was good. However, after later visiting Jaipur's Amber fort and Jodhpur's Mehrangarh fort, I realised how this pales in comparison. The part open to visitors is smaller than those, it's a less impressive",
          "We spent a couple of hours wandering around this first, and really enjoyed ourselves. We skipped the offer of being guided and really enjoyed finding our way about and learning (via the lonely planet walking tour) about the fort. It is very well managed, and the site is",
          "I did the once in a life time tour of Taj Mahal, with Subash. I wanted it to be special and he delivered on all grounds . No queuing, vip status , and the best pictures , to preserve my memory. Rajesh my chauffeur is the best ! Made me feel like royalty. Highly recommend this ,",
          "Actually this was the king\u2019s Shah Jahan and wife Mumtaz, palace .This is the king that built the Taj Mahal for memory of his wife in the 17 century. Very nice palace , only 20% open to the public . Great view of Taj Mahal from distance. Take 1 hour to explore. Entrance 8 USDLRS.",
          "The history behind the fort and that view is enough to make anyone\u2019s heart ache. Go here before the Taj Mahal for the first glimpse. It\u2019s worth it!",
          "We found this beautiful fort very interesting, we would recommend having a guide or reading up on the history beforehand.",
          "After the Taj Mahal, the Agra Red Fort is the second big attraction in this dusty city. My driver Sharma arranged a local guide for me, who also led me through the Taj. Also thanks to Israr Ahmad who knows many details that would not have been noticed, it was a worthy visit. The",
          "By itself, it might not reach the level of a \"must see\", but if you are looking to fill out the day, going to the fort after the Taj is a nice option.",
          "Worth a visit. Interesting place. Beautiful building. The views are spectacular. A guide would be useful in order to fully appreciate the history of it. Our friend lost her phone in it and went to speak to security and they had it. She had left it in the cafe and it had been",
          "Visited, enjoyed and liked it. It is moghul palace w/ mansions located on big garden walled by a fort. It is characteristic by red stoned used, marble and stone carving craftsmanship.",
          "You guessed it, another Unesco world heritage site. It is a beautiful red sand stone structure. On a good clear day you can see the Taj mahal which is at a distance of a couple of miles. Our chirpy guide let us know that the Emperor Shah Jahan who built the Taj Mahal was locked",
          "Not very nicely kept. Could have been more cleaner. Wish they restored it adequately. Its beautiful but losing it's charm.",
          "Visited this afort the day after the one in Delhi. Nice if you have not been to one before, very similar to Delhi. But remarcable in its construction and being preserved all this time is a challenge. It's well laid out and signposted accordingly. Just beware of the monkeys they",
          "Although only part is open to the public it is worth a visit. Get the guide to show you the trick view of the Taj Mahal through the lattice window.",
          "this fort is a classic example of moghul architecture, it is built by indian and moghul styles. it need some more care and govt of India and ASI should also take more care",
          "It's one of the best place to visit in Agra it's more interested to see the sunset from the Fort you gave beautiful view of Taj Mahal!",
          "This is a delight! The history alone is enough to blow your mind. Built initially by the grandfather of Emperor Shah Jahan who built the Taj Mahal, renovated big time by the emperor who was later imprisoned for years in it by a 3rd son, in a room facing the Taj Mahal. It is",
          "Second best attraction in Agra. We manage to get a really cheap tour inside so don\u2019t grab one at the entrance as they will try to rip you off. A lot to learn and see in this place... we really enjoyed our visit.",
          "Agra Fort was amazing. It contains an area of 9; acres. It is a walled city. From here we could see Taj Mahal. It is a historical fort in the city of Agra, India. It was the residence of emperors of the Mughal dynasty until 1683 when the capital moved from Agra to Delhi. Our",
          "An impressive construction. Red stone and white marble. A little bit crowded in the winter. 600 rupee entrance for foreigner.",
          "This palace--still a working army fort--is a must-see on any trip to Agra. About 25% of the fort is open to the public, but it's a fascinating display of two different eras of Mughal architecture. There is the red sandstone palace, and the newer, white marble palace. All of",
          "This fort is quite beautiful and in amazing shape. The stonework is stunning. The fort is large and accommodated many uses. I recommend visiting the fort with a local guide.",
          "Agra Fort was built in the year 1573 under the reign of Akbar \u2013 one of the greatest Mughal Emperors. It took more than 4000 workers and eight years of hardship to complete the fort. Knowing the significance of its location, Akbar built the fort to make it the main residence of",
          "Fort is big and beautiful and gives glimpse of life style of mughal emperors. About 25% of the whole area is open for public while rest is still used by Army. View of Taj Mahal from Agar Fort is also very beautiful.",

          "A very large fort in Agra. The fort is huge, but much of it is not open to the public. It is a great place and takes 2-3 hours to see it all. Very difficult to find everywhere without a guide, but we prefer to do things ourselves. Worth a visit, if very crowded with tourists.",
          "Gives a good long distance view of the Taj as well, the locals keep the maintenance up to a great standard, magnificent architecture and a step back in history.",
          "Really nice place and highly recommended. This is where the king who built the Taj Mahal lived, for part of the year. The taj cost so much money and he wanted to build a black taj across the water and his son locked him up here after taking his throne. He lived in prison for 8",
          "Positives: Beautiful architecture mainly built with red sandstone. Later additions included buildings built with marble. Lovely views across the river towards the Taj Mahal. Negatives: Only 20% open to the public. Verdict: Well worth a visit. Recommended.",
          "this agra fort is quite big in size.when you enter.again,security check first.inside in my opinion has not much to see.at one corner you can see taj mahal from a distance,quite nice.the rest has nothing impress to me.if you have too much free time, go there.nothing to miss",
          "This is the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. It was built by the great Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1565. It a complex with notable buildings such as halls of public audience and private audience. The",
          "A small part is open to public and not worth the visit in my opinion. As there is not much to do around Taj Mahal it still is an option.",
          "I've been there the day after visiting the Taj to complete the history learning in site. Very recommendable to understand all the history. Hate the British devastation did here, but usual from the pirates of the world. I've made the tour with an excellent local guide from Taj",
          "good services are given by them plz try it its amazing and fabulous , i recommend for you its amazing",
          "This is also one of the nice place after Taj mahal to visit. Old and historical fort. Many tourist came here after visiting Taj mahal.",
          "Agra fort .it's beautiful place to know about history of Mughals . tickets is very reasonable for Indians 50 rs only . 16 points in Agra fort to see .",
          "The bulk of the Fort is occupied by the army but the 10% plus that you can visit is plenty. The fortifications from the moat to the double wall and so on makes it formidable. The accommodations of the Ruling family along with the fascinating history are splendid even if some",
          "I came to Agra Fort late on November afternoon and overall I was impressed with the architecture. The fort did not have good signposting within it to show the direction of travel and as a westerners we did receive lots of attention from domestic tourists, some of it unpleasant.",
          "Wonderful heritage and architectural marvelous but indian govt not taking care of it. Entrance is a mess, lot of beggars and uncontrollable crowd! If only they maintain well ....",
          "HIghly recommend you see this fort before you see the Taj Mahal. Definitely have a guide--either one you get at the fort or one you pay ahead of time. If you arrange for one earlier, then they are able to assist with getting your tickets and showing you where you need to be to",
          "Impressive fort in its own right overlooking the Taj Mahal - needs to be visited to see the architecture and work that went into building it - stunning!",
          "I absolutely loved Agra Fort. I would even go as far as too say its better than the Taj Mahal. There is a lot more to see here and it feels like it has more history to it. Bonus, you get good views of the Taj Mahal from here. Plus, it doesn't seem as busy.",
          "Go with a guide if possible..they bring it to life. Much history to be gained. Fascinating building.",
          "Myself, my wife and my elder brother visited this well preserved monument and there is so much to see and know about this fort. It is well worth visiting this place at any cost.",
          "Very significant historical site with amazing fortifications and a wonderful set of royal palaces. There are actually two. The old one was remodeled by Shah Jagan before he built the magnificent white marble structures. Some were not open but sufficient were and the crowds",
          "The overall trip was excellent, a little costly for the amount of time and places visited. Agra Fort visit had to be adjusted and we had to skip lunch. The guide who was very good took us to an art shop which was not needed and we wasted time there. Otherwise, the views of Taj",
          "The first standout on Agra Fort is that it is large and beautiful. Between the contrast of the white marble and the red sandstone it is an imposing building. Once you get through the fortification it opens up into vast courtyards and palaces that are splendid to observe. Bring",
          "This place is truly stunning! The history and the architecture is truly breathtaking and the details are incredible.",
          "Excellent architecture. Easy access from railway station. Tickets can be purchased online in advance. Ample parking.",
          "We went early in the morning, as it was still too foggy to go see Taj at sunrise. This is a massive structure and although not as iconic as the Taj, still worth a visit. Watch out for the monkeys. One almost got my cell phone. Good views of the Taj from the fort (if not",
          "We visited with my family(Wife and 2 kids) on Christmas 2019 and it was excellent to be honest and lived up to expectations. Mughal architecture surely needs to be appreciated and agra fort is well maintained. However agra town as such is not clean and needs improvement . Even",
          "Very interesting fort. Sadly half of it is inaccessible due to it being used by the military. Still worth a visit.",
          "I visit agra fort in, December it's amazing and very beautiful. It's very good historical place for visit. This was very enjoyable visit. We hire a guide who explained what we are seeing.",
          "If you are here, you should probably go to the fort. Interesting history and architecture. A little more peaceful than the other Agra site!",
          "This is an architecturally beautiful structure - like a walled city. From the lovely gardens through the ramparts & gates you will see beautiful artistically designed walls and inlays and cutouts. This was a very enjoyable visit - we did have a guide who explained what we were",
          "The trip to the fort was a journey down the history of India. Every pillar had a story to tell. You can even see the Taj Mahal from it on a clear day.",
          "The planning and architecture of the fort is awesome. It is must visit spot, if you are visiting Agra.",
          "A nice location to see Taj Mahal. 550inr with Taj Mahal ticket. Easy to find location. Good place for pictures.",
          "Well positioned between Taj and Jaipur. Beautiful. We had a guide and that made a lot of difference.",
          "I wouldn't go here for this site alone. Get it in a package with The Taj Mahal. Call ahead to see if it's open as it closes somewhat early.",
          "This fort is very impressive and worth a visit. I have visited both Red Fort in Delhi and Agra Fort I would recommend Agra fort over Red Fort Delhi both inside and out are impressive and much better than Delhi Red Fort this can be seen from outside and the inside is not so good.",
          "Spent a couple of hours been shown around the fort by our guide Sakhander. Very interesting and very beautiful place and considering you only get to see 20% of it as the Indian army occupy the rest, quite large. Barter hard with your guide, never accept their first price.",
          "More impressive than we had imagined. After seeing the Taj Mahal the day before, we hadn't expected to be as impressed with the Fort as we were. Well worth a visit",
          "The fort has its own history and link to the Taj and we found having a guide extremely valuable for this experience. The fort is an impressive structure and a formidable defensive position.Despite it still being a working military base and therefore restricting access to the",
          "We only went to Agra for the Taj so we weren't expecting much but we had a good guide at the Agra Fort that shed a new light on the love story behind the Taj and a little into the Moghul dynasty. People have ruined it as they have scratched all over the walls.",
          "Its a must visit place. What this fort looks even today makes you only wonder as to how this fort would have looked in its full glory. It makes you marvel at the brilliant architect and engineering.",
          "Rajasthan is all about forts and this was the least interesting one in my trip (Agra is actually in Uttar Pradesh, east of Rajasthan). In my opinion, Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur has more beautiful interior and stunning features, Chittor Fort is huge and high, offering great views",
          "This is another stunning piece of architecture. It is a shame that not much of it can be explored. Would love to go in the rooms and see more of the beauty inside this fort.",
          "Interesting visit. Grand design. Despite the haze/fog/smog we saw the Taj in the distance. Magic. Worth the visit! Unesco World Heritage site.",
          "Agra Fort was the first stop on our tour and an excellent beginning to our trip of a lifetime. The rain had come a few days before our visit so the smog had all but gone and it was from here we got our first glimpse of the landscape and the Taj Mahal. The fort is another must .",
          "We have spent 2 weeks in India with a tour group. We have seen a lot of forts and palaces - Agra Fort is one of them. To be honest, it is not that special compared to the others. Only a small portion of the fort is opened for the tourist. You really don't see much. You can",
          "Agra Fort definitely worth visiting! Really well maintained and interesting to wander around. It exceeded our expectations. We did not use a guide but I imagine this would be worthwhile.",
          "The fort is epic and shows the history and beauty of Indian architecture on a scale and size that leaves one in awe. The fort is busy but well maintained. I can only imagine what it was like to be a mogul back in the 15th century. We had a fantastic guide that knew the history",
          "Better than expected. Considering that you can visit only about 20% of it, it is huge. Plan enough time for the visit: minimum 2 hours",
          "A pleasant surprise. Definitely hire a guide to make this tour worthwhile. Very impressive architecture and deceptively large palace. A must, to put on your sightseeing list!",
          "Definitely worth a look. Much bettert then Taj Mahal! Can see most articles. Child friendly and good for a walk around the building.",
          "Agra Fort gives you a nice glimpse into life of Mughal Kings & their way of living. The Meena Bazar, Deewan-a-aam or Deewan-a-khas inside it, help you understand how the life was around 400 years ago. Take help of a guide available there, so that you can understand the history",
          "Spent the morning at the Agra Fort and was amazed at the history and beauty of the structure. The structure is well preserved, allowing you to walk around and explore. It was interesting to explore the area where Shah Jahan was kept prisoner by his son. Such a beautiful white",
          "Beautiful and marvellous architecture, it is situated near to the Taj Mahal.Public communication is available to reach this place.It is a place of historical importance. History lovers will love this place. Better to take a guide to know details",
          "This is an enormous Mughal fort. Currently, only 20% is available to be toured, the rest is used by the Indian Army. The fort has a few different architectural styles and some really interesting stories. Make sure you have a guide. Most tourists visit the Taj Mahal in the",
          "Seems to be the only other old building that walking near the edge of isn't taking your life in your hands as they are crumbling away. Taj M is the other. Great gardens and fascinating stories of times past.",
          "I visited Agra with my friends in June this year. I visited there all historic places. I liked the Red Fort very much. It is relatively less crowded city than Delhi. There are many nearby places to visit. Bus & Train Connectivity is very good for all places in India. Flight are",
          "Only ~ 20% is for tourists, 80% for the Indian Army, you will not see to much. You can have a look from outside. Almost all forts in India are mainly for soldiers, but offered as tourist place - not nice.",
          "There is nothing better than walking in the laps of glorious history that tells so many tales to enchant and mesmerize you. The fort was built in 16 century by Mughal Emperors Akbar and they kept it their capital till mid 17th century before moving to Delhi. It can be called as",
          "Had visited the Agra for Tajmahal and need to visit Agra fort to spend remaining time after Tajmahal visit. it is just a normal fort where king/queen leave.",
          "We have been travelling around North India for a month and have seen a few Forts. My expectations for the Agra Fort were high. Unfortunately there are a lot of areas closed off for repairs which meant that there wasn\u2019t many places to explore like at other Forts. This is still a",
          "We visited this fort on an afternoon, after travelling from Delhi to Agra. Our tour company arranged a tour guide for us, and he was with us during our Agra days. I recommend you come with someone and make these arrangements ahead of time, as it could be overwhelming to be",
          "Great fort although I'd say 75% of the fort is inaccessible which is a bit of a let down but still good for visiting and taking photos. On a hazy day you can't see the Taj though!",
          "We visited Agra from Jaipur. It is roughly 220km by road. Visited Agra fort. It\u2019s mesmerising!! Beautiful red stone structure with Mughal and Persian architecture. Information about different parts within the fort is missing. It would be advisable to read about the fort before",
          "Not a dominating hilltop fort like say Jodhpur or Gwalior but a significant presence nonetheless. A substantial entrance leads into the first court-yard, from there you continue to a number of other buildings, internal courtyards and gardens to explore. One of the most",
          "This is good to do after the Taj Mahal. Again, I would advise booking a guide in advance to explain the fort and who built/lived there.",
          "Well, you simply have to look from the Balcony to the Taj, just like the king did all the time. In itself a splendid piece of architecture, if well explained it gives good insight into the history of the time and the colonial time. mot far away from the Taj, so can be easily",
          "Enough remains of this walled city to connect you to the early mogul Emperors. It is hard to imagine it in its hayday when it was a working palace complex Well worth the visit",
          "Agra was the capital of the Mughal dynasty for years. There are many grand mansions, palaces and courtrooms in the fortification. I found this Diwan-E-Aam or the Court for the Commons, notable for its plainness and balance. The distant view of Taj from one of the galleries",
          "Nice place to visit but due to so large area you have at least half day free for the whole area visit ...nice ..",
          "Beautiful red sandstone fort - terrific stonework and carvings. Take a guide who will tell you the stories associated with this fort and especially the imprisonment of Shah Jahan (the builder of the Taj Mahal) by his son in a tower overlooking the mausoleum for his wife. A",

          "The Red Fortress of Agra is a must see historical masterpiece. Built on the other side of the river from the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum for his favourite wife, who also bore him 13 children, and died in childbirth, from his wing of the fortress,",
          "While visiting the Mehtabh Bagh had to cross over to the other side where the Agra Fort was situated. The Fort has a great profile:It looks magnificent from outside. Good to study about it or take a guide to delve deeper in the past. See the Taj from this angle too.",
          "I visited this place with a guide. I would recommend using one otherwise you will see the building and surrounds but miss out on some pretty good information that makes it more worthwhile. You can see the Taj Mahal from within through the windows. Unfortunately my day was very",
          "Although in the shadow of other forts and the Taj Mahal this fort is worth doing. There are excellent view points to see the Taj Mahal and some excellent sites in the fort.",
          "This is a lovely building to visit and the history really does give you a greater insight in to the Taj Mahal visit and the reasoning behind the build. Fascinating history of family.",
          "This is the place the emperor Shah Jahan who commissioned the Taj Mahal was imprisoned. Not as big or impressive as some similar places visited on our tour, but still an interesting place. Worth a visit",
          "The fort was really lovely and had so many interesting buildings and palaces to see. It just kept going on and on with each one a little different than the next. The views out over the river with the Taj Mahal in the background were great too.",
          "If you start your trip to India in Delhi you will already be familiar with Akbar by the time you get to Agra but leaving aside the truly stunning architecture what is before you is a fascinating insight into the courtly life of an emperor and his family and courtiers. Learn",
          "Agra fort is great in architecture and it's history. There are many buildings. They are luxurious inside and certainly look glorious in historic time. We can see Taj mahal from here.",
          "Amazing marvel and amazing building with great view of Taj Mahal. A must see for everyone. Well maintained with great effort by the staff to keep it near and clean",
          "There is so much history here that I didn't know about prior to my tour, and I am very glad this was included as one of our tour stops. There is limited access as some of the Fort is still active with military personnel. The architecture is fantastic, as I've found with many",
          "Do not confuse with the Red Fort at Dehli! The hard red sandstone is the only thing in common. This is a monument to the 16th century and architectural features abound. Look at the white marble parts inside and marvel at the amazing craftmanship.",
          "Only the red part is open, because the marble area is where the Indian army settles. This is the old palace of the Mughal Dynasty. You can find where the king judged people and international businessmen\u2019s cases. The gate of the performance hall shows symbols of multiple",
          "Outstanding Mughal architecture both inside and outside. We had a good guide who was very knowledgeable and made our visit extremely interesting. The gardens are beautifully laid out.",

          "Just another amazing place to visit. You could spend hours wondering around. It is so big you can get lost! A lot of history too. It's the following of the Taj Mahal. To many people trying to sell you anything - to many guides too (inside&outside). It's overwhelming and",
          "We booked a ticket later in the afternoon when it was cooling down, great decision as it was cooler and we saw the fort at sunset and lit up at night. Fantastic fort but not a quick visit as so vast. Amazing place as incredible architecture and gardens.",
          "Absolutely Amazing! Went in November so the weather was perfect. Can even see the Taj Mahal from the fort.",
          "Beautiful place, we had the best guide who was so knowledgeable & friendly - I would suggest a guided tour for any would be visitor.",
          "May not look as good outside as some other forts but inside it\u2019s beautiful. Really worth a visit and you have great views of the Taj Mahal too!",
          "Another fantastic place to visit - so rich in history and craftsmanship. Our guide was great and we enjoyed out visit",
          "A massive red sandstone fort standing high above the town. Inside a number of beautiful palace buildings lived in by the ruling family and their entourage. A large and attractive site - a little crowded in places. Beware of touts at entrance.",

          "This wonderful red-stone fort is really a huge castle with a history that goes back over the ages. A guide is a must as the history and architecture is interesting and needs to be explained. It is incredibly impressive.",
          "A very interesting place our guide was very good with lots of information - not that I remember it all there was so much to take in.",
          "I came again to Agra Fort and believe me, in the second time also I could not see the entire Agra Fort. it is too big. It's giant. So much history is hidden in it.",
          "Only 20 % of Agra Fort is available for Vistors. Perfect view of Taj Mahal, from the red fort. The guide is required to understand the history of the Fort , don't pick the first guide you meet at Red fort and do bargain for the best rate.",
          "I really enjoyed learning the stories about the four generations of the family who built this fort. It's definitely worth getting a guide to help fill in the details.",
          "A world heritage site, it overlooks the wonderful Taj Mahal, and is the Fort where the Taj creator, Shah Jahan, was deposed and restrained by his son, Aurangzeb. It is rumoured that Shah Jahan died in Muasamman Burj, a tower with a marble balcony with a view of the Taj Mahal.",
          "This is a UNESCO heritage site built in red stone. If you have visited Fatehpur Sikri, you may skip to visit this place. The Mughal ruled from this fort for some time. Again this place has palace, rooms where Jahangir was kept under house arrest, a view of Taj Mahal. Most part",
          "This place is very big and requires decent amount of time to cover it's entirety. And quite significant portion is under Indian Army's control which Tourists are not permitted to visit unless you have some special permission or VVIP! Has many sections from various gardens,",
          "An interesting history of an important stronghold. Very well maintained. Allow several hours to take it all in.",
          "Without a guide to give perspective, this wouldn't be super impressive, with one it moves up a notch. Not strenuous, but it would have been great being a kid growing up here.",
          "Was pleasantly surprised by Agra Fort. I have already seen a number of forts throughout India but this was my favourite by far. Definitely worth checking out.",
          "This is a must visit attraction if you visit Agra. Only 20% of the fort is open to the public. The army occupies the rest of the fort. The history is fascinating. The buildings are magnificent and the interior would be even more so if the gold inlays had not been removed by the",
          "Simply stunning. Would recommend bringing a tour guide to truly understand the history of this monument.",
          "Agra Fort in Agra and Red Fort in Delhi have a similar architecture (Mughal I think, as it is also Muslim/Mongol). The Agra fort was built before that the Red fort, when Agra was still the capital of the empire.",
          "The fort dates to 1565 when the foundation stone was laid on the site of the existing ruined fort. It was constructed in red sandstone under the sponsorship of Akbar the Great, the third Mughal emperor who reigned from 1556 to 1605, and was completed in 1573. The marble palaces",
          "Went to Agra fort in Nov 2019. Really enjoyed the place. would recommend a guide it should not cost more than 200/- or 250/- rupees but bargain. Can get hot , carry a bottle of water .",
          "The marvel of a place that still exudes the power and majesty of the Maraja India then stripped of British greed. A place to visit absolutely",
          "I didn\u2019t expect that the fort is hiding the palace inside, made in the same kind of way as Taj Mahal. And the story is very interesting",
          "What an amazing building this is, absolutely steeped in history from being build by Akbar in the 1560\u2019s and his grandson Shah Jahan\u2019s input later down the line and his eventual death there. It was exceedingly busy when we visited so we did rush a little more than I might have",
          "Great place to visit and when you consider that it wasn't just a monument but an active fort & palace all that time ago. A wonderful external colour, large walls, 2 moats and then the intricate workmanship inside is all quite amazing. The water system used then is amazing &",
          "Magnificent structure and incredible history. So well preserved. We were with an organised tour so we were limited with where we could go but would have loved to have roamed and seen more. Its a must see.",
          "The Agra Fort is #2 in Agra on TripAdvisor. The Taj Majal is #1, and for good reason. The Taj is amazing. The fort is a 4 out of 5 because it's just that; very good. Certainly go and see the Agra Fort, and spend 2-3 hours. I believe that a section of the Fort is where the",
          "If you are in Agra you \u2018must\u2019 visit the Taj Mahal and Agra fort. Google some background information before you go. The buildings don\u2019t just look nice. There lies a nice a story in them!",
          "It was a great day to tour Agra Fort. The fort was amazing, such great history and a beautiful building.",
          "It's Massive... the only down side was the congested entrance but after that it's well spread out... lots of history is attached ...",
          "If you learn story of the dethroned king and see where he was imprisoned - it's worth seeing his view of the Taj in his old age. Not an awesome tourist attraction but something to do in Agra.",
          "Didn't expect that much with the fort but a very good experience visiting it! It has a very beatiful view of the Taj Mahal also, and t'he fortress conservation is very good.",
          "Large red Fort, lots of fab buildings, busy attraction. Worth visiting... Especially with a guide to provide you with the historic facts",
          "This a very impressive fort made of red sandstone built in the 1600 century has a long history of occupation.Once inside the main feature is the architecture which in some cases quite stunning especially the ceiling's and columns,a little restoration work was being carried out",
          "Better than Delhi fort. Guides in many languages not too expensive. Strongly recommend to get one as like in any Indian place if interest there is very little information.",
          "One of Agra most famous places. It's a really well maintained building and definitely the number two in Agra after Taj Mahal. If I remember right, the entrance fee is about 300 rupees for foreigners.",
          "Just go see it! You will not be disappointed. I would recommend a guide as they can show you so much more!",
          "This was the oldest fort in once upon a time when the Mughal king was there .. palace looks like not so maintained but charm is there....",
          "It was big crowd when I was there... Before your start reading review , IMPORTANT... Counter tickets are advisable , as in online you will not get both the tickets.. huge lines are there for entry and at the ticket counter window. Place is good to go and you may enjoy a lott if",
          "I guess you never get to remember enough of this forts history. It's my second visit and I learnt so much more with the guide. It's worth having one. It's a beautiful place and a must when in Agra.",
          "Do yourself a favor and hire a guide for this place. There was so much history and details about this fort that we discovered through our guide which made us appreciate the fort even more. It's quite impressive.",
          "What makes a visit here important, is it's connection to the history and story of the Taj Mahal. The Taj can be seen from the balcony that Shah Jahan used himself, to view his wife's monument. Recommend having a guide, as they will give you the history of the fort and ensure",
          "The Agra Fort is an interesting tourist attraction, and on a good day you get an amazing view of the Taj Mahal, but unfortunately there was a lot of pollution when we went so the Taj was barely visible. Unfortunately only a small percentage of the fort can be visited as the rest",
          "This place is another one of India\u2019s gems and there is a reason why it\u2019s on the Golden Triangle route. I would recommend getting a tour guide, don\u2019t pay more than 500 as you can get them cheaper. It\u2019s worth having a guide as there is a lot of fascinating history behind this",
          "This was an amazing place. We went there after visiting Tajmahal. Tajmahal can be seen from here as well. Shah Jahan was imprisoned here by his son for his madness like making another Tajmahal which was supposed to be black.",
          "beautiful buildings with an interesting history, always best to go with a guide to explain more about what you are looking at only downside is that the guy in the ticket booth short changed me by 1000 rupees - I wanted to pay by card but \"the machine is not working\" so I had to",
          "There are many forts in india,and this is one of the best with mogul architecture. If in agra and has time to see only few things,my suggestion will be agra fort and taj mahal.",
          "One of the best monument of India. Very beautiful architecture, well maintained by Govt of India. It was the place where you Mughal Jahangir lived. You can imagine the real history visit over there.",
          "Not what I was expecting. Only 20% of fort open. Generally in bad repair. Not a lot to see if I was honest. Without the tour guide who had a good knowledge of the fort it would have scored 'terrible'. Can not recommend.",
          "Found the fort amazing. Could not help but amaze at the scientific construction that made it possible for them to enjoy air conditioning at that time when there was no electricity. The sheesh mahal or palace of mirrors, bathroom of the queen, was closed for tourists but we were",
          "Worth visiting with a guide. The guide nicely draw your attention towards architecture, lifestyle, its usefulness, view of Taj from here etc etc...",
          "It\u2019s hard for anything to be your next stop after the Taj Mahal but the Agra Fort is an amazing place to explore. Parts of it are still occupied by the military and are off limits but that still leaves plenty to see. We particularly enjoyed the views of the Taj Mahal and the",
          "We were taken here by a wonderful guide with Explore India Journeys, It is not to be missed with the stunning red clay structure and rich history",
          "Many folks seem to go to Agra just for the Taj Mahal, if time permits try to get to Agra Fort, one of the best Mughal forts in India, we feel it is well worth it. The scale of the fort is impressive, originally a military fortress it was later turned into a palace.",
          "I was looking forward to visiting this fort after researching before my visit and finding myself totally immersed in the Mughal dynasty and the great Emperor Akbar. As I booked this holiday directly with an agent in India and arranged our itinerary, he had arranged a guide for",
          "Good place to visit for site seeing It's so far from Hyderabad still we went and enjoyed a lot I was very glad to go there",
          "This would have been amazing to see in full action in the 1700s. A very big fort. The red stone is a feature of the area and a symbol of the builders.",

          "Very busy around the entrance with visitors and the occasional monkey being nosey. Impressive moat surrounding the fort and can imagine in the day what it was like. Once inside it is immense and considering only 25% is able to be toured it is impressive.Towards the river side",
          "I initially thought our visit to Agra Fort was to 'kill time' before we saw the Taj Mahal. Boy, was I wrong. This is a must see while in Agra, and the story behind it very interesting. Go!",
          "Visited the Fort late afternoon as the sun was setting. A truly spectacular Fort with stunning views of the magnificent Taj Mahal in the distance across the banks of the Yamuna. One cannot help but be awestruck by the immense size of these Forts and how they were constructed",
          "We spent less than 2 hours here on a guided tour but could have stayed longer. You can see the Taj Mahal in the distance from the royal pavillions.",
          "This is an attraction that is best appreciated with a guide conversant in its history. It was built in sections and - most notably - is where Shah Jahan was imprisoned. Without the history it's not anywhere near as interesting. Be prepared for crowds so go early. Many school",
          "Amazing to see the high level of engineering employed in the development of this interesting fort. Be prepared for a long tour beginning with walk up an incline. Highly recommended tour!",
          "The walls of the fort are 2.6km long, that\u2019s a big fort. We got there at 7.30am and there was hardly anyone there which was great. We had a guide which helped the going to the best places but evidently you can only visit about 20% of the fort as the rest of it is still being",
          "Agra is just 3hours drive away from Delhi.. we started our journey in the morning and reached the destination soon. The first place we went there was Agra Fort. It was a nice place and really huge. You will find lot of tourists here.",
          "Beautiful place to visit to see where the royal family (of the king who built the Taj Mahal) lived. Was under construction but nonetheless still had beautiful sites even after 400+ years. Again lots of tourists come here so expect crowds every time and everyday.",
          "The best view is from the outside, I was disappointed I paid to go in. Didnt think it was up to much to be fair.",
          "Agra fort is a historical monument beside Yamuna river overlooking Tajmahal.Nice built complexes contain Dewan e aam and Dewan e khas with mehals for queens.Major part of this fort occupied by Indian army.This fort offers a light and sound show at night which is quite enriching",
          "A must see when in Agra. Really interesting to get a glimpse of how the people of India lived hundreds of years ago. Beautiful views of the Taj Mahal throughout the fort, albeit the Taj did not exist for much of the forts history. A very clever civilisation with great",
          "Most of the places are closed for public. Waste of time n money. Could be more existing once places like Meena Bazaar, shesh Mahal and others are opened.",

          "Only a small portion of the grounds are available to visit,and not as much as what is described in guide books because of renovation. Some of the marble buildings are truly beautiful, with other viewpoint across the river to the Taj Mahal Avoid crowds, early morning is good but",
          "Absolut impressive! You can imagine the history of the powerful family and how they lived and found their decisions. Seeing this creates ideas of the old stories.",
          "Must see place in Agra.A historical place with some of common ruler having there contribution. Shahajahan who built Taj was house arrested in this fort .It is wonderful to see this which has wonderful carvings. View from here of Taj is amazing. Hire a guide compulsorily.",
          "Enter across the once crocodile-occupied moat into the fort/palace complex, which is spacious with lovely gardens. This is where Shah Jahan was imprisoned in his white marble octagonal tower, with a view to his wife's mausoleum (the Taj Mahal) around a bend in the river. Take",

          "The walls are very impressive and very red sandstone. Once inside there is a lot of marble. Plenty of rooms to visit but none are furnished. Signage a bit hit and miss, which is a problem. Views to the Taj Mahal are a highlight.",
          "Agra Fort well preserves and still well maintained. You can see Taj Mahal from some of the windows and that's the best part of Agra Fort. Full of hidden history and lots of spots for pictures. Agra Fort have a lovely garden but please avoid to visit in summer from 12 am to 4 pm",

          "This fort was bulit for Akbar in 1565. The place is also known as red fort beacause the walls of the palace is red in colour. I visited this place for the first time and i liked the fort as its totally open and The Great Taj mahal can be seen from here. The cost of ticket is 40\u20b9",
          "Suggestion- First visit Fatehpur Sikri and travel to Agra. It's possible to complete Fatehpur Sikri and Agra visit in One day. Tajmahal- it's marvel. Don't rush for early morning viewing. 2-3 hrs is perfect. Although I hired a guide, it is not required. Authorised guide is",
          "I had the opportunity to see the Agra Fort as a part of my tour of the Golden Triangle. I always wonder how a king or ruler could build such a stronghold to protect his kingdom or his country as well as his wife or wives. Agra Fort is one of the must to see in India. This is",

          "OK, let us be frank, anything in Agra is going to take a huge second place to the Taj Mahal which is spectacular beyond belief. That in mind this is a really good place to visit for a number of reasons, ironically one of them is the great views of the Taj Mahal! The fort is",

          "Its hot and humid in the monsoon season - take water - but engage a guide as well to explain the way parts of this fort are a forerunner to the architecture of the Taj Mahal",
          "Really amazing buildings. Hired a guide for 500 rupee for 2 people which was extremely beneficial as we wouldn\u2019t of understood anything otherwise. There is limited English information provided around the fort so the guide was very informative.",
          "If you go to the Taj first and retain your ticket, you don't pay tax again so the entry fee was just 550 INR for adults and free for children under 15. The place is nice and well worth a visit, but it doesn't rival Jodhpur, Jaisalmer or Jaipur's forts.",
          "Great place to go. Actually a must go along with taj mahal its important that you hire. a guide who will.show the right place and right spots",
          "one of the main city must-see, organized and clean you need a guide as the public info provided is not enough",
          "I would have felt very vulnerable here without a guide as locals were taking pictures of me and constantly staring/walking close by my side. With the guide, it was fine because he could translate and tell them I was happy to have pictures with them once the tour guide had",

          "Agra Fort was so interesting to learn about. I went and had never even heard of it so to hear the story of the Mughals who ruled and the death of Shah Jahan (who built the Taj Mahal) was very interesting!",

          "After visiting the Taj Majal, we traveled across town to the Red Fort of Agra. This was another very interesting location that I highly suggest you visit. This fort has a distant view of the Taj Majal, some interesting architecture features of its own and amazing history. Our",

          "This place is really astounding, you'll notice it's greatness as soon as you enter the gate. Everything here is humongous from Walls to Palaces to Durbar to Gardens.A Must visit place if you're in agra. You can reach here by Auto or Rickshaw from Taj Mahal or Agra Cantt. Railway",
          "After Taj Mahal we went to Agra Fort. Spent some time there and left back for Delhi. Good one day activity.",
          "simply beautiful n worth the trip to see the architectural wonder.Trying to imagine how was the lifestyle then....with all the luxuries at hand.",
          "For those with an interest in history in India this is a good stop. It is not visually very different from the Red Fort though. It is interesting to visit but may be more worthwhile with a guide who can inform you about the story.",
          "Nice place to visit. We were accompanied by a guide (recommended). We visited the place late in the afternoon. We also had a good view from this place on the Taj Mahal. We enjoyed it very much.",
          "Taking a guide is recommended, but it is advisable to negotiate. A good guide should cost around Rs 600, but insist he takes you to all nooks and corners and explains everything in detail. Also, take your own time to explore the lovely fort. There are many photographers who will",

          "Really good restaurant with good local food and friendly staff .Deepak is very cool and fun gay ,loved talking with him.highly recommended this place.",
          "Except for the great nostalgia over the last days of illustrious Shah Jahan there is practically nothing to see at Agra Fort and that too post a visit to Taj and Fatehpur. Added to it is government's apathy to give Agra Fort any importance when the famous cousin is a kilometer",
          "Fort is nice and has an hour or so of walk around it, but well that's rather it. Nothing too interesting inside. Was touted by \"guides\" before entering as if Fort is so big and I would get lost in it. Did not pick that option and I was more than right.",
          "when we entered this beautiful monument, we had no idea about this rich history. we never imagined our guide - Afshana, would make such an impact on us. she approached us very calmly near the entrance and mentioned that she is willing to share just half of what the male guides",
          "We hired one of the official guides - Abdul (speaks french by the way) - in side the Fortress. That was a very good - and cheep (300 rupies) - investment. Abdul guided us through the maze consisting af buldings, rooms and sguares of the amazing fortress giving us lots of",

          "The Agra Fort has some beautiful artistry and intricate detail which is fascinating; in addition to the views of the Taj Mahal. We were treated with a parade of monkeys jumping from the tower to wall and running along their way.",
          "Another gem that we got to visit early in the morning and the architecture and history are truly amazing. You can also get a good shot of the Taj Mahal from the palace rooms of the fort.",
          "from the moment you enter this incredible complex of fortifications and palaces you are wowed- well worth the visit- to see the prison where Shah Jahan spent his final years- gazing out on the Taj he had lavishly built for his beloved wife is very moving.",
          "Very well maintained, must visit if you are in Agra. Take a guide while visiting fort so that you can understand more in details instead of looking only at building.",
          "Agra Fort is old and huge. Too big for me to tour in 1 hour and very hot. I toured the outside of the fort and it is awesome, considering when it was built.",
          "One of the most beautiful fort in India. I have never seen such a secure design in any other fort. Beautiful architecture & mix of different religion",
          "Expensive but you gotto have something to do on a Friday in Agra (Tja Mahal closed). In combination with the Baby Taj Mahal on the other side of the river it's a good timekiller.",
          "One of the biggest fort.you will ever see. As you enter lots of guides are available in all the languages if you wish to you can hire one for few hours to give you a proper guided tour. It take around about 2-3 hours to see the entire fort.You could go in the morning to avoid",
          "This was the big surprise of Agra. All know Taj Mahal but do not miss the Agra Fort - even better: get a guide. Loads of stories and history you should not miss! We loved our 3 hour trip and time went as one hour",
          "Beautiful Fort, worth a visit when in Agra. Nice if you like gardens and open, good view of the Taj on a clear day.",
          "The beauty lies in the architecture of the monument. The TAJ vision from varied angles makes it more interesting.",
          "We enjoyed the stories our guide told us of the many mughal kings that have graced this fort. They all had unique and quite plunderous histories. Makes one appreciate how violent these rulers were in ancient India.",
          "Good view of Taj Mahal from this place but apart from that nothing much on it. Good to take a view of Taj sitting here.",
          "This fort is just opposite to Taj and a great place to explore. We went when the weather was good, would advise not visit when it is hot, prefer to visit after 4 pm.",
          "An amazing place from the outside And as you are there have a look inside but dont a low that much time Really you can see Agra in an afternoon evening",
          "Managed to go in lots of nooks & crannies, & you get a great view of the Taj down the river. Around sunset or sunrise is the best time",
          "Little was known about Agra Fort until we visited Taj Mahal, but this Fort is definitely worth a visit. The architecture and story behind this is quite amazing. The designer of the Taj was placed under house arrest by his youngest son, for the last 12 years of his life (in a",

          "fort was beautiful . unfortunately all over India you will be scammed short changed robbed and harassed . shame as it could be too much nicer to visit. Ticket office for foreigners 600 rupees Indians 40 rupees but the fellow on the ticket office also tried to short change me by",
          "We spent an hour and a half walking round the amazing palaces of Agra fort, which is massive. Sadly there are some areas closed to visitors that we really wanted to see, such as the prison palace of Shah Jahan for his final years. We didn't take a guide and don't think we missed",
          "incridible, wonderfull, what else I can say, Agra Fort is a castle with red colour, huge place with nice ornaments every side of building, colourfull garden, I suggest to hire local guide and you get all histories about this castle, must visit",

        "wiki": "Akbar's tomb is the tomb of the Mughal emperor Akbar. This tomb is an important Mughal architectural masterpiece. It was built in 1605\u20131613 by his son Jahangir and is situated in 119 acres of grounds in Sikandra, a sub of Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAkbar planned the tomb and selected a suitable site for it. After his death, Akbar's son Jahangir completed the construction in 1605\u20131613. It cost 1,500,000 rupees to build and took 3 or 4 years to complete.During the reign of Aurangzeb, Jats rose in rebellion under the leadership of Raja Ram Jat. Mughal prestige suffered a blow when Jats ransacked Akbar's tomb, plundering and looting the gold, jewels, silver and carpets. According to one account, even Akbar's grave was opened and his bones burned.As Viceroy of India, George Curzon directed extensive repairs and restoration of Akbar's mausoleum, which were completed in 1905. Curzon discussed restoration of the mausoleum and other historical buildings in Agra in connection with the passage of the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act in 1904, when he described the project as \"an offering of reverence to the past and a gift of\nrecovered beauty to the future\". This preservation project may have discouraged veneration of the mausoleum by pilgrims and people living nearby.\n\n\n== Location ==\nIt is located at Sikandra, in the suburbs of Agra, on the Mathura road (NH2), 8 km west-northwest of the city center.  About 1 km away from the tomb, lies Mariam's Tomb, the tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani, wife of the Mughal Emperor Akbar and the mother of Jahangir.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe south gate is the largest, with four white marble chhatri-topped minarets which are similar to (and pre-date) those of the Taj Mahal, and is the normal point of entry to the tomb.  The tomb itself is surrounded by a walled enclosure 105 m square. The tomb building is a four-tiered pyramid, surmounted by a marble pavilion containing the false tomb.  The true tomb, as in other mausoleums, is in the basement. The buildings are constructed mainly from a deep red sandstone, enriched with features in white marble.  Decorated inlaid panels of these materials and a black slate adorn the tomb and the main gatehouse.  Panel designs are geometric, floral and calligraphic, and prefigure the more complex and subtle designs later incorporated in Itmad-ud-Daulah's Tomb.\n\n\n== Architectural details ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKeene, Henry George (1899). \"Sikandra\".

        "wiki": "Mehtab Bagh (Hindi: \u092e\u0947\u0939\u0924\u093e\u092c \u092c\u093e\u0917\u093c, Urdu: \u0645\u06c1\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u063a\u200e, translation: Moonlight Garden) is a charbagh complex in Agra, North India. It lies north of the Taj Mahal complex and the Agra Fort on the opposite side of the Yamuna River, in the flood plains. The garden complex, square in shape, measures about 300 by 300 metres (980 ft \u00d7 980 ft) and is perfectly aligned with the Taj Mahal on the opposite bank. During the rainy season, the ground becomes partially flooded.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Mehtab Bagh garden was the last of eleven Mughal-built gardens along the Yamuna opposite the Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort; the first being Ram Bagh. It is mentioned that this garden was built by Emperor Babur (d. 1530). It is also noted that Emperor Shah Jahan had identified a site from the crescent-shaped, grass-covered floodplain across the Yamuna River as an ideal location for viewing the Taj Mahal. It was then created as \"a moonlit pleasure garden called Mehtab Bagh.\" White plaster walkways, airy pavilions, pools and fountains were also created as part of the garden, with fruit trees and narcissus. The garden was designed as an integral part of the Taj Mahal complex in the riverfront terrace pattern. Its width was identical to that of the rest of the Taj Mahal. Legends attributed to the travelogue of the 17th century French traveler Jean Baptiste Tavernier mention Shah Jahan's wish to build a Black Taj Mahal for himself, as a twin to the Taj Mahal; however, this could not be achieved as he was imprisoned by his son Aurangzeb. This myth had been further fueled in 1871 by a British archaeologist, A. C. L. Carlleyle, who, while discovering the remnants of an old pond at the site had mistaken it for the foundation of the fabled structure. Thus, Carlleyle became the first researcher to notice structural remains at the site, albeit blackened by moss and lichen. Mehtab Bagh was later owned by Raja Man Singh Kacchawa of Amber, who also owned the land around the Taj MahalFrequent floods and villagers extracting building materials nearly ruined the garden. Remaining structures within the garden were in a ruinous state. By the 1990s, the garden's existence was almost forgotten and it had degraded to little more than an enormous mound of sand, covered with wild vegetation and alluvial silt.\n\n\n== Site plan ==\n\n \n\nInscriptions on the site of Mehtab Bagh mention that it adjoins other gardens to the west; these are called \"Chahar Bagh Padshahi\" and \"Second Chahar Bagh Padshahi\". A compound wall surrounded the garden; it was made of brick, lime plaster, and red sandstone cladding. Measuring about 289 metres (948 ft) in length, the river wall is partially intact. Built on platforms, there were domed towers of red sandstone in an octagonal shape, which may have stood at the corners. A 2\u20132.5 metres (6 ft 7 in\u20138 ft 2 in) wide pathway made of brick edged the western boundary of the grounds, covering the remains of the boundary wall to the west. Near the entrance is a small Dalit shrine on the riverside. Of the four sandstone towers, which marked the corners of the garden, only the one on the southeast remains. A large octagonal pond on the southern periphery reflects the image of the Mausoleum. There is a small central tank on the eastern side.  Water channels enrich the landscape and there are baradaris on the east and west. There is a gate at the northern wall. The foundations of two structures remain immediately north and south of the large pond, which were probably garden pavilions. From the northern structure a stepped waterfall would have fed the pool. The garden to the north has the typical square, cross-axial plan with a square pool in its centre. To the west, an aqueduct fed the garden. Other structures which are not in keeping with the original landscape plan include nurseries owned by private individuals, a temple in place of a gazebo, an odd statue of B. R. Ambedkar holding the Constitution of India in the courtyard, and relics of a water supply network to the park.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\nRestoration of the Mehtab Bagh began after the ASI survey, setting new standards for Mughal garden research. This included a surface survey, historical documentation, paleobotanical assessment, archaeological excavation techniques, and requirements coordination with the Ministries of Culture, Tourism, and Planning. Restoration began in the 1990s, aided by the Americans, during which barbed-wire fencing was added to the Mehtab Bagh site.\nThe garden's original ambiance was restored as ASI insisted on having plants that the Mughals had used in their gardens. Though the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) had suggested planting of 25 pollution-mitigating plant species every 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) in the proposed renovation of the garden, this was opposed by the ASI. The Supreme Court intervened in the matter in favour of ASI who wanted the garden to only have plants that the Mughals used in their gardens.\nA common list of plants was suggested. ASI landscape artists meticulously planned the replanting of trees, plants and herbage to match the original Mughal gardens, replicating the riverside gardens brought to India from Central Asia in Shalimar Bagh in Kashmir. Some 81 plants adopted in Mughal horticulture were planted, including guava, maulshri, Nerium, hibiscus, citrus fruit plants, neem, bauhinia, ashoka and jamun. The herbage was planted in such a way that tall trees follow the short ones, then shrubs, and lastly flowering plants. Some of these plants produce bright-coloured flowers that shine in the moonlight. The park has been reconstructed to its original grandeur and has now become a very good location to view the Taj Mahal.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\nArchaeological excavations in the Mehtab Bagh site have been described as \"setting new archaeological standards for Mughal garden research\", using paleobotanical and excavations techniques. Excavations to the extent of 90,000 cubic metres of earth, were carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), in 1994. The excavations unearthed a large octagonal tank with 25 fountains, and a garden, divided into four compartments. Mumtaz Mahal's tomb was found to be situated halfway between the Taj Mahal complex's main entrance and the ends of the Mehtab Bagh site. This is corroborated by a letter from Aurangzeb addressed to Shah Jahan in which he referred to the condition of the garden after the flood event in 1652 AD.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Herbert Offen Research Collection of the Phillips Library at the Peabody Essex Museum",

          "God Almighty planted the garden of paradise. It is a garden of leisure. River on outskirts induces tranquillity,even indolence. There's a kind of melancholy in its decrepitude. The senses are soothed by the cool restfulness of the landscape and heightened by subtle displays of",

          "This park does not have much attraction. But rather charming Many people do not sit on the edge of the park, facing the Taj Mahal. We really enjoyed the photography and atmosphere at that time.",
          "The park itself was absolutely not worth visiting. The gardens are neither beautiful nor well maintained. There is a little wall near the riverbanks where people can sit and watch the sunset. However, the park closes at sunset which means, that the security asks you to leave",
          "From what the guide told me, someday the government will build a viewing platform for the Taj here. When they do, this will be a must-see stop. However, until then it's really nothing more than a grove of trees with a decent view. Don't get your hopes up. Supposedly this is",
          "The gardens are a great viewing spot for the Taj, and is a very tranquil setting to spend a couple of hours in. It does start to get busier around sunset, but the views of the Taj are great whatever time of day you go. Well worth a trip.",
          "It\u2019s been a couple of years since I\u2019ve been here and the first visit it felt like a secret gem that made it quite a special experience. Now there are coaches of tourists and lots of hawkers and it was more expensive. No food or drink allowed, only water and no smoking. Bags",

          "The gardens themselves are nothing special but 100% worth it for the amazing view of the Taj. Now costs 300 rupees for foreigners (250 if you get online ticket). Make sure you arrive in plenty of time for sunset (around 4pm) to get a front row seat on the wall and the best",
          "This place is defo worth a visit. It costs to get in & it gets abit crowded but it is a nice place to walk around - the gardens are beautiful, and of course the view to the Taj Mahal. We combined this along with the baby Taj Mahal in a couple of hours. Hired a tuc tuc from our",
          "Other than the view of the Taj there's no good reason to visit this place. Most people come an hour before sunset to watch the Taj and its translucent marble bathe in the golden light. It's a phenomenal view and if you're fortunate enough to be in Agra during monsoon and the",
          "It is a garden with flowers and one can view Tajmahal from backside. It is just opposite to Tajmahal on other side of Yamuna river. SahaJahan planned to built a black marble Taj in this place for him, but was house arrested by his son Aurangzeb. So nothing to visit.",
          "Mehtab Bagh is back of taj to speak as Taj looks same from all sides.yamuna lies between Taj and Mehtab,its told that its the site where Shahjahan wished to build Black Taj Mahal.U can get the beautiful view of Taj and if u are lucky there may be water flowing along the Yamuna",
          "Use the road that conrinues past the ticket office:it's free,no crowds and a better view at sunset of the Taj Mahal",
          "It is simply superb. With Taj in background,it looks magnificent- nicely maintained, kept clean, it steals the hearts of visitors.",
          "After tired visit of Akbar's tomb,Marium's tomb and baby taj we came here and found very relaxing. Taj from bank of yamuna is marvelous. sunset scene is very memorial. Must visit.",
          "Visited this garden which has great views of the Taj from across the river. I interesting as well to see the foundations of the unfinished Black Taj. Well worth the trip.",
          "Initially we had thought to skip this site but our guide insisted. So glad he did. We thoroughly enjoyed walking through the \u00b4baby Taj \u00b4.",
          "Once u enter in garden will feel that it's just a normal garden but, another side walk beautiful flat view of Taj just 300 meters far from garden wall",
          "The weather wasn\u2019t the best for us, but this is a nice garden to wander and sit in while watching the sun go down. Plenty of photo ops here! Felt semi safe, plenty of kids around looking for money.",
          "A return tuk tuk to the east gate cost us 300 rupees. It is a few km to get to the garden as it winds through Agra. The gardens were relaxing compared to the chaos of the city. Tripods of any kind are not allowed.",
          "Quite annoying entrance. Entrance fee by card is 250, by cash 300. Off course card payment is not possible when you ask for. Paying with 2.000 cash results in receiving 1.500 back. If you say that it's not correct you get your additional 200, which the guy is already holding",
          "Mehtab baug is a place from where Taj can be seen from back side . On the bank of Yamuna river it's more a garden . A dream of emperor Shahjahan of making black Tajmahal never came true.",
          "This is a garden area to the north of the Taj on the far banks of the Yamuna. It costs 300 INR to get in (kids free; 50 INR cheaper if you pay by card vice cash) and a couple of mins stroll takes you to the perimeter walls where you get great views (and photos) across the river",
          "Its one of the best place to see Taj mahal at sunset. Recommend to all. Connectivity is also very good. Nice road to reach there.",
          "Perhaps not that great of a view unless the river is in its full glory and you must take a photo from the other side of the Yamuna river.",
          "Strongly recommend visiting this place either in winter, summers, autumn. Every season it has its own charm. Beautiful view of tan mahal mesmerises you completely. For photographers, it's a lovely place to capture the moments.",
          "Not really worth paying the entrance. Unless you have not yet seen the Taj Mahal and then you are able to see it from a distance.",
          "The Bagh (garden) is unexciting and the only reason for visiting this place is the view of the Taj Mahal it offers from the other side of the Yamuna. However, the river is more like a putrid drain here and so the view of the Taj is very disappointing. Only if the river is full",
          "This is the place to go for the best view of the Taj Mahal. It is not crowded either and is much cheaper. However you cant actually get to the main building from here to appreciate it close up.",
          "Of course one need to visit Taj Mahal and check out its incredible stonework and inlays. However, once you are done with it and want to get away from the massive crowds that get into every photo of Taj Mahal you take, I would highly recommend to go across the river to the Mehtab",
          "Visited Mehtab Bagh in the morning and found it pleasant and peaceful. It is not very large so I do agree that the admission ticket is rather overpriced. Nevertheless, it's still worth a visit for a different perspective of the Taj Mahal.",
          "Less explored place in Agra. Must visit place in pleasant weather or early mornings. You can relax in parks. Taj in the backdrop of all your pictures. You will love it.",
          "Overpriced. For just a view on the Taj Mahal over the river you have to pay an entryfee of Inr 300 per person. The so called garden is 't worth the money. People only visite this garden for a distant glance at the famous tombe.",
          "Worth a visit any time of day for the spectacular views of the Taj Mahal as well as a quiet walk in calm gardens with very few people to bother you. Described as the \"Backsid\" of the Taj Mahal, the gardens are said to contain the foundations of the planned Black Taj Mahal",
          "It is one of those places tht are of utmost importance but less reverred abd visited..! Visiting these beautiful garden can change your perception of Taj Mahal in White marble as these gardens were supposed to have a Taj Mahal in blck marble which couldnt take place because of",
          "Beautiful garden. And does give you the view of the Taj as promised. There's some pieces of bricks ruining the view but easy to get over. Some benches around and good spots for picnicking.",
          "Sunset at these gardens are the best place to view The Taj Mahal from. Reasonably good value at Rupees 300, and if you pay by credit card then it's only Rupees 250. Yes I agree with a number of other reviewers that the guards are very officious in insisting you leave promptly",
          "It's a very good place to see the Taj Mahal but you have to pay 300Rs. Would be better if they take care of it. Apparently, was an amazing garden until some Indian people start to take part of the ruins to build other things. Looks like now they have started to plant new trees.",
          "We visited these rose gardens late in the afternoon to view the Taj and maybe to enjoy a sunset. I was very disappointed that the official ticket booth tried to steal from me, giving me incorrect change from 2000 rupees. I\u2019ve come to expect tuk tuk drivers all trying it on,",
          "That\u2019s no other place in the city with better view of Taj Mahal than from the Mehtab Bagh garden, on the other side of the river, in the sunset, you can see the Taj all orange and get some different perspectives for photography! Amazing place, even you can find some indian",
          "Translating to moonlight garden, Mehtab Bagh is the perfect spot for admiring the beauty of the Taj Mahal. Built by Babur, it is a square garden that was once resplendent with pools, fountains and trees. Today, it makes for a recreational tourist spot. A Mughal garden, it is",
          "Got up early and went to the Taj Mahal in the morning then later in the day we went to see the sunset at Mehtab Bagh. Well worth the visit, nice view over the river and you see the Taj Mahal in the changing light.",
          "This Bagh is on the ear side of the Taj across river Yamuna. The place is well maintained however due to security restrictions, you cannot go closer to Taj or river bank, this takes away a lot of joy of viewing Taj. Getting a Public transport after sunset can be an issue",
          "If u want to the taj from 360 degrees and on toast -u have to come here and sunsets the time. Re- hassle at the site + cost : The disparate entrance fee attracting seemebly people just there to hassle foreign tourists- happens at all the tourist sites in the golden triangle that",
          "Great photo of the Taj Mahal at sunset. One can get a panoramic view from the great gate to the mosque. Great side view of the Taj Mahal too especially at sunset.",
          "Its a nice big garden meaning Moonlight Garden its name. Its really to the opposite bank of Yamuna River behind Taj Mahal You can have unrestricted views of the monument but as it will follow your visit to Taj Mahal it must be another hour of the day for other colors of the",
          "Great views of back of Taj Mahal from black mahal which was going to be built as counterpoint. Park, not very exciting but hood opportunity to ser birds in river & an alternative view of Taj",
          "The gardens are quite limited so we camped out here as we were told it was a great place for sunset photos of the Taj Mahal. I think that is and a couple of hundred others were disappointed. Good views but sunset didn't reveal anything different.",
          "We came here at the end of a long day visiting various places in Agra. We got here just before sunset. The park is very serene and a lovely quiet place to visit. The view of the Taj is excellent from across the river and gives a great view of it as the sun sets. The colours on",
          "Fantastic view of the Taj. Reaching here is slightly a challenge. Normally this a place to be visited during sun set. That gives a good orange colour shade of sun on the Taj. Take a cab on return basis or book the cab (Ola) immediately after sun set as very few cabs in this",
          "This is a popular garden to view the Taj Mahal at sunset. You can get great pictures however the park closes at sunset and so you are likely to be ushered out before the pink glow of the sunset strikes the Taj",
          "Reminded us of the gardens surrounding the Summer palace in St. Petersburg, but not quite as well groomed. The Taj Mahal makes a beautiful picture from this location on the opposite bank of the river.",
          "We went here to view the Taj Mahal as soon as we arrived in Agra, in the late afternoon. It was a beautiful spot to view the Taj Mahal from a distance, and a lovely first viewing of it. The place has an interesting history as well",
          "Offers good views of the Taj Mahal, but there isn\u2019t much to do here. Recommend going here in the evening. Tip - sale of tickets stops 30 minutes before sunset. And this varies based on whether it\u2019s summer or winters so be careful of the timings.",
          "We were told there were beautiful gardens and you got fantastic sunset views of the Taj Mahal. The gardens were mainly rose gardens that were without a single flower. There were a few flower beds with flowers but most were empty. Unfortunately it was overcast and we didn't even",
          "The tuktuk driver said that there are no more boat operating on Yamuna River so we can watch the sunset on this garden. I think Mehtab Bagh was a field before without the admission fee. But when we came, we were asked to pay Rs 300 just because the place got a nice view of Taj",
          "DON\u2019T PAY. If you only want to see the Taj from a distance don\u2019t pay. There\u2019s two entrances in to this... one is 300INR P/P the other is FREE! If you continue to go straight you\u2019ll see the same thing. The only difference with the entry fee in you\u2019ll get a direct picture of the",
          "First visit, the Taj Mahal was invisible due to dense fog which took about \u00bd an hour to clear to the point where we could see an outline. Fog stayed with us for 2 solid days - be aware this can happen... On the way there, from town, there are some sports fields, loads of groups",

          "This is a \"garden\" on the opposite side of the river from the Taj. It is not really a garden yet, as nothing is rally established yet. There is a fee of IR300 to enter, which is a rip-off.Although it was raining when we were there we had a very good view of the Taj. It is also",
          "There really isn\u2019t much to this garden. However, it wasn\u2019t crowded at all when we were there and had nice views of the Taj Mahal across the river. The pollution was terrible, so the views were very hazy. Still, probably worth the small admission fee to be able to see it with few",
          "Difficult to get to. Alot of traffic, but the gardens are nice. People go here to view the Taj at evening time, if they visited the Taj for sunrise, or during the day.",
          "One has to pay 300 roepies to walk in a poorly kept 'park' with barely a few flowers and fences everywhere (around archeological? works) that make it difficult to reach the only reason to come here: the magnificent view of the Taj Mahal.",
          "Yes it's a nice garden, if lucky a clear day good view of Taj Mahal, with there high fenced in area, now blocked off free river walk as well no boats alowed or walking along the river far side. Hevan for bid we see the Taj Mahal with out paying a fee but also 28x higher fee",
          "This garden lies behind the Taj Mahal and even though there is a reasonable view of the Taj from the back side the garden itself is unimpressive. The only interesting thing to see here is the foundations for the making of the Black Taj that never eventuated.",
          "The garden itself was not very remarkable but looked to be being revamped. Good for bird watching. This is well worth the cost of entry for some pictures of Taj Mahal without the crowds.",
          "Unfortunately, you can no longer go on boats at sunrise/sunset to see the Taj but this park does have a great view of the Taj from across the river. Most of the property is now fenced off, so you can't walk along the river... Still worth a visit though.",
          "You can take some excellent creative photos of the Taj from here as its much quieter, and you have space and time to do your thing. The actual gardens, however, aren't much.",
          "Experience the Taj from across the Yamuna for some stunning views of the Taj - we visited between 2-4 pm in February.",
          "Part of our pre-booked tour. Not horrible but be sure you have enough time to spend in Fort Agra and the Taj Mahal. In January the gardens were kind of dead and the views of the Taj Mahal were just OK nothing great. Even our excellent guide kind to just left us wander around a",

          "After seeing the Taj at sunrise, i wouldn\u2019t waste time here. Although it\u2019s lovely to see the Taj always, this is not a unique viewpoint...you will have much better photos from you visit to the Taj itself and it\u2019s not worth the time or extra rupees although cheap. I do not",
          "From here you can only see the Taj Mahal and the river. Nothing else to be seen here as the things from the bases of the new tomb for the emperor don't say much. 250 INR is just too much just to visit a piece of grass!",
          "We came here at sunset to see the other side of the Taj Mahal, from across the river. The gardens are just ok but the sight more than makes up for them. Well worth a visit.",
          "Came here in the evening to see the sunset. (Didn't happen and also there is smog so how often you get to see the sun setting I am not sure). The coach parked a way off and we were mobbed by people trying to sell you things (keep your head down and avoid any eye contact) on the",
          "Not that good. Can visit to see the real front view of the Taj from the other side of river Yamuna. It's very far and isolated.",
          "We were taken to these gardens by our guide immediately on arrival in Agra in the late afternoon to find that there were lots of other visitors there already. It soon became clear as you get amazing views of the Taj Mahal ahead of any planned visit. The gardens are not that",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit in the evening. Go at about 4pm to view the Black mausoleum and see the Taj Mahal at sunset when it changes to a pink hue. The gardens are great with an orchard and well worth looking about. There is a long wall where you sit and view the Taj",
          "Wouldn\u2019t let me take tripod nor my drone and I was not gonna leave my $1500 drone with the front office so we didn\u2019t bothered checking it out. Judging by outside of this park grass looked dead and there were typical hundreds of Indian men standing and staring.",

          "Went here the night before we went to see the Taj Mahal just to get our fist glimpses of it. What views we got and really whetted our appetite for going the next day. The gardens themselves were pretty spectacular and all in all can highly recommend an hour or so here prior to",

          "This time of the year is a great period to soak the sun at the Mehtab Bagh, while enjoying beautiful views of the Taj. There are numerous areas where you can click gorgeous pictures- do try out different angles if you are a professional photographer. The entrance fee is not",
          "By itself, this garden is not worth the entrance fee. However, for a view of the Taj Mahal and a place to sit and relax while enjoying the majesty of the place it was worth it for me. You can see the view of the Taj from outside the garden but it is not the same and it can get",

          "A lesser known spot to quietly contemplate the majestic site of the Taj Mahal. Follow the road past the fort and find a haven of peace away from the trippers and hustlers. It is almost the extended gardens but across the other side of the river which depending on the season can",

          "Situated on the opposite side of Taj Mahal, Mehtab Bagh holds an ancient history in Agra. It was build during mughals and was a magnificent veiw point to look at Taj Mahal and witness it's beauty on a full moon light. The garden is largely spread across acres and is a good place",

          "I wasn't quite sure whether to go to the place because I just had some negative reviews by some of our family members (they visited the place two years ago or so) before going over there. We went to Agra on a Thursday evening and wasn't really satisfied with the time we got to",

          "A scenic view of the Taj. No crowd. Just the river Yamuna flowing. Early morning visit is a beautiful experience ! Since I had already visited Taj several times, I decided to skip it this time and catch a glimpse of Taj elsewhere. Mehtab Bagh was definitely a smart choice !",
          "The place offers a great view of the taj mahal... I love the place ... Several flowers of different species",
          "Try visiting this beautiful place. This is near to the Taj Mahal and gives you complete view of the monument without getting into the crowd. Also if the monument is officially closed you can get to see it from here",
          "To get the sunset with the Taj Mahal, the Mehtab Bagh is not the ideal place, as it does close before the sunset. Beside the park there is also some place, but the get easy yelled at by park rangers, as they don't like that you get the view for free. But the view is breath",
          "The place is just behind Taj where Shah Jahan's black Taj was supposed to be built but it never was. It will take you 20 minutes by car because you have to travel to the other side of the river. I recommend to avoid because it isn't grandiose and filled with local boys who",

          "If Taj Mahal is closed (Friday) this park is the best spot to still get the closest picture of this wonder. Despite this point and some gardens, there is no much to be seen. Black Taj Mahal's remains are in bad shape: few circles of stones facing the White Taj Mahal on the",
          "Located between the taj Mahal and the fort. Nice garden with lots of trees and flowers and a fountain at the center. Well maintained by the authority. Nice place to click photo with friends or family member. A uplifted area at the center in the middle of the fountain where you",
          "Average garden with steep entry fee. Great view of Taj from across the river. Can really appreciate the symmetry from her. Can get busy. Would only be an add on, not a main attraction.",
          "Far from the crowd, amazing view of the Taj. I would say even better than the other side and definitely more peaceful... If you need to take one picture take it there",
          "We probably loved this place more than the Taj Mahal itself, mainly because when we were there, there\u2019s no one else, we had the whole grounds to ourselves. The environment was very relaxed, we took our time taking pictures, walked between the rows of trees and flowers.",
          "Moon Garden is the best place to spend the evening time behind the Taj Mahal. You can use your professional camera to take some exotic pictures of the setting sun in the evening time. It has enough space for the various kind of photographs that you want to take of the Taj",
          "A place from where one can see the beauty of Taj , specifically the Sun Set. If one interested in phography, this is the place for clicking Taj. Also can see old foundation for proposed Black Taj.",
          "This garden is a bit under reconstruction, which aims to mirror Taj Mahal across the river, as it used to do in ancient times. We walked through the yards here and took some marvellous pictures of the flowers and the Taj itself. Nice place to unwind.",
          "This place is situated opposite the Taj Mahal, across the river. It offers a stunning view of the Taj Mahal and is less crowded so you can enjoy the views more. You would need to get a driver to take you and you have to pay 200 rps entrance but is well worth the view.",
          "If you have time and you have a driver it's worth going there at sunset, it's not only a nice quiet park with very few people, it also has a breathtaking view on Taj Mahal.",
          "The place is having historical importance. The place is having a beautiful Garden on the other side of Taj across Yamuna. It is believed that there was a plan to build another Black Taj Mahal at this site.",

          "Yamuna river separates taj and this bagh, but Yamuna is mostly dry and you won't see any water in it. Either go early morning or around evening as its large open area and can be pretty hot during summers. There is unofficial road side parking available before the entrance.",
          "It\u2019s not so well maintained garden, wish they can do a better job, it\u2019s on the banks of Jamuna River opposite to Taj Mahal, the morning silhouette of The Taj Mahal is worth a look from this garden",
          "Didnt even know this place existed- the benefit of a guide I guess. Fab views but can get a bit crowded. No facilities to speak of but that view will do it every time!",

          "We visited here after seeing the Taj Mahal and Amber Fort. We did get great views of the Taj Mahal from the river side, but it\u2019s not totally necessary to visit here, as the views from the Taj Mahal site are much better. However, it was a nice way to finish our trip. You don\u2019t",
          "Since we went during the summer time, most of the flowers are not fully blown yet. The soil was dry and dusty. A slight haze obscured the Taj Mahal from a good photo shoot. I recommend to check the local weather and avoid summer and dry season. Don't forget that the Taj Mahal is",
          "My husband visited here a few years ago when the building was inlay of real semi - precious stones and gold ceilings. Now it appears to have been looted and wish restoration done on inside more. When leaving I believe a police officer guarding the facility tipped some random",
          "You can\u2019t miss being in Mehtab bagh once you are inside Taj campus to visit Taj Mahal . I will place its parallel to how a perfectly shaped nose define beauty of a damsel , Mehtab bagh defines that beauty for Taj . Bagh looks much more beautiful with its splendid fountains",
          "Went here to just see the backside of the Taj Mahal. If you like to take pictures this is a great place as the view of the Taj is stunning. Would recommend to just see the backside of the Taj Mahal.",
          "Over hyped garden ( sort of garden). Tickets cost 15 rs per head. Mehtab bagh presents a view of the Taj Mahal from the other side of Yamuna river. But other than the view there is nothing else to do. Absolutely nothing else. The trees are newly planted and would take atleast",
          "Try to go during sunset. The photos you will take of Taj Mahal would by magnificent. 200 INR for the entrance. Nothing to see or do except the view.",
          "Away from the heavily crwded Taj and Fort, this provides an alternate Taj viewing location from across the river",
          "The Mehtab Bagh is really beautiful and the place is quite well kept. Its interesting to hear about how this garden was planned.",
          "It should be one of the must visit places list for people visiting Taj. It is well maintained, is peaceful, greenery and provides a beautiful view of Taj. You can spend half an hour to an hour for sight seeing, clicking pictures and admiring the beauty that should be enough.",

          "It should be in a must visit list for people visiting Taj. It is well maintained, is peaceful, green and provides a splendid view of Taj. On a good day it is a pretty sight seeing the sunset over it. It is a good place for photographers, lot of pre-wedding shoots happen here.",
          "Great views on a clear day of the Taj Mahal. Peaceful to visit - just what you need in Agra. No hassle just a couple of kids outside asking you to buy something or take a camel ride. Entrance fee currently 200 IRP for foreigners.",
          "Yet again, one from my Agra diaries(I still have a lot of places to write about). This place is just across the Taj, in fact this place gives a good vantage point for amateur photographers to get some good long shots of the Taj especially during the sunrise and the sunset, it",
          "Go for the garden, stay for the view. This is the spot where Shah Jahan wanted to build a Black Taj Mahal, as his own mausoleum. Now it has been converted to a garden with a low priced ticket, go just before the sunset to get stunning views of the Taj.",
          "Spent 1.5 hrs for the sunset. It's very relaxing and a great viewpoint for the Taj Mahal. This is a location where supposedly the \"black\" Taj Mahal twin be built, but it was never done.",
          "If you want to see the Taj Mahal but it's Monday (so it's closed), you can still go to Mehtab Bagh on the other side of the river but symmetrically aligned to the Taj, like a backyard, so to say. Although this is a much more humble place and the gardens are not as magnificent,",
          "Mehtab Bagh is an excellent place to have great view of Taj. Situated right across the banks of river Jumana, you get excellent views of Taj. Moreover one avoids all the crowd and rush. The best views are in the evening at dusk. Make sure to reach there at least 1hour before the",
          "This place is great to see the Taj at Sunset. Be aware to check the time of Sunset because the entrance closes about 1h prior to. It is not crowded and does offer great views. Best time to go is after the rainy season as the Taj then reflect into the river along with the sunset.",
          "This garden is quite well maintained. I found it a bit far from the centre, but it is worth going over there. Make sure you visit this place before 4.30 PM as they tend to close the gate very soon.",
          "Seeing the Taj Mahal from here was so amazing as you can see the truth symmetry. Parts of the garden are maintained but the original site is kept as is. Very peaceful.",
          "According to our guide, this was the site where the Emperor planned to build a matching black Taj as his own tomb, complementing the white Taj built for is wife. He never got to build it. The site is a garden area (not very ornate by Western standards), just across the river",
          "A quite place just behind The Taj Mahal. This place is full of trees and flowers making it more beautiful. One can see back side of The Taj from here. But the view is very good. A must visit.",
          "at just Rs 15/- for indians its really a worth visiting this place. it looks lovely in sunset. you can click so many pics at leisure without so much of disturbance from crowds.. go there by 4.30pm relax in the lushful gardens and click photos with taj background.. but i think it",
          "The day before visiting the Taj at dawn we went to the Mehtab Bagh. The view across the river is stunning and the setting sun really shows off the Taj at its best. Lots of bird life to be seen on the river and in the gardens.",
          "We arrived at the garden around 16:30, took a look around and we were the fist to sat on the wall in the end of the gardens before the river. It was good to be the first one as we had Taj Mahal positioned in the centre! The sun set was around 6:15pm on the right of Taj Mahal",
          "Lovely to visit prior to getting up close to the Taj in the morning. Gardens are lovely and its so nice to see the sunset in the relative quiet (although busy with tourists). Well worth a visit.",
          "We visited this area on the day the Taj was closed. It supposedly has the ruins of another Taj they where going to build on the otherside of the river. A very peaceful place to relax",
          "It's a nicely done garden where you can wait to have the evening view of the Taj Mahal... Its mesmerizing to see the Taj from the riverside... You can wait in the garden and enjoy nature and scenery while waiting for the sunset.. .Though you would like to reach here a bit early",
          "These gardens are the place to be to see the Taj in evening. The Taj across the river seems to become the setting sunlight and people flock here as the sun goes down the number of people here go up. You have to pay to get in but it is worth it. There were some ladies working in",
          "No doubt it's a beautiful place to watch Taj Mahal in sunset.. but that's the only thing is great about it.",
          "This dirty, run down park/garden has a nice view of the \"back\" side of the Taj but the hype about sunset is silly. They herded us out of there before the sun actually set, and anyway it was April, the sun was NOT setting anywhere near the building.",
          "Very dusty when we visited but another good viewpoint for Taj photos. Late afternoon was quiet for a wander through the gardens.",
          "This is an ok garden but the views of the Taj across the river are brilliant. We arrived late afternoon and waited for the sunset which many other visited also did. You need to get there early enough to get a good position as it gets crowded but definitely worth the wait.",
          "These gardens/park are located on the opposite bank to the Taj Mahal and apparently where a similar tomb to the Taj was to be built for Shah Jahan himself. The ruins/foundations to this structure still remain. This is a popular place to view the Taj Mahal during sunset as the",
          "This is what you do at sunset on day before you visit the Taj. See it from across the river. Well recommended. Get there around 4.30-5pm. It costs 200 rupees to enter. Great views of Taj Mahal",
          "I loved seeing the Taj Mahal from the river side during the day. It was beautiful to be able to see the Taj and be in the garden and enjoy nature at the same time and be able to grasp just how magical Agra is...",
          "It's a quaint place built into a park with a nominal fee and an excellent view of the Taj Mahal from across the River Yamuna. Would suggest going here very early in the morning so that you can see the first rays of the sun fall on the Taj.",
          "Mehtab Bagh is a historic park built by Mughals. It is situated on the bank of Yamuna river other than that of the Taj Mahal. Mehtab Bagh is often visited to have a sunset view of the Taj or to have a view of Taj on the days it is closed, such as Fridays. Mehtab Bagh can be",
          "very disappointing. All this has is a view across the river at the Taj. The gardens are well kept but very sparse, and they water by flooding - so expect to get wet! At 200 rupee's it's a rip off. Spend your money on going to the baby Taj instead, way better",
          "These gardens have been let go over the years but are now being worked on. Wonderful view of the Taj anytime of day.",
          "Lots of tourists here to see the sunset. However, due to the pollution, you don\u2019t get a proper sunset....it just sinks into the brown murkiness. However, still a really good spot to see a different perspective of the Taj. Nice photos.",
          "This is basically a dilapidated park that charges a hefty 200 rupees for nothing (15 for Indians), except the view of the Taj. FYI, the Taj view in the morning from inside the complex is 100 times better. Totally disappointing and not worth the trip.",
          "The gardens are nothing to remember but the view on the Taj from this side of the river is worth the small detour, especially if you have your own mean of transportation as you can\u2019t really go there easily. Given that they ask for an entrance fee, they could finish the small",
          "Beautiful gardens provide an incredible view - stunning first full-on view of the Taj Mahal. So peaceful despite throngs of people.",
          "Please Agra - make this site worthy of a tourist attraction. Rather messy and a bit scruffy - was expecting it to be a much grander garden. View of Taj different, wasn't much water in the river, so night reflections would not have been good.",
          "This garden provides a view of the back of the Taj Mahal. Nothing fancy, just another normal garden. Can be given a miss. Entry Fees-30 Rs.(Indian)",
          "This is the rear view of the taj garden is across the river yamuna , some excavation sites along with a garden with lovely flowers . If you want to take pictures without having people walking into your frame it is advisable to come at dusk or dawn to get some mesmerizing views",
          "It is pretty far from the city. Happened to have a sandstorm that day, and view of taj mahal was blur. Attraction itself has limited offering, except for the taj mahal view",
          "Gives a nice view of Taj mahal from other side. Picturesque. Prominent for Sun set and Moonlight views. There was also a story that Shahjahan tried to build Black Taj Mahal after completion of the Taj and was over thrown by his son Aurangzeb. The remains of the structures can be",
          "The mehtab bagh is a 25 acre garden that is located in front of the Taj Mahal. The ticket price is $200 ruppes which is around 3 usd the place is small but you can see a different view of the Taj Mahal a non crowded place. It is said that this place was build before the Taj",
          "Very nice to watch the sunset but come early around 4:30 to get a good spot. The ticket is a bit expensive just to watch a sunset (200 roupies). We found out after that it is possible to access the garden for free using another entrance.",
          "Nice garden with one of the best views of the Taj Mahal. This is where the mysterious Black Taj Mahal should have been built.",
          "Mehtab Bagh is just behind Taj Mahal. By road it is 10 kms away from Taj. One can get a view of Taj.",
          "Since it's a bit of an effort to get to this park, it's not very crowded at all (at least not on a weekday). Quiet and largely empty, we sat under the shade of a tree and spent about an hour just chatting and gazing at the splendor of the Taj Mahal.",
          "its on ban of river yamuna having good garden with beautiful collection of flowers enjoy with friends and have fun",
          "This needs to be viewed before the Taj. It is very pretty and intricate and the carvin* is absolutely stunning. It\u2019s a miracle it was preserved . The gardens around it were nice",
          "It is poorly maintained now. It is located at the back of yamuna river. One can view the Taj Mahal from here. This garden is from the Mughal era times.",
          "Located on the opposite side of the river, Mehtab Bagh or Moonight Garden is an ideal place to see the sunset at the Taj Mahal. There are also architectural ruins of a building originally designed to complement the Taj Mahal, but was never completed. The gardens themselves",
          "It is at back of taj Mahal on bank of Yamuna river having good collection of flowers nice to se it in morning so enjoy it",
          "Just a lovely alternative place to see Taj Mahal especially at sunset. Really nice to see both sides",
          "Although the garden itself is nothing special, it is pleasant and peaceful in the late afternoon and presents a lovely view of the Taj from across the Yamuna River. We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and the families also relaxing in the garden which provides a large open space",
          "If you are planning your visit to taj mahal mehtab bagh is another must visit destination. Last of the mughal gardens Though not much to talk about the beautiful peaceful garden but it\u2019s very close to Taj mahal.",
          "Reaching at Mehtab Bagh can be difficult but must visit to see Taj from across River. Please take care of opening and closing hrs.",
          "great place for early morning photos of the Taj just across the river. gives you the Taj at its best.",
          "A nice area to watch the sunset and to get another angle and perspective of the beautiful Taj Mahal.",
          "We were here during our Agra tour. It was a running stopover. Wonderful view of the Taj from the gardens.",
          "Actually, this is a mix of styles. It\u00b4s a spectacular place because is empty of tourist, very quiet, on the riverside of Yamuna, with interesting designs. A lot of trees and plants and flowers. You can also see the Taj.",
          "It was supposed to build another taj mahal of black stone. but couldnot be built. just opposite to the taj mahal on the bank of yamuna",
          "From the gardens you can view the Taj Mahal from the other side of the river. The gardens are simple and there are some ruined areas near the river. We visited the gardens before going to the Taj Mahal at sunrise the next day. It was a lovely taster of what was to come. Worth a",
          "Its only a few 10's of rupees to get in & wasn't too busy when we went. The main mausoleum gets very crowded, which doesn\u2019t allow one to soak in the magnificence of the Taj Mahal. Visiting the moonlight garden, the Mehtab Bagh provides this. It's a quadrilateral complex",
          "Came at sunset for the view of the Taj Mahal. Though the weather proved cloudy, this site was worth the stop.",
          "It is just behind the Taj Mahal. We did not visit it but saw from taj mahal . it was supposed to make another taj mahal here",
          "Such beautiful gardens and a great view of the Taj Mahal. We paid a fraction of the cost to take some lovely photos of the Taj from the gardens.",
          "This place is located directly across the river from the Taj Mahal, and gives you a fantastic view, great for photos. The park is also pretty peaceful and relaxing, a good place to just wander and enjoy the peace for an hour or two.",
          "This as our driver described it is the backside of the Taj, true to his word the area leading up to it is terrible so be prepared. Unfortunately when we visited it was very foggy so our views were spoilt, i am sure on a better day the views of the Taj would be stunning.",
          "The Moonlight Gardens, across the river from the Taj give you an excellent view especially in the evening light. It is a really good pre-visit and worth the time.",
          "This is a place which is not known by many but is the which one should definitely visit when in Agra. This is a big garden on back side of Taj Mahal. One has a clear unobstructed view of Taj and can also see Yamuna river. It is very peaceful and quiet. One can spend hours at",
          "Its location is Taj mahal back side park. Lots of flowers and greenre in park. Food not allowed in park Thanks rajiv verma",
          "As we chose to visit Taj Mahal early morning next day & this place was among the last place of sight seeing tour. The garden itself is not great & popular for seeing the Taj Mahal from the opposite side. The river Yamuna is crossing centrally between the Taj Mahal & Mehtab Bag a",
          "Taj is crowded. Unless you are a senior govt official, a visiting dignitary or from the army stationed inside Taj, you will probably never get a photo of the Taj without people :-) Mehtab Bagh is a place where you can. Surprisingly not many go there. It is behind the taj on the",
          "Our guide brought us here at sunset the day before we actually went into the Taj Mahal. I personally liked strolling these gardens across the river from the Taj. The history picked my imagination which only made the day of more spectacular. Just over grown and some manicured",
          "These gardens are perfect to see the sunset on the Taj, they are still in progress as they have only recently been discovered but were originally built for the Sultan to view the Taj that he had built.",
          "The park itself is worth visiting because you get a nice view of the Taj. But what stroke us was the road to the park. It is pure India! Poor neighborhoods, tempts with people living inside, filthy water, monkeys, a place where they are burning the dead, here you can really see",
          "We went to Mehtab Bagh as we were not able to completely see the Taj Mahal because of heavy fog during republic day weekend time. This one is also a less crowded attraction and currently in a renovation phase. At the one side of Yamuna river is this garden and on the other side",
          "Has a beautiful view of the back side of the Taj. The view has Yamuna river and across that is the beautiful Taj. A must vusit if you want to see a different scene",
          "An excellent view of the Taj from across the river. Definitely need a car to get there. The setting is green & relaxing without the crowds of the Taj. Lots of photo ops! We were there around 3 pm and lighting was very good for photos. If you want to see this architectural",
          "I had seen the Taj Mahal several times before but never had the chance to go to Mehtab Bagh, the garden across the Yamuna, for a different view of the Taj. The trees in bloom were lovely and it was great to see the Taj from a different perspective and without the crowds. It is",
          "If bounded by time, please skip this place. Nothing to view here. Black base of proposed Black Taj can be seen here.",
          "200 rupees to enter but the gardens are wonderful and peaceful to walk round. The ruins are interesting and there are some good views of the Taj Mahal.",
          "I am not sure if it's because of the time I visited but I was not impressed by this garden. While you could see the Taj Mahal from a different angle, there's nothing much more. The garden was just ordinary at my time of visit and the place was quite foggy.",
          "Went here in the afternoon and was very disappointed. Apart from the view to the Taj Mahal there really isn't anything else to see. It would have been ok if it had been free but having to pay 200 rupees each simply wasn't worth it.",
          "The trees, shrubs and the bushes are pretty ordinary and it seems they haven't been looked after since a long time. I went there for sunset with an Australian friend and its sad that they charged her Rs. 200/- For this kind of maintenance it is very expensive although they",
          "We were planning to visit the Taj Mahal the next day, but decided to visit the \u201cgardens\u201d directly across the river from the Taj near sunset. Perhaps, this was a garden at some point, but now it\u2019s overgrown and a ruin. HOWEVER, views of the Taj Mahal are incredible. You can take",
          "The Mehtab-Bagh, also known as the Moon Gardens, is a lush green garden of rows of trees, flowers, and bushes. After walking inside, go all the way to the back of the gardens and there is a dilapidated wall that offers great views over to the rear side of the Taj Mahal. If the",
          "Good place for photography of Taj on back side during Sunrise & Sunset. It would be best place to view Taj on full moon day.",
          "This place is perfect for budget travellers as you can see the backview of taj for 200 rupees this place is perfect for evening chill session",
          "Across the river from the Taj is the lesser known Baby Taj, smaller but none the less impressive than the Taj itself. Beautifully kept gardens and somehow more serene than its bigger cousin, probably because there are far less numbers of tourists. A mausoleum again built out of",
          "The area of this park (Moon Park) immediately opposite the Taj Mahal is under renovation and I am sure it will look lovely when finished BUT at the moment (1/1/18) looks like a building site. Entrance fee is R200 (\u00a32.50 approx.) and arrival takes about 15 minutes by car after",
          "Another peaceful spot to get away from the hustle of Agra. This one with great views of the Taj, as just across the river from it. Make sure you get a ticket when you pay as guards often pocket cash (apparently, according to our cab driver). Nice park area, well maintained. Some",
          "These relatively unknown gardens were designed by Shah Jahan to provide a view of the Taj from across the Yamuna. Restoration of the gardens began some years back and they do provide a wonderful panoramic view of the Taj. Side note: there is no historical evidence for the so",
          "Such a nice place for explain wild life sanctuaries and animal husbandry. Nice place for spending a bit time with nature as well as with family.",
          "A Nice place for a clear view of the monument with the river Jamuna in the foreground. The gardens of Mehtab bagh are nothing great but are kept trimmed. Good spot for photographing the Taj during sunrise and sunset. Full moon time will make a great viewing from this side of the",
          "That\u2019s what it\u2019s there for. The gardens aren\u2019t much but the view is to die for. Defo make the effort",
          "This is a sweet spot to view Taj (with no crowd). Also from a photography viewpoint, this is a good sport to capture pictures of Taj at a distant (but not so distant) without the crowd.",
          "It was lovely to see the Taj Mahal from the Gardens across the river looking back towards the Taj in the morning mist. It gave you a surreal moment. Priceless.",
          "If you have time, do visit Mehtab Bagh. You get excellent views (great if you are a photographer), and if you visit this place first without visiting Taj, then it can greatly whet your appetite.",
          "Unfortunately this place opens at 10.00hrs. Personal request to India Tourism & UP tourism to open this place at Sunrise and make camping provisions with tents on full moon nights. My preferred time for visit is morning because sunrays falling on Taj & you give some",
          "The least visited of the main sites in Agra this is still worth a visit. The simplest yet also the most enchanting, you get to wander around the small tomb and mosque almost on your own. Do visit and ensure that this does not get forgotten amidst the Taj clamour.",
          "Yes,this is an awesome and ideal place for photography exclusively for the great taj mahal. a paradise for the photographers.no hussle bussle,no struggle for an entry inside taj mahal,no touts,no frisking by security guard and last but not the least, no worry you will be able to",
          "Arriving to the Mehtab Bagh for sunset was a great way of seeing the Taj from across the river. Couldn't wait to visit the Taj early the next morning. A perfect way to wet the appetite...",
          "Beautiful view of Taj with Yamuna river. Wait for sunset view to get excellent photos. Poorly maintain garden. Archaeological India and UP government must be sleeping.",
          "I proposed to my girlfriend here. It was wonderful and turned out my best decision. Good place for photo-shooting programs. You have Best view of Taj mahal from Mehtab bagh.",
          "This place is out of the city but only 10 min.you can see Taj mahal frome here.I had great time here coz it was the place that my fiance propse me.we hired a photographer for taking couple shoots coz here is not crowded and have beautiful nature and Taj view.I have to say it is",
          "Mehtab bagh is known from king shahjahan and very peaceful place where you can imagine how they live in the romantic evening",
          "Just the drive through the streets to get to this part of Agra is worth it, you will see a different world and hopefully appreciate yours. The gardens are great and then you turn to the right and you see the majestic Taj Mahal. A very quiet place to reflect and get away from",
          "It is the unhindered view of the Taj from across the river Yamuna without the maddening crowds that gives this place the edge. For some unexplained sarkari reason they wont allow tripod stands for cameras inside the park. The bagh is crying out for proper maintenance. Hope the",
          "I would highly recommend visiting this park purely for the spectacular sunset views overlooking the Yamuna river and the Taj Mahal. Entrance is only RS 200, the park itself is not the greatest or greenest but people don\u2019t come here to look at the plants. Arrive 45 minutes",
          "Situated on the opposite side of Taj Mahal, it give a great view of Taj. Built much before Taj by Babar, it was recreated & beautified for Taj",
          "It was originally built by Babur much before Taj was built, however it was recreated keeping the beauty of Taj in mind. You will get an ultimate view of Taj from here.",
          "We came here for our first view of the taj which was amazing. Lots of work has been done so far to bring this park up to standard and it is nice - although it will be amazing once they also reinstate the fountain at at the taj view spot",
          "We visited in the evening, around an hour or so before Sunset to get decent photos of the Taj Mahal; it is a lovely spot and worth a visit prior to entering the Taj Mahal.",
          "It is well worth the half hour tuk tuk ride to get here. There is an entrance fee of 200 rupees and there are guards and security. A short walk through the gardens and the views are amazing for sunset.",
          "If you have come to Agra, you should not miss this wonderful garden which gives you a back view of the magnificent Taj Mahal",
          "This is a place to start with. You can see the great Taj Mahal from the backside and you know what you will come to. A good place to start.",
          "Again what can I say, it give the full experience of what Agra has to offer. allows you the opportunity to get a real feel for Agra and its history",
          "Mehtab Bagh ( moonlight garden ) is another of Babur's work's. The garden is directly opposite the Taj Mahal & is aligned with it's garden. It is a Char bagh with grass paths & good plantings of trees & bushes in the 4 gardens. There is very little in the way of any",
          "It's a great place to visit so peaceful and the best part of this place is that it's situated at the back of Taj Mahal.",
          "You can see the Taj across the river, if the smog permits!!!! Maybe this is a good place to see it in the evening in moonlight, but during the day it's not really worthwhile. To call this a garden is a bit of an overstatement.",
          "This is the place to visit prior to visiting the Taj itself. You get a great view from across the river - check smog levels first!! On a bad day, you would barely be able to see the Taj but if the haze and smog are not too bad, this is the place to be at sunset.",
          "Across the river at the rear of the Taj Mahal. Got us closer to the Taj, which was good, but the days being so hazy at this time of year, there was barely any sun let alone a spectacular sunset to be seen. As far as gardens go they were pretty average and with the hordes of",
          "The gate itself is impressive, but who are we kidding? You only see it because it\u2019s on the way to the Taj Mahal! Most tourists are drawn to take the first Taj pictures from immediately after the gate, but I recommend to way and walk 200m further for better results especially in",
          "Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays. We reached Agra on a Friday and Mehtab bagh provided an opportunity to view the rear of the Taj. We visited Taj the following day. Fairly well maintained garden where you can soak in the Taj. It is barricaded at the river bank and you cannot reach",
          "We went here at sunset the night before seeing the Taj at sunrise. It's neat to see it at different times of the day.",
          "I got up early to see the sunrise and Taj Mahal from Mehtab Bagh. I enjoyed the early morning ride there with a guide and driver. The garden must have been impressive once and is still neat, mostly lawn between all the trees. There are some ruins and a corner building still",
          "We were so delighted to be taken here especially after seeing the Taj early morning. My wife and I had a hard time leaving the Taj behind since it\u2019s the most amazing man made construction we both ever witnessed and having this opportunity later that day, was amazing. Especially",
          "We arrived on Friday when the Taj Mahal is closed. Desperate for an early peak, this park was perfect. It is the rear view of the Taj but because the dimensions are symmetrical you get a great feel for the place. Unfortunately at the time of writing, there was scaffolding on the",
          "One of the many wonders of India you get the pleasure of exploring on a tour. an oasis in a sea of chaos. A joy to wander around & contemplate.",
          "Lovely gardens and we visited them at dusk as a preview to the Taj. Unfortunately it was extremely busy but it did give us a taste of what we would see the next day. If not for our tour guide we would have had no real idea about the place and the ruins of what would have been a",
          "I visited this place with my team on 2nd October for swachta mission. I felt very bad seeing that people throw garbage at such a nice place. It being a tourist place we should be careful about the cleanliness. My team conducted a cleanliness drive here. The view of the taj is",
          "After visiting the Taj at dawn, we chose to watch the sun go down at Mehtab Bagh. it was our last day of sightseeing in India, and gave us the perfect end to the holiday. Along with lots of other travellers, watching the sun go down and the colours of the Taj changing, it was",
          "Note: Appreciate the review by Mr. Ricardo, Congrats! ## For the View of Taj! ## About 7 km from Agra Fort ( & Taj Mahal) ## Frm here we can have a close view of Taj ## Best in the early hours of morning or after 5 PM. ## The sunlight changes (sun gets lower and",
          "My main purpose for going to these gardens is to view the Taj Mahal from across the river. Going on a Friday provides great Taj views without people as it is closed that day. Going earlier in the morning will be preferable to the later afternoon when I visited to capture better",
          "Best way to get there is by tuktuk, it\u00b4s about 7 km from Agra Fort and around taj Mahal we see it very close but no way to cross the river, even if you see a boat they are not allowed to get to the banks. Entrance fee is 200 rupees for foreigners. Go early in the morning or",
          "Mehtab bagh is a entry place of taj mahal mahtab bagh is. So beautiful mahtab bagh is awsm lovely. So beautiful place",
          "Mehtab Bagh is located inside tajmahal. It is well known for its luscious green gardens and scenic view. Camel and horse ride right outside the venue available. It has a lot of varieties of flowers.",
          "Virgin place .. perfect place for sunset . Romantic not much of crowd ... good place for photographers .. a must visit sight .",
          "Very nice park across the river from the Taj Mahal. Highly recommend a late afternoon visit to catch the Taj at sunset. Not terribly crowed and you can get some great shots. A beautiful view of a beautiful structure. Do not be late as the park closes at sunset.",
          "This garden dates back several centuries during the Moghul era. Built by Moghul rulers for a close beautiful view of Taj Mahal, the vast as has greenery that looks lovely. Also some historic structures can be seen as ruins now. The access to this garden is through narrow",
          "Opposite the Taj Mahal, Mehtab Bagh offers an alternative view of the Taj, surrounded by lush and expansive gardens.",
          "This is a good place to go on an evening other than a Friday, when it gets crowded as the Taj Mahal is closed on that day. You get to view the Taj Mahal from across the river and it can be a pleasant place for an hour or so.",
          "There is not a great deal here, except the ruins and some gardens. What you do get is a different view of the Taj Mahal from the other side of the river. We visited at sunset, with lovely views set against the fading light. Worth going if you have an hour available.",
          "This is such an amazing place... we went here for pre-wedding shoot and I am glad that we found this place... this is even far better than being in Taj itself.. One must visit during sunrise n sunset to capture the best possible pictures for lifetime. :)",
          "If your guide is taking you for the view on Taj Mahal at sunset, don't expect too much. From Mehtab Bagh, the park on the other bank of the Yamuna river (entrance fee = 200 rupees per person), you have indeed a very nice view on the Taj. But the sun is not going down behind the",
          "The Mehtab Bagh offers amazing view of the Taj Mahal. We visited at sunset and sat and relaxed in the peaceful garden. The women of the Mehtab Bagh gardens do some incredible work and will always smile for a picture \ud83d\ude00 the price for entry is 200rs which is great value for the",
          "We visited the gardens on our first evening in Agra and the view of the Taj in the evening sunlight was beautiful. It certainly whetted our appetite for visiting the Taj itself the next morning. The Yamuna river was fairly low so we could not get good pictures of the Taj",
          "There are nice gardens and a good view of the Taj Mahal across the river. We were disappointed not to be able to get closer to the waterfront. We went at sunset, which was disappointing due to the cloud / fog - it didn't compare to seeing the Taj from up close or at sunrise.",
          "Smaller scale but still a good trip and worth a visit. Interesting historical buildin. It was hard to get to as the roads on the way from the centre of Agra are very busy so we were in the car most of the time, just one of those things as it was a busy day and in the afternoon,",
          "Cost is 200 to get in, which is fine. The place is a little run down and could be made a lot nicer but the view is beautiful",
          "Visited at sunrise, to see the Taj Mahal from behind. It was amazing, great unobstructed views with the river in the foreground. Also has the footings for what is said to have been the site for the unfinished 'black taj'.",
          "If you are coming to Agra, you are undoubtedly planning to see the Taj Mahal, but add this side trip into your plans to see the Taj from the river side. If you get the timing right to see this at sunset, it's special. The grounds are beautiful and our guide told us that there",
          "Even if you are in a hurry to rush to the Taj and tick one item in your bucket list, take some time to visit the Mehtabh Bagh, a garden on the Northern bank of the Yamuan facing the Taj. While the garden itself is not remarkable, the view of the Taj is. The guide was telling us",
          "This place is located on the other side of yamuna, behind the Taj Mahal, but what may seem near, is around 15kms drive from taj. The location is a bit remote, but the place is nice and quite, and also away from the hectic crowds.",
          "Whenever we think of Taj Mahal, a picture from the front side of the Taj comes to our mind. From this garden on the other side of river Yamuna will give another perspective which is also equally mesmerizing. Sunset time is preferable, and if we are lucky you may see a perfect",
          "Rumoured to be the place where the Black Taj Mahal was to be built, theses gardens are beautiful to watch the sun go down with the Taj Mahal just across from the river. The grounds are well kept.",
          "Mehtab Bagh ( Moon Garden ) is Located Opposite of the Taj Mahal.. It is a charbagh style Mughal garden.. There is many stories about this place.. It is said that there is a foundation of Black Taj Mahal also.. Apart of all these stories I will recommend to visit Mehtab Bagh for",
          "We by mistake reached Agra on Friday, forgetting that entry to Tajmahal will be closed on Friday. As we had our further train tickets booked so we were not in a position to extend our stay. We are happy that atleast from Mehtab bag, we could see Taj from distance. But I will",
          "There are different versions of the history of this archaeological structure. What ever said viewing of Taj mahal from here is a feast to the eyes",
          "This place is run down. Nothing here but a good view if the Taj. Would not recommend unless you have time to kill.",
          "It is called moonlight garden, located opposite of the Taj Mahal complex across Yamuna river in Agra. It is a charbagh style square shaped Mughal garden. The park was reconstructed and is now one the best places from which to view the great mausoleum Taj Mahal. Now it's a place",
          "This is a bagh located inside tajmahal.it has a lot of varieties of flowers. It present a beautiful view for the eyes.",
          "Afternoon to evening will be a very suitable time to visit here. Should visit before Taj cause once you visit the taj then it has no beauty. This is the place where you can be closest to taj from outside of Taj. Can have a good photo session.",
          "Winding your way down the narrow and often crowded 'gallis' of Agra, one reaches the relatively less crowed Mehtab Baag which is a Mughal Garden. Designed across the Yamuna from the Taj, it is in total symmetry to the gardens of the Taj on the other side of the Yamuna. The",
          "Came here to expect sunset but sky and time did not cooperate but was still able to shoot a moon over the Taj.",
          "We came here on both evenings we were in Agra. Our driver brought us the first night and we asked him to bring us back on the second night. It's a great place to view the Taj at sunset. The gardens are relaxing and we just chilled out while being able to look at one of the most",
          "We arrived for a sunset Taj photo but was not fortunate enough to have one. But the garden, with many different bird chirping away, surely is nice to visit. The Taj is closed on Fridays (when we arrived), but a stroll with the Taj's profile was nice.",
          "Unfortunately, it was a hazy day for my visit. The view of the Taj Mahal was superb. Try for a clear morning if pos.",
          "Mehtab Bagh, which lies right opposite to the Taj Mahal offers a breathtaking view of the Taj that you absolutely need to witness. Mehtab Bagh is well-known for its luscious green gardens and scenic view because of which it has been vouched for a lot of iconic bollywood movies,",
          "The Mehtab Bagh place is full of flowers and garden. The Garden is closed at 5:30 PM. Taj Mahal view was excellent from this place. Worthy visit.",
          "This is a garden across the river from the Taj Mahal. What makes this place popular is that you get a nice view of the back of Taj Mahal, thus allowing for nice photo ops in this place. There are few people that come here, so it's easier to take good pictures of the Taj Mahal",
          "A great view of the Taj Mahal from this park. If you arrive in Agra late afternoon, this is a good place to visit if you want to see the Taj without the crowds. The park is easy to get to by tuk tuk but traffic on the roads is chaotic, last entry is at 6.30pm. It costs 200INR to",
          "Beautiful place full of flowers and natural beauty and have good sunset view and Tak Mahal can be seen easily.",
          "The garden is closed on 5:30. Very few tourists here. You cannot reach the river bank from here. There are 2 ruins inside the garden. There are a lot of green trees and plants inside the garden. Outside of it, you can find some booths, selling Coke and ice-cream.",
          "I loved this place. A great way to cap off the day with beautiful views of these Taj. I could really see in my mind Shah Jahan strolling these gardens.",
          "If you want to have great views from Taj Mahal and a great sunset this is a place to visit. It is unforgettable.",
          "Do not expect anything special at this place. It is a land that seems to be a garden but in where there are only small trees and shrubs, and it needs much more care. There are some ruins, supposedly of what may have been the tomb of the builder of the Taj Mahal. It is across the",
          "Do you want to avoid crowd? Do you want to take good photo of Taj Mahal? Do you want to see the sunset? Then Methab Bagh is the place that you want to go. It is right across the Taj Mahal, oppoosite bank of Yamuna River. 200 Rs to get inside.",
          "Here you can see the back of tajamahal a sign of love ... You can spend time with your loved ones here ... Nice park nd nice view",
          "The Mehtab Bagh is situated opposite the Taj Mahal. It's a well maintained garden whose main attraction is the view of the Taj from the back. If you need a view of the monument without the jostling of the crowd, Mehtab Bagh is where you should go. Sunset time is also a good time",
          "We went to Mehtab Bagh at around 5:20 am to catch the sunrise. One day before that, we were in the Taj Mahal and I can say I enjoyed Mehtab Bagh a little more, because there were no tourists and I could take a lot better pictures and better apprciation at the beautiful palace",
          "It costs 200 rupees for foreigners and it provides a very peaceful place to sit and look at the Taj Mahal. Really good to get a photo without the scaffolding in because of the renovation work being done at the moment. The gardens are well kept and would be much nicer when the",
          "Pretty nice and clean garden with a great view to the Taj and easy access to the riverbank of Yamuna. It is full of squirrels and birds, nice flowers. The entry fee is fair, however it is 14 times more expensive if you are a tourist.:) There are plenty sets for taking photos.",
          "We found the lack of crowds, the symmetrical rows of plantings and the view-- well worth the short drive. You can actually enjoy the Taj without being pushed out of the way for someone else's selfie!",
          "Mehtab bagh is a beautiful place across the Yamuna River as an ideal location for viewing the Taj Mahal.",
          "Loved this place but in hindsight we should have gone to Taj 1st. The view from these gardens of the back of the Taj are really good and in fairness you get relatively close. However when we went to see the Taj at 6 the following morning it was a case of we had had a good view",
          "Mehtab Bagh shuts down at 7 and the last entry to this bagh is at 6.30pm. You definitely get an unhindered view of the beautiful Taj but the view isnt as beautiful as the pictures describe.",

          "This is an ideal place to see the Taj Mahal in a different view. A tuc tuc ride to the park and a view across the river at the Taj in all its glory. Not really a sunset as you're looking south but still a nice place to sit and reflect away from the crowds. Cost is 200IRs and",
          "Too overpriced for foreigners. If you're here for a view for the Taj there are other areas in the vicinity that will allow for decent pictures. Not really worth the price of admission if you're coming from a different country.",

          "Not maintained well but visit during sunset to relax and refresh after visiting local sight scenes of Agra.",
          "This is the best place to see the beauty of the Taj without having to deal with the crowd and the lines and guides. Visit this garden early in the morning or evening and get unobstructed view of the Taj and adjacent monuments. You will need a car from your hotels but this garden",
          "A definite must see. Go at sunset so that you get to see the Taj Mahal in that special light. Take the time to smell the flowers. The beautiful scents will make you forget that you are in Agra.",
          "A beautiful and massive garden with a simple layout and great views of the Taj. Romantic couples will definitely enjoy a visit to this serene place.",
          "Go here for views of the Taj Mahal...it's worth it. It costs 200 INR for a foreigner but it's worth the price. The unobstructed view of the Taj is unparalleled. The garden itself is nice but nothing amazing....go for the Taj view.",
          "Best place to get a view of the Taj with next to no people. The grounds are also very beautiful. I believe it is under water for part of the monsoon, say may be worth checking before heading out there.",
          "The black taj mahal was supposed to be build here and the foundation is clearly visible. It offers a view of the taj without the hassle of going through so many people. Must try for all Taj fans",

          "The garden itself is not a WOW and the authorities could do much better at maintaining it however the view of Taj over the river is beautiful. Not so crowded so it is a great place to relax, read a book or take good pictures at sunset or sunrise.",
          "A big garden opposite TAJ, Not nicely maintained but gives a great view of the monument. Could be avoided visiting it.",

          "Go here for sunset or sunrise. Won't be disappointed. Picture from sunrise attached. Tripods not allowed which is a bummer. But view is great. Direct view of taj mahal north face.",
          "Mehtab bagh is the place which is just opposite to Taj Mahal and is a place from where you get an unobstructed view of theTaj and one also doesn't encounter the huge crowds otherwise found at the Taj. It is also the place where the foundation stone was laid for a black Taj Mahal",
          "Instead of entering Taj, one must go to Mehtab Bagh and enjoy the magnificent view of Taj uninterrupted. Its also a great place for clicking pictures.",
          "We were asked by our guide if we wanted to go here to view the Taj at sunset and of course we said yes as the travel to Agra was because this was a bucket list spot. We later could understand why our guides asked these questions because in India as a foreign tourist every place",
          "People use to go at this place to see taj from opposite side from the banks of Yamuna River. You will get various pics of this place but it is not currently In that shape. Also, if you are during sunset, you will find Taj very dull in color. One can enjoy this place if he/she",
          "We decided not to go into the Taj Mahal for sunset but see it from the other side of the river. Excellent choice as it was cheaper (200INR pp) and much quieter and spiritual, with the Moon gardens being a pleasant bonus. Even the drive there was interesting through the village.",
          "Taj from other side. Its less maintained garden right across the Yamuna river. Usually very less populated and site for some snaps with Taj . It was supposed site for the black Taj by shahjahan according to folklore which never materialized. So may be 5 to 10 minute spot.",
          "The view of the Tajmahal from the fountain situated in this garden is best photographic place. It's forever memories with Taj. Good and maintained garden but not much attractive in summer season.",
          "Since Taj Mahal is closed on every Friday so this is an ideal place from where you can have good photographs of sunset/sunrise from backside of Taj Mahal. The Mehtab Bagh garden was the last of eleven Mughal-built gardens along the Yamuna opposite the Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort",

          "This was a quiet and peaceful way to end our hectic day of sight seeing. The view of the taj was excellent and the gardens were pretty enough. We did have to pay 400rps each to enter which I though was a bit much for what is essentially a view of the taj but if it goes towards",

          "The Mehtab Bagh (park/gardens) is well worth a visit, specially later in the day, before sunset - the view of the Taj Mahal from over the river gives another fabulous perspective of this wonderful World Heritage.",
          "This is the garden across the river from the Taj Mahal where the Mughal was going to built his black burial site. His son put an end to this project and he is buried at the Taj next to his wife.",
          "Our tour guide told us this was the sight of what would have been the black Taj Mahal, so they started with the grounds and outside wall, there are ruins there but the outline of what the Taj Mahal gardens look like and the way it's laid out is perfect, the king was imprisoned",
          "Mehtab Bagh is a must visit for the best views of the Taj Mahal. Unfortunately the \"bagh\" which means garden is not the best kept however it is known for its breathtaking views of the Taj. Best time to visit is Sunrise or Sunset.",
          "Located on other side of river yamuna opposite the Taj , it is not as crowded as Taj . Offers good photo opportunity with Taj in background. Good place for children to run around and enjoy in winter day . If you've visited Taj earlier visit here to avoid long queues and crowds.",
          "if you visit the mehtab bagh, don't forget to visit during sunrise and sunset. the views are just spectacular. i fell in love with the taj mahal view from this spot. it is not close to taj, a short drive, but it is pretty. also the garden is very beautiful for couple pictures",
          "One of my favorite view of Taj is from here. But I would suggest in summers to visit the place early in the morning or after 4:30pm",
          "This is a bit of drive from the centre of Agra on the other side of the Yamuna river, but definitely worth a trip for the new perspective. Very peaceful place to see the Taj from away from the hustle and bustle of central Agra.",
          "This is a nice and beautiful garden for evening strolls. It is quite well maintained and the Taj backdrop provides a magnificent feel to it.",
          "To watch Sunset in Agra??? You must go Mehtab Bagh and you will get Sunset with Jamuna & Serenity!! View of Taj mahal from here is also worthy. In my opinion one of Must visit place along with family or friends.",

          "There is no a garden, only some trees and ruins. The Tah Mahal's views is a worth see. It's important to hire one drive (tuc-tuc) to go and back to the city. We hired one for 350 rupees. It's expensive to hire a tuc-tuc on the site to back to downtown.",
          "But if you can do everything, than see the Taj Mahal from Mehtab Bagh at sunset too. It is a nice add on (and a nice souvenir picture)",
          "Taj is a wonder and looking at it from various angles gives different perspective and reveals different beauty. So not much to see at Mehtab Bagh, but worth visiting to see Taj from other side of Yamuna during sunset.",
          "It's definitely worth a visit as it gives you a different perspective of the amazing Taj Mahal. The garden is very calm and peaceful and a good way to relax and enjoy taj away from the crowd",

          "These gardens are nothing special - but at least clean. You have to pay 200 rupees to go in and the gardens have only really been made so that you can ge a view of the Taj. Tourists go there at sunset to take photos of the Taj - not sure if we really understood why taking photos",

          "This is essentially a massive garden with a nice view of the Taj. Didn't expect to have to pay, but it's only 200/300 rupee (can't remember which) and it goes towards conservation so that others can visit this lovely landmark. Only downside is that it's a bit out of the way, but",

        "wiki": "Tomb of I'tim\u0101d-ud-Daulah (I'tim\u0101d-ud-Daulah Maqbara) is a Mughal mausoleum in the city of Agra in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Often described as a \"jewel box\", sometimes called the \"Bachcha Taj\", the tomb of I'tim\u0101d-ud-Daulah is often regarded as a draft of the Taj Mahal.\nAlong with the main building, the structure consists of numerous outbuildings and gardens. The tomb, built between 1622 and 1628, represents a transition between the first phase of monumental Mughal architecture \u2013 primarily built from red sandstone with marble decorations, as in Humayun's Tomb in Delhi and Akbar's tomb in Sikandra \u2013 to its second phase, based on white marble and pietra dura inlay, most elegantly realized in the Taj Mahal.\nThe mausoleum was commissioned by Nur Jahan, the wife of Jahangir, for her father Mirz\u0101 Ghiy\u0101s Beg, originally a Persian Amir in exile, who had been given the title of I'tim\u0101d-ud-Daulah (pillar of the state). Mirz\u0101 Ghiy\u0101s Beg was also the grandfather of Mumt\u0101z Mah\u0101l (originally named Arjumand Bano, daughter of Asaf Khan), the wife of the emperor Shah Jahan, responsible for the construction of the Taj Mahal. Nur Jahan was also responsible for the construction of the Tomb of Jahangir in Lahore.\nIt is noticeable for the first use of pietra dura (floral design made up of semiprecious stone) technique.\n\n\n== Tomb ==\n\nLocated on the eastern bank of the Yamuna River, the mausoleum is set in a large cruciform garden criss-crossed by water courses and walkways. The mausoleum itself covers about twenty-three meters square, and is built on a base about fifty meters square and about one meter high. On each corner are hexagonal towers, about thirteen meters tall.\nThe walls are made up from white marble from Rajasthan encrusted with semi-precious stone decorations: cornelian, jasper, lapis lazuli, onyx, and topaz formed into images of cypress trees and wine bottles, or more elaborate decorations like cut fruit or vases containing bouquets. Light penetrates to the interior through delicate jali screens of intricately carved white marble. The interior decoration is considered by many to have inspired that of the Taj Mahal, which was built by her stepson, Mughal ruler Shah Jahan.\nMany of N\u016br Jah\u0101n's relatives are interred in the mausoleum. The only asymmetrical element of the entire complex is that the cenotaphs of her father and mother have been set side-by-side, a formation replicated in the Taj Mahal.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis is the tomb of Mirza Ghiyas Beg and his wife Asmat Beghum. He hailed from Iran and served Akbar. He was the father of the famous Nur-Jehan and grandfather of Mumtaz-Mahal of the Taj Mahal fame. He was made Vazir (Prime Minister) after Nur Jehan's marriage with Jehangir in 1611. He held the mansab of 7000/7000 and the title : \"I'timad-Ud-Daulah\" (The Lord treasurer). He died at Agra in 1622, a few months after his wife's death. Nur Jehan built this tomb for her parents between 1622 and 1628. Her own tomb and that of Jehangir are at Lahore.\nThe Tomb of I'timad-Ud-Daulah is a masterpiece of the domeless class of Mughal tombs. It is the first building finished in white marble and marks the transitional phase from red stone to white marble, from Akbar's tomb Sikandra to the Taj Mahal. It reflects the personality of the polished Iranian who lies buried here, and, more than that, the formal and ornamental character of its builder Nur Jehan who ruled the Mughal Empire from behind the curtain for 16 years (1611\u201327).\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe tomb, situated on the eastern bank of the river Jamuna, is planned in the centre of a Char-Bagh (four-quartered garden), with the usual enclosing walls and side buildings. As conditioned by its situation, the main gate is on the eastern side. Ornamental gateways with prominent lawns are built in the middle of north and south sides. A multi-storeyed open pleasure pavilion is there on the western side, overlooking the river impressively. These buildings are of red sandstone with bold inlaid designs in white marble.\nShallow water channels, sunk in the middle of the raised stone paved pathways, with intermittent tanks and cascades, divided the garden into four equal quarters. They are only slightly raised from the parterres which could be converted into flower beds. Space for large plants and trees was reserved just adjoining the enclosing walls, leaving the mausoleum fully open to view.\nThe main tomb of white marble is marvellously set in the centre of the garden. It stands on a plinth of red stone having in the middle of each side, facing the central arch, a lotus tank with fountain. The tomb is square in plan with octagonal towers, surmounted by chhatris, attached to its corners. Each facade has three arches: the central one providing the entrance, and the other two on the sides being closed by jalis. Each side is protected by a chhajja and a jali balustrade above it. There is no dome; instead the building is roofed by a square barahdari having three arched openings on each side which are closed by jalis except in the middle of the north and south sides. It is protected by a chhajja above which is the chaukhandi (pyramidal) roof, crowned by lotus petals and kalash finials. The interior is composed of a central square hall housing the cenotaphs of Asmat Begum, Mirza Ghiyas, four oblong rooms on the sides and four square rooms on the corners, all interconnected by common doorways. The cenotaph of Asmat Begum occupies the exact centre of the hall. Corner rooms have tombstones of Nur Jehan's other relations.\nThe most important aspect of this tomb is its polychrome ornamentation. Beautiful floral, stylized, arabesque and geometrical designs have been depicted on the whole exterior in inlay and mosaic techniques, in various pleasing tints and tones. Wine vase, dish and cup, cypress, honeysuckle, guldasta (flower bouquet) and such other Iranian motifs, typical of the art of Jehangir, have been emphatically used. Some compositions have been inspired by the plant studies of Ustad Mansur Naqqash, the famous \"fauna and flora\" painter of Jehangir. Some stylized designs have also been done in exquisite carving, both incised and relief. They look like embroidery work done in ivory. Delicacy is their quality. Stucco and painting have been done in the interior where minute animal and human figures have also been shown. The inspiration has come from the contemporary art of painting. There is no glazed tiling and the decoration is largely by coloured stones which is an indigenous development. By far, it is the most gorgeously ornamented Mughal building. It testifies that \"the Mughals began like Titans and finished like jewellers\"Template:Cite?. Chapters 48 and 73 of the Quran have been carved on the 64 panels on the external sides of the ground floor. The date of writing A.H. 1037/1627 A.D. is mentioned in the last panel. Chapter 67 of the Quran is inscribed on the 12 internal panels of the upper pavilion. \n\nThis is protected and conserved by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nItmad ud Daulah on YouTube\nPictures of Etimad-ud-Daulah's Tomb Pictures of Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb from a backpackers trip around India\nThe Tomb of Etimad-ud-Daula",

          "This is a more serene setting of a \"Baby Taj\" - Beautiful in its design. The lack of large crowds held add to the experience",
          "It is erroneously called the mini-Taj, but this is a diffferent monument in itself with a distinctive character. There is a gallery next to the ticket counter and it is advisable to read all about this monument at the gallery before venturing inside.",

          "Mugal emperor Shahjahan built this to honor his grandfather and all the family members. Shahjahan built this before Taj Mahal, so the simulation is strong, and people call this baby Mahal since the name \u201cItmad-ud-Daulah\u201d is hard to remember. Personally, I like this better than",
          "India has so many incredibly beautiful monuments, this is yet another one. This is definitely worth a visit. Called the Baby Taj, it is often forgotten by tourists so its worth visiting just to get away from the crowds. The tomb is detailed and quite beautiful in it's white",
          "This small tomb, yet very detailed in its decor, as a nice break from the bustling Agra Fort and Taj Mahal. It is sighted on the Yamuna river too and we had a great vantage point to view the many cows and street dogs cooling off in the river! It is easier to wander around in",
          "Worth a visit, 250r entry if you pay on card (300 otherwise) We visited in July and was very quiet. Nicknamed the baby Taj",
          "This tomb is much less visited than the Taj. It makes you appreciate the work and the precious stones in the Taj much better",
          "With such a glorious past Etmad ud daulla is not just another mughal building but it has its own story of love deciphered through beautiful inlay work and architectural wonder...!! A must visit place locally called Baby Taj but it has more to seesand observe than Taj Mahal",
          "Built in the decade before the Taj Mahal was started, this tomb is considered the prototype for what was to follow. It is beautiful. Well worth the time and tiny cost of entry. Much of the techniques used in the decoration of the Taj Mahal can be seen here though not as",
          "I liked the Tomb of Itmad... Also known as \"baby Taj\". It is far less expensive, much less crowded so you can really sit and enjoy the site, architecture and art on the walls. It also offers a great view of the river and the buffalos roaming in it \ud83d\ude1b",
          "This is yet another beautiful tomb in Agra - not at all busy. Visitor entrance fee is only 250 rupees each. The gardens are very well looked after and very clean compared to the rest of Agra.",
          "Many who go to Agra, go there only for the Taj. Do make time for this lovely gem of masterpiece. The surroundings are quieter, the crowd is lesser, but the beauty of this place takes your breath away. Spend an hour or two just resting in the shade and admiring the beauty and",
          "Again this is another fantastic place to visit and absorb the culture of India, so clean and well preserved",
          "less tourism than the taj mahal, but still beautiful with its amazing tombs, a red colored stones walls, a marvelous view on the river bank, green gardens and well-maintained place",
          "we were lucky to be here when it was not busy... was a lovely walk around quite peaceful compared to outside the walls!",
          "Poorly run and maintained site with a lot of people roaming around in predatory way - incl. the slipper people- destroying any atmosphere . Hot in April and no drinks facility that's right. Not enough interpretation. Strict rules re- no tripods we overheard.",
          "If there were no Taj Mahal, this would be the site to visit in Agra. Beautifully set on the riverbank, this gravesite is worthy of historic significance. The site is a smaller scale than the Taj, but that is what makes it so appealing. You will not find the crowds either,",
          "The tomb of Itimad-ud- Daulah's - nicknamed Baby Taj - is not as famous as Taj Mahal, but it's older in fact. It may be smaller than Taj Mahal, but it was built with the same marble inlay work for which Agra is famous. And the inside of this peaceful building may - dare I say it",
          "The tradition involves offering shawl in the tomb. Beware - cost of the shawl are expensive and the money paid is for the businessmen and not offered to the tomb services",

          "Although many people refer to this amazing monument (which is also known as Moti Bagh) as being the 'Baby Taj', our guide preferred to see it actually as the prototype for the Taj Mahal. It certainly is very impressive - the architecture is very intricate and detailed - and",

          "While the Taj Mahal may be all about grandiose and magnificence, the Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah, is beautiful with its detailed and intricate work. It doesn\u2019t see too many visitors so you can go anytime to see it.",
          "This is my favorite monument in Agra. Visited this place to show my guests from UK bcz I run my own company \"Sachan Walking Tours\". They also liked it very much. It's a beautiful monument on the bank of Yamuna and marvelous example of pietra-dura.",
          "it is nicely build at the bank of Yamuna river also called mini taj which is build by marbel. very beautiful.",
          "This is a famous tourist size near the Taj mahal.. Place is a well built tomb but recommended to be travelled in winters as it is very hot in summers in agra..... Overall a great site to visit",
          "This building is truly a work of genius. The inlay work and symmetry make this one of the most beautiful buildings in all of India. Missed by many visitors to Agra, I would highly recommend making time to see it.",
          "Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah or also known as Baby Taj was so beautiful! The entry fee for foreigner is Rs 310. Also not so many people know this place so it is not crowded, and you can take as many pictures as you can. Also made of white marble, Baby Taj was said to be the",
          "The tomb is usually very quiet, and offers an unparalleled chance to examine truly gorgeous inlay work in the peace and reflective solitude that the crowds at Taj or Agra Fort don't let you have. When we went at midday on a Saturday, there were only a few dozen people in the",
          "It is similar to Taj Mahal in many ways, but I still found it worth the visit and recommend visiting this monument.",
          "This is an iconic building. The first muslim monument, built completely with marble and immense use of inlay work. Karan from Sachan Walking Tours helped us to understand the gradual development of Islamic buildings in India. Another lovely tour of Baby Taj.",
          "A lovely little (by comparison) gem, easily visited in combination with Metab Bagh, beautifully situated along the river.",
          "We went here first before visiting the Taj Mahal because it is referred to as the \u201cBaby Taj\u201d. We knew it didn\u2019t look like the Taj but is a marble mausoleum that inspired the building of the Taj Mahal. It is a hidden gem in that it stands alone for its beauty and architecture.",
          "Not far from the Taj Mahal and just across the river from the Red Fort, this baby Taj is the most serene and beautiful building I have been to. Yes the Taj Mahal is impressive, but in my mind this is much better. If you miss out on this building, you hvn't seen India.",
          "It is a good example of pieta dura or large inlay work, but it is visible from the Agra Fort road. Getting there is difficult, and the traffic is impossible.",
          "This baby Taj was not on my list of things to do, but it was a great site. as nice as the larger version but not the same scale. dont miss this",
          "It is easy when visiting Agra to see the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort and then rush on. Don't! The Itimad ud Dualah is a masterpiece in its own right and is well worth a visit. In fact, if it weren't for the Taj, Agra would be famous for this! It is small and need not take",
          "Most people focus on the Taj, but the Baby Taj is a must see. It's totally different in its shapes, architecture, etc. and has beautiful views across the river. It looks like a mini jewelry box! Way less crowded than the Taj too.",
          "If you have time this is a good one to see, but if you're short of time don't stress. It's a nice precursor to visiting the actual Taj.",
          "Easy to overlook with the wonderful Taj Mahal close by. But don't!! It has none of the crowds and is an exquisite building and garden in which to while away an hour or two. Haggle hard with Auto-rickshaw driver and you'll get there for under Rs150.",

          "Also known as the baby Taj - it actually was the inspiration behind the Taj - has magnificent inlay work on marble - even more detailed than the Taj itself. A must see while in Agra",
          "I believe this was built before the Taj Mahal just they call it the baby Taj. This seems wrong to me since the Taj was built after this beautiful structure",
          "Whilst the Taj Mahal gets all the kudos, the Baby Taj gets overlooked. There was only a small fraction of the number of visitors here compared to the Taj Mahal. That made it much more peaceful and calming a place to visit. The inlaid work into the marble is a world class",
          "You will learn this historical monument is the earlier work of Taj Mahal's architect. It may be considered the Taj prototype. This was the first Mughal structure built completely from marble, the first to make extensive use of pietra dura and the first tomb to be built on the",
          "This funerary monument was built by the same architect of the Taj Mahal, several years before. Many elements of the architecture relate to older islamic architecture like the ceiling corners, similar to some in the Alhambra in Spain, but also some elements that are later used",
          "We came here as part of our organised tour. The buildings are beautiful and very well maintained. It is definitely worth a visit.",
          "Agra is a city of great architectures this place is so amazing i can't tell you this place has amazing vibes great experience there the designs on the walls is just amazing but the water of that lake is very dirty and also Beware of Monkeys over there.",

          "We visited this Taj later in the afternoon when it was getting dusk. The amazing marble with its inlaid semi precious stone is superb and the architecture fantastic. There are water features too but for us it was so interesting to view the Yamona river and see the buffalo",
          "Emperor Jahangir built this mausoleum for his wife Nur Jehan's father. Serene ambience, and good work. The well proportioned monument is a small gem worth visiting in the city of Agra. They have also introduced a touch screen interactive display as there are no guides here.",
          "I don't remember everything about this visit because we did so much on that day. But I remember we enjoyed it and thought it was beautiful",
          "This mini Taj does not attract much attention from tourists. It has very similar design and architecture to the Taj except for the dome. Remove your shoes to enter the tomb. Avoid taking the shoe cover because it is just a used cover but they will still ask for tip and payment.",
          "A visit to the tomb is a must if you are visiting Agra. The building is a real work of art. Ensure that you have a good guide for the day.",
          "The Taj Mahal is the main attraction in Agra, and rightly so, but if you have an afternoon or morning spare I would encourage everyone to visit the Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah. It was built by the aunt of the woman the Taj was built for, and was the precursor design. It is",

          "Absolutely beautiful tomb. Well worth the effort. Spend some time admiring this little jewellery box. lots of lovely picture opportunities.",
          "If you see Taj Mahal first, then this one will not offer much, but the view behind the building is very picturesque.",
          "Historically important, architecturally among must see, practically neglected. But one should pay a tribute to the makers nonetheless.",
          "The father of Taj Mahal or the first example of marble architecture by Mughals. This place is as beautiful if not more than the Taj. Set by the side of the Yamuna River, this wonder is calm, quiet and a delight to spend a peaceful afternoon or catch the golden sunset by the",
          "We came here very early in the morning. It was the best thing because we were the only ones here. I believe it is not as well known as the Taj and is not visited as much. I absolutely love the inlaid work here. Too bad there is no water running here anymore. It would have",
          "The tomb of Itimad-ud-daulah, also know as the baby Taj, is a very impressive tomb and well worth a visit. Not as crowded as the Taj and much smaller, the craftsmanship used to build this tomb is just as good.",
          "Very ornate and surprising place. Beautiful inlaid work. Burial place of grandparents of Mumtaz Mahal who is buried in Taj Mahal. Not too many people here as I think less well known but really worth a visit",

          "This place is also called Baby Taj as it looks very similar to the much bigger Taj Mahal but is smaller. But it is very well decorated. You can visit this tomb of Shahjahan's Grandfather, also Mumtaj Begam's grandfather (Mirza Ghias beg), after you are done with Taj Mahal. It",
          "you can tell that the Taj Mahal was inspired by this \"baby Taj\". Beautiful and a bit neglected by the tourist machine, well worth the visit",

          "This is nicknamed the Baby Taj and it is well named. We saw this site after we had visited the Taj Mahal and it is even more intricately adorned with stone carvings and stone inlays. The nice thing was that there were very few people here, so you didn\u2019t have to push your way",

          "This is a very interesting place and time in History. I recommend a guide to help you make full use of your visit. They know small details that add charm and further understanding of the times and lives lived in those days. What's more? You'll also find a variety of deer that",
          "Marvellous site, really worth the visit. TIP! There's a stroppy old man with a white moustache who yells at you to not carry your own shoes when you go inside the mausoleum. That's because he wants to charge you to look after them. You don't have to. It's not a busy site so",
          "Loved it, loved it, loved it. A lot cheaper than the Taj Mahal plus you don\u2019t have to pay the tax on the entrance fee if you have your TM or Red Fort ticket to hand. A lot less crowded and has very good gardens plus you can climb and wander a lot more freely. What I also got",
          "The complex is purely maintained, marble is chipping off the buildings, street dogs roaming freely in the premises, no local Guides available. This doesn\u2019t match the hype about being the Baby Tak or the precessor of Taj Mahal. Government has completely ignored this monumental",

          "Little known by other tourists its a delight to visit this monument without the crush of the crowds at its bigger sibling the Taj Mahal. If you visit both its an interesting comparison to make as this is also very well preserved, and certainly worth your while dropping in here",

          "This is clearly bypassed by many. Which also means it hasn\u2019t suffered the graffiti and closed off areas because of vandalism as has the Taj. Beautiful design, inlaid stone, delicate carved marble, stand in ornate rooms near the tombs, etc. Great story about the period and",

          "If you have to visit Agra then this is worth a quick visit but as a foreigner you will be stung for 300rps at the gate and a strict bag check. The site is peaceful and a welcome escape from Agra. Nothing too much to see, 30mins is plenty.",
          "During our holidays in Agra, I had visited this beautiful Mughal mausoleum which is also popularly known as the Baby Taj. This beautiful tomb in white marble which was built by Empress Nur Jahan(wife of Mughal Emperor Jahangir) in memory of his father is a must visit attraction",

          "If you would like to skip the busy city of Agra and if you are looking forward to talk to nice people, \"Itimad ud-Daulah\" or \"Baby Taj\" is worth a try. Just pay R200 to enter the site. I will leave the rest to your own imagination...",

          "Baby Taj - Itimad-ud-Daulah is a beautiful inlaid marble tomb of Mizra Ghiyas Beg. The details of the parchinkari are stunning. This is well worth the trip. I also loved the Taj Mahal but this smaller tomb is well worth making time to see.",
          "I loved exploring the Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah and could have spent hours here. The details in the design are incredible. We arrived here at around half past 9 in the morning and it was lovely and quiet, which only added to the serenity of the place. Definitely one to visit",

          "This is a mausoleum that enshrines the remains of Mumtaz Mahal's parents, her first husband and first child plus her close lady in waiting. This was a piece of history that I didnt know whereby she had an earlier marriage. All the while she had been associated with Shah Jahan",
          "This was our last main site visit during our tour. I can seen why it is called the baby Taj, looks similar. The art work is very lovely and detailed. The gardens are more as I expected at the Taj. Would be nice to have stayed here longer and not during the heat of the day.",

I was was very disabled friendly which was great as my partner uses a mobility scooter and was about to",
          "While not as large or publicized like the Taj Mahal or Agra Fort, this little gem should not be missed if you have the time. A major significance of this mausoleum is that it was the first building of Mughal architecture of white marble instead of red sandstone. It was built",

          "One must visit this place to understand the sheer marvelous of Islamic architecture. The marble tomb dedicated to Noor Jehan wife of Jehangir is beautiful. Not like Taj Mahal but surely a very beautiful building. One must visit to truly understand the beauty.",
          "Good architecture in this city. This city is imp part of history and these places show it. Must visit.",
          "Its a beautiful architecture with a huge garden area and river yamuna flowing right behind it. Good place to visit. Try to avoid during summer afternoon. Very steep parking charges outside.",
          "This is a wonderful tomb which inspired the Taj Mahal. Built by the most power Empress of India (the Persian wife of Jahangir & aunt of Taj Mahal) for her father. Near the Akbar Garden across the river from the Taj (best to see both at the same time). This is more a palace",
          "200 INR for entrance totally worth the price. Its the baby Taj, not so spectacular as the original Taj but if you have spare time in Agra put it in your list. You can buy a sho plastic cover for 10 INR.",

          "The entrance gate, gardens and exterior are impressive although the interior chambers are fairly ordinary. The ornate exterior has some similarities to the Taj Mahal. If visiting late in the day be warned that the stones are very hot when you remove your shoes.",
          "Agra in a day is hard work. But this was a lovely and peaceful last site. Wonderfully understated, quite and not crowded it was a great place to just sit and watch. Really worth the visit",

          "This is a nice 10 minute drive from Agra fort and seems to be included as part of a combined tour. Much smaller than the Taj but much more detailed inside. Try taking a picture of the ceilings with your camera flash on. Hardly any tourists when We visited so more or less had the",

          "Smaller than the Taj but beautiful and you can get closer to the central tomb in a wheelchair. We liked how it was smaller and more compact, another lovely place to visit woth inlaid marble walls and a pomegranate garden more complete than the Taj's as they continue to be sunken",
          "It is very beautiful symetrical building which was buily by Norjahan. It was built before of Taj. Amaging .",
          "This 400 year old mausoleum which predates the Taj Mahal is a fantastic example of the architectural achievements of the period. It is much more relaxing to visit and easier to get up close to walls, etc as it is not subject to many visitors - there were less than 20 when I",
          "This temple was the inspiration to build the taj mahal, and has a few similarities. This temple is much smaller though, but also much quieter as most tourists seem to skip it. It's only 200 rupees if you bring your ticket from the taj mahal with the same date on it!",
          "Also called Baby Taj as the tomb inside looks like a smaller version of the Taj Mahal. Beautiful place which I highly recommend to see if you are in Agra.",
          "You\u2019ll be disappointed if you go here after although it\u2019s still quite beautiful in it\u2019s own right. Built before the Taj it\u2019s the first of the three, the third being baby Taj in Aurangabad",
          "It's exquisite, small scale and intimate and just stunning on the river Yumana. Unexpected when most poeople just say, \"see the Taj, Agra has nothing else\". Not true at all - Agra has a lot of sights to see",
          "The precursor to the Taj Mahal and less visited but this was wonderful. The delicate paintings and marble in lay work (leaving aside some botched renovation attempts) are exquisite and because this is less well known than its bigger, blingier and showyer peer across the river it",
          "This is a beautiful tomb and surrounding buildings and a highlight of Agra I think. This is our second trip to the city and we didn\u2019t see this before, so we are glad we went this time. I suggest putting this second on your list after the Taj.",
          "Known as mini Taj Mahal this place is no doubt a peaceful place. But I big BUT here.. few tourists are given aeroplane slippers by the security guard and they demand money for this free service. No guide available here to help you.. No arrangement for water if you're thirsty in",
          "The moving tribute to a beloved father by a devoted daughter, this delicate jewel box like tomb is a must see.",
          "This smaller, more intimate site has more impressive carvings AND inlay than the Taj. Don't get me wrong, the Taj is still Queen, for its sheer size and grand elegance, but don't miss this place either.",
          "Since I first saw the Itimad-ud-Daulah many years ago I have loved this tomb building. It is in my opnion by far I the most beautiful building in India. The mable inlay work on the monument is wonderful and in my opinion exceeds anything you will see anywhere else in India.",
          "Somewhere that you have to go to if you are in Agra to see the Taj Mahal. Beautify architecture and stonework.",
          "Do not miss this site. It was built before the Taj Mahal and is not as nearly as large or grand, but is definitely worth the visit. Shoes must be removed or covered with a cloths covering. The details in the walls is wonderful.",
          "This tomb is beautiful and it has lovely gardens too, I would recommend visiting this before the Taj Mahal. It's 200 rupees entrance for a foreigner. Just be careful of a man who tries to charge you for 'looking after your shoes' when you take them off to go inside the tomb!!",
          "My favourite place. This is a smaller-scale prototype, built a generation before the Taj Mahal. It has the beautiful craftsmanship and symmetrical gardens of the Taj, but without crowds. At a quarter of the entrance price, you can wander, and wonder, in a peaceful atmosphere",
          "Built adjacent to the river there are good views across to the main city of Agra which is a busy and bustling place. Commonly known as the Baby Taj this structure was built in a similar style to the Taj Mahal but is only slightly less grand. The external elevations are",

          "So glad we didn't miss out on this. For sure smaller and different than the Taj but it was cool to see the structure built before the wonder was built. The marble workings inside the tomb were beautiful and it was nice to have less of a crowd. Go after the Taj Mahal and show",
          "This was built between 1622 to 1628 just a few years before the initiation of the Taj Mahal after the death of Mumtaz in 1631. It was constructed at the command of the stepmother of Shah Jahan, Empress Noor Jahan. There are various graves of a sister and a husband here. It has",
          "They call this tomb the Baby Taj because it was built in the same style as the Taj Mahal but in a smaller scale and not as magnificent. Nevertheless it is a joy to visit, very few tourist, great architecture and a look to the river. Certainly worth the additional visit when in",
          "called the baby Taj it's a bit of an insult really as it as every bit as good as the Taj Mahal, if a lot less crowed. There's an excellent cool and covered river view to watch Agra life pass by, just right for a hot afternoon. But once again no water in the water features -",
          "Well worth visiting as a monument but also because you get a view of Agra from the other side of the river",
          "Also called Baby Taj, this was the first construction in marble in the Mutual era. Commissioned by Noor Jahan as the tomb for her parents and relatives, one finds numerous elements of Persian architecture in Itmad ud Daula. Intricate inlay work and perfectly symmetrical, this",

          "Much smaller than the real Taj, this so-called Baby Taj is still interesting. Nice structures and not that many visitors. I would skip going to Mehtab Bagh from here though, which is grossly overpriced.",
          "nice architecture good masoleum at banks of reiver yamuna is a good place to visit if you are interested in architecture history and indo persian civil work. approachable by road is little tricky due to traffic (which is unorganised) have no other choice but still worth the visit",
          "Good smaller version of the Taj like structures, worthwhile visit but the bathrooms are awful. It is the tomb of the grandfather of the Taj Mahal builder. Definitely cool architecture. You will see more locals here and they generally ask you to take pictures with them if you are",
          "Located across the river. It is claimed to be the mini Taj Mahal (although there is minor resemblance). Not many visitor - not a favorite place (even among the local) making the tour more pleasant and less pressured. A nice monument (lower your expectation after viewing Taj",

          "Referred to as the baby taj, this is a peaceful and stunning place to visit. I would recommend a visit whilst in Agra.",
          "By now we are totally mesmerized by all the architecture and grander. This site is not on the UNESCO list yet and efforts are being made to do so. Like so many monuments we have seen, the marble work is outstanding.",
          "This place is less crowded than the Taj Mahal and thus provides a serene atmosphere for the visitors. However, there's no shortage of immaculate workmanship in this monument as well. Definitely a must visit if you come to Agra.",
          "The monument was built before Taj mahal, commissioned by Nur Jahan, wife of Jahangir than ruler, for her parents. This also seems to have provided a way for Taj Mahal. Nice architecture and also called Jewel box. This monument is a must see but unfortunately over shadowed by",
          "This building is meant to be the inspiration behind the design of the Taj Mahal. It is of a completely different scale, being much smaller, and one of the pluses is that it does not get the crowds that flock to the Taj Mahal. There is a purity about the design and layout of the",

          "Another impressive sight in Agra this is,, known as Baby Taj but is in fact the mother Taj as it was the inspiration for the Taj Mahal . No crowds here and great to walk around at leisure .",
          "Commonly known as Baby Taj, this is a much less talked about gem in Agra. The work on this monument is simply breathtaking and is a must see when visiting Agra. It took us about 30 minutes or less to see it in detail. The ride to it was also about 20 minutes from the Agra fort.",
          "Loved this building. Its very much quieter than the Taj Mahal. Right on the river and such beautiful gardens.Well looked after.",
          "still worth a visit! Even though we had 'done' the Taj Mahal earlier in the day we still enjoyed the beauty of this building (and gardens) as the decoration is subtly different and has it's own style. I would agree traffic to get here is busy, but what's new in Indian cities?",
          "The building was amazingly beautiful...seems a waste on the dead but that\u2019s what it was like for the rich back in those days.",
          "This is a good precursor for the Taj, a tomb built down by the river in a stunning white colour, set in an attractive garden.",
          "the monument is just OK and can be considered to visit but traffic on the road around it will make you think twice whether it was worth it its always adviced to spend most of the time in and with taj as now a days getting an entry to taj has become troublesome due to floods of",
          "An earlier, smaller version of the Taj Mahal but still very beautiful. We visited before the Taj, and understanding the history of this tomb helped to preface our visit to the Taj.",
          "This is well worth a visit as it is in the same style as the Taj but not so well known,it was very quiet when we visited so we were able to look around leisurely and enjoy the gardens as well as the monument",
          "Wow... this is the hidden gem in Agra. We went here in evening at around 4:15, and it wasn't crowded at all. \u2022 This monument is really an awesome place constructed by famous Noor-Jahan for her parents. \u2022 This was the first monument where the marbles were used in place of red",
          "An excellent and unexpected addition to our trip. I had never heard of it before despite visiting Agra twice before.",
          "This one is also known as the Baby Taj. It was interesting to see as some of the techniques of decorating the marble by inserting different stones is the same one used as the Taj Mahal. Here you can come up close and see the intricate detail work.",
          "As mesmerizing as the Taj and known as baby Taj, it needs to be maintained so that it can come as par with Taj. Less crowded also.",
          "The architecture of the tomb will completely blow away your mind. We visited this tomb at around sunset, and i must say, the visuals were simply brilliant. I feel the Tomb is underrated. The motifs on the walls of the Tomb speak of the beauty and precision that existed in that",
          "Known as the \u2018Baby Taj\u2019, this walled (red stone) fortress has one entrance, but with old entry gates on two sides, while the Yamuna river backs up the other side. There is a lush green garden and trees surrounding the beautiful, main white marble temple at the center of the",
          "They call it the Mini Taj Mahal. Nice place to visit and way less crowded than any other place I have been to in Agra.",
          "Honestly i found this place to be more exemplary than Taj Mahal itself. The architecture is just breath taking. The name is misleading cause this place holds the mortal remains of the family of Noor Jahan, who was the mother of Shah Jahan. The same Shah Jahan who built the Taj",
          "Magnificent structure! Loved the architecture and the history behind this tomb. Would be better if there were more history written on site or descriptions provided inside the tomb.",
          "After the visit to the fort we travelled over to this tomb and it was a nice quiet excursion. If you have an hour spare there are worse places believe me.",
          "Beautiful place to be. Don't miss it if you have time. The original color of ceiling painting and the carvings on the beautiful white marble are awesome.",
          "Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah - historically its a must-see attraction as this place is built before Taj Mahal & has architectural & art similarity with Taj Mahal. Many people visit only Taj Mahal & Agra fort in Agra. but if you have time this should be included in your itinerary. We",
          "Mosaics and stone inlays add to the beauty of this building. The architecture is Islamic in style. Be prepared to leave your shoes outside the temple",
          "This is a lovely place, often called the Baby Taj because there are similarities, but this is smaller and much less crowded. The building and its surroundings are very beautiful and the place has a lovely sense of tranquillity.",
          "Well worth a visit - get your cab to wait and carry on to Mehtab Bagh - Called the Baby Taj this is as special, just much smaller. Great views of the river from western wall. Shoes off to enter tomb area. A haven after the Agra bustle.",
          "Highly recommended. Known as the Baby Taj - it is a precursor to the Taj and the ornamentation rivals that seen on the Taj. Also relatively unknown so you\u2019re not battling crowds and the selfie sticks.",
          "It\u2019s a must to visit this so called \u201cbaby Taj\u201d, when Shaha Jahan saw this one he decided to take same craftsmen to make Taj Mahal, but marble details in here are at least 10 times more beautiful than in Taj Mahal",
          "The city of Agra is full of architectural wonders . On one hand, it has the famous Taj Mahal, and on the other hand, it has the Agra Fort and Itmad-ud-Daulah's mausoleum. Itmad-ud-daulah Tomb completed 1628. The mausoleum of Itmad-ud-Daulah was built between 1622 and 1628 by Nur",
          "This tomb was made by Queen Noor Jehan for her father Ghiyas Beg, the Itimad-ud-Daulah in Jehangir's court. It is in a surprisingly good condition showing all the intricate architectural work in detail. There are many other graves in the tomb of the other family members. It is",

          "Believe it or not but the inlay marble work is more decorative in this Tomb than the Taj Mahal. Breathtaking, No crowds. If there was no Taj Mahal, then a visit to here would be a World Class one !!! Not to be overlooked.",
          "Visited here after just visiting the Taj Mahal so it was never going to reach those heights. The building was very beautiful including the interior, and not so popular as the Taj Mahal so we pretty much had the building to ourselves",
          "The Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah is also known as the Baby Taj. It is a masterpiece of inlaid marble surrounded by the Moon Gardens. This is a hint of the grandeur that sits across the Yamuna River at the Taj Mahal. This small serene monument should not be missed.",

          "If you have been to Agra, you have surely been to the Taj Mahal, and most likely you heard about the Baby Taj, but many do not have, or take the time to find their way across the river to see this wonderful little gem. There were no crowds... there were no hawkers trying to sell",
          "Really amazing inlay marble work which you can see lots of up close. See this before you see the taj to get an appreciation for the marble inlays (which are like those on the taj) but before you are spoilt by the taj's scale Not many people when we visited too which was nice",

          "What a lovely place to visit. There were very few tourists here, unlike the Taj Mahal. The view of the river was excellent. Most impressive was the texture of the inlays in the wall. The inlays are made up of interesting stones that must have been created by layers of sea",

        "wiki": "Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.\nIt had been used by the early mughal rulers. The Fort stands on an ancient site and was traditionally known as Badalgarh. It was captured by Ghaznavi for some time but in the 15th century A.D. the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487\u20131517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556\u20131605).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli (step well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri's general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.\n\nRealising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, Abul Fazl, recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in Rajasthan. Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.It was only during the reign of Akbar's grandson, Shah Jahan, that the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the beautiful Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from white marble. He destroyed some of the earlier buildings inside the fort to make his own.The fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 Years. In the fort, they built the Ratan Singh ki haveli. The fort was invaded and captured by the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century. Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at Third Battle of Panipat by Ahmad Shah Abdali in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next decade. Finally Mahadji Shinde took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, in 1803.The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857, which caused the end of the British East India Company's rule in India, and led to a century of direct rule of India by Britain.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe 380,000 m2 (94-acre) fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river Yamuna and its walls are seventy feet high. Double ramparts have massive circular bastions at intervals, with battlements, embrasures, machicolations and string courses. Four gates were provided on its four sides, one Khizri gate opening on to the river.Two of the fort's gates are notable: the \"Delhi Gate\" and the \"Lahore Gate.\" The Lahore Gate is also popularly also known as the \"Amar Singh Gate,\" for Amar Singh Rathore.The monumental Delhi Gate, which faces the city on the western side of the fort, is considered the grandest of the four gates and a masterpiece of Akbar's time. It was built circa 1568 both to enhance security and as the king's formal gate, and includes features related to both. It is embellished with intricate inlay work in white marble. A wooden drawbridge was used to cross the moat and reach the gate from the mainland; inside, an inner gateway called Hathi Pol (\"Elephant Gate\") \u2013 guarded by two life-sized stone elephants with their riders \u2013 added another layer of security. The drawbridge, slight ascent, and 90-degree turn between the outer and inner gates make the entrance impregnable. During a siege, attackers would employ elephants to crush a fort's gates. Without a level, straight run-up to gather speed, however, that thing is prevented by this layout.Because the Indian military (the Parachute Brigade in particular) is still using the northern portion of the Agra Fort, the Delhi Gate cannot be used by the public. Tourists enter via the Amar Singh Gate.The site is very important in terms of architectural history. Abul Fazal recorded that five hundred buildings in the beautiful designs of Bengal and Gujarat were built in the fort. Some of them were demolished by Shah Jahan to make way for his white marble palaces. Most of the others were destroyed by the British troops of East India Company between 1803 and 1862 for raising barracks. Hardly thirty Mughal buildings have survived on the south-eastern side, facing the river, such as the Delhi Gate and Akbar Gate and one palace \u2013 \"Bengali Mahal\".\nAkbar Darwazza (Akbar Gate) was renamed Amar Singh Gate by Shah Jahan.  The gate is similar in design to the Delhi Gate. Both are built of red sandstone.The Bengali Mahal is built of red sandstone and is now split into Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal.\n\n\n== Other Historic sites inside Agra Fort ==\nJahangir's Hauz (tank) A.D. 1610: This monolithic tank (hauz) was used for bathing. It is 5 feet high, 8 feet in diameter and 25 feet in circumference. On the external side of the rim there is an inscription in Persian which mentions it as 'Hauz-e-Jahangir'. It was first discovered near the courtyard of Akbar's palace. In A.D. 1843 and later it was placed in front of Diwan-e-Am. In 1862, it was shifted to public garden (Company Bagh) where it suffered much damage. Later, Sir John Marshall brought it back to Agra Fort and placed there. Due to this hauz, the palace became famous as Jahangiri Mahal though it is part of Akbar's Bengali mahal.\nShahjahani Mahal (1628-35 A.D.): It is situated in between the white marble Khas Mahal and the red stone Jahangiri Mahal and is set transitionally in between these two residential complexes of two different ages. It is the earliest attempt of the Mughal emperor Shahjahan to convert an existing red stone building in accordance with his taste and it was his earliest palace in Agra Fort. It has a large hall, side rooms and an octagonal tower on the riverside. The skeletal construction of brick and red stone was all redone with a thick white stucco plaster and colourfully painted in floral designs. The whole palace once glistened white like white marble. On the face towards the Khas Mahal, is a large spacious white marble dalan, composed of five arches, supported on double pillars and protected externally by a chhajja. Its closed western bay houses, the Ghaznin gate, Babur's baoli and a well are situated beneath it.\nGhaznin Gate (1030 A.D.): The gate originally belonged to the tomb of Mahmud Ghaznavi at Ghazni. It was brought from there by the British in1842. Lord Ellenborough, the Governor General, in historic proclamation claimed, that these were the sandalwood gates of Somnath which Mahmud had taken to Ghazni in 1025, and the British had thus avenged an insult of 800 years back. This false claim was made just to win the goodwill of the Indian people. The gate is, in fact, made of local deodar wood of Ghazni and not of sandalwood. The style of decoration bears no resemblance to ancient Gujrati woodwork. There is also an Arabic inscription carved on the upper part. It mentions Mahmud with his epithets. Sir John Marshall had placed here a notice-board which described the whole episode about this gate. It is 16.5 feet high and 13.5 feet broad and its wight is about half a ton. It is made up of geometrical, hexagonal and octagonal panels which have been fixed, one with the help of the other into the frame without rivets. The idea to restore it at Somnath was ultimately given up and the gate was abandoned. Since then, it is stored in a room.\nJahangir's Chain of Justice (C. 1605 A.D.): This is the spot where Mughal king Jahangir instituted his 'chain of justice'(Zanjir-i-Adl) in c. 1605 A.D. He records in his memoir that after his accession, the first order he gave, \"was for the fastening up of the chain of justice so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practice hypocrisy, the aggrieved might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract my attention.\" It was made of pure gold. It was 80' in length and had 60 bells. Its weight was 1 Quintal. One end was fastened to the battlements of the Shah-Burj and the other end to a stone post on the bank of the river. This is not a myth. Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins personally saw it. It has also been depicted in a contemporary painting made in 1620 A.D. This was a way to redress the grievances of the people who could approach the king, the highest judicial authority of the empire, directly, without fee, fear or formality for immediate relief. There was no distinction of caste or creed or between poor and rich. Jahangir's administration of justice 'Adl-i-Jahangir' became a legend in Indian history.\nThe Muthamman Burj (Shah-Burj) & Jharokha (1632 -1640 A.D.): This beautiful palace surmounts the largest bastion of Agra Fort on the riverside, facing the East. It was originally built of red stone by Akbar who used it for jharokha darshan, as well as for sun worship, everyday at sunrise. Jehangir also used it as jharokha, as is faithfully shown in his painting made in 1620. He also instituted his 'Adl-i-Janjir'(the chain of justice) on its south side. Owing to its octagonal plan, it was called 'Muthamman Burj'. It has also been mentioned as 'Shah-Burj'(the imperial or king's tower) by Persian historians and foreign travellers. Its name jasmine tower or 'Samman-Burj' as recorded by the contemporary historian Lahauri is a misnomer. It was rebuilt with white marble by Shah Jehan around 1632-1640 A.D. He also used it for jharokha darshan which was an indispensable a Mughal institution as was 'Durbar'. It is an octagonal building, five external sides of which make a dalan overlooking the river. Each side has pillar and bracket openings, the eastern most side projects forward and accommodates a jharokha majestically. On the western side of this palace is a spacious dalan with Shah-Nasin (alcoves). A shallow water-basin (kunda) is sunk in its pavement. It is profusely inlaid. This dalan opens on a court which has a chabutara projected by a jali screen, on its northern side, a series of rooms leading to Shish Mahal on its western side; and a colonnade (dalan) with a room attached to its on the southern side. It is, thus, a large complex entirely built of white marble. It has deep niches on the walls, to break the monotony. Dados have repetitive stylized creepers inlaid on borders and carved plants on the centre pillars, brackets and lintels also bear exquisitely inlaid designs and it is one of the most ornamented buildings of Shah Jehan. This palace is directly connected to the Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas Mahal, and other palaces. and it was from here that the Mughal emperor governed the whole country. This burj offers full and majestic view of Taj Mahal and Shah Jehan spent eight years (1658-1666 A.D.) of his imprisonment in this complex, and it is said that he died here. His body was taken by boat to the Taj Mahal and buried.\nShish Mahal (A.D. 1631-40): It was built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan as a part of summer palace. Its most distinctive feature is glass mosaic work done on its walls and ceiling. These glass pieces have high mirror quality which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways in semi-dark interior. The glass was imported from Haleb of Syria. Shahjahan built glass palace also at Lahore and Delhi, but this is the finest of all.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Agra Fort won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2004. India Post issued a stamp to commemorate this event.\nThe Agra Fort plays a key role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery The Sign of the Four, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\nThe Agra Fort was featured in the music video for Habibi Da, a hit song of Egyptian pop star Hisham Abbas.\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj came to Agra in 1666 as per the \"Treaty of Purandar (1665)\" entered into with Mirza Raje Jaisingh to meet Aurangzeb in the Diwan-i-Khas. In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. Insulted, he stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nJama Masjid\nFatehpur Sikri\nLahore Fort\nRed Fort\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAgra Fort (1983), Uttar Pradesh \u2013 Archaeological Survey of India\nAgra Fort map (from Murray's travel guide, 1909)\n Geographic data related to Agra Fort at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "The Taj Mahal (; lit.\u2009'Crown of the Palace', [ta\u02d0d\u0292 \u02c8m\u025b\u02d0\u0266(\u0259)l]) is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna  in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\nConstruction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $916 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.\nThe Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7\u20138 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000\u20132007) initiative.\n\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum. Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later. The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.\n\n\n== Architecture and design ==\n\nThe Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand), Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.\n\n\n=== Tomb ===\nThe tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Persian in origin.The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.\n\nThe most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical \"drum\" it sits on, which is approximately 7 metres (23 ft) high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud (guava dome). The top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed chattris (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The dome is slightly asymmetrical. Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative spires (guldastas) extend from edges of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas. The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded finial which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century. This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements. The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minarets\u2014 a traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.\n\n\n=== Exterior decorations ===\nThe exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs.\nThroughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.The calligraphy on the Great Gate reads \"O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you.\" The calligraphy was created in 1609 by a calligrapher named Abdul Haq. Shah Jahan conferred the title of \"Amanat Khan\" upon him as a reward for his \"dazzling virtuosity.\" Near the lines from the Qur'an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription, \"Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi.\" Much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble inlaid in white marble panels. Higher panels are written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below. The calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate.Abstract forms are used throughout, especially in the plinth, minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab and, to a lesser extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex array of geometric patterns. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns.On the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.\n\n\n=== Interior decoration ===\nThe interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones. The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are topped by a \"false\" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall. The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or jali cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. The octagonal marble screen or jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers. Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect, in little detail, the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex.\n\nMuslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves. Hence, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right, towards Mecca. Mumtaz Mahal's cenotaph is placed at the precise centre of the inner chamber on a rectangular marble base of 1.5 by 2.5 metres (4 ft 11 in by 8 ft 2 in). Both the base and casket are elaborately inlaid with precious and semiprecious gems. Calligraphic inscriptions on the casket identify and praise Mumtaz. On the lid of the casket is a raised rectangular lozenge meant to suggest a writing tablet. Shah Jahan's cenotaph is beside Mumtaz's to the western side and is the only visible asymmetric element in the entire complex. His cenotaph is bigger than his wife's, but reflects the same elements: a larger casket on a slightly taller base precisely decorated with lapidary and calligraphy that identifies him. On the lid of the casket is a traditional sculpture of a small pen box.The pen box and writing tablet are traditional Mughal funerary icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively. The Ninety Nine Names of God are calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Other inscriptions inside the crypt include, \"O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious... \". The tomb of Shah Jahan bears a calligraphic inscription that reads; \"He travelled from this world to the banquet-hall of Eternity on the night of the twenty-sixth of the month of Rajab, in the year 1076 Hijri.\"\n\n\n=== Garden ===\n\nThe complex is set around a large 300-metre (980 ft) square charbagh or Mughal garden.\nThe garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four-quarters of the garden into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble water tank with a reflecting pool positioned on a north-south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum. The elevated marble water tank is called al Hawd al-Kawthar in reference to the \"Tank of Abundance\" promised to Muhammad.Elsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees labeled according to common and scientific names and fountains. The charbagh garden, a design inspired by Persian gardens, was introduced to India by Babur, the first Mughal emperor. It symbolises the four flowing rivers of Jannah (Paradise) and reflects the Paradise garden derived from the Persian paridaeza, meaning 'walled garden.' In mystic Islamic texts of the Mughal period, Paradise is described as an ideal garden of abundance with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain, separating the garden into north, west, south and east.Most Mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the centre. The Taj Mahal garden is unusual in that the main element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden. With the discovery of Mahtab Bagh or \"Moonlight Garden\" on the other side of the Yamuna, the interpretation of the Archaeological Survey of India is that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden's design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of Paradise. Similarities in layout and architectural features with the Shalimar Gardens suggests both gardens may have been designed by the same architect, Ali Mardan. Early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation, including abundant roses, daffodils, and fruit trees. As the Mughal Empire declined, the Taj Mahal and its gardens also declined. By the end of the 19th century, the British Empire controlled more than three-fifths of India, and assumed management of the Taj Mahal. They changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London.\n\n\n=== Outlying buildings ===\n\nThe Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls; the side facing the river is open. Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan's other wives, and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favourite servant.The main gateway (darwaza) is a monumental structure built primarily of marble, and reminiscent of the Mughal architecture of earlier emperors. Its archways mirror the shape of the tomb's archways, and its pishtaq arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb. The vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the complex.At the far end of the complex are two grand red sandstone buildings that mirror each other, and face the sides of the tomb. The backs of the buildings parallel the western and eastern walls. The western building is a mosque and the other is the jawab (answer), thought to have been constructed for architectural balance although it may have been used as a guesthouse. Distinctions between the two buildings include the jawab's lack of a mihrab (a niche in a mosque's wall facing Mecca), and its floors of geometric design whereas the floor of the mosque is laid with outlines of 569 prayer rugs in black marble. The mosque's basic design of a long hall surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by Shah Jahan, particularly the Masjid-i Jah\u0101n-Num\u0101, or Jama Masjid, Delhi. The Mughal mosques of this period divide the sanctuary hall into three areas comprising a main sanctuary and slightly smaller sanctuaries on either side. At the Taj Mahal, each sanctuary opens onto an expansive vaulting dome. The outlying buildings were completed in 1643.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land. An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above riverbank. In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials. It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal. The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight. A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons. An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a series of purs, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.The plinth and tomb took roughly 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on \"completion\". Construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by 1643 while work on the outlying buildings continued for years. Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost at the time has been estimated to be about 32 million Indian rupees, which is around 52.8 billion Indian rupees ($827 million US) based on 2015 values.\n\n\n== Later days ==\nAbdul Hamid Lahauri in his book Badshahnama refers to Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara (Perso-Arabic: \u0631\u0648\u0636\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0647 rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.\nSoon after the Taj Mahal's completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at nearby Agra Fort. Upon Shah Jahan's death, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife. In the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur invaded Agra and attacked the Taj Mahal, the two chandeliers, one of agate and another of silver, which were hung over the main cenotaph, were taken away by them, along with the gold and silver screen. Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15 ft) finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoliation.By the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair. During the time of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Taj Mahal was defaced by British soldiers and government officials, who chiselled out precious stones and lapis lazuli from its walls. At the end of the 19th century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908. He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber, modelled after one in a Cairo mosque. During this time the garden was remodelled with British-style lawns that are still in place today.\n\n\n== Threats ==\n\nIn 1942, the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force. During the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots.More recent threats have come from environmental pollution on the banks of the Yamuna River including acid rain due to the Mathura Oil Refinery, which was opposed by Supreme Court of India directives. The pollution has been turning the Taj Mahal yellow-brown. To help control the pollution, the Indian government has set up the \"Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ)\", a 10,400-square-kilometre (4,000 sq mi) area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place.Concerns for the tomb's structural integrity have recently been raised because of a decline in the groundwater level in the Yamuna river basin which is falling at a rate of around 1.5 m (5 ft) per year. In 2010, cracks appeared in parts of the tomb, and the minarets which surround the monument were showing signs of tilting, as the wooden foundation of the tomb may be rotting due to lack of water. It has been pointed out by politicians, however, that the minarets are designed to tilt slightly outwards to prevent them from crashing on top of the tomb in the event of an earthquake. In 2011, it was reported that some predictions indicated that the tomb could collapse within five years.Small minarets located at two of the outlying buildings were reported as damaged by a storm on April 11, 2018. On 31 May 2020 another fierce thunderstorm caused some damage to the complex.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe Taj Mahal attracts a large number of tourists. UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001, which had increased to about 7\u20138 million in 2014. A two-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and a more expensive one for foreigners. In 2018, the fee for Indian citizens was 50 INR, for foreign tourists 1,100 INR. Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre. In 2019, in order to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.The small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers. Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes.The grounds are open from 06:00 to 19:00 weekdays, except for Friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between 12:00 and 14:00. The complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after, excluding Fridays and the month of Ramadan.\nForeign dignitaries often visit the Taj Mahal on trips to India. Notable figures who have travelled to the site include Dwight Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, George Harrison, Barack and Michelle Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, Vladimir Putin, Princess Diana and Donald Trump.\n\n\n== Myths ==\n\nEver since its construction, the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument. A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river. The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveller who visited Agra in 1665. It was suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built. Ruins of blackened marble across the river in Moonlight Garden, Mahtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend. However, excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discoloured white stones that had turned black. A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Moonlight Garden. A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.Warrior Empire: The Mughals of India. A+E Television Network. 2006.No evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb. Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design. Similar claims are made for many famous buildings. No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck's biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck's fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.Another myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth. To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.In 2000, India's Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak's petition to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal. In 2005 a similar petition was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court. This case was brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher who says that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu King Parmar Dev in 1196.A theory that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work Itinerario, (The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629\u20131643). Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nAs of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by P. N.  Oak's theory. In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple. Bharatiya Janata Party's Vinay Katiyar in 2017 claimed that the 17th century monument was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after destroying a Hindu temple called \"Tejo Mahalaya\" and it housed a Shiva linga. This claim had also been made by another BJP member Laxmikant Bajpai in 2014. The BJP government's union minister of culture Mahesh Sharma stated in November 2015 during a session of the parliament, that there was no evidence that it was a temple. The theories about Taj Mahal being a Shiva temple started circulating when Oak released his 1989 book \"Taj Mahal: The True Story\". He claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century, as stated by the ASI. Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan stated Taj might be destroyed like Babri Masjid as people believed there was a temple there. Katiyar called for the demolition of the Taj and its replacement by a temple in February 2018. In response Indian National Congress MP Shashi Tharoor called him a troglodyte.A controversy was created in 2017 when the Uttar Pradesh government did not include it in its official tourism booklet \"Uttar Pradesh Tourism - Unlimited Possibilities\". The chief minister Yogi Adityanath had earlier claimed it does not represent Indian culture. Amidst this controversy, BJP MLA Sangeet Som had claimed that the those who built the Taj Mahal were traitors and it was a \"blot\" on the country's culture. He claimed it was built by a man who jailed his own father and wished to kill Hindus. BJP MP Anshul Verma supported his comments. AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference leader Omar Abdullah and Azam Khan criticised him. CM Adityanath stated Som's comments were personal and the government will focus on the tourism potential of every monument.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nTaj Mahal\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nWonders of the World\nNew7Wonders of the World\nArchitecture of India\nFatehpur Sikri, a nearby city and World Heritage Site\nBibi Ka Maqbara, a similar building in the Deccan, Aurangabad\nTaj Mahal replicas and derivatives\nInside, a 1968 new-age music album recorded in the building\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Taj Mahal at Wikimedia Commons\n Quotations related to Taj Mahal at Wikiquote\n Taj Mahal travel guide from Wikivoyage\nOfficial website of the Taj Mahal\nDescription of the Taj Mahal at the Archaeological Survey of India\nProfile of the Taj Mahal at UNESCO",

          "It is closed on Friday, so you can go behind the Taj on the opposite side to see it. The ticket price 50, 200 RS to enter it, 10 RS for shoe covers. It is all worth it. It is not a quick watch. You will indulge in clicking photograph so it will take a lot of time.",

          "Although we paid 1300 Rupees to enter the Taj Mahal it was a Majestic. We went at Sunrise. It was nice and empty but foggy. We were pestered to take a guide on numerous occasions. But still something worth seeing. The mausoleum wasn't worth the money though.",

          "Giving this 5 stars because this truly is a magnificent and awe-inspiring structure, however be prepared to overcome some hurdles to get there. Finding where to buy entrance tickets is not simple. You have to get to Shilpgram (where the ticket office used to be) and now to board",
          "Have been visiting the wonder of the world for many years. Taj looks exquisite now. Have not seen the Marble shine so much and it\u2019s white now. While the over all management of the crowds inside the monument has improved , the selling of tickets , security check , cloak rooms",

          "No photo by any camera in world can give you the real feeling of visiting Taj mahal in person. Its grand, its beautiful. Its symmetric. Its based on layout of Heaven (Jannat) Its a architectural masterpiece. and Its FLOATING...... on wooden platform over 180 wells taking water",
          "The entrance to the site was not accessible by car, so we took an exciting ride on a tuk tuk (which was slightly hit by the car behind when the driver stopped too quickly!) then a short walk towards the north gate, which opened up to a stunning view of the Taj Mahal. I got a",

          "What an incredible experience to see this architectural landmark! Went in the evening which was great because the sunset made the white marble glow pink. We were also fortunate to have a pretty clear day on which to see the Taj Mahal (the next day had lessened visibility).",

          "I visited the Taj Mahal on Dec 1st 2019 in a small group tour of Rajasthan. There are no words to fully express this amazing place. Nothing I had ever read or seen about it (or India) came anywhere near this experience of actually being at this place. Regardless of your beliefs",
          "Standing out, tall and pristine, milky white, on the banks of the river Yamuna, the Taj Mahal is a tribute and monument to the love Shah Jahan had for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. This white marble architectural marvel is known for its symmetry standing amid the water ways casting its",

          "We woke up at 6:00 am to make our way to the Taj Mahal at 6:30, still a bit dark, goofy and polluted. It was worth getting there early and have the early morning view of this magnificent architectural structure. Avoid any and all so called \u201cGovernment approved guides\u201d Do some",

          "The Taj is much more impressive outside than inside. The inside ceiling is very low compared to the actual height of the dome. Super crowded of course but probably the only reason you're in Agra. In March it was already very very hot.",
          "Tourists come to Agra with one purpose - to see Taj Mahal. With all those fairy tale love story and amazing documentary of the monument, people's desire and expectation to see the Taj are rocket high. We visited Taj in early December. In terms of weather, the temperature (16",

          "A highly underrated wonder, a master piece that every person should see. I had lesser expectations honestly, but once you see it, the sheer beauty of the Taj will mesmerise you. What could get better surely, is the way tourists are managed, given the huge potential it has, the",

          "A great guide who knew all the history made it a fascinating story. A monument which signifies a great love story. Beautiful artistry and symmetry. Nothing compares. India has amazing buildings and temples which go back to the 12th century. It is really worth a visit. Much",

          "Despite the cold and the smog, the Taj is a truly amazing place to visit. Do your research first as ticket prices vary depending on whether you're a local or foreigner. We bought foreigner tickets online which made it easier to enter. This also gave us shoe covers and two",
          "We came early at 8am and successfully avoided the crowds. After 10am it starts being a lot busier. Entry is a bit on the pricey side (1300 INR), but then again there is only one Taj Mahal in the world :) Two hours are more than enough to see the entire complex.",
          "Picturesque! Such an iconic landmark so beautiful you are lost for words! Not too crowded which made it even better. There is some people that go around and try and get paid for taking photos of you though, the only downfall",
          "Definitely worth seeing, such a beautiful monument which is very well maintained. For foreign tourists the price is 1300 rupees each. This includes shoe covers (shoes must be covered to walk on the Taj Mahal) and water bottle (both picked up from nearby table). Don\u2019t trust",
          "They do say it\u2019s the 7 wonders of the world, personally I was amazed when I saw this up close and personal, after travelling with the group of friends from India to show us around. We set off early at 3:30 am to catch the sunrise over the Taj (I\u2019m not normally a morning person),",
          "Had two visits to the Taj Mahal during our tour of India. Well worth the visit to see one of the major historic sites of India. Be prepared for large crowds, and long queues to get into the grounds. There are also plenty of hawkers around trying to sell trinkets to the",

          "A visit to the Taj Mahal is on many a bucket list. Is it as splendid as we imagine? More so. A trip to India must include a visit to the Taj Mahal. It is easier to visit if it is included in a Golden Triangle tour. Here is the rub though. This would mean staying over in Agra.",
          "No comments are really needed. There are lots of people, but what would you expect about one of the world wonders?",
          "I took a day trip to Agra from Jaipur with Rajasthan Discovery. I had read some reviews stating that the city of Agra was not really nice. In fact, it is located halfway between Delhi and Jaipur and c. 3 1/2 h drive, so I chose Jaipur for my base. The drive was pretty intense -",
          "We arrived in the morning when the Taj was covered in thick dense fog. By the time we left her beauty was revealed like lifting a vail. The beauty of the Taj is really mesmerizing. The story as told by the guide is alluring just like the majestic Taj Mahal. The crowds include",

          "We visited in early November & although it is a spectacular site it was spoilt by not seeing in it's true splendor with the sun shining on it in fact we never did see the sunshine all day. Do not be put off visiting the Taj Mahal if you the weather is going to be bad it's",
          "Such a popular destination that it\u2019s hard sometimes to be stunned but had a good guide and really enjoyed the visit. Hard to put the design perfection into words. While the place is always filled w tourists, it seems manageable and you can still find the slots for that must",

          "No matter how many photos you see of the Taj Mahal, nothing prepares you for the beauty of this building. Visiting the Taj Mahal should be on everyone's bucket list. It is beyond beautiful and that it was completed in 22 years, without modern technology, using 22000 labourers",
          "It was a few years ago since I was here. They have developed some nice walkway areas and you have plenty of walking without the motorists. Entry and paying is smoother. You don\u2019t have to buy the footwear cover anymore. It is now included in the fee (which has gone up again).",
          "I was touched by the love story behind it. It is amazing how Shah built this magnificent place to burry his loved wife. He engraved the rare marble of it with her favorite flowers made of her favorite gemstones. It is a must see place.",
          "Legend has it that Shah Jahan ordered that all the chief artisans who built the structure be blinded and maimed so that the Taj Mahal\u2019s unique beauty could not ever be replicated. Historians have only been able to determine that workers did suffer from deformities.",
          "For some reason we were sceptical before we went, it could never be as magnificent as people say. It is. We went at Sunrise and as the Sun comes up the light changes and the Building changes colour. As go through the archway to enter the area it almost seems one dimensional but",

          "I first saw it in 1970 ,then in 2014 and now 2019. Each time for two consecutive days .it is amazing. Can\u2019t stop looking for hours at the huge white structure in the back drop of blue sky and empty space all around, every half exactly symmetrical , and pure white, Needs touring",
          "An iconic building that must be seen once, but I am not sure the experience is worth a second visit. The building itself is beautiful, but understand that depending upon the time of day you visit, the site will be very, very crowded. Like most tourist groups we were forced to",

          "A bucket list visit although part of a spiritual tour. It was a pity there was so much smoke etc but that I think is part of a winter visit. An interesting place with some great history non your own you may be able to explore that at greater Leisure",
          "Okay, so this is an iconic structure and from a distance is magnificent. We had a guide to take us around, which is just as well, because there is no information (literally no information) anywhere within the boundaries of the Taj Mahal. If we hadn't had a guide, or not done any",
          "Very crowded in Dec, due to their 15 days public holidays. Keep close when you go in a group! Need a proper guide to tell the story of Taj Mahal & take you with good story of its beautiful things on it. It was made by various religion from many countries. Show how the people",

          "We hired a guide which turned out to be the best thing we did. He knew where to take the best photos, was very informative etc. Guide only asked for 300R but we have him 1000R as he did such a great job. Queued a while at the East Gates to get tickets. We didn\u2019t go for sunrise",

        "wiki": "Agra ( (listen)) is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is 206 kilometres (128 mi) south of the national capital New Delhi. Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh and 24th in India.It has been speculated that in Mahabharata the city Agra is referred to as Agravana which translates as \u201cfront of the forest\u201d. It is mentioned that the Shurasena dynasty of Lord Krishna maintained an outpost at Agravana. Greek geographer Ptolemy referred to Agra by its modern name in his Geographia and placed it in his world map in 2nd century AD. The 11th-century Persian poet Mas'\u016bd Sa'd Salm\u0101n writes of an assault on the fortress of Agra, then held by King Jaypal, by Mahmud of Ghazni. Despite his surrender, Mahmud sacked the place. It was mentioned in 1080 AD when a Ghaznavide force captured it. A 17th century chronicle called the Agra before Sikandar Lod\u012b's time (1488\u20131517) as an old settlement which was merely a village, owing to its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sikandar was the first sultan to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1504, its administration having previously been under Bayana. He governed the country from here and Agra assumed the importance of the second capital. He died in 1517 and his son, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b, remained in power there for nine more years. Several palaces, wells, and a mosque were built by him in the fort during his period. He was finally defeated at the Battle of Panipat in 1526. Between 1540 and 1556, Afghans, beginning with Sher Shah Suri, ruled the area. It was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1648. The city was later taken by the Marathas and later still fell to the British Raj.\nAgra is a major tourist destination because of its many Mughal-era buildings, most notably the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur; and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with Lucknow and Varanasi. Agra is in the Braj cultural region.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nAgra features a semiarid climate that borders on a humid subtropical climate. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season. However, the monsoons, though substantial in Agra, are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India. This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a humid subtropical climate.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nAs of 2011 India census, Agra city has a population of 1,585,704, while the population of Agra cantonment is 53,053. The urban agglomeration of Agra has a population of 1,760,285. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Agra city has an average literacy rate of 73%, below the national average of 74%. Literacy rate of males is considerably higher than that of women. The sex ratio in the city was 875 females per thousand males while child sex ratio stood at 857. Agra district literacy rate is 62.56%.According to the 2011 census, Agra district has a population of 4,380,793, roughly equal to the nation of Moldova or the US state of Kentucky. This gives it a ranking of 41st in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of 1,084 inhabitants per square kilometre (2,810/sq mi) .\n52.5% of Agra's population is in the 15\u201359 years age category. Around 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nHindus are 88.8% while Muslims are 9.3% of the population in Agra district. Hinduism, Islam and Jainism are the major religions in Agra city with 80.7%, 15.4% and 1.0% of the population adhering to them; others are 2.9%. The Catholic minority is served by its own Metropolitan Archdiocese of Agra.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval era ===\nMasud Sa'd Salman claims to have been there when Mahmud assaulted Agra, claiming the Raja Japal surrendered after seeing a nightmare. Mahmud however proceeds to pillage the city. The history of the city before the Muslim conquerors is unclear. The 17th century chronicler named Abdhullah said it was a village before the reign of Sikandar Lodi. The king of Mathura had used the Agra fort as a jail. The degradation in the status of the site was a result of the destruction brought upon it by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sultan Sikandar Lod\u012b, the Muslim ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, shifted his capital to Agra in the year 1504. Before this, it was under the lordship of Bayana. After the Sultan's death, the city passed on to his son, Sultan Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b. He ruled his Sultanate from Agra until he fell fighting to Mughal Badshah B\u0101bar in the First battle of Panipat fought in 1526.\n\n\n=== Mughal era ===\n\nThe golden age of the city began with the Mughals. Previously known as Akbarab\u0101d, Agra was the capital of the Mughal Empire under the Badshahs Akbar, Jah\u0101ng\u012br and Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. Akbar made it the eponymous seat of one of his original twelve subahs (imperial top-level provinces), bordering (Old) Delhi, Awadh (Oudh), Allahabad, Malwa and Ajmer subahs. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted his capital to Sh\u0101hjah\u0101nab\u0101d in the year 1648.Since Akbarab\u0101d was one of the most important cities in India under the Mughals, it witnessed a lot of building activity. Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of the river Yamuna. The garden is called the Ar\u0101m B\u0101gh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson Akbar the Great raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarab\u0101d called Fatehpur Sikri. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.\n\nHis son Jah\u0101ng\u012br had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort or L\u0101l Qil'a. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Akbarab\u0101d its most prized monument, the Taj Mahal. Built in loving memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, the mausoleum was completed in 1653.\nSh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted the capital to Delhi during his reign, but his son Aurangzeb moved the capital back to Akbarab\u0101d, usurping his father and imprisoning him in the Fort there.\n\n\n=== Later periods ===\nThe Jat kingdom of Bharatpur waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra.After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of Marathas and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the British Raj in 1803.\n\nIn 1835 when the Presidency of Agra was established by the British, the city became the seat of government, and just two years later it was witness to the Agra famine of 1837\u201338. During the Indian rebellion of 1857 British rule across India was threatened, news of the rebellion had reached Agra on 11 May and on 30 May two companies of native infantry, the 44th and 67th regiments, rebelled and marched to Delhi. The next morning native Indian troops in Agra were forced to disarm, on 15 June Gwalior (which lies south of Agra) rebelled. By 3 July, the British were forced to withdraw into the fort. Two days later a small British force at Sucheta were defeated and forced to withdraw, this led to a mob sacking the city. However, the rebels moved onto Delhi which allowed the British to restore order by 8 July. Delhi fell to the British in September, the following month rebels who had fled Delhi along with rebels from Central India marched on Agra but were defeated. After this British rule was again secured over the city until the independence of India in 1947.\n\n\n=== Legacies ===\nAgra is the birthplace of the religion known as D\u012bn-i Il\u0101h\u012b, which flourished during the reign of Akbar and also of the Radhaswami Faith, which has around two million followers worldwide. Agra has historic linkages with Shauripur of Jainism and Runukta of Hinduism, of 1000 BC. The Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri are all UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n== Administration and politics ==\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\n\n==== General administration ====\nAgra division which consists of four districts, and is headed by the divisional commissioner of Agra, who is an IAS officer, the commissioner is the head of local government institutions (including municipal corporations) in the division, is in charge of infrastructure development in his division, and is also responsible for maintaining law and order in the division.

In December 2017, the cabinet of the UP Government approved the DPR as per New Metro Policy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of Agra Metro on 8 March 2019.\n\n\n== Monumental Mughal legacy ==\n\n\n=== Taj Mahal ===\n\nThe Taj Mahal is one of the most famous buildings in the world, the mausoleum of Shah Jahan's favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is one of the New Seven Wonders of the world, and one of the three World Heritage Sites in Agra. Agra is commonly identified as the \"City of Taj\".Completed in 1653, the Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal king Shah Jahan as the final resting place for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Finished in marble, it is one of India's many beautiful monuments and is set amidst landscaped gardens. Built by the Persian architect, Ust\u0101d '\u012as\u0101, the Taj Mahal is on the south bank of the Yamuna River. It can be observed from Agra Fort from where Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n gazed at it for the last eight years of his life, a prisoner of his son Aurangzeb. Verses of the Quran are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are 22 small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Taj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant dome of the Taj Mahal has a diameter of 60 feet (18 m), and rises to a height of 80 feet (24 m); directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Shah Jah\u0101n's tomb was erected next to hers by his son Aurangzeb. The interiors are decorated with fine inlay work, incorporating semi-precious stones.\n\n\n=== Agra Fort ===\n\nAgra Fort (sometimes called the Red Fort), was commissioned by the conquering Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great in 1565, and is another of Agra's World Heritage Sites. A stone tablet at the gate of the Fort states that it had been built before 1000 but was later renovated by Akbar. The red sandstone fort was converted into a palace during Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's time, and reworked extensively with marble and pietra dura inlay. Notable buildings in the fort include the Pearl Mosque or Mot\u012b Masjid, the D\u012bw\u0101n-e-'\u0100m and D\u012bw\u0101n-e-Kh\u0101s (halls of public and private audience), Jah\u0101ng\u012br's Palace, Kh\u0101s Mahal, Sh\u012bsh Mahal (mirrored palace), and the Musamman Burj.The forbidding exteriors of this fort conceal an inner paradise. The fort is crescent-shaped, flattened on the east with a long, nearly straight wall facing the river. It has a total perimeter of 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi), and is ringed by double castellated ramparts of red sandstone punctuated at regular intervals by bastions. A moat 9 metres (30 ft) wide and 10 metres (33 ft) deep surrounds the outer wall.\nChhatrapati Sh\u012bvaj\u012b visited the Agra Fort, as a result of the conditions of the Treaty of Purandar entered into with Mirz\u0101 R\u0101j\u0101 Jaisingh to meet Aurangzeb in the D\u012bw\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101s (Special Audience Chamber). In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. An insulted Sh\u012bvaj\u012b stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666. Fearing the dungeons and execution he escaped on 17 August 1666.The fort is a typical example of Mughal architecture, effectively showing how the North Indian style of fort construction differed from that of the South. In the South, the majority of forts were built on the seabed like the one at Bekal in Kerala.\n\n\n=== Fatehpur Sikri ===\n\nThe Mughal Emperor Akbar built Fatehpur Sikri about 35 km (22 mi) from Agra, and moved his capital there. Later abandoned, the site displays a number of buildings of significant historical importance. A World Heritage Site, it is often visited by tourists. The name of the place came about after the Mughal Emperor B\u0101bar defeated R\u0101\u1e47\u0101 S\u0101ng\u0101 in a battle at a place called Sikr\u012b (about 40 km (25 mi) from Agra). Then the Mughal Emperor Akbar wanted to make Fatehpur Sikri his headquarters, so he built a majestic fort; due to the shortage of water, however, he had to ultimately move his headquarters to Agra Fort.\nBuland Darw\u0101za or 'the lofty gateway' was built by the great Mughal emperor, Akbar in 1601 CE. at Fatehpur Sikri. Akbar built the Buland Darw\u0101za to commemorate his victory over Gujarat. The Buland Darw\u0101za is approached by 52 steps. The Buland Darw\u0101za is 53.63 metres (175.95 feet) high and 35 metres (115 feet) wide. it is made of red and buff sandstone, decorated by carving and black and white marble inlays. An inscription on the central face of the Buland Darw\u0101za demonstrates Akbar's religious broadmindedness, it is a message from Jesus advising his followers not to consider this world as their permanent home.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== I'tim\u0101d-Ud-Daulah ===\n\nThe Empress N\u016br Jah\u0101n built I'tim\u0101d-Ud-Daulah's Tomb, sometimes called the \"Baby T\u0101j\", for her father, Mirz\u0101 Ghiy\u0101s Beg, the Chief Minister of the Emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br. Located on the left bank of the Yamuna river, the mausoleum is set in a large cruciform garden, criss-crossed by water courses and walkways. The area of the mausoleum itself is about 23 m2 (250 sq ft), and is built on a base that is about 50 m2 (540 sq ft) and about one metre (3.3 feet) high. On each corner are hexagonal towers, about thirteen metres (43 feet) tall. Small in comparison to many other Mughal-era tombs, it is sometimes described as a jewel box. Its garden layout and use of white marble, pietra dura, inlay designs and latticework presage many elements of the Taj Mahal.\nThe walls are white marble from Rajasthan encrusted with semi-precious stone decorations \u2013 cornelian, jasper, lapis lazuli, onyx, and topaz in images of cypress trees and wine bottles, or more elaborate decorations like cut fruit or vases containing bouquets. Light penetrates to the interior through delicate j\u0101l\u012b screens of intricately carved white marble.\nMany of N\u016br Jah\u0101n's relatives are interred in the mausoleum. The only asymmetrical element of the entire complex are the tombs of her father and mother, which have been set side-by-side, a formation replicated in the Taj Mahal.\n\n\n=== Akbar's Tomb, Sikandra ===\n\nSikandra, the last resting place of the Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great, is on the Delhi-Agra Highway, only 13 kilometres (8.1 miles) from the Agra Fort. Akbar's tomb reflects the completeness of his personality. The vast, beautifully carved, red-ochre sandstone tomb with deers, rabbits and langurs is set amidst a lush garden. Akbar himself planned his own tomb and selected a suitable site for it. To construct a tomb in one's lifetime was a Turkic custom which the Mughals followed religiously.

        "wiki": "Jama Masjid in Agra is opposite the Agra fort and overlooking the Agra Fort Railway Station. The Jama Masjid is also popularly known as the Jami Masjid or \"Friday Mosque\". It is one of the largest mosques in India.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Mosque was built by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan in the honour of his eldest daughter, Jahanara Begum Sahiba in 1648 A.D. There was a spacious, octagonal Tripolia Chowk which existed between the Jama Masjid and the Delhi gate of the Agra Fort. This Tropolia was destroyed in order to create the Agra Fort Railway Station. The cloisters have engrailed arches supported on pillars. The main entrance is through the eastern side. The prayer chamber has a fa\u00e7ade with a broad arched iwan in its centre and is adorned with slender turrets alternated with kiosks. Its dome is the largest and highest of the three domes crowning the sanctuary.\nAll the bulbous domes have inverted lotus and Kalash finials on the top and have narrow zigzag courses of white marble alternated by broad bands of red stone. There is a fountain with four kiosks in its corners in the centre of the courtyard. The interiors of the western wall have a beautiful mihrab and pulpit in white marble. The Persian inscription in white marble inlaid with black stone on the archway of the central portal is in praise of Jahanara and Shah Jshan. The pristine beauty of the mosque must have been breathtaking as it was compared to the Beaty of the Baitul-Mamur, the fabulous mosque of rubies and pearls situated in the fourth sky. It is said that it was once surrounded by a market place called Tripolia set in an octagonal (Muthamman) Chowk that was built between the Delhi Gate and the Jami Masjid. But, it was later destroyed in 1871-73 A.D. to acquire space for laying down the railway tracks for the city.\nIt required six years and 5,000 workers to finish. It was made using red sandstone and marble.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe Jama Masjid of Agra is constructed of red sandstone with intricate white marble decorations. The walls and ceilings of the mosque are painted blue in color. It is a huge mosque in the center of Agra surrounded by a great bazaar.\nThe Mosque itself stands on high platform to which ascent is made by a flight of 35 steps. It was designed to attract the eye of the faithful from afar and proclaim the glory of Islam. \nIt has well-balanced proportions and a courtyard surrounded by cloisters on three of its sides and the prayer chamber on its western side. The cloisters have engrailed arches supported on pillars. All the bulbous domes have inverted lotus and kalash finials on the top and have narrow zigzag courses of white marble alternated by broad bands of red stone. There is a fountain with four kiosks in its corners in the centre of the courtyard. \nAlong the wings of the main prayer wall, panels of beautifully inlaid sandstone similar to those decorating the main gateway of the Taj Mahal, add an appropriately feminine touch. Still in use today, the mosque is one of the city's main landmarks, and serves as a useful reference point when exploring the crowded bazaars that sprawl from its base. These are laid out in a street plan that's barely altered since Mughal days.\nJami Masjid is beautifully decorated with paintings, inlaid stones, carvings, and glazed tiles. The building comprises pillared Dalan, a beautiful 'Chhajja' and the 'Chhatri' on the roof. The main Iwan of the building is rather simple and contains a central arch with geometrical designs.\n\n\n== In Literature ==\nAn engraving of this mosque appears in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1832 together with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon.\n\n\n== External links ==\nAerial View of the Jama Masjid\nhttp://www.agraindia.org.uk/monuments/jami-masjid-agra.html",

        "wiki": "Dara Shikoh, also known as Dara Shukoh (Hindi: \u0926\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0936\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0939, Urdu: \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0634\u0650\u06a9\u0648\u06c1\u200e),\n(20 March 1615 \u2013 30 August 1659) was the eldest son and heir-apparent of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Dara was designated with the title Padshahzada-i-Buzurg Martaba (\"Prince of High Rank\") and was favoured as a successor by his father and his older sister, Princess Jahanara Begum. In the war of succession which ensued after Shah Jahan's illness in 1657, Dara was defeated by his younger brother Prince Muhiuddin (later, the Emperor Aurangzeb). He was executed in 1659 on Aurangzeb's orders in a bitter struggle for the imperial throne.Dara was a liberal-minded unorthodox Muslim as opposed to the orthodox Aurangzeb. A great patron of the arts, he was also more inclined towards philosophy and mysticism rather than military pursuits. The course of the history of the Indian subcontinent, had Dara Shikoh prevailed over Aurangzeb, has been a matter of some conjecture among historians.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nMuhammad Dara Shikoh was born on 11 March 1615 in Ajmer, Rajasthan. He was the first son and third child of Prince Shahab-ud-din Muhammad Khurram and his second wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The prince was named by his father. 'Dara' means owner of wealth or star in Persian while the second part of the prince's name is commonly spelled in two ways: Shikoh (terror) or Shukoh (majesty or grandeur). Thus, Dara's full name can be translated as \"Of the Terror of Darius\" or \"Of the Grandeur of Darius\", respectively. Historian Ebba Koch favours 'Shukoh'.Dara Shikoh had thirteen siblings of whom six survived to adulthood: Jahanara Begum, Shah Shuja, Roshanara Begum, Aurangzeb, Murad Bakhsh, and Gauhara Begum. He shared a close relationship with his older sister, Jahanara. As part of his formal education, Dara studied the Quran, history, Persian poetry and calligraphy. He was a liberal-minded unorthodox Muslim unlike his father and his younger brother Aurangzeb.In October 1627, Dara's grandfather Emperor Jahangir died, and his father ascended the throne in January 1628 taking the regnal name 'Shah Jahan'. In 1633, Dara was appointed as the Vali-ahad (heir-apparent) to his father. He, along with his older sister Jahanara, were Shah Jahan's favourite children.\n\n\n== Marriage ==\n\nDuring the life time of his mother Mumtaz Mahal, Dara Shikoh was betrothed to his half-cousin, Princess Nadira Banu Begum, the daughter of his paternal uncle Sultan Parvez Mirza. He married her on 1 February 1633 at Agra; midst great celebrations, pomp and grandeur. By all accounts, Dara and Nadira were devoted to each other and Dara's love for Nadira was so profound that unlike the usual practice of polygyny prevalent at the time, he never contracted any other marriage. The imperial couple had seven children together, with two sons, Sulaiman Shikoh and Sipihr Shikoh and a daughter Jahanzeb Banu Begum, surviving to play important roles in future events.A great patron of the arts, Dara ordered for the compilation of some refined artwork into an album which is now famous by the name of 'Dara Shikhoh Album.' This album was presented by Dara to his 'dearest intimate friend' Nadira in 1641. Dara had at least two concubines, Gul Safeh (also known as Rana Dil) and Udaipuri Mahal (a Georgian or Armenian slave girl). Udaipuri later became a part of Aurangzeb's harem after her master's defeat.\n\n\n== Military service ==\nAs was common for all Mughal sons, Dara Shikoh was appointed as a military commander at an early age, receiving an appointment as commander of 12,000-foot and 6,000 horse in October 1633. He received successive promotions, being promoted to commander of 12,000-foot and 7,000 horse on 20 March 1636, to 15,000-foot and 9,000 horse on 24 August 1637, to 10,000 horse on 19 March 1638, to 20,000-foot and 10,000 horse on 24 January 1639, and to 15,000 horse on 21 January 1642.\nOn 10 September 1642, Shah Jahan formally confirmed Dara Shikoh as his heir, granting him the title of Shahzada-e-Buland Iqbal (\"Prince of High Fortune\") and promoting him to command of 20,000-foot and 20,000 horse. In 1645, he was appointed as subahdar (governor) of Allahabad. He was promoted to a command of 30,000-foot and 20,000 horse on 18 April 1648, and was appointed Governor of the province of Gujarat on 3 July.As his father's health began to decline, Dara Shikoh received a series of increasingly prominent commands. He was appointed Governor of Multan and Kabul on 16 August 1652, and was raised to the title of Shah-e-Buland Iqbal (\"King of High Fortune\") on 15 February 1655. He was promoted to command of 40,000-foot and 20,000 horse on 21 January 1656, and to command of 50,000-foot and 40,000 horse on 16 September 1657.\n\n\n== The struggle for succession ==\n\nOn 6 September 1657, the illness of emperor Shah Jahan triggered a desperate struggle for power among the four Mughal princes, though realistically only Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb had a chance of emerging victorious. Shah Shuja was the first to make his move, declaring himself Mughal Emperor in Bengal and marched towards Agra from the east. Murad Baksh allied himself with Aurangzeb.\nAt the end of 1657, Dara Shikoh was appointed Governor of the province of Bihar and promoted to command of 60,000 infantry and 40,000 cavalry.(roughly equivalent to general)Despite strong support from Shah Jahan, who had recovered enough from his illness to remain a strong factor in the struggle for supremacy, and the victory of his army led by his eldest son Sulaiman Shikoh over Shah Shuja in the battle of Bahadurpur on 14 February 1658, Dara Shikoh was defeated by Aurangzeb and Murad during the Battle of Samugarh, 13 km from Agra on 30 May 1658. Subsequently, Aurangzeb took over Agra fort and deposed emperor Shah Jahan on 8 June 1658.\n\n\n== Death and aftermath ==\n\nAfter the defeat, Dara Shikoh retreated from Agra to Delhi and thence to Lahore. His next destination was Multan and then to Thatta (Sindh). From Sindh, he crossed the Rann of Kachchh and reached Kathiawar, where he met Shah Nawaz Khan, the governor of the province of Gujarat who opened the treasury to Dara Shikoh and helped him to recruit a new army. He occupied Surat and advanced towards Ajmer. Foiled in his hopes of persuading the fickle but powerful Rajput feudatory, Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Marwar, to support his cause, Dara Shikoh decided to make a stand and fight Aurangzeb's relentless pursuers but was once again comprehensively routed in the battle of Deorai (near Ajmer) on 11 March 1659. After this defeat he fled to Sindh and sought refuge under Malik Jiwan (Junaid Khan Barozai), an Afghan chieftain, whose life had on more than one occasion been saved by the Mughal prince from the wrath of Shah Jahan. However, Junaid betrayed Dara Shikoh and turned him (and his second son Sipihr Shikoh) over to Aurangzeb's army on 10 June 1659.Dara Shikoh was brought to Delhi, placed on a filthy elephant and paraded through the streets of the capital in chains. Dara Shikoh's fate was decided by the political threat he posed as a prince popular with the common people \u2013 a convocation of nobles and clergy, called by Aurangzeb in response to the perceived danger of insurrection in Delhi, declared him a threat to the public peace and an apostate from Islam. He was assassinated by four of Aurangzeb's henchmen in front of his terrified son on the night of 30 August 1659 (9 September Gregorian). After death the remains of Dara Shikoh were buried in an unidentified grave in Humayan's tomb in Delhi. On 26 February 2020 the government of India through Archaeological Survey of India decided to find the burial spot of Dara Shikoh from the 140 graves in 120 chambers inside Humayun's Tomb. It is considered a difficult task as none of the graves are identified or have inscriptions. Niccolao Manucci, the Venetian traveler who worked in the Mughal court, has written down the details of Dara Shikoh's death. According to him, upon Dara's capture, Aurangzeb ordered his men to have his head brought up to him and he inspected it thoroughly to ensure that it was Dara indeed. He then further mutilated the head with his sword three times. After which, he ordered the head to be put in a box and presented to his ailing father, Shah Jahan, with clear instructions to be delivered only when the old King sat for his dinner in his prison. The guards were also instructed to inform Shah Jahan that, \u201cKing Aurangzeb, your son, sends this plate to let him (Shah Jahan) see that he does not forget him\u201d. Shah Jahan instantly became happy (not knowing what was in store in the box) and uttered, \u201c Blessed be God that my son still remembers me\u201d. Upon opening the box, Shah Jahan became horrified and fell unconscious.\n\n\n== Intellectual pursuits ==\n\nDara Shikoh is widely renowned as an enlightened paragon of the harmonious coexistence of heterodox traditions on the Indian subcontinent. He was an erudite champion of mystical religious speculation and a poetic diviner of syncretic cultural interaction among people of all faiths. This made him a heretic in the eyes of his orthodox younger brother and a suspect eccentric in the view of many of the worldly power brokers swarming around the Mughal throne. Dara Shikoh was a follower of the Persian \"perennialist\" mystic Sarmad Kashani, as well as Lahore's famous Qadiri Sufi saint Mian Mir, whom he was introduced to by Mullah Shah Badakhshi (Mian Mir's spiritual disciple and successor). Mian Mir was so widely respected among all communities that he was invited to lay the foundation stone of the Golden Temple in Amritsar by the Sikhs.\n\nDara Shikoh subsequently developed a friendship with the seventh Sikh Guru, Guru Har Rai. Dara Shikoh devoted much effort towards finding a common mystical language between Islam and Hinduism. Towards this goal he completed the translation of fifty Upanishads from their original Sanskrit into Persian in 1657 so that they could be studied by Muslim scholars. His translation is often called Sirr-e-Akbar (\"The Greatest Mystery\"), where he states boldly, in the introduction, his speculative hypothesis that the work referred to in the Qur'an as the \"Kitab al-maknun\" or the hidden book, is none other than the Upanishads. His most famous work, Majma-ul-Bahrain (\"The Confluence of the Two Seas\"), was also devoted to a revelation of the mystical and pluralistic affinities between Sufic and Vedantic speculation. The book was authored as a short treatise in Persian in 1654\u201355.The library established by Dara Shikoh still exists on the grounds of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Kashmiri Gate, Delhi, and is now run as a museum by Archaeological Survey of India after being renovated.\n\n\n== Patron of arts ==\n\nHe was also a patron of fine arts, music and dancing, a trait frowned upon by his younger sibling Muhiuddin, later the Emperor Aurangzeb. The 'Dara Shikoh' is a collection of paintings and calligraphy assembled from the 1630s until his death. It was presented to his wife Nadira Banu in 1641\u201342 and remained with her until her death after which the album was taken into the royal library and the inscriptions connecting it with Dara Shikoh were deliberately erased; however not everything was vandalised and many calligraphy scripts and paintings still bear his mark.\nAmong the existing paintings from the Dara Shikoh Album, are two facing pages, compiled in the early 1630s just before his marriage, showing two ascetics in yogic postures, probably meant to be a pair of yogis, Vaishnava and Shaiva. these paintings are attributed to the artist Govardhan. The album also contains numerous pictures of Muslim ascetics and divines and the pictures obviously reflects Dara Shikoh's interest in religion and philosophy.Dara Shikoh is also credited with the commissioning of several exquisite, still extant, examples of Mughal architecture \u2013 among them the tomb of his wife Nadira Begum in Lahore, the Shrine of Mian Mir also in Lahore, the Dara Shikoh Library in Delhi, the Akhun Mullah Shah Mosque in Srinagar in Kashmir and the Pari Mahal garden palace (also in Srinagar in Kashmir).\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe issues surrounding Dara Shikoh's impeachment and execution are used to explore contradictory interpretations of Islam in a 2008 play, The Trial of Dara Shikoh,  written by Akbar S. Ahmed.\nHe is also the subject of a 2010 play called Dara Shikoh, written and directed by Shahid Nadeem of the Ajoka Theatre Group in Pakistan.\nDara Shikoh is the subject of the 2007 play Dara Shikoh, written by Danish Iqbal and staged by, among others, the director M S Sathyu in 2008.\nHe is also a character played by Vaquar Sheikh in the 2005 Bollywood film Taj Mahal: An Eternal Love Story, directed by Akbar Khan.\nDara Shikoh is the name of the protagonist of Mohsin Hamid's 2000 novel Moth Smoke, which reimagines the story of his trial unfolding in contemporary Pakistan.\nThe television series Upanishad Ganga had two episodes titled \"Veda \u2013 The Source of Dharma 1\" and \"Veda \u2013 The Source of Dharma 2\", featuring Dara Shikoh played by actor Zakir Hussain.\nGopalkrishna Gandhi wrote a play in verse titled Dara Shukoh on his life.\nBengali Writer Shyamal Gangapadhyay wrote a novel on his life Shahjada Dara Shikoh which received Sahitya Academy Award in 1993.\nAssamese writer and politician, Omeo Kumar Das wrote a book called Dara Shikoh: Jeevan O Sadhana.\nUzbek writer Hamid Ismailov wrote a novel called A Poet and Bin-Laden the second part of which devoted to the life of Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb.\nAn Assamese novel, Kalantarat Shahzada Dara Shikoh, was written by author Nagen Goswami.\n\"Dara Shikoh\" \u2013 a poem by poet Abhay K published in 2014 lamented the fact that there were no streets named after Dara.\nNew Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) changed Dalhousie Road's name to Dara Shikoh Road on February 6, 2017.\nIn 2016 Bharatvarsh TV series, Rohit Purohit played the role of Dara Shikoh.\nIn The 2017 novel 1636: Mission to the Mughals he is one of the central characters.\nRanveer Singh has been cast as Dara Shikoh in the upcoming Karan Johar directorial Takht, stated for a 2020 release.\nDara Shikoh award awarded by indo-Iranian society. The award includes a sum of Rs. 1 lakh, a shawl and citation.

          "A walk around a bird and nature park just outside the entrance to the Taj Mahal. Really nice and relaxing place for a walk used mainly by locals rather than tourists. Loads of birds. Well worth going if you like a walk in the country. You can do the shorter walk on paths or head",
          "Right in the middle of the city! This nature walk is an oasis of peace and calm. There are many opportunities to get viewings of wild birds in natural surroundings. Best to visit at sunrise or towards sunset. The local authorities have gone to much effort to place useful",
          "Taj Nature Walk is host to many animals and birds like peacock, Robin, Flycatcher, Pigeon, parakeet, squirrels and Hyena etc. The staff is cooperative and humble. There is a Taj view spot as well. There is a little water lake too which is a home for water snakes. There is a",
          "We went for a walk early in the morning. It was a great nature walk where we saw the Taj, peacocks, parrots and a lot of other birds. It\u2019s a very neat and clean park.",
          "Even in this scorching summer it was like cake walk since the breeze was cooling us like a natural air conditioner. There was no dehydration as we were consuming water like anything.",
          "We found this walk just off the main road to the Taj - what a hidden treasure. Initially I thought it was going to be 200 m loop but the paths are extensive and lead you to fabulous views of the Taj. Amazed that there were very few people enjoying the space and serenity so close",
          "When you first arrive, it is very possible that you will question why you bothered. But as you start walking you will begin to notice the birds and butterflies, but the real reason to come here are the views of the Taj Mahal. A unique perspective of a magnificent building, that",
          "Great place to walk, exercise, yoga with view of Taj Mahal. Its very well maintain walk way around trees and bushes and you can see different birds as well so overall good place to walk in green environment and see the Taj Mahal",
          "A lovely place for a stroll, larger than expected, a stones\u2019 throw from the Taj Mahal, but a million miles from the touts. Climb any hill top for clear views and that unique photo across the tree tops, of one of the wonders of the world. The nature walk is part natural, part",
          "We arrived at 7.30am to do some bird photography. There are loads of peacocks and peahens, as well as treepies, bee eaters, grebes and some smaller birds we couldn't identify. It was very dry so no waterbirds about. There are numerous very good views of the Taj. However, another",
          "billed as a wild bird and life sanctuary I was keen to see this. I even paid my 100 rupees as a foreigner to enter, and I saw one peacock numerous ground squirrels, some unidentified birds - like the Indian version of our crow and that was about it! Ooooh and a tiger!!!!!!",
          "Waste of time and money as we didn't see any wildlife while in the so called bird sanctuary. Don't let the sign and nicely painted walls at the entry gate fool you thinking that you will see many different birds and other animals. For a non Indian the entry is 100 rupees and",
          "Despite the price being 50 rupees on the website, it costs 100 per foreign tourist. The walk is a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of Agra. We went at sunset, and we sat on one of the numerous hills overlooking the Taj. A beautiful, must-do if you want a relaxing",
          "Went here for a sunset stroll and found it really nice. Be careful you don't go in until you see the Taj nature walk sign clearly marked or you'll likely end up in the Leper Colony (seriously). Lot's of peacocks and other birds, some nice views of the Taj, but best this is the",
          "The most surprising part of this vast piece of greenery very close to Taj Mahal is that it is still preserved close to nature. The vast area of flora and fauna is developed as a nature walk with nicely paved walkways around the park. It is lovely to hear variet of birds chirping",
          "A nice opportunity to get away from the crowds, but also from the filth and pollution, on your visit to Agra and the Taj Mahal. A strict policy of no plastic offers a rare glimpse of a nearly pristine Indian landscape, filled with nature of all kinds, including Peacocks,",
          "It took me close to 5 visits to Agra before I got to know about this hidden but beautiful place. It is approximately 500 meters from eastern gate of Taj Mahal. Opens up at 6 in the morning and is suited for morning and evening walk or at anytime if weather is good. This place",
          "it's 2-3 km approach road to Tajmahal, build with red paved blocks/ tiles, restricted for use of electrically operated vehicles , man pulled rickshaws, horse driven Tangas with both the shoulders kept for walkers. it's very clean, picturesque and dotted with nice shops on one",
          "This little gem of a nature walk is conveniently located 500 metres from the East Gate (entrance). A lovely paved walk within a natural setting offering good views of the Taj Mahal and relaxing resting places grassed & benches.",
          "The park itself is quite large, but only a small part is open to visitors. The whole walk is only like a half mile. The views of the Taj are no better than the views of the Taj from the sections of trees just to the south of the Taj within the Taj complex. It is quite pricey for",
          "The Nature Walk was recommended by our host in Agra, and it turned out to be a real treasure! You can wander on different paths through the forrest and see the Taj Mahal from a totally different angle with trees in the foreground. You can rest on benches all over the place. When",
          "For unexpected views of the Taj Mahal as well as a gentle stroll along woodland paths, with more birds than people, this is a lovely way to spend some down time if you're interested in more than a flying visit to the Taj. We lay around on the grass with books for a pleasant hour",
          "A much more peaceful way to see the Taj Mahal (much better view), beautiful walk with the sounds of the local wildlife rather than the beeping and constant chanting over loud speakers. For a mere 100 INR we spent longer here than at the Taj itself.",
          "You can easily devote an hour or two of your time in Agra (if you're staying in Agra for a few days). The views of the Taj Mahal are great, though pollution clearly affects the quality of these views). After a walk in Agra's streets, it's really restful to walk among the trees",
          "This park is huge, we almost got lost. We saw many birds (kingfisher, bee-eaters, peacocks, hoopoe) and even a deer. For people who are not that much into nature it is also a great park to escape the city and read a good book near the lake.",
          "We opted for this instead of actually going to the Taj Mahal, as my partner was ill and couldn't spend too much time walking around in the heat with other tourists. We were very pleased with our choice as it was only 100rupees for foreigners, a well kept park with nice flora and",

          "With all those nature preservation signs and the high walls, I hoped to see more wildlife/flora, but this is nothing else than a path through a city park. Exected more than peacocks and chipmunks! Not unpleasing if you have an hour to spend, but there really isnt much to it... I",
          "This is a great way to escape the crowds of Agra with wonderful views of the Taj Mahal. Only 100 rupees (for tourists) to walk around this clean and peaceful garden which has a number of unique viewing points of the taj. There is a playground inside and a shop where you can buy",
          "This place is a real gem, a beautiful, quiet park right next to the noise and crowds of Taj Mahal. I was there early on a Friday morning (when Taj is closed), so maybe it was quieter than usual, but it was almost deserted. Peacocks walked around undisturbed and there were many",

          "After the madness of the scramble to get in to the Taj Mahal grounds (which of course is worth all the trouble) and being part of all the crowds there, the Taj Nature Walk is a a relaxing alternative for another day in Agra. We paid our \u00a31 entrance fee at the gate, and",
          "Visiting the Taj Nature Walk was a better experience than the Taj Mahal for me. It is a beautifully landscaped park over an expanse of 11 hectares, perfect for a sunny afternoon in winters or a quiet getaway at any time of the day actually. It is not so crowded like the Taj,",
          "Doesn't offer anything you would expect from the hype it has. Ideal for a morning walk and a view of Taj from east end.",
          "Less than a Kilometer before Taj Mahal. View Taj from a very different Angle.[Always Taj looks best when seen from the front, from a distance ] But the views from this place is worth. Very well maintained Garden. Squirrels, pigeons, butterflies, many species of birds & insects",

          "After the hustle off the Taj this is a fab place to get away from the touts. Very peaceful and you get some awsome views of the Taj. Lovely gardens to sit and relax plenty of birds to see. You can spend an hour or a day in here",
          "i love to go for walks and if i would be living in Agra i would have for sure been there every day, but then i would have to do something about the ticket. I loved this place when i went there for the sunset , totally different view from here and also the sunset wow , Taj and",

          "it looks unassuming from the street but if you are after a quiet peaceful stroll in Agra then do yourself a favour and visit the Taj Nature Walk. I think it cost a pittance to enter and you get not only a lovely garden but a good view from a distance of the fabled monument.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Mariam-uz-Zamani (Persian: \u0645\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u200e, lit. 'Mary of the Age'), (c. 1542 \u2013 19 May 1623) was a wife of the Mughal emperor Akbar. She has also been referred to by several other names, including Hira Kunwari, Harkha Bai and Jodha Bai.Born a Hindu-Rajput princess, in 1562, Mariam-uz-Zamani was offered in marriage to Akbar by her father, Raja Bharmal of Amber. The wedding, held in Sambhar, was a political one and was a sign of complete submission of her father to his imperial overlord. Her marriage to Akbar led to a gradual shift in his religious and social policy. She is widely regarded in modern Indian historiography as exemplifying Akbar's and the Mughal's tolerance of religious differences and their inclusive policies within an expanding multi-ethnic and multi-denominational empire.She was to become the mother of Akbar's eldest surviving son and eventual successor, Jahangir.\n\n\n== Name and background ==\nMariam-uz-Zamani was born in 1542, the daughter of Raja Bharmal of Amber by his wife Rani Champavati, daughter of Rao Ganga Solanki. Her paternal grandparents were Raja Prithviraj Singh I and Apurva Devi, a daughter of Rao Lunkaran of Bikaner.The name she was given at birth is unknown. 'Mariam-uz-Zamani' was in fact a title bestowed on her by Akbar on the occasion of their son Jahangir's birth. This was the name by which she was referred to in contemporary Mughal chronicles, including Jahangir's autobiography, the Tuzk-e-Jahangiri. Later historical accounts give several suggestions for her birth name. In an 18th-century genealogy of her clan (the Kachwahas) for example, she is referred to as 'Harkhan Champavati'. Other names provided by various sources include Harkha Bai, Jiya Rani, Maanmati, Harika, and Shahi-Bai. However, the name by which she is most popularly known in modern-times is 'Jodha Bai'.The name 'Jodha Bai' was first used in relation to Mariam-uz-Zamani in James Tod's Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han, a colonialist history written in the early 19th century. This naming appears to have been an error, given that it implies a relation with the royal family of Jodhpur, rather than that with the Rajas of Amber. Further to this, there is no historical record of Akbar having married a princess of Jodhpur at all. Instead, it is believed that 'Jodha Bai' in fact refers to the wife of Jahangir, Jagat Gosain daughter of Raja Udai Singh  of Jodhpur.\n\n\n== Marriage ==\nMariam-uz-Zamani's marriage was the result of a conflict between her father and Akbar's brother-in-law Sharif-ud-din Mirza, the Hakim of Mewat. Bharmal, facing harassment at Sharif-ud-din's hands, approached Akbar to request his intervention. The emperor agreed to mediate on the condition of Bharmal's personal submission, as well as the suggestion that Mariam-uz-Zamani be given to Akbar in marriage.\n\nThe marriage, thus a political one, took place on 6 February 1562, while Akbar was on his way back to Agra from Ajmer (after offering prayers to the tomb of Moinuddin Chishti) at the imperial military camp in Sambhar, Rajasthan, instead of the bride's natal home in Ajmer (which was only 80 miles away). This was a sign that the marriage was not of equals and indicated Bharmal's family's inferior social status. The marriage with the Amber princess provided the service of her family throughout the reign, and offered a proof manifest to all the world that Akbar had decided to be the Badshah or Shahenshah of his whole people i.e. Hindus as well as Muslims.Akbar took many Rajput princesses in marriage as the rajas had much to gain from the link to imperial family. He made such marriages respectable for Rajputs. Akbar did not convert any of his Hindu wives to Islam and permitted them to perform their rituals in the palace, and even participated occasionally. However, the Rajput wives (including Mariam-uz-Zamani) did not play any political role in the Mughal court.In 1569, Akbar heard the news that his first Hindu wife was expecting a child, and that he might hope for the first of the three sons that had previously been promised to him by Sheikh Salim Chisti, a reputed holy man who lived at Sikri. The expectant empress was sent to Sheikh's humble dwelling Sikri during the latter period of her pregnancy. On 30 August 1569, the boy was born and received the name Salim, in acknowledgement of his father's faith in the efficacy of the holy man's prayer. Though she remained a Hindu, the new mother was subsequently honoured with the title Mariam-uz-Zamani (\"Mary of the Age\").\n\n\n== Family advancement ==\nThe Rajas of Amber (who came from a very small kingdom) especially benefited from their close association with the Mughals, and acquired immense wealth and power. Of twenty-seven Rajputs in Abu'l-Fazl list of mansabdars, thirteen were of the Amber clan, and some of them rose to positions as high as that of imperial princes. Mariam-uz-Zamani's brother Raja Bhagwan Das, for instance, became commander of 5000, the highest position available at that time, and bore the proud title Amirul-Umara (Chief Noble). His son, Man Singh I, rose even higher to become commander of 7000. His daughter, Manbhawati Bai or Manmati Bai, married Jahangir on 13 February 1585. Man Bai later became mother to Prince Khusrau Mirza and was awarded the title of Shah Begum.\n\n\n== Jahangir's reign ==\nAlthough she may have enjoyed a certain status in Akbar's imperial household after giving birth to the heir, Mariam-uz-Zamani gained prestige only during Jahangir's reign (as the emperor's mother), after he had succeeded Akbar as Mughal emperor in 1605. During the reign of Jahangir, she was amongst the most prodigious female traders at the Mughal court. No other noblewoman on record seems to have been as adventurous a trader as the Queen mother.Mariam-uz-Zamani owned ships that carried pilgrims to and from the Islamic holy city Mecca. In 1613, her ship, the Rah\u012bm\u012b , was seized by Portuguese pirates along with the 600-700 passengers onboard and the cargo. Rah\u012bm\u012b was the largest Indian ship sailing in the Red Sea and was known to the Europeans as the \"great pilgrimage ship\". When the Portuguese officially refused to return the ship and the passengers, the outcry at the Mughal court was quite unusually severe. The outrage was compounded by the fact that the owner and the patron of the ship was the revered dowager empress. Jahangir, in retaliation ordered the seizure of the Portuguese town Daman. This episode is considered to be an example of the struggle for wealth that would later ensue and lead to colonisation of the Indian sub-continent.She was known to receive a jewel from every nobleman \"according to his estate\" each year on the occasion of New Year's festival. Like only a few other women at the Mughal court, Mariam-uz-Zamani was granted the right to issue official documents by Jahangir, called firmans, usually the exclusive privilege of the emperor. Issuing of such orders was confined to the highest ladies of the harem such as Hamida Banu Begum, Nur Jahan, Mumtaz Mahal, Nadira Banu Begum, Jahanara Begum etc.  It was quite common for women of noble birth to commission architecture in the Mughal Empire, so Mariam-uz-Zamani built gardens, wells, mosques and other developments around the countryside.These courtesies and largesses demonstrate the amount of respect and love Jahangir held for his mother, Mariam-uz-Zamani. A number of royal functions took place in the household of Mariam-uz-Zamani like Jahangir's solar weighing, Jahangir's marriage to daughter of Jagat Singh, and Shehzada Parviz's wedding to daughter of Sultan Murad Mirza.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nMariam-uz-Zamani died in 1623. The grave itself is underground with a flight of steps leading to it. Her tomb, built in 1623\u201327, is on the Tantpur road now known as in Jyoti Nagar. Mariam's Tomb, commissioned by her son, is only a kilometre from Tomb of Akbar the Great.\nThe Mosque of Mariam Zamani Begum Sahiba was built by Jahangir in her honour and is situated in the Walled City of Lahore, present day Pakistan.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nSulochana portrayed Rani Jodha Bai in 1953 film Anarkali.\nDurga Khote portrayed Mariam uz-Zamani in the 1960 Indian epic film Mughal-e-Azam.\nAishwarya Rai portrayed Jodha Bai in the 2008 film Jodhaa Akbar directed by Ashutosh Gowarikar.\nParidhi Sharma played the role of Jodha Bai in historical drama series Jodha Akbar which ran from 2013 to 2015.\nDelnaaz Irani portrayed Mariam-uz-Zamani in historical comedy series Har Mushkil Ka Hal Akbar Birbal from 2014 to 2016. She was replaced by Pragati Mehra in 2016 for few episodes as she was unavailable due to personal issues.\nJodha Bai was portrayed by Gurdeep Kohli in the Colors TV series Dastaan-E-Mohabbat Salim Anarkali.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.\nIt had been used by the early mughal rulers. The Fort stands on an ancient site and was traditionally known as Badalgarh. It was captured by Ghaznavi for some time but in the 15th century A.D. the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487\u20131517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556\u20131605).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli (step well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri's general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.\n\nRealising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, Abul Fazl, recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in Rajasthan. Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.It was only during the reign of Akbar's grandson, Shah Jahan, that the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the beautiful Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from white marble. He destroyed some of the earlier buildings inside the fort to make his own.The fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 Years. In the fort, they built the Ratan Singh ki haveli. The fort was invaded and captured by the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century. Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at Third Battle of Panipat by Ahmad Shah Abdali in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next decade. Finally Mahadji Shinde took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, in 1803.The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857, which caused the end of the British East India Company's rule in India, and led to a century of direct rule of India by Britain.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe 380,000 m2 (94-acre) fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river Yamuna and its walls are seventy feet high. Double ramparts have massive circular bastions at intervals, with battlements, embrasures, machicolations and string courses. Four gates were provided on its four sides, one Khizri gate opening on to the river.Two of the fort's gates are notable: the \"Delhi Gate\" and the \"Lahore Gate.\" The Lahore Gate is also popularly also known as the \"Amar Singh Gate,\" for Amar Singh Rathore.The monumental Delhi Gate, which faces the city on the western side of the fort, is considered the grandest of the four gates and a masterpiece of Akbar's time. It was built circa 1568 both to enhance security and as the king's formal gate, and includes features related to both. It is embellished with intricate inlay work in white marble. A wooden drawbridge was used to cross the moat and reach the gate from the mainland; inside, an inner gateway called Hathi Pol (\"Elephant Gate\") \u2013 guarded by two life-sized stone elephants with their riders \u2013 added another layer of security. The drawbridge, slight ascent, and 90-degree turn between the outer and inner gates make the entrance impregnable. During a siege, attackers would employ elephants to crush a fort's gates. Without a level, straight run-up to gather speed, however, that thing is prevented by this layout.Because the Indian military (the Parachute Brigade in particular) is still using the northern portion of the Agra Fort, the Delhi Gate cannot be used by the public. Tourists enter via the Amar Singh Gate.The site is very important in terms of architectural history. Abul Fazal recorded that five hundred buildings in the beautiful designs of Bengal and Gujarat were built in the fort. Some of them were demolished by Shah Jahan to make way for his white marble palaces. Most of the others were destroyed by the British troops of East India Company between 1803 and 1862 for raising barracks. Hardly thirty Mughal buildings have survived on the south-eastern side, facing the river, such as the Delhi Gate and Akbar Gate and one palace \u2013 \"Bengali Mahal\".\nAkbar Darwazza (Akbar Gate) was renamed Amar Singh Gate by Shah Jahan.  The gate is similar in design to the Delhi Gate. Both are built of red sandstone.The Bengali Mahal is built of red sandstone and is now split into Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal.\n\n\n== Other Historic sites inside Agra Fort ==\nJahangir's Hauz (tank) A.D. 1610: This monolithic tank (hauz) was used for bathing. It is 5 feet high, 8 feet in diameter and 25 feet in circumference. On the external side of the rim there is an inscription in Persian which mentions it as 'Hauz-e-Jahangir'. It was first discovered near the courtyard of Akbar's palace. In A.D. 1843 and later it was placed in front of Diwan-e-Am. In 1862, it was shifted to public garden (Company Bagh) where it suffered much damage. Later, Sir John Marshall brought it back to Agra Fort and placed there. Due to this hauz, the palace became famous as Jahangiri Mahal though it is part of Akbar's Bengali mahal.\nShahjahani Mahal (1628-35 A.D.): It is situated in between the white marble Khas Mahal and the red stone Jahangiri Mahal and is set transitionally in between these two residential complexes of two different ages. It is the earliest attempt of the Mughal emperor Shahjahan to convert an existing red stone building in accordance with his taste and it was his earliest palace in Agra Fort. It has a large hall, side rooms and an octagonal tower on the riverside. The skeletal construction of brick and red stone was all redone with a thick white stucco plaster and colourfully painted in floral designs. The whole palace once glistened white like white marble. On the face towards the Khas Mahal, is a large spacious white marble dalan, composed of five arches, supported on double pillars and protected externally by a chhajja. Its closed western bay houses, the Ghaznin gate, Babur's baoli and a well are situated beneath it.\nGhaznin Gate (1030 A.D.): The gate originally belonged to the tomb of Mahmud Ghaznavi at Ghazni. It was brought from there by the British in1842. Lord Ellenborough, the Governor General, in historic proclamation claimed, that these were the sandalwood gates of Somnath which Mahmud had taken to Ghazni in 1025, and the British had thus avenged an insult of 800 years back. This false claim was made just to win the goodwill of the Indian people. The gate is, in fact, made of local deodar wood of Ghazni and not of sandalwood. The style of decoration bears no resemblance to ancient Gujrati woodwork. There is also an Arabic inscription carved on the upper part. It mentions Mahmud with his epithets. Sir John Marshall had placed here a notice-board which described the whole episode about this gate. It is 16.5 feet high and 13.5 feet broad and its wight is about half a ton. It is made up of geometrical, hexagonal and octagonal panels which have been fixed, one with the help of the other into the frame without rivets. The idea to restore it at Somnath was ultimately given up and the gate was abandoned. Since then, it is stored in a room.\nJahangir's Chain of Justice (C. 1605 A.D.): This is the spot where Mughal king Jahangir instituted his 'chain of justice'(Zanjir-i-Adl) in c. 1605 A.D. He records in his memoir that after his accession, the first order he gave, \"was for the fastening up of the chain of justice so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practice hypocrisy, the aggrieved might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract my attention.\" It was made of pure gold. It was 80' in length and had 60 bells. Its weight was 1 Quintal. One end was fastened to the battlements of the Shah-Burj and the other end to a stone post on the bank of the river. This is not a myth. Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins personally saw it. It has also been depicted in a contemporary painting made in 1620 A.D. This was a way to redress the grievances of the people who could approach the king, the highest judicial authority of the empire, directly, without fee, fear or formality for immediate relief. There was no distinction of caste or creed or between poor and rich. Jahangir's administration of justice 'Adl-i-Jahangir' became a legend in Indian history.\nThe Muthamman Burj (Shah-Burj) & Jharokha (1632 -1640 A.D.): This beautiful palace surmounts the largest bastion of Agra Fort on the riverside, facing the East. It was originally built of red stone by Akbar who used it for jharokha darshan, as well as for sun worship, everyday at sunrise. Jehangir also used it as jharokha, as is faithfully shown in his painting made in 1620. He also instituted his 'Adl-i-Janjir'(the chain of justice) on its south side. Owing to its octagonal plan, it was called 'Muthamman Burj'. It has also been mentioned as 'Shah-Burj'(the imperial or king's tower) by Persian historians and foreign travellers. Its name jasmine tower or 'Samman-Burj' as recorded by the contemporary historian Lahauri is a misnomer. It was rebuilt with white marble by Shah Jehan around 1632-1640 A.D. He also used it for jharokha darshan which was an indispensable a Mughal institution as was 'Durbar'. It is an octagonal building, five external sides of which make a dalan overlooking the river. Each side has pillar and bracket openings, the eastern most side projects forward and accommodates a jharokha majestically. On the western side of this palace is a spacious dalan with Shah-Nasin (alcoves). A shallow water-basin (kunda) is sunk in its pavement. It is profusely inlaid. This dalan opens on a court which has a chabutara projected by a jali screen, on its northern side, a series of rooms leading to Shish Mahal on its western side; and a colonnade (dalan) with a room attached to its on the southern side. It is, thus, a large complex entirely built of white marble. It has deep niches on the walls, to break the monotony. Dados have repetitive stylized creepers inlaid on borders and carved plants on the centre pillars, brackets and lintels also bear exquisitely inlaid designs and it is one of the most ornamented buildings of Shah Jehan. This palace is directly connected to the Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas Mahal, and other palaces. and it was from here that the Mughal emperor governed the whole country. This burj offers full and majestic view of Taj Mahal and Shah Jehan spent eight years (1658-1666 A.D.) of his imprisonment in this complex, and it is said that he died here. His body was taken by boat to the Taj Mahal and buried.\nShish Mahal (A.D. 1631-40): It was built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan as a part of summer palace. Its most distinctive feature is glass mosaic work done on its walls and ceiling. These glass pieces have high mirror quality which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways in semi-dark interior. The glass was imported from Haleb of Syria. Shahjahan built glass palace also at Lahore and Delhi, but this is the finest of all.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Agra Fort won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2004. India Post issued a stamp to commemorate this event.\nThe Agra Fort plays a key role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery The Sign of the Four, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\nThe Agra Fort was featured in the music video for Habibi Da, a hit song of Egyptian pop star Hisham Abbas.\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj came to Agra in 1666 as per the \"Treaty of Purandar (1665)\" entered into with Mirza Raje Jaisingh to meet Aurangzeb in the Diwan-i-Khas. In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. Insulted, he stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nJama Masjid\nFatehpur Sikri\nLahore Fort\nRed Fort\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAgra Fort (1983), Uttar Pradesh \u2013 Archaeological Survey of India\nAgra Fort map (from Murray's travel guide, 1909)\n Geographic data related to Agra Fort at OpenStreetMap",

          "Carpet making, marble inlaying. Watched carpets being made by hand, really interesting .Fantastic marble items to buy. Watched items being made. Quality and at a reasonable cost. Brought a marble table top and had it shipped home. So cheap and arrived in a week on returning",
          "it is a nice idea to spend ur nigh in agra watching the show. the Mohabbat show is nice and at the end u will be able to have a photo with the actress and a mini taj mahal for a fee. the translation is not in rhythm with the acting so this causes annoyance. ther is love in",
          "A very stylised and romantic take on the well known Shah Jehan/ Mumtaz Mahal story. Not true to the history but a good Bollywood take on it with the required song and dance sequences and ham acting. Good fun, don't take it as the definitive story.",
          "Excellent show to get the information about Taj Mahal. It is based on the sad and sweet story of love, & affection. However it is very expensive to watch it. But worth the price. Everyone must visit and watch it once.",
          "This is a \"musical\" about the love between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, that resulted in the Shah having the greatest mausoleum ever built for his wife when she died. The show is in Hindi, but there are ear phones in many languages, so you won't miss out. It's a bit corny - in",
          "Very well written dialogue and great music. Everything from the auditorium to the actors were amazing. They also had audio narration in 13 different languages to make sure everyone could enjoy.",
          "Our show started at 6:45 pm . and there are 3 types of ticket available there : 1- 1250 rupees for normal seats 2- 1000 for upper flor 3- 1500 for rows near to stages (vip) We tried the vip seating. There were a headsets for translating the show to several languages",
          "We went here to see the play about Shah Jahan and Taj Mahal. Being theater fans and volunteering at theaters we were excited to see this professional production on a subject we had recently learned about. Frankly we were pretty disappointed with the whole thing. We thought",
          "We went to Kalakriti given that it is the only big show in Agra but with pretty low expectations. Even those low expectations could not be met. The show seemed to be designed for tourists who have no aesthetic sense at all and are willing to put up for 80 minutes worth of crap",
          "We happened upon the performance of Kalakriti. Don't expect a great broadway show here. It's Bollywood meets high school or less. The music and acting is all pre-recorded. The dancing is real and that definitely has a bollywood-feel and was entertaining. The storyline is okay",
          "Went for the English show and were a disappointed when comparing the promises made in advance with what was delivered, for quite a bit of money. Colourful remake of the story of the Tah Mahal with opulent dresses, but dancers were mostly on the mediocer side. As were the",
          "After visiting the Taj Mahal, one can visit this place and learn how the inlaid marble was produced. Mr. Maqbool will explain the process and one can see how labor intensive the inlaying process of marble is. There are items for sale and it will be shipped to you and well",
          "This 80 minutes play is great to watch. It's got everything - Romance, Dance, Drama, Music & of course the TAJ. Yes the Taj claimed to be made of the same white marble 'Makrana'. The time spent there just flew by and we were left wanting for more. The actors are fabulous & the",
          "depicting the background of taj and shah jahan and mumtaz and all... I really love the dances and costumes and all... but half way through the show, I was so sleepy and and I can't wait for the next change of backdrop or dance or costume to pop up. be surprise i am not the only",
          "The event is organized very professionally. The fees are a bit on the higher side but worth it. The actors, the choreography, the dresses and costumes are all very well done. For new comers, it will give some of the background into the Taj and the events leading up to building",
          "One should see this programme before actually visiting Taj. This programme is a musical drama about the history of Taj. Only one show every day. Hence prior booking must on vacation times. You can choose to listen in a language of your choice.Great show.",
          "The show starts at 6:45PM and most days you can get the tickets easily. The auditorium seats more than 500 people and has the show translated into multiple languages (they give you a pair of headphones with the translated script of the play). Story about how and why Shah Jahan",
          "We had front row seats to the show which was about the building of the Taj Mahal. We had ear phones with an English translation. The show told the story of the building of the Taj Mahal, there were beautiful costumes, song and dance. It is well worth doing prior to your visit",
          "A sweet musical rendition of the the Shah Jahan & Mumtaz Mahal love story. The costumes are lovely, the dancers clearly loved what they were re-enacting. They provide head-sets with the different international languages so one can listen to the audio in your own language as",

          "Very expensive, for Indian standards, musical based on the story of Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Shah Jahan built the Taji Mahal mausoleum for his wife when she died. The musical is in the style of Bollywood; if you like that then the show may be OK. Otherwise is like a",
          "The story of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz is enacted right in front of your eyes. If you have seen the Taj but not this programme you need to visit Agra again to see it. Keep an evening free to see this programme - visit to Taj should have a night halt in Agra.",
          "Uhh, well, he really loved her. Like a lot. A whole lot. And she was real smart. And pretty. No, but seriously. The music and costumes and set were great. The acting a bit over the top but hey, it's an over the top story. A neat thing to do while in Agra and the theater is very",
          "The thing is dubbed... This is a big negative and a good starting point. And badly dubbed. They start moving their mouths with lousy timing and the Hindi audio comes on way before the other languages. The acting is so over the top that you might think they are actually just",
          "We were little confused whether to go for this show or not as we got mixed reviews. We still though to give it a try. The show is quite expensive, but considering the cost involved the show is not upto the level and not recommended. Its waste of money and time.",
          "I reluctantly went to watch this show after a day tour of the taj and the fort, but I am happy that I did. Some much of colour, so many dances and lots of energy. I am sure if you do it you will not regret doing it. Best way to end your day in Agra.",
          "If you got a good sense of humour I strongly recommend you go. It's so bad, it's brilliant. At times I thought it was going to break into a Monty Python sketch\ud83d\ude02.",
          "Exceptionally Over-priced, over rated and not worth spending large sum for a under-performed Drama. Primarily focused to earn money then providing quality service.",
          "Went to this show after visiting The Taj Mahal which made a great end to the day The costumes were fantastic and the scenery editing was very clever. The seating was very comfortable and each had been supplied with headphones for your choice of language. It was an entertaining,",

          "The whole show On Taj-the love is so artistically created that you just enjoy it ... not to speak of the more than a museum and unlimited varieties of handicrafts , marble and clothes ..",
          "Would not really recommend it ! Honestly.Have seen much better cultural shows then this . In Agra, nothing beats the Taj Mahal",
          "If you are in Agra and have some time, you must must watch this show. Well managed and very beautifully scripted.",

          "My first Bollywood show was a little disappointing I expected more. The costumes were wonderful but the actual dancing was not what I expected. They do have audio so you can listen to the translation however I opted to listen to it without the earphones as we had already heard",
          "I do not understand why this show got 4 stars. This was a complete waste of my $30- the show was very amateurish and half my group and I ran away halfway. Pros: \u2022 The only thing I liked about this show was the elaborate and beautiful costumes \u2022 Complimentary bottle of water",
          "This performance is presented for tourists and consists of some lively Bollywood singing and dancing interspersed with a somewhat over-the-top theatrical performance about the origins of the Taj Mahal. This was a blatant tourist trap.",
          "I got the opportunity to see the show. It was like heaven. Stage was so beautiful and all the performances were adorable. Good thing is that although the show is in Hindi, they have audio translators to 12 foreign languages. I would term it resurrection of Theater art in India.",
          "my group was charged $35 for the show in which the acting was so bad it was funny. The only saving grace was the Taj Mahal replica at the end, but we had to sit through an hour of tortuous music to see it. Save your money, or better yet visit Mother Theresa's orphanage and",
          "Seated front row we enjoyed the stories of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz, the lovely costumes and the beautiful decor. Using the headlines for english texts was not easy because the volume of the music on stage was too loud. Anyway, the story was easy enough to follow",
          "This is the convention center organizing local cultural dance and music programs daily.... plays are also bein organized here.... nice place to relax in the evening...",
          "It was nice show, however my expectations were more, probably I was comparing it with Kingdom of Dreams experience.",
          "Every time I go for shopping in Agra, I feel that I am getting ripped off. Now, I have found a place where I feel comfortable taking my clients and friends. Superb collection and service levels. Prices are negotiable...so request for a bargain. Ask for Mr.Vivek . He know",
          "I attended this show with a tour group of 15. We were charged 2,500 rupees which was collected by our guide. He must have skimmed off the top. Interesting to have the variety of translations by headphone but the Hindi from the stage was far too loud to understand anything over",
          "It was a great show. There was too much dance. To make it interesting they could add how Mumtaj married Janagir and more historical contents, Reduce dance part of it.",
          "We visited kalakriti to watch their play on shahjahan and mumtaz's love story and I must say that kalakriti became the highlight of our trip apart from the taj mahal ofcourse. We booked gold class tickets which are front row and give u a chance to dress up as shahjahan or",

          "I just got back from the show with my wife and 2 and half daughter and it was a good experience. The theatre is quite comfortable, the headphones are working well with 10 available languages. The show is as colorful and glowy as any Indian musical with good songs and dances. Now",

          "A must see when visiting Agra . It's nice to see that such shows are being done now in India . Gives a good perspective on why Taj Mahal history . Although the dances are average and some of the acting is over done , still it is worth visiting !!!!",
          "We were 5 adults and one child who were really excited about the show but it turned out to be a disaster .. The music was boring .. Acting was overacting and the dancers were not in sync ... The biggest drawback was that for the changeover in scene they used to give long",
          "Its a very good place for shopping A bit pricey but you get the high quality stuff here. Also to experience local culture at its best",
          "I enjoyed the show and felt it gave a very interesting, theatrical persepective of the Taj Mahal! The acting was a bit over the top but enjoyable. The scale model was amazing! I would recommend attending before visiting the Taj.",
          "We did not like this show... It is not that special and it is far too much touristic... Most of the group got bored... I'm sorry, but I do not recommend it.",
          "When I heard this place and regarding performance ,I thought it would be like other light and sound show.But when I entered the convention center my total view was changed.Me and my other friends enjoyed the show with deep concentration .",
          "Maybe because of off season we were really put off by this place. The entire place seemed to be in darkness because there were no visitors on the handicrafts side. They only put on the fans and lights when we asked them to. On the marble side there was too much marble dust and",
          "This was a live performance - colorful, vibrant, great music and great clothes. They give you headphones with translation in English and that wasn't very good. But overall it was charming and mesmerizing.",
          "I was mesmerized with the amazing craftmanship. We spent an entire day at Kalakriti and I loved the story of The Taj Mahal. Every piece is so beautiful and there is something to please everyone. . I was really impressed by how close you can get to some of these works. Everyone",
          "A very nice environment, where you find high quality products whether it`s marble, carpets, pashmina or cashmere, stones etc. I was there much longer than originally expected - most probably, y`ll experience the same . . .",

          "My review is probably biased because I compared this show with the Kingdom of Dreams show I saw two days before in Delhi and it comes up lacking. My party of four and I kept falling asleep and waiting for it to just end. My earpiece did not work very well at first, but the",
          "A professionally well choreographed dance drama, artistically performed, excellent back stage management with a superb emporium next door. A polite and helpful staff, with some great acoustics makes it a holistic experience. Recommended as a must see while in Agra.",
          "Must see show, before you visit the Taj Mahal. The storey behind the building of the Taj Mahal set to music. 30 \"bollywood\" style dancers on the stage at a time, good effects. Prices based on \"platinum\", \"gold\", ... based on distance from stage. 1,600 RNI for gold. Price",
          "Bollywood style display of the history of the Taj Mahal. Great recommendation of the tour escort Rajeev Butalia.",
          "I like bollywood movies, and this show was like a live movie displayed infront of me. the dancing and decoration will keep your opened without a blink. it's OK if you notice that the actors were exagrating and I really hate the English audio translation but I wish I could listen",

          "WE were given quite a hard see to see this show, however it was really quite good. The only thing was that it sort of cut short our seeing of the Taj Mahal in order to leave to get to see it in time as it started rather early. So beware if you want to see the TM at sunset,",

          "place is beautiful with very good light and sound arrangements costly for indians tickets are 1500 to 2000 per head but show is very good and real replica of taj emerging from the floor is an amazing experience and there is a hot air show next door in the same complex u can see",
          "This is an auditorium where they have performance by artists on history of Taj Mahal. The theatre is very good with nice sound and light arrangements. The programme audio is available in many foreign languages including English. Overall a performance worth remembering.",
          "Its ok for a foreign traveller who has travelled so far. However for an Indian it is just ok. Expensive though, but the end part where real replica of Taj Mahal is shown, is really amazing",
          "The show at night was great, very good actors and beautiful dancers. If you take out the indian dresses it could be an european show. Very well conceived. The english translation (\u00e1udio) had some disturbances. Better if it had no breaks. During the day we were taken to the shops",
          "I visited Agra with my GF, i got the passes from my friend, i went for the show, they have more than 10 Languages options & then the live show starts. It was really really amazing, the speed of changing the seen was very fast. Very nice costumes. The show made me cry when Mumtaz",

          "I was sold a storytelling about the Taj Mahal history with live actors. Let me tell you what I've got: - Almost no history. The 80 minute play will have over 40 minutes of cruise-like dancing in disco-powder covered not-authentic customs. - 10 minutes of showing off their Taj",

          "I found this over sentimental & sickly. It could be so much better. It was nice to go see something whilst at Agra but compared to other shows, missed the mark for me",

          "I will never regret watching this show this month. Perfect treat for your eyes. It's a brief colorful story of love of Shahjahan for his beloved Mumtaj Mahal. Artists are par excellence. Above all, the model of Taj Mahal is superb. Overall, out of this world experience.",
          "We went to the show which depicts the story of Taj Mahal and really enjoyed it. The theatre was specially built and was traditional in style. The show was so colourful with beautiful costumes for the men as well as the women. The finale with the scale model of the Taj Mahal",

          "We loved this show, but it is seriously melodramatic in the best Indian traditions. I think it is worthwhile to get an insight into how Indians describe events in their history, and how they stage a show, as much as the show itself. Be aware! Our show started 7 minutes early!",

It is maintained by Jagadguru Kripalu Parishat, an international non-profit, educational, spiritual, charitable trust.\nThe complex is on a 55-acre site on the outskirts of Vrindavan, and is dedicated to Lord Radha Krishna and Sita Ram, Radha Krishna on the first level and Sita Ram on the second level.\nThe temple structure was established by the fifth Jagadguru, Kripalu Maharaj. Figures of Shri Krishna and his followers depicting important events surrounding the Lord's existence cover the main temple..\nConstruction began in January 2001 and the inauguration ceremony took place from 15 February to 17 February 2012. The temple was opened to public on 17 February. The cost was 150 crore rupees ($23 million). The presiding deity are Shri Radha Govind (Radha Krishna) and Shri Sita Ram. A 73,000 square feet, pillar-less, dome shaped satsang hall is being constructed next to Prem Mandir, which will accommodate 25,000 people at a time. Surrounded by beautiful gardens and fountains, the temple complex has life-size depictions of four leelas of Shri Krishna \u2013 Jhulan leela, Govardhan leela, Raas leela and Kaliya Naag leela.\nIt is sister temple of Bhakti Mandir which was opened in 2005 and another sister temple which is known as Kirti Mandir, Barsana opened in 2019.\n\n\n== History architecture and design ==\n\nThe foundation stone was laid by Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj in the presence of thousand devotees on 14 January 2001. It took approximately 1000 artists about 12 years to build the complex.\nThe Vrindavan site was developed by Kripalu Ji Maharaj, whose main ashram was at Vrindavan. He dedicated the gift of love to Shri Vrindavan Dham.\nPrem Mandir is constructed entirely of Italian marble. The total dimensions of the temple including its flag is 125 ft. high, 190 ft. long and the 128 ft. wide raised platform serves as the seat of the two-storeyed white monument.\nA circumambulation route has been constructed on the mandir prangan, the platform of the temple, enabling visitors to view the 48 panels depicting the pastimes of Shri Radha Krishna which are carved on the outer walls of the temple. The walls are made of solid Italian marble, 3.25 ft. thick. The thickness of the walls of the garbha-griha is 8 ft to bear the weight of huge shikhar, swarna Kalash and the Flag. 84 panels have also been set up on the exterior of the temple and display the loving pastimes of Shri Krishna. Other than this, numerous portraits of Krishna Leela, or the miracles of Lord Krishna, can also be found inside the temple. \n\n\n== Events ==\nJagadguruttam Diwas Mahotsav\nJanmashtami\nRadhastami\n\n\n== See also ==\nVrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir\nBanke Bihari Temple\nRadha Raman Temple\nKrishna Balaram Mandir\nBhakti Mandir\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPrem Mandir",

        "wiki": "Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.\nIt had been used by the early mughal rulers. The Fort stands on an ancient site and was traditionally known as Badalgarh. It was captured by Ghaznavi for some time but in the 15th century A.D. the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487\u20131517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556\u20131605).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli (step well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri's general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.\n\nRealising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, Abul Fazl, recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in Rajasthan. Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.It was only during the reign of Akbar's grandson, Shah Jahan, that the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the beautiful Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from white marble. He destroyed some of the earlier buildings inside the fort to make his own.The fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 Years. In the fort, they built the Ratan Singh ki haveli. The fort was invaded and captured by the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century. Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at Third Battle of Panipat by Ahmad Shah Abdali in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next decade. Finally Mahadji Shinde took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, in 1803.The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857, which caused the end of the British East India Company's rule in India, and led to a century of direct rule of India by Britain.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe 380,000 m2 (94-acre) fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river Yamuna and its walls are seventy feet high. Double ramparts have massive circular bastions at intervals, with battlements, embrasures, machicolations and string courses. Four gates were provided on its four sides, one Khizri gate opening on to the river.Two of the fort's gates are notable: the \"Delhi Gate\" and the \"Lahore Gate.\" The Lahore Gate is also popularly also known as the \"Amar Singh Gate,\" for Amar Singh Rathore.The monumental Delhi Gate, which faces the city on the western side of the fort, is considered the grandest of the four gates and a masterpiece of Akbar's time. It was built circa 1568 both to enhance security and as the king's formal gate, and includes features related to both. It is embellished with intricate inlay work in white marble. A wooden drawbridge was used to cross the moat and reach the gate from the mainland; inside, an inner gateway called Hathi Pol (\"Elephant Gate\") \u2013 guarded by two life-sized stone elephants with their riders \u2013 added another layer of security. The drawbridge, slight ascent, and 90-degree turn between the outer and inner gates make the entrance impregnable. During a siege, attackers would employ elephants to crush a fort's gates. Without a level, straight run-up to gather speed, however, that thing is prevented by this layout.Because the Indian military (the Parachute Brigade in particular) is still using the northern portion of the Agra Fort, the Delhi Gate cannot be used by the public. Tourists enter via the Amar Singh Gate.The site is very important in terms of architectural history. Abul Fazal recorded that five hundred buildings in the beautiful designs of Bengal and Gujarat were built in the fort. Some of them were demolished by Shah Jahan to make way for his white marble palaces. Most of the others were destroyed by the British troops of East India Company between 1803 and 1862 for raising barracks. Hardly thirty Mughal buildings have survived on the south-eastern side, facing the river, such as the Delhi Gate and Akbar Gate and one palace \u2013 \"Bengali Mahal\".\nAkbar Darwazza (Akbar Gate) was renamed Amar Singh Gate by Shah Jahan.  The gate is similar in design to the Delhi Gate. Both are built of red sandstone.The Bengali Mahal is built of red sandstone and is now split into Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal.\n\n\n== Other Historic sites inside Agra Fort ==\nJahangir's Hauz (tank) A.D. 1610: This monolithic tank (hauz) was used for bathing. It is 5 feet high, 8 feet in diameter and 25 feet in circumference. On the external side of the rim there is an inscription in Persian which mentions it as 'Hauz-e-Jahangir'. It was first discovered near the courtyard of Akbar's palace. In A.D. 1843 and later it was placed in front of Diwan-e-Am. In 1862, it was shifted to public garden (Company Bagh) where it suffered much damage. Later, Sir John Marshall brought it back to Agra Fort and placed there. Due to this hauz, the palace became famous as Jahangiri Mahal though it is part of Akbar's Bengali mahal.\nShahjahani Mahal (1628-35 A.D.): It is situated in between the white marble Khas Mahal and the red stone Jahangiri Mahal and is set transitionally in between these two residential complexes of two different ages. It is the earliest attempt of the Mughal emperor Shahjahan to convert an existing red stone building in accordance with his taste and it was his earliest palace in Agra Fort. It has a large hall, side rooms and an octagonal tower on the riverside. The skeletal construction of brick and red stone was all redone with a thick white stucco plaster and colourfully painted in floral designs. The whole palace once glistened white like white marble. On the face towards the Khas Mahal, is a large spacious white marble dalan, composed of five arches, supported on double pillars and protected externally by a chhajja. Its closed western bay houses, the Ghaznin gate, Babur's baoli and a well are situated beneath it.\nGhaznin Gate (1030 A.D.): The gate originally belonged to the tomb of Mahmud Ghaznavi at Ghazni. It was brought from there by the British in1842. Lord Ellenborough, the Governor General, in historic proclamation claimed, that these were the sandalwood gates of Somnath which Mahmud had taken to Ghazni in 1025, and the British had thus avenged an insult of 800 years back. This false claim was made just to win the goodwill of the Indian people. The gate is, in fact, made of local deodar wood of Ghazni and not of sandalwood. The style of decoration bears no resemblance to ancient Gujrati woodwork. There is also an Arabic inscription carved on the upper part. It mentions Mahmud with his epithets. Sir John Marshall had placed here a notice-board which described the whole episode about this gate. It is 16.5 feet high and 13.5 feet broad and its wight is about half a ton. It is made up of geometrical, hexagonal and octagonal panels which have been fixed, one with the help of the other into the frame without rivets. The idea to restore it at Somnath was ultimately given up and the gate was abandoned. Since then, it is stored in a room.\nJahangir's Chain of Justice (C. 1605 A.D.): This is the spot where Mughal king Jahangir instituted his 'chain of justice'(Zanjir-i-Adl) in c. 1605 A.D. He records in his memoir that after his accession, the first order he gave, \"was for the fastening up of the chain of justice so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practice hypocrisy, the aggrieved might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract my attention.\" It was made of pure gold. It was 80' in length and had 60 bells. Its weight was 1 Quintal. One end was fastened to the battlements of the Shah-Burj and the other end to a stone post on the bank of the river. This is not a myth. Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins personally saw it. It has also been depicted in a contemporary painting made in 1620 A.D. This was a way to redress the grievances of the people who could approach the king, the highest judicial authority of the empire, directly, without fee, fear or formality for immediate relief. There was no distinction of caste or creed or between poor and rich. Jahangir's administration of justice 'Adl-i-Jahangir' became a legend in Indian history.\nThe Muthamman Burj (Shah-Burj) & Jharokha (1632 -1640 A.D.): This beautiful palace surmounts the largest bastion of Agra Fort on the riverside, facing the East. It was originally built of red stone by Akbar who used it for jharokha darshan, as well as for sun worship, everyday at sunrise. Jehangir also used it as jharokha, as is faithfully shown in his painting made in 1620. He also instituted his 'Adl-i-Janjir'(the chain of justice) on its south side. Owing to its octagonal plan, it was called 'Muthamman Burj'. It has also been mentioned as 'Shah-Burj'(the imperial or king's tower) by Persian historians and foreign travellers. Its name jasmine tower or 'Samman-Burj' as recorded by the contemporary historian Lahauri is a misnomer. It was rebuilt with white marble by Shah Jehan around 1632-1640 A.D. He also used it for jharokha darshan which was an indispensable a Mughal institution as was 'Durbar'. It is an octagonal building, five external sides of which make a dalan overlooking the river. Each side has pillar and bracket openings, the eastern most side projects forward and accommodates a jharokha majestically. On the western side of this palace is a spacious dalan with Shah-Nasin (alcoves). A shallow water-basin (kunda) is sunk in its pavement. It is profusely inlaid. This dalan opens on a court which has a chabutara projected by a jali screen, on its northern side, a series of rooms leading to Shish Mahal on its western side; and a colonnade (dalan) with a room attached to its on the southern side. It is, thus, a large complex entirely built of white marble. It has deep niches on the walls, to break the monotony. Dados have repetitive stylized creepers inlaid on borders and carved plants on the centre pillars, brackets and lintels also bear exquisitely inlaid designs and it is one of the most ornamented buildings of Shah Jehan. This palace is directly connected to the Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas Mahal, and other palaces. and it was from here that the Mughal emperor governed the whole country. This burj offers full and majestic view of Taj Mahal and Shah Jehan spent eight years (1658-1666 A.D.) of his imprisonment in this complex, and it is said that he died here. His body was taken by boat to the Taj Mahal and buried.\nShish Mahal (A.D. 1631-40): It was built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan as a part of summer palace. Its most distinctive feature is glass mosaic work done on its walls and ceiling. These glass pieces have high mirror quality which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways in semi-dark interior. The glass was imported from Haleb of Syria. Shahjahan built glass palace also at Lahore and Delhi, but this is the finest of all.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Agra Fort won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2004. India Post issued a stamp to commemorate this event.\nThe Agra Fort plays a key role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery The Sign of the Four, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\nThe Agra Fort was featured in the music video for Habibi Da, a hit song of Egyptian pop star Hisham Abbas.\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj came to Agra in 1666 as per the \"Treaty of Purandar (1665)\" entered into with Mirza Raje Jaisingh to meet Aurangzeb in the Diwan-i-Khas. In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. Insulted, he stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nJama Masjid\nFatehpur Sikri\nLahore Fort\nRed Fort\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAgra Fort (1983), Uttar Pradesh \u2013 Archaeological Survey of India\nAgra Fort map (from Murray's travel guide, 1909)\n Geographic data related to Agra Fort at OpenStreetMap",

          "This fort is well worth a visit, ideally with a guide who can help bring the history alive. And it's a fascinating history. It's a large complex but only a relatively small percentage is open to the public. There are some great photo ops. The red sandstone is lovely.",

          "We had already visited a number of forts on our tour by the time we got to this one, but the sheer scale and workmanship on display is different and impressive in every single one, so don\u2019t get into the way of thinking \u2018oh, no, another Indian fort\u2019. Go and admire the work of men",

          "Besides the Taj Mahal this is a MUST SEE in Agra. The sheer size and layout for a 400 yr old building makes today's architects look amateurish !!!! That it is a functioning building used by the army explains a lot about it's design. Please allow at least 2-3 hours to appreciate",
          "A wonderful surprise since all the focus (at least ours) was on the main attraction that is the Taj Mahal. Crowdy, but you still enjoy the beauty of the site and the history present everywhere...if only those walls could tell their stories. A must see.",
          "This place is so much more than a fort. It was also a palace. It is spectacular. There are also some great views from there. It will take at least an hour and a half to see it, but it is really worth it. For any of the forts in India, it is a good idea to have a good pair",
          "This is the home of the Shah Jahan, who built the Taj Mahal for his wife. It\u2019s right across from the Taj Mahal so he could see it. A beautiful fort in its own right. Partially (80%) closed off as it\u2019s still in use by the Indian Army but what you see is really amazing! We enjoyed",
          "After you buy the tickets, you\u2019ll have to form in separate lines for men and women. The lines were up to 40 people long, (ladies\u2019 was shorter) but took less than 5 minutes. Security checks are superficial, but no snacks are allowed. I saw people discarding bags of potato chips.",
          "A must go place if you are traveling to Agra... A guided tour is recommended for the fort because there are so many things to know and from the fort you can experience the view of Taj Mahal on the bank of River Yamuna.",
          "Take a guide as you will learn a lot more about the fort and history of the tai. The excursion with guide is about 75 minutes. A really good excursion.",
          "The fort is located at a major crossing just like the Red Fort in New Delhi and is therefore extremely congested. There was a long queue in the ticket counter, which was obvious too as the entire Taj Mahal crowd was queuing up at Agra fort since the later was closed. I finally",
          "But all the same, the guide explained all the detail and brought the place to life. Amazing views across to the Taj Mahal on the terrace and well worth visiting no matter how many forts you had seen already.",
          "This was the first fort I visited in India, and at the time I thought it was good. However, after later visiting Jaipur's Amber fort and Jodhpur's Mehrangarh fort, I realised how this pales in comparison. The part open to visitors is smaller than those, it's a less impressive",
          "We spent a couple of hours wandering around this first, and really enjoyed ourselves. We skipped the offer of being guided and really enjoyed finding our way about and learning (via the lonely planet walking tour) about the fort. It is very well managed, and the site is",
          "I did the once in a life time tour of Taj Mahal, with Subash. I wanted it to be special and he delivered on all grounds . No queuing, vip status , and the best pictures , to preserve my memory. Rajesh my chauffeur is the best ! Made me feel like royalty. Highly recommend this ,",
          "Actually this was the king\u2019s Shah Jahan and wife Mumtaz, palace .This is the king that built the Taj Mahal for memory of his wife in the 17 century. Very nice palace , only 20% open to the public . Great view of Taj Mahal from distance. Take 1 hour to explore. Entrance 8 USDLRS.",
          "The history behind the fort and that view is enough to make anyone\u2019s heart ache. Go here before the Taj Mahal for the first glimpse. It\u2019s worth it!",
          "We found this beautiful fort very interesting, we would recommend having a guide or reading up on the history beforehand.",
          "After the Taj Mahal, the Agra Red Fort is the second big attraction in this dusty city. My driver Sharma arranged a local guide for me, who also led me through the Taj. Also thanks to Israr Ahmad who knows many details that would not have been noticed, it was a worthy visit. The",
          "By itself, it might not reach the level of a \"must see\", but if you are looking to fill out the day, going to the fort after the Taj is a nice option.",
          "Worth a visit. Interesting place. Beautiful building. The views are spectacular. A guide would be useful in order to fully appreciate the history of it. Our friend lost her phone in it and went to speak to security and they had it. She had left it in the cafe and it had been",
          "Visited, enjoyed and liked it. It is moghul palace w/ mansions located on big garden walled by a fort. It is characteristic by red stoned used, marble and stone carving craftsmanship.",
          "You guessed it, another Unesco world heritage site. It is a beautiful red sand stone structure. On a good clear day you can see the Taj mahal which is at a distance of a couple of miles. Our chirpy guide let us know that the Emperor Shah Jahan who built the Taj Mahal was locked",
          "Not very nicely kept. Could have been more cleaner. Wish they restored it adequately. Its beautiful but losing it's charm.",
          "Visited this afort the day after the one in Delhi. Nice if you have not been to one before, very similar to Delhi. But remarcable in its construction and being preserved all this time is a challenge. It's well laid out and signposted accordingly. Just beware of the monkeys they",
          "Although only part is open to the public it is worth a visit. Get the guide to show you the trick view of the Taj Mahal through the lattice window.",
          "this fort is a classic example of moghul architecture, it is built by indian and moghul styles. it need some more care and govt of India and ASI should also take more care",
          "It's one of the best place to visit in Agra it's more interested to see the sunset from the Fort you gave beautiful view of Taj Mahal!",
          "This is a delight! The history alone is enough to blow your mind. Built initially by the grandfather of Emperor Shah Jahan who built the Taj Mahal, renovated big time by the emperor who was later imprisoned for years in it by a 3rd son, in a room facing the Taj Mahal. It is",
          "Second best attraction in Agra. We manage to get a really cheap tour inside so don\u2019t grab one at the entrance as they will try to rip you off. A lot to learn and see in this place... we really enjoyed our visit.",
          "Agra Fort was amazing. It contains an area of 9; acres. It is a walled city. From here we could see Taj Mahal. It is a historical fort in the city of Agra, India. It was the residence of emperors of the Mughal dynasty until 1683 when the capital moved from Agra to Delhi. Our",

          "This palace--still a working army fort--is a must-see on any trip to Agra. About 25% of the fort is open to the public, but it's a fascinating display of two different eras of Mughal architecture. There is the red sandstone palace, and the newer, white marble palace. All of",
          "This fort is quite beautiful and in amazing shape. The stonework is stunning. The fort is large and accommodated many uses. I recommend visiting the fort with a local guide.",
          "Agra Fort was built in the year 1573 under the reign of Akbar \u2013 one of the greatest Mughal Emperors. It took more than 4000 workers and eight years of hardship to complete the fort. Knowing the significance of its location, Akbar built the fort to make it the main residence of",
          "Fort is big and beautiful and gives glimpse of life style of mughal emperors. About 25% of the whole area is open for public while rest is still used by Army. View of Taj Mahal from Agar Fort is also very beautiful.",
          "This was booked via our agents with a tour guide, giving us an in-depth history of the family and fort. Excellent \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
          "A very large fort in Agra. The fort is huge, but much of it is not open to the public. It is a great place and takes 2-3 hours to see it all. Very difficult to find everywhere without a guide, but we prefer to do things ourselves. Worth a visit, if very crowded with tourists.",
          "Gives a good long distance view of the Taj as well, the locals keep the maintenance up to a great standard, magnificent architecture and a step back in history.",
          "Really nice place and highly recommended. This is where the king who built the Taj Mahal lived, for part of the year. The taj cost so much money and he wanted to build a black taj across the water and his son locked him up here after taking his throne. He lived in prison for 8",
          "Positives: Beautiful architecture mainly built with red sandstone. Later additions included buildings built with marble. Lovely views across the river towards the Taj Mahal. Negatives: Only 20% open to the public. Verdict: Well worth a visit. Recommended.",
          "this agra fort is quite big in size.when you enter.again,security check first.inside in my opinion has not much to see.at one corner you can see taj mahal from a distance,quite nice.the rest has nothing impress to me.if you have too much free time, go there.nothing to miss",
          "This is the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. It was built by the great Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1565. It a complex with notable buildings such as halls of public audience and private audience. The",
          "A small part is open to public and not worth the visit in my opinion. As there is not much to do around Taj Mahal it still is an option.",
          "I've been there the day after visiting the Taj to complete the history learning in site. Very recommendable to understand all the history. Hate the British devastation did here, but usual from the pirates of the world. I've made the tour with an excellent local guide from Taj",
          "good services are given by them plz try it its amazing and fabulous , i recommend for you its amazing",
          "This is also one of the nice place after Taj mahal to visit. Old and historical fort. Many tourist came here after visiting Taj mahal.",
          "Agra fort .it's beautiful place to know about history of Mughals . tickets is very reasonable for Indians 50 rs only . 16 points in Agra fort to see .",
          "The bulk of the Fort is occupied by the army but the 10% plus that you can visit is plenty. The fortifications from the moat to the double wall and so on makes it formidable. The accommodations of the Ruling family along with the fascinating history are splendid even if some",
          "I came to Agra Fort late on November afternoon and overall I was impressed with the architecture. The fort did not have good signposting within it to show the direction of travel and as a westerners we did receive lots of attention from domestic tourists, some of it unpleasant.",
          "Wonderful heritage and architectural marvelous but indian govt not taking care of it. Entrance is a mess, lot of beggars and uncontrollable crowd! If only they maintain well ....",
          "HIghly recommend you see this fort before you see the Taj Mahal. Definitely have a guide--either one you get at the fort or one you pay ahead of time. If you arrange for one earlier, then they are able to assist with getting your tickets and showing you where you need to be to",
          "Impressive fort in its own right overlooking the Taj Mahal - needs to be visited to see the architecture and work that went into building it - stunning!",
          "I absolutely loved Agra Fort. I would even go as far as too say its better than the Taj Mahal. There is a lot more to see here and it feels like it has more history to it. Bonus, you get good views of the Taj Mahal from here. Plus, it doesn't seem as busy.",
          "Go with a guide if possible..they bring it to life. Much history to be gained. Fascinating building.",
          "Myself, my wife and my elder brother visited this well preserved monument and there is so much to see and know about this fort. It is well worth visiting this place at any cost.",
          "Very significant historical site with amazing fortifications and a wonderful set of royal palaces. There are actually two. The old one was remodeled by Shah Jagan before he built the magnificent white marble structures. Some were not open but sufficient were and the crowds",
          "The overall trip was excellent, a little costly for the amount of time and places visited. Agra Fort visit had to be adjusted and we had to skip lunch. The guide who was very good took us to an art shop which was not needed and we wasted time there. Otherwise, the views of Taj",
          "The first standout on Agra Fort is that it is large and beautiful. Between the contrast of the white marble and the red sandstone it is an imposing building. Once you get through the fortification it opens up into vast courtyards and palaces that are splendid to observe. Bring",
          "This place is truly stunning! The history and the architecture is truly breathtaking and the details are incredible.",
          "Excellent architecture. Easy access from railway station. Tickets can be purchased online in advance. Ample parking.",
          "We went early in the morning, as it was still too foggy to go see Taj at sunrise. This is a massive structure and although not as iconic as the Taj, still worth a visit. Watch out for the monkeys. One almost got my cell phone. Good views of the Taj from the fort (if not",
          "We visited with my family(Wife and 2 kids) on Christmas 2019 and it was excellent to be honest and lived up to expectations. Mughal architecture surely needs to be appreciated and agra fort is well maintained. However agra town as such is not clean and needs improvement . Even",
          "Very interesting fort. Sadly half of it is inaccessible due to it being used by the military. Still worth a visit.",
          "I visit agra fort in, December it's amazing and very beautiful. It's very good historical place for visit. This was very enjoyable visit. We hire a guide who explained what we are seeing.",
          "If you are here, you should probably go to the fort. Interesting history and architecture. A little more peaceful than the other Agra site!",
          "This is an architecturally beautiful structure - like a walled city. From the lovely gardens through the ramparts & gates you will see beautiful artistically designed walls and inlays and cutouts. This was a very enjoyable visit - we did have a guide who explained what we were",
          "The trip to the fort was a journey down the history of India. Every pillar had a story to tell. You can even see the Taj Mahal from it on a clear day.",
          "The planning and architecture of the fort is awesome. It is must visit spot, if you are visiting Agra.",
          "A nice location to see Taj Mahal. 550inr with Taj Mahal ticket. Easy to find location. Good place for pictures.",
          "Well positioned between Taj and Jaipur. Beautiful. We had a guide and that made a lot of difference.",
          "I wouldn't go here for this site alone. Get it in a package with The Taj Mahal. Call ahead to see if it's open as it closes somewhat early.",
          "This fort is very impressive and worth a visit. I have visited both Red Fort in Delhi and Agra Fort I would recommend Agra fort over Red Fort Delhi both inside and out are impressive and much better than Delhi Red Fort this can be seen from outside and the inside is not so good.",
          "Spent a couple of hours been shown around the fort by our guide Sakhander. Very interesting and very beautiful place and considering you only get to see 20% of it as the Indian army occupy the rest, quite large. Barter hard with your guide, never accept their first price.",
          "More impressive than we had imagined. After seeing the Taj Mahal the day before, we hadn't expected to be as impressed with the Fort as we were. Well worth a visit",
          "The fort has its own history and link to the Taj and we found having a guide extremely valuable for this experience. The fort is an impressive structure and a formidable defensive position.Despite it still being a working military base and therefore restricting access to the",
          "We only went to Agra for the Taj so we weren't expecting much but we had a good guide at the Agra Fort that shed a new light on the love story behind the Taj and a little into the Moghul dynasty. People have ruined it as they have scratched all over the walls.",
          "The Agra fort is an impressive representation of Mughal architecture showcasing beautiful marble inlay work. It has massive ramparts and like most forts it is surrounded by a moat which is now dry. One can view the Taj Mahal from the fort at a distance. You can only see 25%",
          "From outside it seems to be a normal fort just like many others in India. Inside the palace is grand and unique in many aspects. Special palaces for the King- the khas mahal, queen Jodhabai palace, the palace of daughters Jahanara and Roshanara, the place where ShahJahan was",
          "Looking from outside it's just a typical fort with massive walls but the red sandstone makes it striking. Inside is quite impressive with its incredible maze of walled courtyards, mosques and lavish private chambers reflecting the grandeur of the Mughal Empire. Peaking through",
          "Agra Fort continues to be one of the best monuments reflecting the true glory of the Mughal empire. The Fort is under conservation and looks more beautiful now. The over all experience would be better if they sold a little Map of the area which guided the tourists from one room",
          "This fort was Capital of Mughal empire for quite some time. Later capital was shifted to Red Fort in Delhi. I wonder if capital would not have been shifted, then Agra would have been Capital of India....Strange thoughts...75% fort is an army base and rest is available for sight",
          "Its a must visit place. What this fort looks even today makes you only wonder as to how this fort would have looked in its full glory. It makes you marvel at the brilliant architect and engineering.",
          "Rajasthan is all about forts and this was the least interesting one in my trip (Agra is actually in Uttar Pradesh, east of Rajasthan). In my opinion, Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur has more beautiful interior and stunning features, Chittor Fort is huge and high, offering great views",
          "This is another stunning piece of architecture. It is a shame that not much of it can be explored. Would love to go in the rooms and see more of the beauty inside this fort.",
          "Interesting visit. Grand design. Despite the haze/fog/smog we saw the Taj in the distance. Magic. Worth the visit! Unesco World Heritage site.",
          "Agra Fort was the first stop on our tour and an excellent beginning to our trip of a lifetime. The rain had come a few days before our visit so the smog had all but gone and it was from here we got our first glimpse of the landscape and the Taj Mahal. The fort is another must .",
          "We have spent 2 weeks in India with a tour group. We have seen a lot of forts and palaces - Agra Fort is one of them. To be honest, it is not that special compared to the others. Only a small portion of the fort is opened for the tourist. You really don't see much. You can",
          "Agra Fort definitely worth visiting! Really well maintained and interesting to wander around. It exceeded our expectations. We did not use a guide but I imagine this would be worthwhile.",
          "The fort is epic and shows the history and beauty of Indian architecture on a scale and size that leaves one in awe. The fort is busy but well maintained. I can only imagine what it was like to be a mogul back in the 15th century. We had a fantastic guide that knew the history",
          "Better than expected. Considering that you can visit only about 20% of it, it is huge. Plan enough time for the visit: minimum 2 hours",
          "A pleasant surprise. Definitely hire a guide to make this tour worthwhile. Very impressive architecture and deceptively large palace. A must, to put on your sightseeing list!",
          "Definitely worth a look. Much bettert then Taj Mahal! Can see most articles. Child friendly and good for a walk around the building.",
          "Agra Fort gives you a nice glimpse into life of Mughal Kings & their way of living. The Meena Bazar, Deewan-a-aam or Deewan-a-khas inside it, help you understand how the life was around 400 years ago. Take help of a guide available there, so that you can understand the history",
          "Spent the morning at the Agra Fort and was amazed at the history and beauty of the structure. The structure is well preserved, allowing you to walk around and explore. It was interesting to explore the area where Shah Jahan was kept prisoner by his son. Such a beautiful white",
          "Beautiful and marvellous architecture, it is situated near to the Taj Mahal.Public communication is available to reach this place.It is a place of historical importance. History lovers will love this place. Better to take a guide to know details",
          "This is an enormous Mughal fort. Currently, only 20% is available to be toured, the rest is used by the Indian Army. The fort has a few different architectural styles and some really interesting stories. Make sure you have a guide. Most tourists visit the Taj Mahal in the",
          "Seems to be the only other old building that walking near the edge of isn't taking your life in your hands as they are crumbling away. Taj M is the other. Great gardens and fascinating stories of times past.",
          "I visited Agra with my friends in June this year. I visited there all historic places. I liked the Red Fort very much. It is relatively less crowded city than Delhi. There are many nearby places to visit. Bus & Train Connectivity is very good for all places in India. Flight are",
          "Only ~ 20% is for tourists, 80% for the Indian Army, you will not see to much. You can have a look from outside. Almost all forts in India are mainly for soldiers, but offered as tourist place - not nice.",
          "There is nothing better than walking in the laps of glorious history that tells so many tales to enchant and mesmerize you. The fort was built in 16 century by Mughal Emperors Akbar and they kept it their capital till mid 17th century before moving to Delhi. It can be called as",
          "Had visited the Agra for Tajmahal and need to visit Agra fort to spend remaining time after Tajmahal visit. it is just a normal fort where king/queen leave.",
          "We have been travelling around North India for a month and have seen a few Forts. My expectations for the Agra Fort were high. Unfortunately there are a lot of areas closed off for repairs which meant that there wasn\u2019t many places to explore like at other Forts. This is still a",
          "We visited this fort on an afternoon, after travelling from Delhi to Agra. Our tour company arranged a tour guide for us, and he was with us during our Agra days. I recommend you come with someone and make these arrangements ahead of time, as it could be overwhelming to be",
          "Great fort although I'd say 75% of the fort is inaccessible which is a bit of a let down but still good for visiting and taking photos. On a hazy day you can't see the Taj though!",
          "We visited Agra from Jaipur. It is roughly 220km by road. Visited Agra fort. It\u2019s mesmerising!! Beautiful red stone structure with Mughal and Persian architecture. Information about different parts within the fort is missing. It would be advisable to read about the fort before",
          "Not a dominating hilltop fort like say Jodhpur or Gwalior but a significant presence nonetheless. A substantial entrance leads into the first court-yard, from there you continue to a number of other buildings, internal courtyards and gardens to explore. One of the most",
          "This is good to do after the Taj Mahal. Again, I would advise booking a guide in advance to explain the fort and who built/lived there.",
          "Well, you simply have to look from the Balcony to the Taj, just like the king did all the time. In itself a splendid piece of architecture, if well explained it gives good insight into the history of the time and the colonial time. mot far away from the Taj, so can be easily",
          "Enough remains of this walled city to connect you to the early mogul Emperors. It is hard to imagine it in its hayday when it was a working palace complex Well worth the visit",
          "Agra was the capital of the Mughal dynasty for years. There are many grand mansions, palaces and courtrooms in the fortification. I found this Diwan-E-Aam or the Court for the Commons, notable for its plainness and balance. The distant view of Taj from one of the galleries",
          "Nice place to visit but due to so large area you have at least half day free for the whole area visit ...nice ..",
          "Beautiful red sandstone fort - terrific stonework and carvings. Take a guide who will tell you the stories associated with this fort and especially the imprisonment of Shah Jahan (the builder of the Taj Mahal) by his son in a tower overlooking the mausoleum for his wife. A",
          "Was One addition to Agra visit ... Place was good to knowledge ooit of view and can be visited when at Taj Mahal for its historic value...",
          "The Red Fortress of Agra is a must see historical masterpiece. Built on the other side of the river from the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum for his favourite wife, who also bore him 13 children, and died in childbirth, from his wing of the fortress,",
          "While visiting the Mehtabh Bagh had to cross over to the other side where the Agra Fort was situated. The Fort has a great profile:It looks magnificent from outside. Good to study about it or take a guide to delve deeper in the past. See the Taj from this angle too.",
          "I visited this place with a guide. I would recommend using one otherwise you will see the building and surrounds but miss out on some pretty good information that makes it more worthwhile. You can see the Taj Mahal from within through the windows. Unfortunately my day was very",
          "Although in the shadow of other forts and the Taj Mahal this fort is worth doing. There are excellent view points to see the Taj Mahal and some excellent sites in the fort.",
          "This is a lovely building to visit and the history really does give you a greater insight in to the Taj Mahal visit and the reasoning behind the build. Fascinating history of family.",
          "This is the place the emperor Shah Jahan who commissioned the Taj Mahal was imprisoned. Not as big or impressive as some similar places visited on our tour, but still an interesting place. Worth a visit",
          "The fort was really lovely and had so many interesting buildings and palaces to see. It just kept going on and on with each one a little different than the next. The views out over the river with the Taj Mahal in the background were great too.",
          "If you start your trip to India in Delhi you will already be familiar with Akbar by the time you get to Agra but leaving aside the truly stunning architecture what is before you is a fascinating insight into the courtly life of an emperor and his family and courtiers. Learn",
          "Agra fort is great in architecture and it's history. There are many buildings. They are luxurious inside and certainly look glorious in historic time. We can see Taj mahal from here.",
          "Amazing marvel and amazing building with great view of Taj Mahal. A must see for everyone. Well maintained with great effort by the staff to keep it near and clean",
          "There is so much history here that I didn't know about prior to my tour, and I am very glad this was included as one of our tour stops. There is limited access as some of the Fort is still active with military personnel. The architecture is fantastic, as I've found with many",
          "Do not confuse with the Red Fort at Dehli! The hard red sandstone is the only thing in common. This is a monument to the 16th century and architectural features abound. Look at the white marble parts inside and marvel at the amazing craftmanship.",
          "Only the red part is open, because the marble area is where the Indian army settles. This is the old palace of the Mughal Dynasty. You can find where the king judged people and international businessmen\u2019s cases. The gate of the performance hall shows symbols of multiple",
          "Outstanding Mughal architecture both inside and outside. We had a good guide who was very knowledgeable and made our visit extremely interesting. The gardens are beautifully laid out.",
          "Fun place to explore. After out guide showed us the Taj we took a Rikshaw to the Fort. The Fort was amazing. History of the fort was interesting. Another must see.",
          "Just another amazing place to visit. You could spend hours wondering around. It is so big you can get lost! A lot of history too. It's the following of the Taj Mahal. To many people trying to sell you anything - to many guides too (inside&outside). It's overwhelming and",
          "We booked a ticket later in the afternoon when it was cooling down, great decision as it was cooler and we saw the fort at sunset and lit up at night. Fantastic fort but not a quick visit as so vast. Amazing place as incredible architecture and gardens.",
          "Absolutely Amazing! Went in November so the weather was perfect. Can even see the Taj Mahal from the fort.",
          "Beautiful place, we had the best guide who was so knowledgeable & friendly - I would suggest a guided tour for any would be visitor.",
          "May not look as good outside as some other forts but inside it\u2019s beautiful. Really worth a visit and you have great views of the Taj Mahal too!",
          "Another fantastic place to visit - so rich in history and craftsmanship. Our guide was great and we enjoyed out visit",
          "A massive red sandstone fort standing high above the town. Inside a number of beautiful palace buildings lived in by the ruling family and their entourage. A large and attractive site - a little crowded in places. Beware of touts at entrance.",
          "The fort is a large palace complex, on its territory you will be met not only by the spirits of history, but also completely living chipmunks. Do not forget to take a treat for them!",
          "This wonderful red-stone fort is really a huge castle with a history that goes back over the ages. A guide is a must as the history and architecture is interesting and needs to be explained. It is incredibly impressive.",
          "A very interesting place our guide was very good with lots of information - not that I remember it all there was so much to take in.",
          "I came again to Agra Fort and believe me, in the second time also I could not see the entire Agra Fort. it is too big. It's giant. So much history is hidden in it.",
          "Only 20 % of Agra Fort is available for Vistors. Perfect view of Taj Mahal, from the red fort. The guide is required to understand the history of the Fort , don't pick the first guide you meet at Red fort and do bargain for the best rate.",
          "I really enjoyed learning the stories about the four generations of the family who built this fort. It's definitely worth getting a guide to help fill in the details.",
          "A world heritage site, it overlooks the wonderful Taj Mahal, and is the Fort where the Taj creator, Shah Jahan, was deposed and restrained by his son, Aurangzeb. It is rumoured that Shah Jahan died in Muasamman Burj, a tower with a marble balcony with a view of the Taj Mahal.",
          "This is a UNESCO heritage site built in red stone. If you have visited Fatehpur Sikri, you may skip to visit this place. The Mughal ruled from this fort for some time. Again this place has palace, rooms where Jahangir was kept under house arrest, a view of Taj Mahal. Most part",
          "This place is very big and requires decent amount of time to cover it's entirety. And quite significant portion is under Indian Army's control which Tourists are not permitted to visit unless you have some special permission or VVIP! Has many sections from various gardens,",
          "An interesting history of an important stronghold. Very well maintained. Allow several hours to take it all in.",
          "Without a guide to give perspective, this wouldn't be super impressive, with one it moves up a notch. Not strenuous, but it would have been great being a kid growing up here.",
          "Was pleasantly surprised by Agra Fort. I have already seen a number of forts throughout India but this was my favourite by far. Definitely worth checking out.",
          "This is a must visit attraction if you visit Agra. Only 20% of the fort is open to the public. The army occupies the rest of the fort. The history is fascinating. The buildings are magnificent and the interior would be even more so if the gold inlays had not been removed by the",
          "Simply stunning. Would recommend bringing a tour guide to truly understand the history of this monument.",
          "Agra Fort in Agra and Red Fort in Delhi have a similar architecture (Mughal I think, as it is also Muslim/Mongol). The Agra fort was built before that the Red fort, when Agra was still the capital of the empire.",
          "The fort dates to 1565 when the foundation stone was laid on the site of the existing ruined fort. It was constructed in red sandstone under the sponsorship of Akbar the Great, the third Mughal emperor who reigned from 1556 to 1605, and was completed in 1573. The marble palaces",
          "Went to Agra fort in Nov 2019. Really enjoyed the place. would recommend a guide it should not cost more than 200/- or 250/- rupees but bargain. Can get hot , carry a bottle of water .",
          "The marvel of a place that still exudes the power and majesty of the Maraja India then stripped of British greed. A place to visit absolutely",
          "I didn\u2019t expect that the fort is hiding the palace inside, made in the same kind of way as Taj Mahal. And the story is very interesting",
          "What an amazing building this is, absolutely steeped in history from being build by Akbar in the 1560\u2019s and his grandson Shah Jahan\u2019s input later down the line and his eventual death there. It was exceedingly busy when we visited so we did rush a little more than I might have",
          "Great place to visit and when you consider that it wasn't just a monument but an active fort & palace all that time ago. A wonderful external colour, large walls, 2 moats and then the intricate workmanship inside is all quite amazing. The water system used then is amazing &",
          "Magnificent structure and incredible history. So well preserved. We were with an organised tour so we were limited with where we could go but would have loved to have roamed and seen more. Its a must see.",
          "The Agra Fort is #2 in Agra on TripAdvisor. The Taj Majal is #1, and for good reason. The Taj is amazing. The fort is a 4 out of 5 because it's just that; very good. Certainly go and see the Agra Fort, and spend 2-3 hours. I believe that a section of the Fort is where the",
          "If you are in Agra you \u2018must\u2019 visit the Taj Mahal and Agra fort. Google some background information before you go. The buildings don\u2019t just look nice. There lies a nice a story in them!",
          "It was a great day to tour Agra Fort. The fort was amazing, such great history and a beautiful building.",
          "It's Massive... the only down side was the congested entrance but after that it's well spread out... lots of history is attached ...",
          "If you learn story of the dethroned king and see where he was imprisoned - it's worth seeing his view of the Taj in his old age. Not an awesome tourist attraction but something to do in Agra.",
          "Didn't expect that much with the fort but a very good experience visiting it! It has a very beatiful view of the Taj Mahal also, and t'he fortress conservation is very good.",
          "Large red Fort, lots of fab buildings, busy attraction. Worth visiting... Especially with a guide to provide you with the historic facts",
          "This a very impressive fort made of red sandstone built in the 1600 century has a long history of occupation.Once inside the main feature is the architecture which in some cases quite stunning especially the ceiling's and columns,a little restoration work was being carried out",
          "Better than Delhi fort. Guides in many languages not too expensive. Strongly recommend to get one as like in any Indian place if interest there is very little information.",
          "One of Agra most famous places. It's a really well maintained building and definitely the number two in Agra after Taj Mahal. If I remember right, the entrance fee is about 300 rupees for foreigners.",

          "This was the oldest fort in once upon a time when the Mughal king was there .. palace looks like not so maintained but charm is there....",
          "It was big crowd when I was there... Before your start reading review , IMPORTANT... Counter tickets are advisable , as in online you will not get both the tickets.. huge lines are there for entry and at the ticket counter window. Place is good to go and you may enjoy a lott if",
          "I guess you never get to remember enough of this forts history. It's my second visit and I learnt so much more with the guide. It's worth having one. It's a beautiful place and a must when in Agra.",
          "Do yourself a favor and hire a guide for this place. There was so much history and details about this fort that we discovered through our guide which made us appreciate the fort even more. It's quite impressive.",
          "What makes a visit here important, is it's connection to the history and story of the Taj Mahal. The Taj can be seen from the balcony that Shah Jahan used himself, to view his wife's monument. Recommend having a guide, as they will give you the history of the fort and ensure",
          "The Agra Fort is an interesting tourist attraction, and on a good day you get an amazing view of the Taj Mahal, but unfortunately there was a lot of pollution when we went so the Taj was barely visible. Unfortunately only a small percentage of the fort can be visited as the rest",
          "This place is another one of India\u2019s gems and there is a reason why it\u2019s on the Golden Triangle route. I would recommend getting a tour guide, don\u2019t pay more than 500 as you can get them cheaper. It\u2019s worth having a guide as there is a lot of fascinating history behind this",
          "This was an amazing place. We went there after visiting Tajmahal. Tajmahal can be seen from here as well. Shah Jahan was imprisoned here by his son for his madness like making another Tajmahal which was supposed to be black.",
          "beautiful buildings with an interesting history, always best to go with a guide to explain more about what you are looking at only downside is that the guy in the ticket booth short changed me by 1000 rupees - I wanted to pay by card but \"the machine is not working\" so I had to",
          "There are many forts in india,and this is one of the best with mogul architecture. If in agra and has time to see only few things,my suggestion will be agra fort and taj mahal.",
          "One of the best monument of India. Very beautiful architecture, well maintained by Govt of India. It was the place where you Mughal Jahangir lived. You can imagine the real history visit over there.",
          "Not what I was expecting. Only 20% of fort open. Generally in bad repair. Not a lot to see if I was honest. Without the tour guide who had a good knowledge of the fort it would have scored 'terrible'. Can not recommend.",
          "Found the fort amazing. Could not help but amaze at the scientific construction that made it possible for them to enjoy air conditioning at that time when there was no electricity. The sheesh mahal or palace of mirrors, bathroom of the queen, was closed for tourists but we were",
          "Worth visiting with a guide. The guide nicely draw your attention towards architecture, lifestyle, its usefulness, view of Taj from here etc etc...",
          "It\u2019s hard for anything to be your next stop after the Taj Mahal but the Agra Fort is an amazing place to explore. Parts of it are still occupied by the military and are off limits but that still leaves plenty to see. We particularly enjoyed the views of the Taj Mahal and the",
          "We were taken here by a wonderful guide with Explore India Journeys, It is not to be missed with the stunning red clay structure and rich history",
          "Many folks seem to go to Agra just for the Taj Mahal, if time permits try to get to Agra Fort, one of the best Mughal forts in India, we feel it is well worth it. The scale of the fort is impressive, originally a military fortress it was later turned into a palace.",
          "I was looking forward to visiting this fort after researching before my visit and finding myself totally immersed in the Mughal dynasty and the great Emperor Akbar. As I booked this holiday directly with an agent in India and arranged our itinerary, he had arranged a guide for",
          "Good place to visit for site seeing It's so far from Hyderabad still we went and enjoyed a lot I was very glad to go there",
          "This would have been amazing to see in full action in the 1700s. A very big fort. The red stone is a feature of the area and a symbol of the builders.",

          "Very busy around the entrance with visitors and the occasional monkey being nosey. Impressive moat surrounding the fort and can imagine in the day what it was like. Once inside it is immense and considering only 25% is able to be toured it is impressive.Towards the river side",
          "I initially thought our visit to Agra Fort was to 'kill time' before we saw the Taj Mahal. Boy, was I wrong. This is a must see while in Agra, and the story behind it very interesting. Go!",
          "Visited the Fort late afternoon as the sun was setting. A truly spectacular Fort with stunning views of the magnificent Taj Mahal in the distance across the banks of the Yamuna. One cannot help but be awestruck by the immense size of these Forts and how they were constructed",
          "We spent less than 2 hours here on a guided tour but could have stayed longer. You can see the Taj Mahal in the distance from the royal pavillions.",
          "This is an attraction that is best appreciated with a guide conversant in its history. It was built in sections and - most notably - is where Shah Jahan was imprisoned. Without the history it's not anywhere near as interesting. Be prepared for crowds so go early. Many school",
          "Amazing to see the high level of engineering employed in the development of this interesting fort. Be prepared for a long tour beginning with walk up an incline. Highly recommended tour!",
          "The walls of the fort are 2.6km long, that\u2019s a big fort. We got there at 7.30am and there was hardly anyone there which was great. We had a guide which helped the going to the best places but evidently you can only visit about 20% of the fort as the rest of it is still being",
          "Agra is just 3hours drive away from Delhi.. we started our journey in the morning and reached the destination soon. The first place we went there was Agra Fort. It was a nice place and really huge. You will find lot of tourists here.",
          "Beautiful place to visit to see where the royal family (of the king who built the Taj Mahal) lived. Was under construction but nonetheless still had beautiful sites even after 400+ years. Again lots of tourists come here so expect crowds every time and everyday.",

          "Agra fort is a historical monument beside Yamuna river overlooking Tajmahal.Nice built complexes contain Dewan e aam and Dewan e khas with mehals for queens.Major part of this fort occupied by Indian army.This fort offers a light and sound show at night which is quite enriching",
          "A must see when in Agra. Really interesting to get a glimpse of how the people of India lived hundreds of years ago. Beautiful views of the Taj Mahal throughout the fort, albeit the Taj did not exist for much of the forts history. A very clever civilisation with great",

          "Only a small portion of the grounds are available to visit,and not as much as what is described in guide books because of renovation. Some of the marble buildings are truly beautiful, with other viewpoint across the river to the Taj Mahal Avoid crowds, early morning is good but",
          "Absolut impressive! You can imagine the history of the powerful family and how they lived and found their decisions. Seeing this creates ideas of the old stories.",
          "Must see place in Agra.A historical place with some of common ruler having there contribution. Shahajahan who built Taj was house arrested in this fort .It is wonderful to see this which has wonderful carvings. View from here of Taj is amazing. Hire a guide compulsorily.",
          "Enter across the once crocodile-occupied moat into the fort/palace complex, which is spacious with lovely gardens. This is where Shah Jahan was imprisoned in his white marble octagonal tower, with a view to his wife's mausoleum (the Taj Mahal) around a bend in the river. Take",

          "The walls are very impressive and very red sandstone. Once inside there is a lot of marble. Plenty of rooms to visit but none are furnished. Signage a bit hit and miss, which is a problem. Views to the Taj Mahal are a highlight.",
          "Agra Fort well preserves and still well maintained. You can see Taj Mahal from some of the windows and that's the best part of Agra Fort. Full of hidden history and lots of spots for pictures. Agra Fort have a lovely garden but please avoid to visit in summer from 12 am to 4 pm",

          "This fort was bulit for Akbar in 1565. The place is also known as red fort beacause the walls of the palace is red in colour. I visited this place for the first time and i liked the fort as its totally open and The Great Taj mahal can be seen from here. The cost of ticket is 40\u20b9",
          "Suggestion- First visit Fatehpur Sikri and travel to Agra. It's possible to complete Fatehpur Sikri and Agra visit in One day. Tajmahal- it's marvel. Don't rush for early morning viewing. 2-3 hrs is perfect. Although I hired a guide, it is not required. Authorised guide is",
          "I had the opportunity to see the Agra Fort as a part of my tour of the Golden Triangle. I always wonder how a king or ruler could build such a stronghold to protect his kingdom or his country as well as his wife or wives. Agra Fort is one of the must to see in India. This is",

          "OK, let us be frank, anything in Agra is going to take a huge second place to the Taj Mahal which is spectacular beyond belief. That in mind this is a really good place to visit for a number of reasons, ironically one of them is the great views of the Taj Mahal! The fort is",

          "It\u2019s a must visit place in my opinion, if you are in Agra. Lots of guides will approach you at the entrance offering their services. If you are a first timer and you like to know more about the history of the fort, it\u2019s a good idea to hire a guide. They will be able to explain",

          "Outstanding structure with excellent gardens and a very peaceful atmosphere. We believe that the Taj Mahal was the main attraction in this area but the Fort really must be considered when coming to Agra",
          "One of Agra\u2019s highlight, a historical place that still looks charming despite the age. The best time to visit is late afternoon when the sun is about to set. Food & drink aren\u2019t allowed at the premises. It\u2019s better to get an authorized local guide so you wont miss any",
          "Much history - lovely gardens and buildings in fantastic condition. More close up, intricate carvings to be seen than at the Taj Mahal. Very sad that the person who wanted the Taj Mahal built was imprisoned here till death by his own son! One of his views was the Taj Mahal in",

          "We visited Agra Fort as part of a Trip-a-Deal package. It is very beautiful. We visited first thing in the morning when it was less crowded. It gets incredibly hot there by about 11am. Lots of areas to discover and explore. Worth the visit.",
          "the fort is pretty extensive. not really a fort but a place for the mughal sultans. the rustic red adds to it charm. be careful of the monkeys as they are quick snatchers. saw them snatch away a few bags from unwary visitors",
          "This is an interesting fort to visit which used to be surrounded on three sides by a moat and a river on the other side. The river has changed course but invaders can buy a ticket to get in now. There is a view of the Taj Mahal. A ruler of this area was imprisoned by his son",

          "If you go to the Taj first and retain your ticket, you don't pay tax again so the entry fee was just 550 INR for adults and free for children under 15. The place is nice and well worth a visit, but it doesn't rival Jodhpur, Jaisalmer or Jaipur's forts.",

        "wiki": "Agra ( (listen)) is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is 206 kilometres (128 mi) south of the national capital New Delhi. Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh and 24th in India.It has been speculated that in Mahabharata the city Agra is referred to as Agravana which translates as \u201cfront of the forest\u201d. It is mentioned that the Shurasena dynasty of Lord Krishna maintained an outpost at Agravana. Greek geographer Ptolemy referred to Agra by its modern name in his Geographia and placed it in his world map in 2nd century AD. The 11th-century Persian poet Mas'\u016bd Sa'd Salm\u0101n writes of an assault on the fortress of Agra, then held by King Jaypal, by Mahmud of Ghazni. Despite his surrender, Mahmud sacked the place. It was mentioned in 1080 AD when a Ghaznavide force captured it. A 17th century chronicle called the Agra before Sikandar Lod\u012b's time (1488\u20131517) as an old settlement which was merely a village, owing to its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sikandar was the first sultan to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1504, its administration having previously been under Bayana. He governed the country from here and Agra assumed the importance of the second capital. He died in 1517 and his son, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b, remained in power there for nine more years. Several palaces, wells, and a mosque were built by him in the fort during his period. He was finally defeated at the Battle of Panipat in 1526. Between 1540 and 1556, Afghans, beginning with Sher Shah Suri, ruled the area. It was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1648. The city was later taken by the Marathas and later still fell to the British Raj.\nAgra is a major tourist destination because of its many Mughal-era buildings, most notably the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur; and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with Lucknow and Varanasi. Agra is in the Braj cultural region.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nAgra features a semiarid climate that borders on a humid subtropical climate. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season. However, the monsoons, though substantial in Agra, are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India. This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a humid subtropical climate.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nAs of 2011 India census, Agra city has a population of 1,585,704, while the population of Agra cantonment is 53,053. The urban agglomeration of Agra has a population of 1,760,285. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Agra city has an average literacy rate of 73%, below the national average of 74%. Literacy rate of males is considerably higher than that of women. The sex ratio in the city was 875 females per thousand males while child sex ratio stood at 857. Agra district literacy rate is 62.56%.According to the 2011 census, Agra district has a population of 4,380,793, roughly equal to the nation of Moldova or the US state of Kentucky. This gives it a ranking of 41st in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of 1,084 inhabitants per square kilometre (2,810/sq mi) .\n52.5% of Agra's population is in the 15\u201359 years age category. Around 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nHindus are 88.8% while Muslims are 9.3% of the population in Agra district. Hinduism, Islam and Jainism are the major religions in Agra city with 80.7%, 15.4% and 1.0% of the population adhering to them; others are 2.9%. The Catholic minority is served by its own Metropolitan Archdiocese of Agra.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval era ===\nMasud Sa'd Salman claims to have been there when Mahmud assaulted Agra, claiming the Raja Japal surrendered after seeing a nightmare. Mahmud however proceeds to pillage the city. The history of the city before the Muslim conquerors is unclear. The 17th century chronicler named Abdhullah said it was a village before the reign of Sikandar Lodi. The king of Mathura had used the Agra fort as a jail. The degradation in the status of the site was a result of the destruction brought upon it by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sultan Sikandar Lod\u012b, the Muslim ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, shifted his capital to Agra in the year 1504. Before this, it was under the lordship of Bayana. After the Sultan's death, the city passed on to his son, Sultan Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b. He ruled his Sultanate from Agra until he fell fighting to Mughal Badshah B\u0101bar in the First battle of Panipat fought in 1526.\n\n\n=== Mughal era ===\n\nThe golden age of the city began with the Mughals. Previously known as Akbarab\u0101d, Agra was the capital of the Mughal Empire under the Badshahs Akbar, Jah\u0101ng\u012br and Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. Akbar made it the eponymous seat of one of his original twelve subahs (imperial top-level provinces), bordering (Old) Delhi, Awadh (Oudh), Allahabad, Malwa and Ajmer subahs. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted his capital to Sh\u0101hjah\u0101nab\u0101d in the year 1648.Since Akbarab\u0101d was one of the most important cities in India under the Mughals, it witnessed a lot of building activity. Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of the river Yamuna. The garden is called the Ar\u0101m B\u0101gh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson Akbar the Great raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarab\u0101d called Fatehpur Sikri. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.\n\nHis son Jah\u0101ng\u012br had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort or L\u0101l Qil'a. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Akbarab\u0101d its most prized monument, the Taj Mahal. Built in loving memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, the mausoleum was completed in 1653.\nSh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted the capital to Delhi during his reign, but his son Aurangzeb moved the capital back to Akbarab\u0101d, usurping his father and imprisoning him in the Fort there.\n\n\n=== Later periods ===\nThe Jat kingdom of Bharatpur waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra.After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of Marathas and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the British Raj in 1803.\n\nIn 1835 when the Presidency of Agra was established by the British, the city became the seat of government, and just two years later it was witness to the Agra famine of 1837\u201338. During the Indian rebellion of 1857 British rule across India was threatened, news of the rebellion had reached Agra on 11 May and on 30 May two companies of native infantry, the 44th and 67th regiments, rebelled and marched to Delhi. The next morning native Indian troops in Agra were forced to disarm, on 15 June Gwalior (which lies south of Agra) rebelled. By 3 July, the British were forced to withdraw into the fort. Two days later a small British force at Sucheta were defeated and forced to withdraw, this led to a mob sacking the city. However, the rebels moved onto Delhi which allowed the British to restore order by 8 July. Delhi fell to the British in September, the following month rebels who had fled Delhi along with rebels from Central India marched on Agra but were defeated. After this British rule was again secured over the city until the independence of India in 1947.\n\n\n=== Legacies ===\nAgra is the birthplace of the religion known as D\u012bn-i Il\u0101h\u012b, which flourished during the reign of Akbar and also of the Radhaswami Faith, which has around two million followers worldwide.

The courtyard of the Moti Masjid has side arcades and arched recessions and the main sanctuary facade beyond. The sanctuary is roofed with three bulbous domes built of light white marble and stand on the red sandstone walls. There are a series of Hindu-style domed kiosks along the parapet. There are seven bays that are divided into aisles which are supported by piers and lobed arches. The Moti Masjid boasts of extensive white marble facing, a typical stylistic feature of architecture during the reign of Shah Jahan.\nThis masjid was constructed at a cost of 2 lakhs and 60 thousand rupees and took four years to build.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMina Masjid\nNagina Masjid\n\n\n== External links ==\nOls Drawings of Moti Masjid",

        "wiki": "The Taj Mahal (; lit.\u2009'Crown of the Palace', [ta\u02d0d\u0292 \u02c8m\u025b\u02d0\u0266(\u0259)l]) is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna  in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\nConstruction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $916 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.\nThe Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7\u20138 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000\u20132007) initiative.\n\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum. Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later. The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.\n\n\n== Architecture and design ==\n\nThe Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand), Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.\n\n\n=== Tomb ===\nThe tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Persian in origin.The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.\n\nThe most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical \"drum\" it sits on, which is approximately 7 metres (23 ft) high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud (guava dome). The top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed chattris (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The dome is slightly asymmetrical. Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative spires (guldastas) extend from edges of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas. The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded finial which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century. This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements. The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minarets\u2014 a traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.\n\n\n=== Exterior decorations ===\nThe exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs.\nThroughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.The calligraphy on the Great Gate reads \"O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you.\" The calligraphy was created in 1609 by a calligrapher named Abdul Haq. Shah Jahan conferred the title of \"Amanat Khan\" upon him as a reward for his \"dazzling virtuosity.\" Near the lines from the Qur'an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription, \"Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi.\" Much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble inlaid in white marble panels. Higher panels are written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below. The calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate.Abstract forms are used throughout, especially in the plinth, minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab and, to a lesser extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex array of geometric patterns. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns.On the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.\n\n\n=== Interior decoration ===\nThe interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones. The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are topped by a \"false\" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall. The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or jali cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. The octagonal marble screen or jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers. Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect, in little detail, the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex.\n\nMuslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves. Hence, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right, towards Mecca. Mumtaz Mahal's cenotaph is placed at the precise centre of the inner chamber on a rectangular marble base of 1.5 by 2.5 metres (4 ft 11 in by 8 ft 2 in). Both the base and casket are elaborately inlaid with precious and semiprecious gems. Calligraphic inscriptions on the casket identify and praise Mumtaz. On the lid of the casket is a raised rectangular lozenge meant to suggest a writing tablet. Shah Jahan's cenotaph is beside Mumtaz's to the western side and is the only visible asymmetric element in the entire complex. His cenotaph is bigger than his wife's, but reflects the same elements: a larger casket on a slightly taller base precisely decorated with lapidary and calligraphy that identifies him. On the lid of the casket is a traditional sculpture of a small pen box.The pen box and writing tablet are traditional Mughal funerary icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively. The Ninety Nine Names of God are calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Other inscriptions inside the crypt include, \"O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious... \". The tomb of Shah Jahan bears a calligraphic inscription that reads; \"He travelled from this world to the banquet-hall of Eternity on the night of the twenty-sixth of the month of Rajab, in the year 1076 Hijri.\"\n\n\n=== Garden ===\n\nThe complex is set around a large 300-metre (980 ft) square charbagh or Mughal garden.\nThe garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four-quarters of the garden into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble water tank with a reflecting pool positioned on a north-south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum. The elevated marble water tank is called al Hawd al-Kawthar in reference to the \"Tank of Abundance\" promised to Muhammad.Elsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees labeled according to common and scientific names and fountains. The charbagh garden, a design inspired by Persian gardens, was introduced to India by Babur, the first Mughal emperor. It symbolises the four flowing rivers of Jannah (Paradise) and reflects the Paradise garden derived from the Persian paridaeza, meaning 'walled garden.' In mystic Islamic texts of the Mughal period, Paradise is described as an ideal garden of abundance with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain, separating the garden into north, west, south and east.Most Mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the centre. The Taj Mahal garden is unusual in that the main element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden. With the discovery of Mahtab Bagh or \"Moonlight Garden\" on the other side of the Yamuna, the interpretation of the Archaeological Survey of India is that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden's design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of Paradise. Similarities in layout and architectural features with the Shalimar Gardens suggests both gardens may have been designed by the same architect, Ali Mardan. Early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation, including abundant roses, daffodils, and fruit trees. As the Mughal Empire declined, the Taj Mahal and its gardens also declined. By the end of the 19th century, the British Empire controlled more than three-fifths of India, and assumed management of the Taj Mahal. They changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London.\n\n\n=== Outlying buildings ===\n\nThe Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls; the side facing the river is open. Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan's other wives, and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favourite servant.The main gateway (darwaza) is a monumental structure built primarily of marble, and reminiscent of the Mughal architecture of earlier emperors. Its archways mirror the shape of the tomb's archways, and its pishtaq arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb. The vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the complex.At the far end of the complex are two grand red sandstone buildings that mirror each other, and face the sides of the tomb. The backs of the buildings parallel the western and eastern walls. The western building is a mosque and the other is the jawab (answer), thought to have been constructed for architectural balance although it may have been used as a guesthouse. Distinctions between the two buildings include the jawab's lack of a mihrab (a niche in a mosque's wall facing Mecca), and its floors of geometric design whereas the floor of the mosque is laid with outlines of 569 prayer rugs in black marble. The mosque's basic design of a long hall surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by Shah Jahan, particularly the Masjid-i Jah\u0101n-Num\u0101, or Jama Masjid, Delhi. The Mughal mosques of this period divide the sanctuary hall into three areas comprising a main sanctuary and slightly smaller sanctuaries on either side. At the Taj Mahal, each sanctuary opens onto an expansive vaulting dome. The outlying buildings were completed in 1643.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land. An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above riverbank. In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials. It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal. The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight. A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons. An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a series of purs, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.The plinth and tomb took roughly 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on \"completion\". Construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by 1643 while work on the outlying buildings continued for years. Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost at the time has been estimated to be about 32 million Indian rupees, which is around 52.8 billion Indian rupees ($827 million US) based on 2015 values.\n\n\n== Later days ==\nAbdul Hamid Lahauri in his book Badshahnama refers to Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara (Perso-Arabic: \u0631\u0648\u0636\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0647 rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.\nSoon after the Taj Mahal's completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at nearby Agra Fort. Upon Shah Jahan's death, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife. In the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur invaded Agra and attacked the Taj Mahal, the two chandeliers, one of agate and another of silver, which were hung over the main cenotaph, were taken away by them, along with the gold and silver screen. Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15 ft) finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoliation.By the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair. During the time of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Taj Mahal was defaced by British soldiers and government officials, who chiselled out precious stones and lapis lazuli from its walls. At the end of the 19th century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908. He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber, modelled after one in a Cairo mosque. During this time the garden was remodelled with British-style lawns that are still in place today.\n\n\n== Threats ==\n\nIn 1942, the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force. During the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots.More recent threats have come from environmental pollution on the banks of the Yamuna River including acid rain due to the Mathura Oil Refinery, which was opposed by Supreme Court of India directives. The pollution has been turning the Taj Mahal yellow-brown. To help control the pollution, the Indian government has set up the \"Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ)\", a 10,400-square-kilometre (4,000 sq mi) area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place.Concerns for the tomb's structural integrity have recently been raised because of a decline in the groundwater level in the Yamuna river basin which is falling at a rate of around 1.5 m (5 ft) per year. In 2010, cracks appeared in parts of the tomb, and the minarets which surround the monument were showing signs of tilting, as the wooden foundation of the tomb may be rotting due to lack of water. It has been pointed out by politicians, however, that the minarets are designed to tilt slightly outwards to prevent them from crashing on top of the tomb in the event of an earthquake. In 2011, it was reported that some predictions indicated that the tomb could collapse within five years.Small minarets located at two of the outlying buildings were reported as damaged by a storm on April 11, 2018. On 31 May 2020 another fierce thunderstorm caused some damage to the complex.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe Taj Mahal attracts a large number of tourists. UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001, which had increased to about 7\u20138 million in 2014. A two-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and a more expensive one for foreigners. In 2018, the fee for Indian citizens was 50 INR, for foreign tourists 1,100 INR. Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre. In 2019, in order to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.The small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers. Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes.The grounds are open from 06:00 to 19:00 weekdays, except for Friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between 12:00 and 14:00. The complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after, excluding Fridays and the month of Ramadan.\nForeign dignitaries often visit the Taj Mahal on trips to India. Notable figures who have travelled to the site include Dwight Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, George Harrison, Barack and Michelle Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, Vladimir Putin, Princess Diana and Donald Trump.\n\n\n== Myths ==\n\nEver since its construction, the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument. A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river. The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveller who visited Agra in 1665. It was suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built. Ruins of blackened marble across the river in Moonlight Garden, Mahtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend. However, excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discoloured white stones that had turned black. A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Moonlight Garden. A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.Warrior Empire: The Mughals of India. A+E Television Network. 2006.No evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb. Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design. Similar claims are made for many famous buildings. No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck's biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck's fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.Another myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth. To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.In 2000, India's Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak's petition to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal. In 2005 a similar petition was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court. This case was brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher who says that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu King Parmar Dev in 1196.A theory that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work Itinerario, (The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629\u20131643). Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nAs of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by P. N.  Oak's theory. In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple. Bharatiya Janata Party's Vinay Katiyar in 2017 claimed that the 17th century monument was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after destroying a Hindu temple called \"Tejo Mahalaya\" and it housed a Shiva linga. This claim had also been made by another BJP member Laxmikant Bajpai in 2014. The BJP government's union minister of culture Mahesh Sharma stated in November 2015 during a session of the parliament, that there was no evidence that it was a temple. The theories about Taj Mahal being a Shiva temple started circulating when Oak released his 1989 book \"Taj Mahal: The True Story\". He claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century, as stated by the ASI. Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan stated Taj might be destroyed like Babri Masjid as people believed there was a temple there. Katiyar called for the demolition of the Taj and its replacement by a temple in February 2018. In response Indian National Congress MP Shashi Tharoor called him a troglodyte.A controversy was created in 2017 when the Uttar Pradesh government did not include it in its official tourism booklet \"Uttar Pradesh Tourism - Unlimited Possibilities\". The chief minister Yogi Adityanath had earlier claimed it does not represent Indian culture. Amidst this controversy, BJP MLA Sangeet Som had claimed that the those who built the Taj Mahal were traitors and it was a \"blot\" on the country's culture. He claimed it was built by a man who jailed his own father and wished to kill Hindus. BJP MP Anshul Verma supported his comments. AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference leader Omar Abdullah and Azam Khan criticised him. CM Adityanath stated Som's comments were personal and the government will focus on the tourism potential of every monument.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nTaj Mahal\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nWonders of the World\nNew7Wonders of the World\nArchitecture of India\nFatehpur Sikri, a nearby city and World Heritage Site\nBibi Ka Maqbara, a similar building in the Deccan, Aurangabad\nTaj Mahal replicas and derivatives\nInside, a 1968 new-age music album recorded in the building\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Taj Mahal at Wikimedia Commons\n Quotations related to Taj Mahal at Wikiquote\n Taj Mahal travel guide from Wikivoyage\nOfficial website of the Taj Mahal\nDescription of the Taj Mahal at the Archaeological Survey of India\nProfile of the Taj Mahal at UNESCO",

          "Some landmarks are just underwhelming when you see them in real life (hi Sydney Opera House or Eiffel Tower), but the Taj Mahal definitely lives up to the hype. It's an amazing building that I found hard to leave behind. I strongly recommend taking a guided tour as there's so",
          "In the 8 years since we visited this amazing location much has been done to improve the admission procedures which, in turn, helps with visitor management. The whole place is just one stunning experience after another as you wander around goggle-eyed at the mind that was able",

          "The architecture and design of the Taj Mahal truly make it one of the most beautiful, and amazing, buildings in the world. Try to be there early in the morning, to see the sun rising on it. Plan on at least an hour and a half, or more, to see it. Don't miss seeing the Red",
          "From the place you leave your car or bus it\u00b4s a long walk to the entrance (it took my husband and I 10 minutes), but it\u00b4s very pleasant, with wide sidewalks, cows and monkeys.

          "Second visit to Taj Mahal and the timing was lovely, afternoon sun glinting on the beautiful marble highlights. I had a guide for the hour or so here, it was worth it as he helped navigate the entry, explained the history and construction and took some photos of me (solo",

          "This place is legendary to British people, but the photos do not do justice the gorgeous gardens and atmosphere of the site. A must visit when in this part of India and going early in the day meant it was not overcrowded, but just looked mystical!!",
          "Not much I can say that hasn't been said before, other than to give my tips for a good Taj Mahal experience: Don't go on Friday, it's closed. Stay in a hotel on Taj East Gate Road the night before. Buy tickets online, or when you get there pay by card rather than cash. It's a",
          "We took the opportunity to visit the taj mahal first thing in the morning, and we're very glad we did. By the time we were leaving the crowds were starting to build up, but we managed the opportunity to get a few photos without the crowds. The site is amazing and well worth a",

          "Our main reason for travelling to India was to visit the Taj Mahal. We were not disappointed! It is a most beautiful and awe inspiring monument. We visited at 10am when the mist had lifted and the sun shone on the beautiful white marble. It was also not so crowded at this time.",
          "If you can get Rehan nicknamed \"Sunny,\" then you'll have the best tour. The Taj is as beautiful as its pictures, but more breathtaking in person than one can imagine. We went at dawn. Be sure to purchase your tickets before going there. Sunny was a jewel in the Taj's crown.",
          "Very impressive monument. To visit this place is a must for all travelers. Go and visit, there are few words that can describe the Taj Mahal.",
          "No words or pictures can adequately describe the beauty and grandeur of the Taj Mahal. It certainly moves you to tears. The level of detail of this wonder of the world is pure artistry. It truly is a testament to love. Seeing the Taj Mahal up close and personal exceeded all",

          "My first visit to the Taj was in October 2013 and it was great that the entrance is now well paved and lit for dawn entry. Security seems better & ticketing area and entrance have been laid out well compared to 2013. No annoying shops to sellers as well. Only one government",
          "Depending on where you are coming from, it is an effort to get to Agra and the Taj Mahal (3+ hour drive from Delhi), but it is most worthwhile. Getting there for dawn is a nice option to consider, but you would need to sleep in the Agra area the night before and get to the",
          "We arrived about 6am. We missed the crowds and saw the beauty of the building at sunrise. A guide is good here as he pointed out things we had never thought of. It is such an amazing place I just loved wandering around. It takes your breath away. I never thought I would be like",
          "Put it on your list! So beautiful to behold in person. Went in afternoon and early morning. Although cold and foggy in AM there were no crowds. The guides display the echo which can only be appreciated when there aren\u2019t large crowds. Spectacular to see!!!",

          "\" A strange guy\" stands close the tombs ( definitely not allowed). He shows you how the marble of tombs looks with the flashlight, then shouts your name in air for echo ( strictly prohibited here). This process lasts just 30 seconds. Then he demands tip. I didn't ask him for",
          "Went early in the morning--first thing---would highly recommend you do the same. There are less people and the atmosphere is much calmer. Have been there other times and morning is definately the best. You do risk it being foggy in the winter in the mornings. Decide before",

          "Architecture at it's finest. We visited at around 9am and it was not too busy. Managed to get some great photos without too many people in them. We also went inside the Taj Mahal and it was equally as spectacular. Shame you have to pay extra to go in as the ticket is quite",
          "Visit early in the morning when there are less crowds. I would highly recommend visiting when visibility is best too, so def not in the winter, be sure to see the Yamuna River behind it. Beautiful world wonder overall!",
          "Hey guys, hope you well. I have been to tajmahal multiple times as I belong to UP. You should must visit once in life. But if you are really interested in history go with guide. He will tell you exact details. Have fun..cheers!!!",
          "An amazing white marble building and went early morning to experience the effect of the sunrise on this building. Recommend you go very early morning while still dark when there are fewer tourists",
          "We went to see this one of the most unique place in the world. The queue for the ticket was quite long so we got one of official Guide and he got our tickets and pass to enter the monument. He showed and guided us explaining everything about Taj Maha and he was excellent in",

          "It is truly a world wonder. Early morning it could less crowded, but could surrounded with mist. travel souvenir can be less price than New Delhi. (typically this is other way round in most of the cases).",
          "The Taj Mahal has been on my bucket list ever since I can remember. I was worried that it wouldn't live up to my expectations but I was blown away. We were lucky with the weather and it was a quiet day. Our guide said Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the quieter days to go,",
          "You have to go- make sure you got early to see it and get Mohammed Tariq as a guide- he was fantastic. Highly recommend.",
          "I love this place. It is like a turn back time trip and shows me how people in the past lived and loved.",
          "On a chance, I\u2019ve visited a site that was posed to be one of \u201cthe world\u2019s nicest\u201d and happend solely to be, It\u2019s typically not that the site itself wasn\u2019t splended it\u2019s that I\u2019d built such an unreal (and perhaps inaccessible) metaphor of what the site potency be. I\u2019m not a fan",
          "The moment I saw this place....it brought tears to my eyes. I am so truly grateful I was able to see and visit a most magnificent place.",
          "If you are reading reviews for the Taj Mahal you are probably visiting for the wrong reasons. Despite the crowds, this marvel is awe inspiring and has an amazing historic story. No more need be said.",
          "There was nothing to prepare us for the first time we saw the Taj Mahal, perfectly framed in the entrance gate, towers in the shadows. Beautiful. Stunning. No wonder the Taj Mahal was on the list of new \"7 Wonders of the World.\" Highlights: The first time we saw the Taj Mahal",
          "The Taj Mahal is a jewel in India and there is a reason why it is considered to be one of the 7 Wonders of the World. A beautiful example of Indo-Islamic architecture it is stunning. I highly recommend getting a guide to show you around. Not only are there tons of small",

          "Amazing! I was overwhelmed as the Taj came into view from the entryway. If you find a good guide, they will not only provide historical information, but they\u2019ll know all the cool places to take photos. For me, that was worth it. I traveled from Bangalore to Delhi (while on",

          "Taj Mahal, the wonder created by Shah Jahan is a love saga. As you walk through the doors of this mighty structure, you can feel the emotion. Every woman dreams of the man she loves doing something romantic for her and the Taj Mahal sets the bar really high. A majestic",
          "My husband and I visited the Taj, early morning! We got there around 645am, queued for tickets Rs. 1300 each. Includes water, shoe covers and a tour guide. We declined the tour guide as we just wanted to wander on our own. What an amazing structure with a beautiful story behind",
          "Had a guided tour by a very knowledgeable and friendly guide Taboo, he told us the love story of the Taj Mahal. I loved every moment. It's breathtaking.",
          "Having seen a million photos of the Taj over the years I thought seeing it in person would be slightly underwhelming. How bloody wrong I was! Get there early before the swarms of people arrive. As per the rest of India, do not believe what anyone says outside in regards to",
          "We visited with my family(Wife and 2 kids) on Christmas 2019 and it was awesome to be honest and lived up to expectations. However agra town as such is not clean and needs improvement . Even the train approach to the railway station is so unclean with lots of garbage.",
          "This is a very cool place and tippy should visit of you are in the area. Don't let your guide stress you and take your time!",
          "Very nice management. It was magical, seeing taj at sun set time. White marvel stone looks amazing at time of sun, set.",
          "What a magnificent construction made by Emperor Shah Jahan in the love of his wife Mum Taj. Till date one of the most beautiful monument in the world. The Taj dont need more descriptions. A day trip from Delhi is enough for tourist to enjoy the Taj. Just avoid the summers as it",
          "You may see many representations of this place, but none will live up to actually visiting. Waiting for tickets and getting into the place is a scrum, but when inside you can find space, and even without it, serenity.",
          "We were undecided what to do in relation to getting to the car we decided to book a private taxi from Gurgaon rather than take that rather expensive hotel excursion which was basically the same as what we\u2019ve got and we got it for a quarter of the price. We used \u2018South Delhi",
          "Better queue system here, however I got annoyed by the fact that I had to buy and pay an entrance fee as a foreigner! The officials require ID to proof Indian nationality. Otherwise prices are cheaper if you are a student or SAARC National. Buy tickets and get into Taj Mahal as",
          "Considered the most beautiful building in the world, hard to disagree. Built out of love makes it even more stunning. You should take a tour guide and get the \u201chigh value\u201d entrance tickets.",
          "Words and photos can not convey the beauty of the Taj Mahal. If it is possible for you to do, do it.",
          "Incredible! A long drive from Delhi but well worth the trip! Crowded but pretty well controlled when we were there. A must see on a trip to India!",
          "The Taj is like a poem in stone. Every corner of this monument is so beautifully crafted. The symmetry is amazing. It was my second visit but can go again and again to see it.",
          "This was on my bucket list and it didn't disappoint, it was magical seeing it at sunrise. As the sun came up you could see it change colour and when the sun started to come out the coloured stones started to sparkle. An absolute must if you are in Agra",
          "We visited in the last week of December-19. It was very awesome experience and i recommend every person should visit this place. It was a superb moment and despite crowed , local authorities managed properly.",
          "This was my 3rd visit to Taj Mahal, earliest it was good but at this time it was so terrible and very expensive too.. Govt is doing a very good business from public why they have increased the entry fee from 50 to 250 why just to see the beauty, the most beautiful is Akshardham",
          "We stayed here for just one night for our visit to The Taj Mahal. After having stayed at Oberoi hotels in both Mumbai & Delhi this was a major letdown. The hotel is very dated and a bit creepy. The rooms are old and in desperate need of an updated. The pool",
          "This is one of the 8 wonders of the world. It was so beautiful. We were there when the air quality was unsafe and you could barely see the structure - and yet it\u2019s beauty shined through. You need to wear shoe covers while there. You can take as many pictures as you want on the",
          "This is a must see when in India. It is overwhelming and magnificent. The entry process is chaotic as well as the parking. It would be best to have a local guide to get you through all the hawkers and misinformation. Once inside it is just stunning.",
          "Wow What a surreal experience. We visited the Taj at 6.42 (sunrise) We were surprised by how quiet it was, so would reccomend getting up early to try miss the crowds. Pictures and words don't do the Taj justice. If you have the chance you must go",
          "The Taj Mahal is simply magical despite being very busy and so well known. As you go through the gates, and get the first glimpse of the Taj, it is nothing short of magical",
          "I visited Xmas day and it was enchanting - such a gorgeous calm place, the Taj Mahal exceeded my expectations the gardens and the size of the grounds are wonderful I recommend getting the professional photographer they do a great job especially if you\u2019re traveling alone",
          "Agra will introduce one to the busy-ness and poverty of parts of India. Use a government tour guide, booked ahead, to expedite through lines. They'll provide great tips. However, they'll also direct you to the rug, marble and gem \"museums\" which are really cooperative factories",
          "One of the most amazing sites in the world from an external perspective. We were left a little disappoitnted with inside the mausauliam though as we had no opportunity to explore and felt a little herded like sheep. The grounds get excessively busy at certain times of the day",
          "We were fortunate to have a guide who could provide us the back-story and facts as we walked through the grounds. At his suggestion we also employed a photographer to take shots of the both of us. This is not something I'd normally consider but I'm glad we did. The photographer",
          "Such an amazingly beautiful building. Dec is not the best month, due to fog and pollution, but we arrived late in the afternoon, and visibility was quite good. Plus the crowds were not tooo bad.",
          "Absolutely breathtaking. See while you can as they may stop tourist visits from next year to protect the foundation structures ( due to climate change not visitors). A true monument for love. It is quite indescribable as to it\u2019s beauty. Large crowds, lots of guide and photo",
          "It is a different experience seeing the Taj Mahal 'in real life', as oppose to on a screen. It's so beautiful, try to go as early as you can. A guide can really help you understand the history and context of the site, as well as the practical advantage of skilfully guiding you",
          "Truely one of the wonders of the world. No words can describe the breathless beauty & intricate craftmanship of the monument. Definitely DO NOT MISS.",
          "It's magnificent and beautiful. There will be people around wanting to take photos for you and you will have to pay for it. It\u2019s up to you whether you want it or not. It\u2019s not really that great quality but if you\u2019re traveling alone, then why not.",
          "Although we paid 1300 Rupees to enter the Taj Mahal it was a Majestic. We went at Sunrise. It was nice and empty but foggy. We were pestered to take a guide on numerous occasions. But still something worth seeing. The mausoleum wasn't worth the money though.",
          "Taj one of the 7 wonder is always a dream come true visit. Property is nicely maintained having all sort of facilities required inside",
          "Nice monument in the world, our tour guide give us lots of details and history about this love monument. Highly recommend",
          "It is simply amazing! It is a place to visit once in a Life, I strongly suggest to spend one day there if you are in India. It is empty inside, so if you want you can visit only outsider.",
          "Awesome trip with kids. Not as grand and freedom to roam as I remember when I visited as a kid, but i suppose my kids may end up saying the same.",
          "Taj Mahal is definitely my favourite place in India! The craftmanship involved for this place is simply amazing. Bad that the air was heavily polluted when we visited and everything looked hazy..",
          "We came to India for this particular landmark. It\u2019s been on my bucket list for quite sometime. I\u2019m not gonna lie, we\u2019ve put it off and went to other \u201cmust visit\u201d on my bucket list first like Egypt and Jordan (see my reviews). When we finally made it to Agra, Taj Mahal was",
          "It was worth all the way to get here. Very breathtaking view.. So I went there in the early morning and the queue already quite long. One thing I love in India, they have special line for woman and divided into two with and without bag, so the queue not too long. After",
          "I have visited Taj Mahal four times and everything it looks and throws up some new features. Over the years lot of improvements have happened around Taj. Some useful tips to the visitors from my latest trip are, carry an ID proof, avoid photographers, avoid buying anything, have",
          "We visited the Taj Mahal (parents & boyfriend) departing from Delhi on a Monday at 3am through a recommended contact called Arun driver on Facebook - he connected us with a local guide called Guddu who was very nice, professional and interesting. The sun appeared slowly around",
          "A must of course but make sure there is no fog! One of the most beautiful buildings to see and appreciate the history of India.",
          "Undoubtedly an incredible piece of marble architecture and rightfully a WORLD WONDER. Lot has been written and documented about Taj and me adding more would be addition to its beauty and awesomeness, but I would do it as I visited it for the first time and the first look",
          "People want to visit this place for culture happiness and also it is so what called Wonder of he world but recently I have noticed there are paan and other rubbish spotted the whiteness is like a hello red gutka freak you",
          "Nothing really to add to previous reviews about the amazing and spectacular Taj. One planning note for those considering sunrise visits in December and January. As we learned, there are at least 1 or 2 days of morning fog in these months that totally obscures any views of",
          "It's a feminine Mughal architecture, so well designed and suited as the symbol of love in memory of the beloved Queen. Complementing with the garden and the fountain as well as the love story which makes the site captivating. Unfortunately it is too crowded and noisy to enjoy or",
          "Well enough written about this place. Nothing really prepares you for the first look...You have to see it before you d..... Try to buy tickets online in advance it is very easy. Available with the garden ticket too where a nice photo can be taken especially at sunset. Get unside",
          "Wonderful place with awesome carvings.This is a great place to visit which is one of the seven wonders of the world.",
          "We couldn't do the sunrise trip as the fog was so think so we went late morning when it had cleared quite a bit. Yes it was busy, but so beautiful. It's amazing from the outside but rather underwhelming inside, but still worth a look.",
          "Giving this 5 stars because this truly is a magnificent and awe-inspiring structure, however be prepared to overcome some hurdles to get there. Finding where to buy entrance tickets is not simple. You have to get to Shilpgram (where the ticket office used to be) and now to board",
          "Have been visiting the wonder of the world for many years. Taj looks exquisite now. Have not seen the Marble shine so much and it\u2019s white now. While the over all management of the crowds inside the monument has improved , the selling of tickets , security check , cloak rooms",
          "The crowds this winter evening were overwhelming. But the Taj itself compensated well for this. We were there at sunset with the thinning crowds and were rewarded with emptying grounds.",
          "We had a perfect DAY, out driver Jahoor took us to all nice places! We felt all the time comfortable :)",
          "No photo by any camera in world can give you the real feeling of visiting Taj mahal in person. Its grand, its beautiful. Its symmetric. Its based on layout of Heaven (Jannat) Its a architectural masterpiece. and Its FLOATING...... on wooden platform over 180 wells taking water",
          "The entrance to the site was not accessible by car, so we took an exciting ride on a tuk tuk (which was slightly hit by the car behind when the driver stopped too quickly!) then a short walk towards the north gate, which opened up to a stunning view of the Taj Mahal. I got a",
          "My review is based not on the building and structure, yes, it was built by a silly king for a wife that he loved..bla bla bla on the love stuff of the yesteryears. It was breathtaking for a minute and then I could smell BO, urine etc etc on the outskirts of the building. Hoards",
          "Taj mahal very beautiful place to visit. This is also religion tour especially for moslem. Enjoy Taj Mahal.",
          "Nothing prepares you to see the Taj Mahal in person. It is beyond spectacular and truly deserves more than just a couple hours to explore, admire and learn about its history. From the marble benches outside, to the stunning inlay work on the arches, the perfectly manicured",
          "This place is amazing and you should totally go as early as you can, there would be fewer people and if the weather is good, you can catch te sunrise.",
          "On my visit, the guide told me the story of Shah Jahan and his beloved wife Mumtaz. The Taj Mahal is a true sign of their love and an amazing place to visit.",
          "Everything I hoped it was been waiting all my life to check it out, Worth travelling India and putting up with all the chaos to check it out.",
          "What an incredible experience to see this architectural landmark! Went in the evening which was great because the sunset made the white marble glow pink. We were also fortunate to have a pretty clear day on which to see the Taj Mahal (the next day had lessened visibility).",
          "Beautiful! Not so many people in early morning, you may come and buy tickets by yourself, just around 10-20 peoples in line. Save your time and extra cost on those express tickets mentioned on internet.",
          "the most beautiful place I've ever seen. I will never forget it. the beauty of the building is not to be believed. The serenity of the place is breathtaking. I would recommend this site to anyone.",
          "A unique experience visiting one of the wonders of the world. Though our visit was during the Christmas holiday time, the crowds were manageable. The only issue we had was that the weather in December can be foggy and cold.",
          "A once in a lifetime experience.wah Taj!Never to be missed.The entire city comes alive because of the Taj.",
          "I visited the Taj Mahal on Dec 1st 2019 in a small group tour of Rajasthan. There are no words to fully express this amazing place. Nothing I had ever read or seen about it (or India) came anywhere near this experience of actually being at this place. Regardless of your beliefs",
          "Standing out, tall and pristine, milky white, on the banks of the river Yamuna, the Taj Mahal is a tribute and monument to the love Shah Jahan had for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. This white marble architectural marvel is known for its symmetry standing amid the water ways casting its",

          "Due to current sitaution is not advisable to visit Taj Mahal as internet services are not working properly.",
          "We woke up at 6:00 am to make our way to the Taj Mahal at 6:30, still a bit dark, goofy and polluted. It was worth getting there early and have the early morning view of this magnificent architectural structure. Avoid any and all so called \u201cGovernment approved guides\u201d Do some",
          "Truly a must see!! This world wonder is one of the most beautiful structures I've ever laid my eyes one! There were tons of visitors the day I went.",
          "The Taj is much more impressive outside than inside. The inside ceiling is very low compared to the actual height of the dome. Super crowded of course but probably the only reason you're in Agra. In March it was already very very hot.",
          "Tourists come to Agra with one purpose - to see Taj Mahal. With all those fairy tale love story and amazing documentary of the monument, people's desire and expectation to see the Taj are rocket high. We visited Taj in early December. In terms of weather, the temperature (16",
          "It can't really be described in words. Beware of agents and try getting the tickets directly and avoid online transactions because my money was deducted but still there is no refund.",
          "A highly underrated wonder, a master piece that every person should see. I had lesser expectations honestly, but once you see it, the sheer beauty of the Taj will mesmerise you. What could get better surely, is the way tourists are managed, given the huge potential it has, the",
          "Being a couple it was our dream to visit it and it comes true when I kept my first foot in the Taj campus with my wife. Its beauty is undescriable.",
          "A great guide who knew all the history made it a fascinating story. A monument which signifies a great love story. Beautiful artistry and symmetry. Nothing compares. India has amazing buildings and temples which go back to the 12th century. It is really worth a visit. Much",
          "Worth seeing this monument. Such a beautiful landmark in India. Must view for everyone. Lots of people outside India also enjoy visiting this.",
          "Despite the cold and the smog, the Taj is a truly amazing place to visit. Do your research first as ticket prices vary depending on whether you're a local or foreigner. We bought foreigner tickets online which made it easier to enter. This also gave us shoe covers and two",
          "We came early at 8am and successfully avoided the crowds. After 10am it starts being a lot busier. Entry is a bit on the pricey side (1300 INR), but then again there is only one Taj Mahal in the world :) Two hours are more than enough to see the entire complex.",
          "Picturesque! Such an iconic landmark so beautiful you are lost for words! Not too crowded which made it even better. There is some people that go around and try and get paid for taking photos of you though, the only downfall",
          "Definitely worth seeing, such a beautiful monument which is very well maintained. For foreign tourists the price is 1300 rupees each. This includes shoe covers (shoes must be covered to walk on the Taj Mahal) and water bottle (both picked up from nearby table). Don\u2019t trust",
          "They do say it\u2019s the 7 wonders of the world, personally I was amazed when I saw this up close and personal, after travelling with the group of friends from India to show us around. We set off early at 3:30 am to catch the sunrise over the Taj (I\u2019m not normally a morning person),",
          "Had two visits to the Taj Mahal during our tour of India. Well worth the visit to see one of the major historic sites of India. Be prepared for large crowds, and long queues to get into the grounds. There are also plenty of hawkers around trying to sell trinkets to the",
          "What can I put? One of the most beautiful buildings in the world, it doesn't disappoint, weekends are very busy.",
          "A visit to the Taj Mahal is on many a bucket list. Is it as splendid as we imagine? More so. A trip to India must include a visit to the Taj Mahal. It is easier to visit if it is included in a Golden Triangle tour. Here is the rub though. This would mean staying over in Agra.",
          "No comments are really needed. There are lots of people, but what would you expect about one of the world wonders?",
          "I took a day trip to Agra from Jaipur with Rajasthan Discovery. I had read some reviews stating that the city of Agra was not really nice. In fact, it is located halfway between Delhi and Jaipur and c. 3 1/2 h drive, so I chose Jaipur for my base. The drive was pretty intense -",
          "We arrived in the morning when the Taj was covered in thick dense fog. By the time we left her beauty was revealed like lifting a vail. The beauty of the Taj is really mesmerizing. The story as told by the guide is alluring just like the majestic Taj Mahal. The crowds include",
          "I was on a business trip in Mathura and was encouraged by my colleagues to visit the Taj Mahal since it\u2019s only few kilometers away. They even provided me with a guide, and grabbing the opportunity was definitely a good decision on my part. Being a foreigner, I have to pay 1,300",
          "We visited in early November & although it is a spectacular site it was spoilt by not seeing in it's true splendor with the sun shining on it in fact we never did see the sunshine all day. Do not be put off visiting the Taj Mahal if you the weather is going to be bad it's",
          "Such a popular destination that it\u2019s hard sometimes to be stunned but had a good guide and really enjoyed the visit. Hard to put the design perfection into words. While the place is always filled w tourists, it seems manageable and you can still find the slots for that must",
          "Ahmad is such a warm personality and highly motivated guide (recommendable!). I truly enjoyed walking with my sister of us through the area. taj mahal was beautiful and it was a relieve to walk in such a quiet and peaceful environment. he is very smart to take photo shoot...",
          "What can possibly be said about one of the 7 modern wonders of the world that has not been said? This is number 6 of the 7 for me and Wow, wow, wow, oh wow!! You cannot prepare yourself for this experience - it is absolutely breathtaking. We were blessed with glorious sunshine",
          "Good monument which is still not destroyed by rulers like Hampi, else there are plenty of other monuments which are in ruins.",
          "No matter how many photos you see of the Taj Mahal, nothing prepares you for the beauty of this building. Visiting the Taj Mahal should be on everyone's bucket list. It is beyond beautiful and that it was completed in 22 years, without modern technology, using 22000 labourers",
          "It was a few years ago since I was here. They have developed some nice walkway areas and you have plenty of walking without the motorists. Entry and paying is smoother. You don\u2019t have to buy the footwear cover anymore. It is now included in the fee (which has gone up again).",
          "So glad that we took the time to visit the Taj Mahal it was an amazing experience. We were lucky that the fog disappeared while we were there. Would not recommend more than one day in Agra thou.",
          "Do your research before you go. We entered by East Gate which I hear is the most quiet entrance. Go first thing in the morning, rug up and embrace the cold weather because then will be the fewest crowds. Explore the gardens and take photos from every angle. There are amazing",
          "Definitely worth a visit but check if you go make sure you check the weather! I arrived @ 6am with a guide and could not visualise ANYTHING! It was a bit of a joke, so CHECK!",
          "The Taj Mahal is one of those places that you read about in books and imagine what it must be like to visit. It was more than I could ever imagine. The size and shape of the white marble structure is amazing to witness, allowing you to pause and sit and just take in the",
          "Truly breathtaking and completely awestruck by its beauty. From the moment I saw it and till I came out of it, I was engrossed to it. Classic example of Mughal architecture and you can see tinge of Iranian and Turkish architecture too. Must Visit :-)",

        "wiki": "Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.\nIt had been used by the early mughal rulers. The Fort stands on an ancient site and was traditionally known as Badalgarh. It was captured by Ghaznavi for some time but in the 15th century A.D. the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487\u20131517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556\u20131605).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli (step well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri's general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.\n\nRealising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, Abul Fazl, recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in Rajasthan. Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.It was only during the reign of Akbar's grandson, Shah Jahan, that the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the beautiful Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from white marble. He destroyed some of the earlier buildings inside the fort to make his own.The fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 Years. In the fort, they built the Ratan Singh ki haveli. The fort was invaded and captured by the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century. Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at Third Battle of Panipat by Ahmad Shah Abdali in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next decade. Finally Mahadji Shinde took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, in 1803.The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857, which caused the end of the British East India Company's rule in India, and led to a century of direct rule of India by Britain.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe 380,000 m2 (94-acre) fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river Yamuna and its walls are seventy feet high. Double ramparts have massive circular bastions at intervals, with battlements, embrasures, machicolations and string courses. Four gates were provided on its four sides, one Khizri gate opening on to the river.Two of the fort's gates are notable: the \"Delhi Gate\" and the \"Lahore Gate.\" The Lahore Gate is also popularly also known as the \"Amar Singh Gate,\" for Amar Singh Rathore.The monumental Delhi Gate, which faces the city on the western side of the fort, is considered the grandest of the four gates and a masterpiece of Akbar's time. It was built circa 1568 both to enhance security and as the king's formal gate, and includes features related to both. It is embellished with intricate inlay work in white marble. A wooden drawbridge was used to cross the moat and reach the gate from the mainland; inside, an inner gateway called Hathi Pol (\"Elephant Gate\") \u2013 guarded by two life-sized stone elephants with their riders \u2013 added another layer of security. The drawbridge, slight ascent, and 90-degree turn between the outer and inner gates make the entrance impregnable. During a siege, attackers would employ elephants to crush a fort's gates. Without a level, straight run-up to gather speed, however, that thing is prevented by this layout.Because the Indian military (the Parachute Brigade in particular) is still using the northern portion of the Agra Fort, the Delhi Gate cannot be used by the public. Tourists enter via the Amar Singh Gate.The site is very important in terms of architectural history. Abul Fazal recorded that five hundred buildings in the beautiful designs of Bengal and Gujarat were built in the fort. Some of them were demolished by Shah Jahan to make way for his white marble palaces. Most of the others were destroyed by the British troops of East India Company between 1803 and 1862 for raising barracks. Hardly thirty Mughal buildings have survived on the south-eastern side, facing the river, such as the Delhi Gate and Akbar Gate and one palace \u2013 \"Bengali Mahal\".\nAkbar Darwazza (Akbar Gate) was renamed Amar Singh Gate by Shah Jahan.  The gate is similar in design to the Delhi Gate. Both are built of red sandstone.The Bengali Mahal is built of red sandstone and is now split into Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal.\n\n\n== Other Historic sites inside Agra Fort ==\nJahangir's Hauz (tank) A.D. 1610: This monolithic tank (hauz) was used for bathing. It is 5 feet high, 8 feet in diameter and 25 feet in circumference. On the external side of the rim there is an inscription in Persian which mentions it as 'Hauz-e-Jahangir'. It was first discovered near the courtyard of Akbar's palace. In A.D. 1843 and later it was placed in front of Diwan-e-Am. In 1862, it was shifted to public garden (Company Bagh) where it suffered much damage. Later, Sir John Marshall brought it back to Agra Fort and placed there. Due to this hauz, the palace became famous as Jahangiri Mahal though it is part of Akbar's Bengali mahal.\nShahjahani Mahal (1628-35 A.D.): It is situated in between the white marble Khas Mahal and the red stone Jahangiri Mahal and is set transitionally in between these two residential complexes of two different ages. It is the earliest attempt of the Mughal emperor Shahjahan to convert an existing red stone building in accordance with his taste and it was his earliest palace in Agra Fort. It has a large hall, side rooms and an octagonal tower on the riverside. The skeletal construction of brick and red stone was all redone with a thick white stucco plaster and colourfully painted in floral designs. The whole palace once glistened white like white marble. On the face towards the Khas Mahal, is a large spacious white marble dalan, composed of five arches, supported on double pillars and protected externally by a chhajja. Its closed western bay houses, the Ghaznin gate, Babur's baoli and a well are situated beneath it.\nGhaznin Gate (1030 A.D.): The gate originally belonged to the tomb of Mahmud Ghaznavi at Ghazni. It was brought from there by the British in1842. Lord Ellenborough, the Governor General, in historic proclamation claimed, that these were the sandalwood gates of Somnath which Mahmud had taken to Ghazni in 1025, and the British had thus avenged an insult of 800 years back. This false claim was made just to win the goodwill of the Indian people. The gate is, in fact, made of local deodar wood of Ghazni and not of sandalwood. The style of decoration bears no resemblance to ancient Gujrati woodwork. There is also an Arabic inscription carved on the upper part. It mentions Mahmud with his epithets. Sir John Marshall had placed here a notice-board which described the whole episode about this gate. It is 16.5 feet high and 13.5 feet broad and its wight is about half a ton. It is made up of geometrical, hexagonal and octagonal panels which have been fixed, one with the help of the other into the frame without rivets. The idea to restore it at Somnath was ultimately given up and the gate was abandoned. Since then, it is stored in a room.\nJahangir's Chain of Justice (C. 1605 A.D.): This is the spot where Mughal king Jahangir instituted his 'chain of justice'(Zanjir-i-Adl) in c. 1605 A.D. He records in his memoir that after his accession, the first order he gave, \"was for the fastening up of the chain of justice so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practice hypocrisy, the aggrieved might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract my attention.\" It was made of pure gold. It was 80' in length and had 60 bells. Its weight was 1 Quintal. One end was fastened to the battlements of the Shah-Burj and the other end to a stone post on the bank of the river. This is not a myth. Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins personally saw it. It has also been depicted in a contemporary painting made in 1620 A.D. This was a way to redress the grievances of the people who could approach the king, the highest judicial authority of the empire, directly, without fee, fear or formality for immediate relief. There was no distinction of caste or creed or between poor and rich. Jahangir's administration of justice 'Adl-i-Jahangir' became a legend in Indian history.\nThe Muthamman Burj (Shah-Burj) & Jharokha (1632 -1640 A.D.): This beautiful palace surmounts the largest bastion of Agra Fort on the riverside, facing the East. It was originally built of red stone by Akbar who used it for jharokha darshan, as well as for sun worship, everyday at sunrise. Jehangir also used it as jharokha, as is faithfully shown in his painting made in 1620. He also instituted his 'Adl-i-Janjir'(the chain of justice) on its south side. Owing to its octagonal plan, it was called 'Muthamman Burj'. It has also been mentioned as 'Shah-Burj'(the imperial or king's tower) by Persian historians and foreign travellers. Its name jasmine tower or 'Samman-Burj' as recorded by the contemporary historian Lahauri is a misnomer. It was rebuilt with white marble by Shah Jehan around 1632-1640 A.D. He also used it for jharokha darshan which was an indispensable a Mughal institution as was 'Durbar'. It is an octagonal building, five external sides of which make a dalan overlooking the river. Each side has pillar and bracket openings, the eastern most side projects forward and accommodates a jharokha majestically. On the western side of this palace is a spacious dalan with Shah-Nasin (alcoves). A shallow water-basin (kunda) is sunk in its pavement. It is profusely inlaid. This dalan opens on a court which has a chabutara projected by a jali screen, on its northern side, a series of rooms leading to Shish Mahal on its western side; and a colonnade (dalan) with a room attached to its on the southern side. It is, thus, a large complex entirely built of white marble. It has deep niches on the walls, to break the monotony. Dados have repetitive stylized creepers inlaid on borders and carved plants on the centre pillars, brackets and lintels also bear exquisitely inlaid designs and it is one of the most ornamented buildings of Shah Jehan. This palace is directly connected to the Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas Mahal, and other palaces. and it was from here that the Mughal emperor governed the whole country. This burj offers full and majestic view of Taj Mahal and Shah Jehan spent eight years (1658-1666 A.D.) of his imprisonment in this complex, and it is said that he died here. His body was taken by boat to the Taj Mahal and buried.\nShish Mahal (A.D. 1631-40): It was built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan as a part of summer palace. Its most distinctive feature is glass mosaic work done on its walls and ceiling. These glass pieces have high mirror quality which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways in semi-dark interior. The glass was imported from Haleb of Syria. Shahjahan built glass palace also at Lahore and Delhi, but this is the finest of all.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Agra Fort won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2004. India Post issued a stamp to commemorate this event.\nThe Agra Fort plays a key role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery The Sign of the Four, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\nThe Agra Fort was featured in the music video for Habibi Da, a hit song of Egyptian pop star Hisham Abbas.\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj came to Agra in 1666 as per the \"Treaty of Purandar (1665)\" entered into with Mirza Raje Jaisingh to meet Aurangzeb in the Diwan-i-Khas. In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. Insulted, he stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nJama Masjid\nFatehpur Sikri\nLahore Fort\nRed Fort\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAgra Fort (1983), Uttar Pradesh \u2013 Archaeological Survey of India\nAgra Fort map (from Murray's travel guide, 1909)\n Geographic data related to Agra Fort at OpenStreetMap",

          "Such a beautiful magic place! We were with our private guide Akash from akbrantours.com & although we were there a few hours, it went by in a flash. Because Akash spoke really good English & was a great story teller, the whole place came to life for us. I had heard people",
          "First time I visited the Taj Mahal about 25 years ago. I was very much like this monument that time a best tourist guide mr. JP Sharma live in Agra, He sow me taj mahal and give all information. there is good work in marble make all item like taj mahal and other i By a marbel",

          "Amazing place! even on a rainy day this place was worth the visit! stunning building with lovely details ...",

          "There was nothing to prepare us for the first time we saw the Taj Mahal, perfectly framed in the entrance gate, towers in the shadows. Beautiful. Stunning. No wonder the Taj Mahal was on the list of new \"7 Wonders of the World.\" Highlights: The first time we saw the Taj Mahal",
          "The Taj Mahal is a jewel in India and there is a reason why it is considered to be one of the 7 Wonders of the World. A beautiful example of Indo-Islamic architecture it is stunning. I highly recommend getting a guide to show you around. Not only are there tons of small",

          "Amazing! I was overwhelmed as the Taj came into view from the entryway. If you find a good guide, they will not only provide historical information, but they\u2019ll know all the cool places to take photos. For me, that was worth it. I traveled from Bangalore to Delhi (while on",

          "Taj Mahal, the wonder created by Shah Jahan is a love saga. As you walk through the doors of this mighty structure, you can feel the emotion. Every woman dreams of the man she loves doing something romantic for her and the Taj Mahal sets the bar really high. A majestic",
          "My husband and I visited the Taj, early morning! We got there around 645am, queued for tickets Rs. 1300 each. Includes water, shoe covers and a tour guide. We declined the tour guide as we just wanted to wander on our own. What an amazing structure with a beautiful story behind",
          "Had a guided tour by a very knowledgeable and friendly guide Taboo, he told us the love story of the Taj Mahal. I loved every moment. It's breathtaking.",
          "Having seen a million photos of the Taj over the years I thought seeing it in person would be slightly underwhelming. How bloody wrong I was! Get there early before the swarms of people arrive. As per the rest of India, do not believe what anyone says outside in regards to",
          "We visited with my family(Wife and 2 kids) on Christmas 2019 and it was awesome to be honest and lived up to expectations. However agra town as such is not clean and needs improvement . Even the train approach to the railway station is so unclean with lots of garbage.",

          "What a magnificent construction made by Emperor Shah Jahan in the love of his wife Mum Taj. Till date one of the most beautiful monument in the world. The Taj dont need more descriptions. A day trip from Delhi is enough for tourist to enjoy the Taj. Just avoid the summers as it",
          "You may see many representations of this place, but none will live up to actually visiting. Waiting for tickets and getting into the place is a scrum, but when inside you can find space, and even without it, serenity.",
          "We were undecided what to do in relation to getting to the car we decided to book a private taxi from Gurgaon rather than take that rather expensive hotel excursion which was basically the same as what we\u2019ve got and we got it for a quarter of the price. We used \u2018South Delhi",
          "Better queue system here, however I got annoyed by the fact that I had to buy and pay an entrance fee as a foreigner! The officials require ID to proof Indian nationality. Otherwise prices are cheaper if you are a student or SAARC National. Buy tickets and get into Taj Mahal as",
          "Considered the most beautiful building in the world, hard to disagree. Built out of love makes it even more stunning. You should take a tour guide and get the \u201chigh value\u201d entrance tickets.",

          "Incredible! A long drive from Delhi but well worth the trip! Crowded but pretty well controlled when we were there. A must see on a trip to India!",
          "This is one of the 8 wonders of the world. It was so beautiful. We were there when the air quality was unsafe and you could barely see the structure - and yet it\u2019s beauty shined through. You need to wear shoe covers while there. You can take as many pictures as you want on the",
          "This is a must see when in India. It is overwhelming and magnificent. The entry process is chaotic as well as the parking. It would be best to have a local guide to get you through all the hawkers and misinformation. Once inside it is just stunning.",
          "Wow What a surreal experience. We visited the Taj at 6.42 (sunrise) We were surprised by how quiet it was, so would reccomend getting up early to try miss the crowds. Pictures and words don't do the Taj justice. If you have the chance you must go",

          "I visited Xmas day and it was enchanting - such a gorgeous calm place, the Taj Mahal exceeded my expectations the gardens and the size of the grounds are wonderful I recommend getting the professional photographer they do a great job especially if you\u2019re traveling alone",
          "Agra will introduce one to the busy-ness and poverty of parts of India. Use a government tour guide, booked ahead, to expedite through lines. They'll provide great tips. However, they'll also direct you to the rug, marble and gem \"museums\" which are really cooperative factories",
          "One of the most amazing sites in the world from an external perspective. We were left a little disappoitnted with inside the mausauliam though as we had no opportunity to explore and felt a little herded like sheep. The grounds get excessively busy at certain times of the day",
          "We were fortunate to have a guide who could provide us the back-story and facts as we walked through the grounds. At his suggestion we also employed a photographer to take shots of the both of us. This is not something I'd normally consider but I'm glad we did. The photographer",

          "Absolutely breathtaking. See while you can as they may stop tourist visits from next year to protect the foundation structures ( due to climate change not visitors). A true monument for love. It is quite indescribable as to it\u2019s beauty. Large crowds, lots of guide and photo",
          "It is a different experience seeing the Taj Mahal 'in real life', as oppose to on a screen. It's so beautiful, try to go as early as you can. A guide can really help you understand the history and context of the site, as well as the practical advantage of skilfully guiding you",
          "Truely one of the wonders of the world. No words can describe the breathless beauty & intricate craftmanship of the monument. Definitely DO NOT MISS.",
          "It's magnificent and beautiful. There will be people around wanting to take photos for you and you will have to pay for it. It\u2019s up to you whether you want it or not. It\u2019s not really that great quality but if you\u2019re traveling alone, then why not.",
          "Although we paid 1300 Rupees to enter the Taj Mahal it was a Majestic. We went at Sunrise. It was nice and empty but foggy. We were pestered to take a guide on numerous occasions. But still something worth seeing. The mausoleum wasn't worth the money though.",
          "Taj one of the 7 wonder is always a dream come true visit. Property is nicely maintained having all sort of facilities required inside",
          "It was worth all the way to get here. Very breathtaking view.. So I went there in the early morning and the queue already quite long. One thing I love in India, they have special line for woman and divided into two with and without bag, so the queue not too long. After",
          "I have visited Taj Mahal four times and everything it looks and throws up some new features. Over the years lot of improvements have happened around Taj. Some useful tips to the visitors from my latest trip are, carry an ID proof, avoid photographers, avoid buying anything, have",

          "It's a feminine Mughal architecture, so well designed and suited as the symbol of love in memory of the beloved Queen. Complementing with the garden and the fountain as well as the love story which makes the site captivating. Unfortunately it is too crowded and noisy to enjoy or",
          "Well enough written about this place. Nothing really prepares you for the first look...You have to see it before you d..... Try to buy tickets online in advance it is very easy. Available with the garden ticket too where a nice photo can be taken especially at sunset. Get unside",

          "We couldn't do the sunrise trip as the fog was so think so we went late morning when it had cleared quite a bit. Yes it was busy, but so beautiful. It's amazing from the outside but rather underwhelming inside, but still worth a look.",
          "Giving this 5 stars because this truly is a magnificent and awe-inspiring structure, however be prepared to overcome some hurdles to get there. Finding where to buy entrance tickets is not simple. You have to get to Shilpgram (where the ticket office used to be) and now to board",
          "Have been visiting the wonder of the world for many years. Taj looks exquisite now. Have not seen the Marble shine so much and it\u2019s white now. While the over all management of the crowds inside the monument has improved , the selling of tickets , security check , cloak rooms",
          "The crowds this winter evening were overwhelming. But the Taj itself compensated well for this. We were there at sunset with the thinning crowds and were rewarded with emptying grounds.",

          "No photo by any camera in world can give you the real feeling of visiting Taj mahal in person. Its grand, its beautiful. Its symmetric. Its based on layout of Heaven (Jannat) Its a architectural masterpiece. and Its FLOATING...... on wooden platform over 180 wells taking water",
          "The entrance to the site was not accessible by car, so we took an exciting ride on a tuk tuk (which was slightly hit by the car behind when the driver stopped too quickly!) then a short walk towards the north gate, which opened up to a stunning view of the Taj Mahal. I got a",
          "My review is based not on the building and structure, yes, it was built by a silly king for a wife that he loved..bla bla bla on the love stuff of the yesteryears. It was breathtaking for a minute and then I could smell BO, urine etc etc on the outskirts of the building. Hoards",
          "Taj mahal very beautiful place to visit. This is also religion tour especially for moslem. Enjoy Taj Mahal.",

          "What an incredible experience to see this architectural landmark! Went in the evening which was great because the sunset made the white marble glow pink. We were also fortunate to have a pretty clear day on which to see the Taj Mahal (the next day had lessened visibility).",
          "Beautiful! Not so many people in early morning, you may come and buy tickets by yourself, just around 10-20 peoples in line. Save your time and extra cost on those express tickets mentioned on internet.",

          "I visited the Taj Mahal on Dec 1st 2019 in a small group tour of Rajasthan. There are no words to fully express this amazing place. Nothing I had ever read or seen about it (or India) came anywhere near this experience of actually being at this place. Regardless of your beliefs",
          "Standing out, tall and pristine, milky white, on the banks of the river Yamuna, the Taj Mahal is a tribute and monument to the love Shah Jahan had for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. This white marble architectural marvel is known for its symmetry standing amid the water ways casting its",

          "We woke up at 6:00 am to make our way to the Taj Mahal at 6:30, still a bit dark, goofy and polluted. It was worth getting there early and have the early morning view of this magnificent architectural structure. Avoid any and all so called \u201cGovernment approved guides\u201d Do some",

          "The Taj is much more impressive outside than inside. The inside ceiling is very low compared to the actual height of the dome. Super crowded of course but probably the only reason you're in Agra. In March it was already very very hot.",
          "Tourists come to Agra with one purpose - to see Taj Mahal. With all those fairy tale love story and amazing documentary of the monument, people's desire and expectation to see the Taj are rocket high. We visited Taj in early December. In terms of weather, the temperature (16",

          "A highly underrated wonder, a master piece that every person should see. I had lesser expectations honestly, but once you see it, the sheer beauty of the Taj will mesmerise you. What could get better surely, is the way tourists are managed, given the huge potential it has, the",

          "A great guide who knew all the history made it a fascinating story. A monument which signifies a great love story. Beautiful artistry and symmetry. Nothing compares. India has amazing buildings and temples which go back to the 12th century. It is really worth a visit. Much",

          "Despite the cold and the smog, the Taj is a truly amazing place to visit. Do your research first as ticket prices vary depending on whether you're a local or foreigner. We bought foreigner tickets online which made it easier to enter. This also gave us shoe covers and two",
          "We came early at 8am and successfully avoided the crowds. After 10am it starts being a lot busier. Entry is a bit on the pricey side (1300 INR), but then again there is only one Taj Mahal in the world :) Two hours are more than enough to see the entire complex.",
          "Picturesque! Such an iconic landmark so beautiful you are lost for words! Not too crowded which made it even better. There is some people that go around and try and get paid for taking photos of you though, the only downfall",
          "Definitely worth seeing, such a beautiful monument which is very well maintained. For foreign tourists the price is 1300 rupees each. This includes shoe covers (shoes must be covered to walk on the Taj Mahal) and water bottle (both picked up from nearby table). Don\u2019t trust",
          "They do say it\u2019s the 7 wonders of the world, personally I was amazed when I saw this up close and personal, after travelling with the group of friends from India to show us around.

          "A visit to the Taj Mahal is on many a bucket list. Is it as splendid as we imagine? More so. A trip to India must include a visit to the Taj Mahal. It is easier to visit if it is included in a Golden Triangle tour. Here is the rub though. This would mean staying over in Agra.",
          "No comments are really needed. There are lots of people, but what would you expect about one of the world wonders?",
          "The Taj Mahal was on my bucket list so I was so excited to visit in person. On arrival in Agrar we couldn't see a metre in front of us due to the smog . The dawn rising was postponed with a 0930 arrival in the hope of getting in earlier than than the mobs but late enough to see",
          "Loved the experience at the monument per se, one to be for ever cherished. I just have a comment regarding the bathroom at the gate where the tickets are bought. The hygienic conditions were really bad, dirty floors, and the smell was awful. It would help if this is taken care",
          "Booked the 6am entry online (in winter it opens at dawn but th crowd at 6:35 was ok. Yes it is a tourist \u201cmust do\u201d, but it really is fabulous. The organisation is v good. The crowds and selfie-takers are everywhere but there you go.",

          "We were fortunate that when we visited the sun shone and we had a wonderful guide. The Taj was not too busy actually, the place was clean and indeed the building itself is very impressive. Glad to have been able to tick this off our bucket list!",
          "I took a day trip to Agra from Jaipur with Rajasthan Discovery. I had read some reviews stating that the city of Agra was not really nice. In fact, it is located halfway between Delhi and Jaipur and c. 3 1/2 h drive, so I chose Jaipur for my base. The drive was pretty intense -",
          "We arrived in the morning when the Taj was covered in thick dense fog. By the time we left her beauty was revealed like lifting a vail. The beauty of the Taj is really mesmerizing. The story as told by the guide is alluring just like the majestic Taj Mahal. The crowds include",
          "I was on a business trip in Mathura and was encouraged by my colleagues to visit the Taj Mahal since it\u2019s only few kilometers away. They even provided me with a guide, and grabbing the opportunity was definitely a good decision on my part. Being a foreigner, I have to pay 1,300",
          "We visited in early November & although it is a spectacular site it was spoilt by not seeing in it's true splendor with the sun shining on it in fact we never did see the sunshine all day. Do not be put off visiting the Taj Mahal if you the weather is going to be bad it's",
          "Such a popular destination that it\u2019s hard sometimes to be stunned but had a good guide and really enjoyed the visit. Hard to put the design perfection into words. While the place is always filled w tourists, it seems manageable and you can still find the slots for that must",

          "Do your research before you go. We entered by East Gate which I hear is the most quiet entrance. Go first thing in the morning, rug up and embrace the cold weather because then will be the fewest crowds. Explore the gardens and take photos from every angle. There are amazing",
          "Definitely worth a visit but check if you go make sure you check the weather! I arrived @ 6am with a guide and could not visualise ANYTHING! It was a bit of a joke, so CHECK!",
          "The Taj Mahal is one of those places that you read about in books and imagine what it must be like to visit. It was more than I could ever imagine. The size and shape of the white marble structure is amazing to witness, allowing you to pause and sit and just take in the",
          "Truly breathtaking and completely awestruck by its beauty. From the moment I saw it and till I came out of it, I was engrossed to it. Classic example of Mughal architecture and you can see tinge of Iranian and Turkish architecture too. Must Visit :-)",
          "An iconic building that must be seen once, but I am not sure the experience is worth a second visit. The building itself is beautiful, but understand that depending upon the time of day you visit, the site will be very, very crowded. Like most tourist groups we were forced to",
          "Stunning. Be aware that at this time of year haze/fog can mean that sunset/sunrise are not at all spectacular. We went at 3pm and had lovely light.",

          "A bucket list visit although part of a spiritual tour. It was a pity there was so much smoke etc but that I think is part of a winter visit. An interesting place with some great history non your own you may be able to explore that at greater Leisure",
          "Okay, so this is an iconic structure and from a distance is magnificent. We had a guide to take us around, which is just as well, because there is no information (literally no information) anywhere within the boundaries of the Taj Mahal. If we hadn't had a guide, or not done any",
          "Very crowded in Dec, due to their 15 days public holidays. Keep close when you go in a group! Need a proper guide to tell the story of Taj Mahal & take you with good story of its beautiful things on it. It was made by various religion from many countries. Show how the people",
          "After many years of traveling to India for work, I FINALLY got to see the Taj Mahal. The timing was perfect - weather not too hot, a slight breeze, not overly crowded. It was truly an inspiring site. We had an amazing tour guide - his name was \"PC\". He knew so much history and",
          "We hired a guide which turned out to be the best thing we did. He knew where to take the best photos, was very informative etc. Guide only asked for 300R but we have him 1000R as he did such a great job. Queued a while at the East Gates to get tickets. We didn\u2019t go for sunrise",

          "In a similar style to other Moghul tombs like Humayan\u2019s or Safdarjung\u2019s in Delhi but now completed in white marble rather than red sandstone this is the Taj Mahal, the most beautiful building in the world. And that opinion doesn't change after a visit eight years ago, it is",
          "What an incredible monument. Breathtakingly beautiful, we visited the Taj at sunrise which was an ideal time. Although busy, there was still plenty of room to leisurely wander the grounds admiring this staggering piece of architecture. It was worth the days of travel to",
          "I traveled for 13 hours just to see Taj Mahal for few hours and travel again for another 5h. So worth it!!!",

        "wiki": "The Taj Mahal (; lit.\u2009'Crown of the Palace', [ta\u02d0d\u0292 \u02c8m\u025b\u02d0\u0266(\u0259)l]) is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna  in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\nConstruction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $916 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.\nThe Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7\u20138 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000\u20132007) initiative.\n\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum. Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later. The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.\n\n\n== Architecture and design ==\n\nThe Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand), Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.\n\n\n=== Tomb ===\nThe tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Persian in origin.The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.\n\nThe most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical \"drum\" it sits on, which is approximately 7 metres (23 ft) high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud (guava dome). The top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed chattris (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The dome is slightly asymmetrical. Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative spires (guldastas) extend from edges of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas. The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded finial which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century. This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements. The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minarets\u2014 a traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.\n\n\n=== Exterior decorations ===\nThe exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs.\nThroughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.The calligraphy on the Great Gate reads \"O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you.\" The calligraphy was created in 1609 by a calligrapher named Abdul Haq. Shah Jahan conferred the title of \"Amanat Khan\" upon him as a reward for his \"dazzling virtuosity.\" Near the lines from the Qur'an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription, \"Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi.\" Much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble inlaid in white marble panels. Higher panels are written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below. The calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate.Abstract forms are used throughout, especially in the plinth, minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab and, to a lesser extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex array of geometric patterns. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns.On the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.\n\n\n=== Interior decoration ===\nThe interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones. The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are topped by a \"false\" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall. The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or jali cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. The octagonal marble screen or jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers. Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect, in little detail, the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex.\n\nMuslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves. Hence, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right, towards Mecca. Mumtaz Mahal's cenotaph is placed at the precise centre of the inner chamber on a rectangular marble base of 1.5 by 2.5 metres (4 ft 11 in by 8 ft 2 in). Both the base and casket are elaborately inlaid with precious and semiprecious gems. Calligraphic inscriptions on the casket identify and praise Mumtaz. On the lid of the casket is a raised rectangular lozenge meant to suggest a writing tablet. Shah Jahan's cenotaph is beside Mumtaz's to the western side and is the only visible asymmetric element in the entire complex. His cenotaph is bigger than his wife's, but reflects the same elements: a larger casket on a slightly taller base precisely decorated with lapidary and calligraphy that identifies him. On the lid of the casket is a traditional sculpture of a small pen box.The pen box and writing tablet are traditional Mughal funerary icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively. The Ninety Nine Names of God are calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Other inscriptions inside the crypt include, \"O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious... \". The tomb of Shah Jahan bears a calligraphic inscription that reads; \"He travelled from this world to the banquet-hall of Eternity on the night of the twenty-sixth of the month of Rajab, in the year 1076 Hijri.\"\n\n\n=== Garden ===\n\nThe complex is set around a large 300-metre (980 ft) square charbagh or Mughal garden.\nThe garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four-quarters of the garden into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble water tank with a reflecting pool positioned on a north-south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum. The elevated marble water tank is called al Hawd al-Kawthar in reference to the \"Tank of Abundance\" promised to Muhammad.Elsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees labeled according to common and scientific names and fountains. The charbagh garden, a design inspired by Persian gardens, was introduced to India by Babur, the first Mughal emperor. It symbolises the four flowing rivers of Jannah (Paradise) and reflects the Paradise garden derived from the Persian paridaeza, meaning 'walled garden.' In mystic Islamic texts of the Mughal period, Paradise is described as an ideal garden of abundance with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain, separating the garden into north, west, south and east.Most Mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the centre. The Taj Mahal garden is unusual in that the main element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden. With the discovery of Mahtab Bagh or \"Moonlight Garden\" on the other side of the Yamuna, the interpretation of the Archaeological Survey of India is that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden's design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of Paradise. Similarities in layout and architectural features with the Shalimar Gardens suggests both gardens may have been designed by the same architect, Ali Mardan. Early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation, including abundant roses, daffodils, and fruit trees. As the Mughal Empire declined, the Taj Mahal and its gardens also declined. By the end of the 19th century, the British Empire controlled more than three-fifths of India, and assumed management of the Taj Mahal. They changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London.\n\n\n=== Outlying buildings ===\n\nThe Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls; the side facing the river is open. Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan's other wives, and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favourite servant.The main gateway (darwaza) is a monumental structure built primarily of marble, and reminiscent of the Mughal architecture of earlier emperors. Its archways mirror the shape of the tomb's archways, and its pishtaq arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb. The vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the complex.At the far end of the complex are two grand red sandstone buildings that mirror each other, and face the sides of the tomb. The backs of the buildings parallel the western and eastern walls. The western building is a mosque and the other is the jawab (answer), thought to have been constructed for architectural balance although it may have been used as a guesthouse. Distinctions between the two buildings include the jawab's lack of a mihrab (a niche in a mosque's wall facing Mecca), and its floors of geometric design whereas the floor of the mosque is laid with outlines of 569 prayer rugs in black marble. The mosque's basic design of a long hall surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by Shah Jahan, particularly the Masjid-i Jah\u0101n-Num\u0101, or Jama Masjid, Delhi. The Mughal mosques of this period divide the sanctuary hall into three areas comprising a main sanctuary and slightly smaller sanctuaries on either side. At the Taj Mahal, each sanctuary opens onto an expansive vaulting dome. The outlying buildings were completed in 1643.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land. An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above riverbank. In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials. It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal. The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight. A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons. An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a series of purs, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.The plinth and tomb took roughly 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on \"completion\". Construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by 1643 while work on the outlying buildings continued for years. Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost at the time has been estimated to be about 32 million Indian rupees, which is around 52.8 billion Indian rupees ($827 million US) based on 2015 values.\n\n\n== Later days ==\nAbdul Hamid Lahauri in his book Badshahnama refers to Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara (Perso-Arabic: \u0631\u0648\u0636\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0647 rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.\nSoon after the Taj Mahal's completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at nearby Agra Fort. Upon Shah Jahan's death, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife. In the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur invaded Agra and attacked the Taj Mahal, the two chandeliers, one of agate and another of silver, which were hung over the main cenotaph, were taken away by them, along with the gold and silver screen. Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15 ft) finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoliation.By the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair. During the time of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Taj Mahal was defaced by British soldiers and government officials, who chiselled out precious stones and lapis lazuli from its walls. At the end of the 19th century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908. He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber, modelled after one in a Cairo mosque. During this time the garden was remodelled with British-style lawns that are still in place today.\n\n\n== Threats ==\n\nIn 1942, the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force. During the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots.More recent threats have come from environmental pollution on the banks of the Yamuna River including acid rain due to the Mathura Oil Refinery, which was opposed by Supreme Court of India directives. The pollution has been turning the Taj Mahal yellow-brown. To help control the pollution, the Indian government has set up the \"Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ)\", a 10,400-square-kilometre (4,000 sq mi) area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place.Concerns for the tomb's structural integrity have recently been raised because of a decline in the groundwater level in the Yamuna river basin which is falling at a rate of around 1.5 m (5 ft) per year. In 2010, cracks appeared in parts of the tomb, and the minarets which surround the monument were showing signs of tilting, as the wooden foundation of the tomb may be rotting due to lack of water. It has been pointed out by politicians, however, that the minarets are designed to tilt slightly outwards to prevent them from crashing on top of the tomb in the event of an earthquake. In 2011, it was reported that some predictions indicated that the tomb could collapse within five years.Small minarets located at two of the outlying buildings were reported as damaged by a storm on April 11, 2018. On 31 May 2020 another fierce thunderstorm caused some damage to the complex.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe Taj Mahal attracts a large number of tourists. UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001, which had increased to about 7\u20138 million in 2014. A two-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and a more expensive one for foreigners. In 2018, the fee for Indian citizens was 50 INR, for foreign tourists 1,100 INR. Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre. In 2019, in order to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.The small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers. Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes.The grounds are open from 06:00 to 19:00 weekdays, except for Friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between 12:00 and 14:00. The complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after, excluding Fridays and the month of Ramadan.\nForeign dignitaries often visit the Taj Mahal on trips to India. Notable figures who have travelled to the site include Dwight Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, George Harrison, Barack and Michelle Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, Vladimir Putin, Princess Diana and Donald Trump.\n\n\n== Myths ==\n\nEver since its construction, the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument. A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river. The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveller who visited Agra in 1665. It was suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built. Ruins of blackened marble across the river in Moonlight Garden, Mahtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend. However, excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discoloured white stones that had turned black. A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Moonlight Garden. A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.Warrior Empire: The Mughals of India. A+E Television Network. 2006.No evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb. Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design. Similar claims are made for many famous buildings. No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck's biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck's fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.Another myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth. To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.In 2000, India's Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak's petition to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal. In 2005 a similar petition was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court. This case was brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher who says that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu King Parmar Dev in 1196.A theory that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work Itinerario, (The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629\u20131643). Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nAs of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by P. N.  Oak's theory. In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple. Bharatiya Janata Party's Vinay Katiyar in 2017 claimed that the 17th century monument was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after destroying a Hindu temple called \"Tejo Mahalaya\" and it housed a Shiva linga. This claim had also been made by another BJP member Laxmikant Bajpai in 2014. The BJP government's union minister of culture Mahesh Sharma stated in November 2015 during a session of the parliament, that there was no evidence that it was a temple. The theories about Taj Mahal being a Shiva temple started circulating when Oak released his 1989 book \"Taj Mahal: The True Story\". He claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century, as stated by the ASI. Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan stated Taj might be destroyed like Babri Masjid as people believed there was a temple there. Katiyar called for the demolition of the Taj and its replacement by a temple in February 2018. In response Indian National Congress MP Shashi Tharoor called him a troglodyte.A controversy was created in 2017 when the Uttar Pradesh government did not include it in its official tourism booklet \"Uttar Pradesh Tourism - Unlimited Possibilities\". The chief minister Yogi Adityanath had earlier claimed it does not represent Indian culture. Amidst this controversy, BJP MLA Sangeet Som had claimed that the those who built the Taj Mahal were traitors and it was a \"blot\" on the country's culture. He claimed it was built by a man who jailed his own father and wished to kill Hindus. BJP MP Anshul Verma supported his comments. AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference leader Omar Abdullah and Azam Khan criticised him. CM Adityanath stated Som's comments were personal and the government will focus on the tourism potential of every monument.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nTaj Mahal\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nWonders of the World\nNew7Wonders of the World\nArchitecture of India\nFatehpur Sikri, a nearby city and World Heritage Site\nBibi Ka Maqbara, a similar building in the Deccan, Aurangabad\nTaj Mahal replicas and derivatives\nInside, a 1968 new-age music album recorded in the building\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Taj Mahal at Wikimedia Commons\n Quotations related to Taj Mahal at Wikiquote\n Taj Mahal travel guide from Wikivoyage\nOfficial website of the Taj Mahal\nDescription of the Taj Mahal at the Archaeological Survey of India\nProfile of the Taj Mahal at UNESCO",

        "wiki": "Agra ( (listen)) is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is 206 kilometres (128 mi) south of the national capital New Delhi. Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh and 24th in India.It has been speculated that in Mahabharata the city Agra is referred to as Agravana which translates as \u201cfront of the forest\u201d. It is mentioned that the Shurasena dynasty of Lord Krishna maintained an outpost at Agravana. Greek geographer Ptolemy referred to Agra by its modern name in his Geographia and placed it in his world map in 2nd century AD. The 11th-century Persian poet Mas'\u016bd Sa'd Salm\u0101n writes of an assault on the fortress of Agra, then held by King Jaypal, by Mahmud of Ghazni. Despite his surrender, Mahmud sacked the place. It was mentioned in 1080 AD when a Ghaznavide force captured it. A 17th century chronicle called the Agra before Sikandar Lod\u012b's time (1488\u20131517) as an old settlement which was merely a village, owing to its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sikandar was the first sultan to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1504, its administration having previously been under Bayana. He governed the country from here and Agra assumed the importance of the second capital. He died in 1517 and his son, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b, remained in power there for nine more years. Several palaces, wells, and a mosque were built by him in the fort during his period. He was finally defeated at the Battle of Panipat in 1526. Between 1540 and 1556, Afghans, beginning with Sher Shah Suri, ruled the area. It was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1648. The city was later taken by the Marathas and later still fell to the British Raj.\nAgra is a major tourist destination because of its many Mughal-era buildings, most notably the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur; and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with Lucknow and Varanasi. Agra is in the Braj cultural region.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nAgra features a semiarid climate that borders on a humid subtropical climate. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season. However, the monsoons, though substantial in Agra, are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India. This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a humid subtropical climate.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nAs of 2011 India census, Agra city has a population of 1,585,704, while the population of Agra cantonment is 53,053. The urban agglomeration of Agra has a population of 1,760,285. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Agra city has an average literacy rate of 73%, below the national average of 74%. Literacy rate of males is considerably higher than that of women. The sex ratio in the city was 875 females per thousand males while child sex ratio stood at 857. Agra district literacy rate is 62.56%.According to the 2011 census, Agra district has a population of 4,380,793, roughly equal to the nation of Moldova or the US state of Kentucky. This gives it a ranking of 41st in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of 1,084 inhabitants per square kilometre (2,810/sq mi) .\n52.5% of Agra's population is in the 15\u201359 years age category. Around 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nHindus are 88.8% while Muslims are 9.3% of the population in Agra district. Hinduism, Islam and Jainism are the major religions in Agra city with 80.7%, 15.4% and 1.0% of the population adhering to them; others are 2.9%. The Catholic minority is served by its own Metropolitan Archdiocese of Agra.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval era ===\nMasud Sa'd Salman claims to have been there when Mahmud assaulted Agra, claiming the Raja Japal surrendered after seeing a nightmare. Mahmud however proceeds to pillage the city. The history of the city before the Muslim conquerors is unclear. The 17th century chronicler named Abdhullah said it was a village before the reign of Sikandar Lodi. The king of Mathura had used the Agra fort as a jail. The degradation in the status of the site was a result of the destruction brought upon it by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sultan Sikandar Lod\u012b, the Muslim ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, shifted his capital to Agra in the year 1504. Before this, it was under the lordship of Bayana. After the Sultan's death, the city passed on to his son, Sultan Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b. He ruled his Sultanate from Agra until he fell fighting to Mughal Badshah B\u0101bar in the First battle of Panipat fought in 1526.\n\n\n=== Mughal era ===\n\nThe golden age of the city began with the Mughals. Previously known as Akbarab\u0101d, Agra was the capital of the Mughal Empire under the Badshahs Akbar, Jah\u0101ng\u012br and Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. Akbar made it the eponymous seat of one of his original twelve subahs (imperial top-level provinces), bordering (Old) Delhi, Awadh (Oudh), Allahabad, Malwa and Ajmer subahs. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted his capital to Sh\u0101hjah\u0101nab\u0101d in the year 1648.Since Akbarab\u0101d was one of the most important cities in India under the Mughals, it witnessed a lot of building activity. Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of the river Yamuna. The garden is called the Ar\u0101m B\u0101gh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson Akbar the Great raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarab\u0101d called Fatehpur Sikri. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.\n\nHis son Jah\u0101ng\u012br had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort or L\u0101l Qil'a. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Akbarab\u0101d its most prized monument, the Taj Mahal. Built in loving memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, the mausoleum was completed in 1653.\nSh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted the capital to Delhi during his reign, but his son Aurangzeb moved the capital back to Akbarab\u0101d, usurping his father and imprisoning him in the Fort there.\n\n\n=== Later periods ===\nThe Jat kingdom of Bharatpur waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra.After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of Marathas and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the British Raj in 1803.\n\nIn 1835 when the Presidency of Agra was established by the British, the city became the seat of government, and just two years later it was witness to the Agra famine of 1837\u201338. During the Indian rebellion of 1857 British rule across India was threatened, news of the rebellion had reached Agra on 11 May and on 30 May two companies of native infantry, the 44th and 67th regiments, rebelled and marched to Delhi. The next morning native Indian troops in Agra were forced to disarm, on 15 June Gwalior (which lies south of Agra) rebelled. By 3 July, the British were forced to withdraw into the fort. Two days later a small British force at Sucheta were defeated and forced to withdraw, this led to a mob sacking the city. However, the rebels moved onto Delhi which allowed the British to restore order by 8 July. Delhi fell to the British in September, the following month rebels who had fled Delhi along with rebels from Central India marched on Agra but were defeated. After this British rule was again secured over the city until the independence of India in 1947.\n\n\n=== Legacies ===\nAgra is the birthplace of the religion known as D\u012bn-i Il\u0101h\u012b, which flourished during the reign of Akbar and also of the Radhaswami Faith, which has around two million followers worldwide. Agra has historic linkages with Shauripur of Jainism and Runukta of Hinduism, of 1000 BC. The Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri are all UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n== Administration and politics ==\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\n\n==== General administration ====\nAgra division which consists of four districts, and is headed by the divisional commissioner of Agra, who is an IAS officer, the commissioner is the head of local government institutions (including municipal corporations) in the division, is in charge of infrastructure development in his division, and is also responsible for maintaining law and order in the division.

Agra is commonly identified as the \"City of Taj\".Completed in 1653, the Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal king Shah Jahan as the final resting place for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Finished in marble, it is one of India's many beautiful monuments and is set amidst landscaped gardens. Built by the Persian architect, Ust\u0101d '\u012as\u0101, the Taj Mahal is on the south bank of the Yamuna River. It can be observed from Agra Fort from where Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n gazed at it for the last eight years of his life, a prisoner of his son Aurangzeb. Verses of the Quran are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are 22 small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Taj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant dome of the Taj Mahal has a diameter of 60 feet (18 m), and rises to a height of 80 feet (24 m); directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Shah Jah\u0101n's tomb was erected next to hers by his son Aurangzeb. The interiors are decorated with fine inlay work, incorporating semi-precious stones.\n\n\n=== Agra Fort ===\n\nAgra Fort (sometimes called the Red Fort), was commissioned by the conquering Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great in 1565, and is another of Agra's World Heritage Sites.

The red sandstone fort was converted into a palace during Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's time, and reworked extensively with marble and pietra dura inlay. Notable buildings in the fort include the Pearl Mosque or Mot\u012b Masjid, the D\u012bw\u0101n-e-'\u0100m and D\u012bw\u0101n-e-Kh\u0101s (halls of public and private audience), Jah\u0101ng\u012br's Palace, Kh\u0101s Mahal, Sh\u012bsh Mahal (mirrored palace), and the Musamman Burj.The forbidding exteriors of this fort conceal an inner paradise. The fort is crescent-shaped, flattened on the east with a long, nearly straight wall facing the river. It has a total perimeter of 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi), and is ringed by double castellated ramparts of red sandstone punctuated at regular intervals by bastions. A moat 9 metres (30 ft) wide and 10 metres (33 ft) deep surrounds the outer wall.\nChhatrapati Sh\u012bvaj\u012b visited the Agra Fort, as a result of the conditions of the Treaty of Purandar entered into with Mirz\u0101 R\u0101j\u0101 Jaisingh to meet Aurangzeb in the D\u012bw\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101s (Special Audience Chamber). In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. An insulted Sh\u012bvaj\u012b stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666. Fearing the dungeons and execution he escaped on 17 August 1666.The fort is a typical example of Mughal architecture, effectively showing how the North Indian style of fort construction differed from that of the South.

Then the Mughal Emperor Akbar wanted to make Fatehpur Sikri his headquarters, so he built a majestic fort; due to the shortage of water, however, he had to ultimately move his headquarters to Agra Fort.\nBuland Darw\u0101za or 'the lofty gateway' was built by the great Mughal emperor, Akbar in 1601 CE. at Fatehpur Sikri.

        "wiki": "Ram Prasad Bismil pronunciation  (11 June 1897 \u2013 19 December 1927) was an Indian revolutionary who participated in Mainpuri conspiracy of 1918, and the Kakori conspiracy of 1925, and struggled against British imperialism. As well as being a freedom fighter, he was a patriotic poet and wrote in Hindi and Urdu using the pen names Ram, Agyat and Bismil. But, he became popular with the last name \"Bismil\" only. He was associated with Arya Samaj where he got inspiration from Satyarth Prakash, a book written by Swami Dayanand Saraswati. He also had a confidential connection with Lala Har Dayal through his guru Swami Somdev, a preacher of Arya Samaj.\nBismil was one of the founding members of the revolutionary organisation Hindustan Republican Association. Bhagat Singh praised him as a great poet-writer of Urdu and Hindi, who had also translated the books Catherine from English and Bolshevikon Ki Kartoot from Bengali.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRam Prasad Bismil was born on 11 June 1897 at Shahjahanpur, in North-Western Provinces, British India. He learned Hindi from his father at home and was sent to learn Urdu from a moulvi. He was admitted to an English-language school, despite his father's disapproval, and also joined the Arya Samaj in Shahjahanpur. Bismil showed a talent for writing patriotic poetry.\n\n\n=== Contact with Somdev ===\nAs an 18-year-old student, Bismil read of the death sentence passed on Bhai Parmanand, a scholar and companion of Har Dayal. At that time he was regularly attending the Arya Samaj Temple at Shahjahanpur daily, where Swami Somdev, a friend of Paramanand, was staying. Angered by the sentence, Bismil composed a poem in Hindi titled Mera Janm (en: My Birth), which he showed to Somdev. This poem demonstrated a commitment to remove the British control over India.\n\n\n=== Lucknow Congress ===\nBismil left school in the following year and travelled to Lucknow with some friends. The Naram Dal (of the Indian National Congress) was not prepared to allow the Garam Dal to stage a grand welcome of Tilak in the city. They organised a group of youths and decided to publish a book in Hindi on the history of American independence, America Ki Swatantrata Ka Itihas, with the consent of Somdev. This book was published under the authorship of the fictitious Babu Harivans Sahai and its publisher's name was given as Somdev Siddhgopal Shukla. As soon as the book was published, the government of Uttar Pradesh proscribed its circulation within the state.\n\n\n== Mainpuri conspiracy ==\nBismil formed a revolutionary organisation called Matrivedi (Altar of Motherland) and contacted Genda Lal Dixit, a school teacher at Auraiya. Somdev arranged this, knowing that Bismil could be more effective in his mission if he had experienced people to support him. Dixit had contacts with some powerful dacoits of the state. Dixit wanted to utilise their power in the armed struggle against the British rulers. Like Bismil, Dixit had also formed an armed organisation of youths called Shivaji Samiti (named after Shivaji Maharaj). The pair organised youths from the Etawah, Mainpuri, Agra and Shahjahanpur districts of United Province (now Uttar Pradesh) to strengthen their organisations.On 28 January 1918, Bismil published a pamphlet titled Deshvasiyon Ke Nam Sandesh (A Message to Countrymen), which he distributed along with his poem Mainpuri Ki Pratigya (Vow of Mainpuri). To collect funds for the party looting was undertaken on three occasions in 1918. Police searched for them in and around Mainpuri while they were selling books proscribed by the U.P. Government in the Delhi Congress of 1918. When police found them, Bismil absconded with the books unsold. When he was planning another looting between Delhi and Agra, a police team arrived and firing started from both the sides. Bismil jumped into the Yamuna and swam underwater. The police and his companions thought that he had died in the encounter. Dixit was arrested along with his other companions and was kept in Agra fort. From here, he fled to Delhi and lived in hiding. A criminal case was filed against them. The incident is known as the \"Mainpuri Conspiracy\". On 1 November 1919 the Judiciary Magistrate of Mainpuri B. S. Chris announced the judgement against all accused and declared Dixit and Bismil as absconders.\n\n\n== Underground activities ==\nFrom 1919 to 1920 Bismil remained inconspicuous, moving around various villages in Uttar Pradesh and producing several books. Among these was a collection of poems written by him and others, entitled Man Ki Lahar, while he also translated two works from Bengali (Bolshevikon Ki Kartoot and Yogik Sadhan) and fabricated Catherine or Swadhinta Ki Devi from an English text. He got all these books published through his own resources under Sushilmala \u2013 a series of publications except one Yogik Sadhan which was given to a publisher who absconded and could not be traced. These books have since been found. Another of Bismil's books, Kranti Geetanjali, was published in 1929 after his death and was proscribed by British Raj in 1931.\n\n\n== Formation of Hindustan Republican Association ==\nIn February 1920, when all the prisoners in the Mainpuri conspiracy case were freed, Bismil returned home to Shahjahanpur, where he agreed with the official authorities that he would not participate in revolutionary activities. This statement of Ram Prasad was also recorded in vernacular before the court.In 1921, Bismil was among the many people from Shahjahanpur who attended the Ahmedabad Congress. He had a seat on the dias, along with the senior congressman Prem Krishna Khanna, and the revolutionary Ashfaqulla Khan. Bismil played an active role in the Congress with Maulana Hasrat Mohani and got the most debated proposal of Poorna Swaraj passed in the General Body meeting of Congress. Mohandas K. Gandhi, who was not in the favour of this proposal became quite helpless before the overwhelming demand of youths. He returned to Shahjahanpur and mobilised the youths of United Province for non-co-operation with the Government. The people of U.P. were so much influenced by the furious speeches and verses of Bismil that they became hostile against British Raj. As per statement of Banarsi Lal (approver) made in the court \u2013 \"Ram Prasad used to say that independence would not be achieved by means of non-violence.\"\nIn February 1922 some agitating farmers were killed in Chauri Chaura by the police. The police station of Chauri Chaura was attacked by the people and 22 policemen were burnt alive. Gandhi, without ascertaining the facts behind this incident, declared an immediate stop the non-co-operation movement without consulting any executive committee member of the Congress. Bismil and his group of youths strongly opposed Gandhi in the Gaya session of Indian National Congress (1922). When Gandhi refused to rescind his decision, its then-president Chittranjan Das resigned. In January 1923, the rich group of party formed a new Swaraj Party under the joint leadership of Moti Lal Nehru and Chittranjan Das, and the youth group formed a revolutionary party under the leadership of Bismil.\n\n\n== Yellow Paper constitution ==\nWith the consent of Lala Har Dayal, Bismil went to Allahabad where he drafted the constitution of the party in 1923 with the help of Sachindra Nath Sanyal and another revolutionary of Bengal, Dr. Jadugopal Mukherjee. The basic name and aims of the organisation were typed on a Yellow Paper and later on a subsequent Constitutional Committee Meeting was conducted on 3 October 1924 at Cawnpore in U.P. under the Chairmanship of Sachindra Nath Sanyal.\nThis meeting decided the name of the party would be the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA). After a long discussion from others Bismil was declared there the District Organiser of Shahjahanpur and Chief of Arms Division. An additional responsibility of Provincial Organiser of United Province (Agra and Oudh) was also entrusted to him. Sachindra Nath Sanyal, was unanimously nominated as National Organiser and another senior member Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee, was given the responsibility of Coordinator, Anushilan Samiti. After attending the meeting in Kanpur, both Sanyal and Chatterjee left the U.P. and proceeded to Bengal for further extension of the organisation.\n\n\n== Manifesto of H.R.A. ==\n\nA pamphlet entitled as The Revolutionary was distributed throughout the United Province in India about the end of January 1925. Copies of this leaflet, referred to in the evidence as the \"White Leaflet\", were also found with some other alleged conspirators of Kakori Conspiracy as per judgement of the Chief Court of Oudh. A typed copy of this manifesto was found with Manmath Nath Gupta. It was nothing but the Manifesto of H.R.A. in the form of a four paged printed pamphlet on white paper which was circulated secretly by post and by hands in most of the districts of United Province and other parts of India.\nThis pamphlet bore no name of the printing press. The heading of the pamphlet was: \"The Revolutionary\" (An Organ of the Revolutionary Party of India). It was given 1st number and 1st issue of the publication. The date of its publication was given as 1 January 1925.\n\n\n== Kakori conspiracy ==\nBismil executed a meticulous plan for looting the government treasury carried in a train at Kakori, near Lucknow in U.P. This historical event happened on 9 August 1925 and is known as the Kakori conspiracy. Ten revolutionaries stopped the 8 Down Saharanpur-Lucknow passenger train at Kakori \u2013 a station just before the Lucknow Railway Junction. German-made Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistols were used in this action. Ashfaqulla Khan, the lieutenant of the HRA Chief Ram Prasad Bismil gave away his Mauser to Manmath Nath Gupta and engaged himself to break open the cash chest. Eagerly watching a new weapon in his hand, Manmath Nath Gupta fired the pistol and accidentally shot and killed passenger Ahmed Ali, who had gotten down from the train to see his wife in the ladies compartment.\nMore than 40 revolutionaries were arrested whereas only 10 persons had taken part in the decoity. Persons completely unrelated to the incident were also captured. However some of them were let off. The government-appointed Jagat Narain Mulla as public prosecutor at an incredible fee. Dr. Harkaran Nath Mishra (Barrister M.L.A.) and Dr. Mohan Lal Saxena (M.L.C.) were appointed as defence counsel. The defence committee was also formed to defend the accused. Govind Ballabh Pant, Chandra Bhanu Gupta and Kripa Shankar Hajela defended their case. The men were found guilty and subsequent appeals failed. On 16 September 1927, a final appeal for clemency was forwarded to the Privy Council in London but that also failed.\nFollowing 18 months of legal process, Bismil, Ashfaqulla Khan, Roshan Singh and Rajendra Nath Lahiri were sentenced to death. Bismil was hanged on 19 December 1927 at Gorakhpur Jail, Ashfaqulla Khan at the Faizabad Jail and Roshan Singh at Naini Allahabad Jail. Lahiri had been hanged two days earlier at Gonda Jail.\nBismil's body was taken to the Rapti river for a Hindu cremation, and the site became known as Rajghat.\n\n\n== Literary works ==\nBismil published a pamphlet titled Deshvasiyon ke nam sandesh (en: A message to my countrymen). While living underground, he translated some of Bengali books viz. Bolshevikon Ki Kartoot (en: The Bolshevik's programme) and Yogik Sadhan (of Arvind Ghosh). Beside these a collection of poems Man Ki Lahar (en: A sally of mind) and Swadeshi Rang was also written by him. Another Swadhinta ki devi: Catherine was fabricated from an English book into Hindi. All of these were published by him in Sushil Mala series. Bismil wrote his autobiography while he was kept as condemned prisoner in Gorakhpur jail.The autobiography of Ram Prasad Bismil was published under the cover title of Kakori ke shaheed by Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi in 1928 from Pratap Press, Cawnpore. A rough translation of this book was got prepared by the Criminal Investigation Department of United Province in British India. Translated book was circulated as confidential document for official and police use throughout the country.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\n\nShaheed Smarak Samiti of Shahjahanpur established a memorial at Khirni Bagh mohalla of Shahjahanpur city where Bismil was born in 1897 and named it \"Amar Shaheed Ram Prasad Bismil Smarak\". A statue made of white marble was inaugurated by the then Governor of Uttar Pradesh Motilal Vora on 18 December 1994 on the eve of the martyr's 69th death anniversary.The Northern railway zone of Indian Railways built the Pt Ram Prasad Bismil railway station, 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Shahajahanpur.There is a memorial to the Kakori conspiracists at Kakori itself. It was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, on 19 December 1983.The Government of India issued a multicoloured commemorative postal stamp on 19 December 1997 in Bismil's birth centenary year.The government of Uttar Pradesh had named a park after him: Amar Shaheed Pt. Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan is near Rampur Jagir village, where Bismil lived underground after the Mainpuri conspiracy case in 1919.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAshfaqullah Khan\nSukhdev Thapar\nChandrashekar Azad\nShivaram Rajguru\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSimha, Ema Ke (2009).

Noida is the most developed urban city of Uttar Pradesh.\nTo boost the tourism in the state from within the country and other parts of the world, the Government of Uttar Pradesh established a 'Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc' covering the cities of Agra, Allahabad, Lucknow and Varanasi.\n\n\n== Agra ==\nThe 17th-century Taj Mahal in Agra is the most popular monument in India, attracting over 7 million visitors per year. Agra is home to four World Heritage Sites in Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Sikandra & the Fatehpur Sikri. Agra is also home to many other Mughal buildings like Akbar's Tomb, Itmad-Ud-Daulah etc. Dayal Bagh is an under-construction temple that many visit. The lifelike carving in marble is not seen anywhere else in India.\n\n\n== Prayagraj ==\n\nFamous landmarks of the city are \nTriveni Sangam, Allahabad Museum, Allahabad Fort, New Yamuna Bridge, Allahabad University, All Saints Cathedral, Anand Bhavan, Alfred Park, Khusro Bagh, Allahabad Planetarium, Allahabad pillar, Swaraj bhawan, Bade Hanuman Mandir, Magh Mela, Kumbh Mela, Company Garden, Allahabad High court, Alopi Devi Mandir, Akshayavat, Mahakaleshwar temple, Minto park, Jawahar Planetarium, Allahabad Public library, Fun Gaon Water park, Nandan kanan water retreat.\nBhakti Mandir Mangarh , Maa shitla devi Temple, Kaushambi, Jain Temple Kaushambi , Prabhashgiri Kaushambi are also nearest of city.\nEvery year thousands gather at Allahabad to take part in the festival on the banks of the Ganges, the Magh Mela. The same festival is organised in a larger scale every 12th year and attracts millions of people and is called the Kumbha Mela. Kumbh Mela (especially the Maha Kumbh Mela) is the most sacred of all the pilgrimages. Thousands of holy men and women (monks, saints and sadhus) attend, and the auspiciousness of the festival is in part attributable to this. The sadhus are seen clad in saffron sheets with plenty of ashes and powder dabbed on their skin per the requirements of ancient traditions. Some called nanga sanyasis or 'Dhigambers' may often be seen without any clothes even in severe winter, generally considered to live an extreme lifestyle. This tends to attract a lot of western attention as it is seemingly in contrast to a generally conservative social modesty practised in the country.\n\n\n== Hindu religious sites ==\nMillions of tourists and pilgrims visit the cities of Prayagraj, Varanasi, Mathura, Gorakhpur, and Ayodhya, as those are considered to be the holiest cities in India.\n\n\n=== Varanasi ===\n\nVaranasi (also called Kashi and Benares) is widely considered to be the oldest city in the world,  before Jerusalem.

        "wiki": "Agra ( (listen)) is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is 206 kilometres (128 mi) south of the national capital New Delhi. Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh and 24th in India.It has been speculated that in Mahabharata the city Agra is referred to as Agravana which translates as \u201cfront of the forest\u201d. It is mentioned that the Shurasena dynasty of Lord Krishna maintained an outpost at Agravana. Greek geographer Ptolemy referred to Agra by its modern name in his Geographia and placed it in his world map in 2nd century AD. The 11th-century Persian poet Mas'\u016bd Sa'd Salm\u0101n writes of an assault on the fortress of Agra, then held by King Jaypal, by Mahmud of Ghazni. Despite his surrender, Mahmud sacked the place. It was mentioned in 1080 AD when a Ghaznavide force captured it. A 17th century chronicle called the Agra before Sikandar Lod\u012b's time (1488\u20131517) as an old settlement which was merely a village, owing to its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sikandar was the first sultan to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1504, its administration having previously been under Bayana. He governed the country from here and Agra assumed the importance of the second capital. He died in 1517 and his son, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b, remained in power there for nine more years. Several palaces, wells, and a mosque were built by him in the fort during his period. He was finally defeated at the Battle of Panipat in 1526. Between 1540 and 1556, Afghans, beginning with Sher Shah Suri, ruled the area. It was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1648. The city was later taken by the Marathas and later still fell to the British Raj.\nAgra is a major tourist destination because of its many Mughal-era buildings, most notably the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur; and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with Lucknow and Varanasi. Agra is in the Braj cultural region.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nAgra features a semiarid climate that borders on a humid subtropical climate. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season. However, the monsoons, though substantial in Agra, are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India. This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a humid subtropical climate.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nAs of 2011 India census, Agra city has a population of 1,585,704, while the population of Agra cantonment is 53,053. The urban agglomeration of Agra has a population of 1,760,285. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Agra city has an average literacy rate of 73%, below the national average of 74%. Literacy rate of males is considerably higher than that of women. The sex ratio in the city was 875 females per thousand males while child sex ratio stood at 857. Agra district literacy rate is 62.56%.According to the 2011 census, Agra district has a population of 4,380,793, roughly equal to the nation of Moldova or the US state of Kentucky. This gives it a ranking of 41st in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of 1,084 inhabitants per square kilometre (2,810/sq mi) .\n52.5% of Agra's population is in the 15\u201359 years age category. Around 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nHindus are 88.8% while Muslims are 9.3% of the population in Agra district. Hinduism, Islam and Jainism are the major religions in Agra city with 80.7%, 15.4% and 1.0% of the population adhering to them; others are 2.9%. The Catholic minority is served by its own Metropolitan Archdiocese of Agra.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval era ===\nMasud Sa'd Salman claims to have been there when Mahmud assaulted Agra, claiming the Raja Japal surrendered after seeing a nightmare. Mahmud however proceeds to pillage the city. The history of the city before the Muslim conquerors is unclear. The 17th century chronicler named Abdhullah said it was a village before the reign of Sikandar Lodi. The king of Mathura had used the Agra fort as a jail. The degradation in the status of the site was a result of the destruction brought upon it by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sultan Sikandar Lod\u012b, the Muslim ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, shifted his capital to Agra in the year 1504. Before this, it was under the lordship of Bayana. After the Sultan's death, the city passed on to his son, Sultan Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b. He ruled his Sultanate from Agra until he fell fighting to Mughal Badshah B\u0101bar in the First battle of Panipat fought in 1526.\n\n\n=== Mughal era ===\n\nThe golden age of the city began with the Mughals. Previously known as Akbarab\u0101d, Agra was the capital of the Mughal Empire under the Badshahs Akbar, Jah\u0101ng\u012br and Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. Akbar made it the eponymous seat of one of his original twelve subahs (imperial top-level provinces), bordering (Old) Delhi, Awadh (Oudh), Allahabad, Malwa and Ajmer subahs. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted his capital to Sh\u0101hjah\u0101nab\u0101d in the year 1648.Since Akbarab\u0101d was one of the most important cities in India under the Mughals, it witnessed a lot of building activity. Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of the river Yamuna. The garden is called the Ar\u0101m B\u0101gh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson Akbar the Great raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarab\u0101d called Fatehpur Sikri. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.\n\nHis son Jah\u0101ng\u012br had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort or L\u0101l Qil'a. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Akbarab\u0101d its most prized monument, the Taj Mahal. Built in loving memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, the mausoleum was completed in 1653.\nSh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted the capital to Delhi during his reign, but his son Aurangzeb moved the capital back to Akbarab\u0101d, usurping his father and imprisoning him in the Fort there.\n\n\n=== Later periods ===\nThe Jat kingdom of Bharatpur waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra.After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of Marathas and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the British Raj in 1803.\n\nIn 1835 when the Presidency of Agra was established by the British, the city became the seat of government, and just two years later it was witness to the Agra famine of 1837\u201338. During the Indian rebellion of 1857 British rule across India was threatened, news of the rebellion had reached Agra on 11 May and on 30 May two companies of native infantry, the 44th and 67th regiments, rebelled and marched to Delhi. The next morning native Indian troops in Agra were forced to disarm, on 15 June Gwalior (which lies south of Agra) rebelled. By 3 July, the British were forced to withdraw into the fort. Two days later a small British force at Sucheta were defeated and forced to withdraw, this led to a mob sacking the city. However, the rebels moved onto Delhi which allowed the British to restore order by 8 July. Delhi fell to the British in September, the following month rebels who had fled Delhi along with rebels from Central India marched on Agra but were defeated. After this British rule was again secured over the city until the independence of India in 1947.\n\n\n=== Legacies ===\nAgra is the birthplace of the religion known as D\u012bn-i Il\u0101h\u012b, which flourished during the reign of Akbar and also of the Radhaswami Faith, which has around two million followers worldwide. Agra has historic linkages with Shauripur of Jainism and Runukta of Hinduism, of 1000 BC.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "John Russell Colvin (29 May 1807 \u2013 9 September 1857) was a British civil servant in India, part of the illustrious Anglo-Indian Colvin family. He was lieutenant-governor of the North-West Provinces of British India during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, at the height of which he died.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nColvin's was an Anglo-Indian family of Scottish descent. He was the second son and fourth child of James Colvin (born 1768), a merchant with Colvin, Bazett & Co. of London and Calcutta.  He was educated at the East India Company College at Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire; and entered the service of the British East India Company in 1826.In 1836 he became private secretary to Lord Auckland at the time of the First Anglo-Afghan War of 1837, and named his son after him. From 1846-49, Colvin served as Commissioner of Tenasserim, in British (Lower) Burma.\n\nIn 1853 Lord Dalhousie appointed him lieutenant-governor of the North-West Provinces of India. In 1857, at the start of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Colvin was at Agra with only a weak British regiment and a native battery, not enough force to prevail against the mutineers. Colvin issued a proclamation to the 'natives' that was censured at the time for its clemency, but it was similar to the approach of Sir Henry Lawrence, later followed by Lord Canning. Colvin died shortly before the fall of Delhi.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nColvin married Emma Sophia, daughter of Wetenhall Sneyd, a vicar in England; they had ten children, many of whom continued the family connection with India. Bazett Wetenhall, Elliott Graham, and Walter Mytton all passed distinguished careers in India, and a fourth, Clement Sneyd, C.S.I., was secretary of the public works department of the India Office in London.  The third son, Auckland, named after Lord Auckland, was lieutenant-governor of the North-West Provinces and Oudh, and also served in Egypt. He co-founded the Colvin Taluqdars' College in Lucknow; he also published a biography of his father in the Rulers of India series in 1895, and in 1905 gave a stained glass East window to the church of St. Mary at Soham, both as a thanksgiving for the termination of the Second Boer War, and as a permanent memorial to his father.Colvin's elder brother, Bazett David, in 1847 inherited their father's estate at The Grove, Little Bealing, near Ipswich, which thus became the childhood home of Sidney Colvin, who grew up to be a critic, curator, and great friend of Robert Louis Stevenson.Colvin's granddaughter Brenda (1897\u20131981) was an important landscape architect, author of standard works in the field and a force behind its professionalisation. She had no children, but another of Colvin's grandchildren founded his own line: Clement Sneyd's son ended up as Admiral Sir Ragnar Colvin, KBE, CB, and fathered John Horace Ragnar Colvin, the Cold War diplomat. The most recent generation is the Australian journalist Mark Colvin and Major General James Balfour CBE of the Royal Green Jackets.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBoase, G.C.; Penner, Peter (reviewer) (2004). \"Colvin, John Russell (1807\u20131857)\".

        "wiki": "Keetham lake, also known as the Sur Sarovar, is a scenic lake just outside Agra on the Agra - Delhi highway (NH 2).\n\n\n== Location ==\nThis scenic lake, is about 20 km from Agra and 12 km from sikandra is located within the Sur Sarovar Bird Sanctuary. Keetham Lake is linked by Railway track at Keetham Railway Station and was declared as National Bird Sanctuary on 27 March 1991 by U.P. Forest Department. The riverine belt of River Yamuna surrounds the area of Sur-Sarovar.\nThe entire lake is formed in a catchment area of 7.13 km\u00b2. Keetham Lake is pentagonal in shape. There are artificially created islands for shelter and breeding grounds to the migratory birds. The best thing is that is placed on the way of Delhi and tourist can visit during their journey to Agra.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climatic conditions of the lake area is typical of Uttar Pradesh plains with hot windy summers and extremely cold winters. The average temperature ranges between 1.5 C to 49 C. The monsoon season occurs during July to September.\n\n\n== Water Management ==\nThe raw water for Keetham Lake is obtained from Agra Canal originating from Okhla barrage on River Yamuna in Delhi. At Delhi Agra road, the Agra Canal water is diverted through Jodhpur branch near Anand Engineering College located about 2 km from Keetham. The lake water of Keetham is also used as raw water intake for Mathura Refinery Water Treatment Plant located in vicinity of Keetham Lake\n\n\n== Development ==\nU.P. Forest Department has created woodlands and developed shallow areas near lake, making it a natural habitat for birds nesting sites. Controversially, Uttar Pradesh Government has decided to reduce the Eco-sensitive zone limit around Keetham Lake from 10 kilometres to just 250 metres.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nMore than 106 species of migratory and resident birds are known to have their resting habitats at Sur Sarovar. The entire lake area gets covered by profuse growth of macrophytic vegetation of water hyacinth (Eichornia sp.) and Potamogeton sp. during summers. The water quality of Keetham lake supports wide range of avifauna during winter season. \nThe important aquatic birds inhabiting Keetham lake are:\nLittle Grebes,\nCormorants,\nDarter,\nGrey Heron,\nPurple Heron,\nPaddy Bird,\nCattle Egrets,\nLarge Egrets,\nSmaller Egrets,\nLittle Egrets,\nNight Heron,\nIndian Reef Heron,\nBlack necked Stork,\nwhite Ibis,\nEurasian Spoon Bill,\nGreying Goose,\nBar headed Goose,\nLesser Whistling Teal,\nRuddy Shelduck,\nNorthern Pintail,\nCommon Teal,\nSpot Billed Duck,\nGadwall, Wigeon,\nShoveler, and\nComb Duck.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPatna Bird Sanctuary\nNational Chambal (Gharial) Wildlife Sanctuary\n\n\n== References ==\n\nhttp://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/india/agra/excursions-from-agra/keetham-lake.html\nhttp://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090410071347/http://cpcbenvis.nic.in/newsletter/birdsanctury/ch40703.htm at the Library of Congress Web Archives (archived 2009-04-10)\nhttp://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090410071428/http://cpcbenvis.nic.in/newsletter/birdsanctury/ch30703.htm at the Library of Congress Web Archives (archived 2009-04-10)\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20081005042333/http://up-tourism.com/tour/agra_braj_circuit.htm",

        "wiki": "The Aram Bagh is the oldest Mughal Garden in India, originally built by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1528, located about five kilometers northeast of the Taj Mahal in Agra, India. Babur was temporarily buried there before being interred in Kabul.\nThe garden is a Persian garden, where pathways and canals divide the garden to represent the Islamic ideal of paradise, an abundant garden through which rivers flow. The Aram Bagh provides an example of a variant of the charbagh in which water cascades down three terraces in a sequence of cascades. Two viewing pavilions face the Jumna river and incorporates a subterranean 'tahkhana' which was used during the hot summers to provide relief for visitors. The garden has numerous water courses and fountains.The name is a corruption of the Persian Aaram Bagh meaning 'Garden of Rest'. It is also variously known as Bagh-i Nur Afshan 'Light-Scattering Garden', Aalsi Bagh or 'Lazy Garden': according to legend,  Emperor Akbar proposed to his third wife, who was a gardener there, by lying idle for 6 days until she agreed to marry him.Jahangir waited in the garden in early March 1621 for the most astrologically auspicious hour for him to enter Agra after he took the Fort of Kangra. The preserved, surviving architecture dates to his reign and demonstrates the skill of his wife Nur Jahan as a garden designer.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKoch, Ebba.

        "wiki": "Situated in the northern part of India, bordering with the capital of India New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh is one of the most popular and an established tourist destination for both Indians and non-Indians alike in India. The most populous state of India, Uttar Pradesh contains many historical monuments and places of religious significance. Geographically, Uttar Pradesh is very diverse, with Himalayan foothills in the extreme north and the Gangetic Plain in the centre. It is also home of India's most visited sites, the Taj Mahal, and Hinduism's holiest city, Varanasi. Kumbh city, Allahabad. Kathak, one of the eight forms of Indian classical dances, originated from Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh is at the heart of India, hence it is also known as The Heartland of India. Cuisine of Uttar Pradesh like Awadhi cuisine, Mughlai cuisine, Kumauni cuisine are very famous not only in India but also many places abroad.\nUttar Pradesh is known for its rich culture and tradition. It is home to Ayodhya and Mathura birthplace of Lord Rama,Lord Krishna and Bhgwan Parshuram respectively. Uttar Pradesh attracts many national and international tourists. Taj Mahal, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in Agra is also located in Uttar Pradesh.\nThere are different places one can visit in Uttar Pradesh. Agra, Jhansi, Lucknow and Meerut are historical cities famous for their monuments. Mathura, Vrindavan, Gokul, Varanasi, Ayodhya, Gorakhpur and Allahabad are holy cities for Hindus and Kushinagar and Sarnath are important Buddhist places among the main four pilgrimage sites related to the life of Gautama Buddha. Noida is the most developed urban city of Uttar Pradesh.\nTo boost the tourism in the state from within the country and other parts of the world, the Government of Uttar Pradesh established a 'Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc' covering the cities of Agra, Allahabad, Lucknow and Varanasi.\n\n\n== Agra ==\nThe 17th-century Taj Mahal in Agra is the most popular monument in India, attracting over 7 million visitors per year. Agra is home to four World Heritage Sites in Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Sikandra & the Fatehpur Sikri. Agra is also home to many other Mughal buildings like Akbar's Tomb, Itmad-Ud-Daulah etc. Dayal Bagh is an under-construction temple that many visit. The lifelike carving in marble is not seen anywhere else in India.\n\n\n== Prayagraj ==\n\nFamous landmarks of the city are \nTriveni Sangam, Allahabad Museum, Allahabad Fort, New Yamuna Bridge, Allahabad University, All Saints Cathedral, Anand Bhavan, Alfred Park, Khusro Bagh, Allahabad Planetarium, Allahabad pillar, Swaraj bhawan, Bade Hanuman Mandir, Magh Mela, Kumbh Mela, Company Garden, Allahabad High court, Alopi Devi Mandir, Akshayavat, Mahakaleshwar temple, Minto park, Jawahar Planetarium, Allahabad Public library, Fun Gaon Water park, Nandan kanan water retreat.\nBhakti Mandir Mangarh , Maa shitla devi Temple, Kaushambi, Jain Temple Kaushambi , Prabhashgiri Kaushambi are also nearest of city.\nEvery year thousands gather at Allahabad to take part in the festival on the banks of the Ganges, the Magh Mela. The same festival is organised in a larger scale every 12th year and attracts millions of people and is called the Kumbha Mela. Kumbh Mela (especially the Maha Kumbh Mela) is the most sacred of all the pilgrimages. Thousands of holy men and women (monks, saints and sadhus) attend, and the auspiciousness of the festival is in part attributable to this. The sadhus are seen clad in saffron sheets with plenty of ashes and powder dabbed on their skin per the requirements of ancient traditions. Some called nanga sanyasis or 'Dhigambers' may often be seen without any clothes even in severe winter, generally considered to live an extreme lifestyle. This tends to attract a lot of western attention as it is seemingly in contrast to a generally conservative social modesty practised in the country.\n\n\n== Hindu religious sites ==\nMillions of tourists and pilgrims visit the cities of Prayagraj, Varanasi, Mathura, Gorakhpur, and Ayodhya, as those are considered to be the holiest cities in India.\n\n\n=== Varanasi ===\n\nVaranasi (also called Kashi and Benares) is widely considered to be the oldest city in the world,  before Jerusalem.

He is known as the father of Jain religion. The city is also important in the history and heritage of Buddhism in India, with several Buddhist temples, monuments and centers of learning having been established here during the age of the Mauryan Empire and the Gupta Dynasty. Ayodhya reached its glorious peak as known to history during the reign of the Guptas over India.\nSwaminarayan led the Swaminarayan Sampraday sect of Hinduism and lived here during his childhood years. It was from Ayodhya that Swaminarayan started his seven-year journey across India as Neelkanth.\nTulsidas is said to have begun the writing of his famous Ramayana poem Shri Ramacharitamanas in Ayodhya in 1574 CE. Several Tamil Alwar mention the city of Ayodhya. Ayodhya is also said to be the birthplace of Bahubali, Brahmi, Sundari, King Dasaratha, Acharya Padaliptasurisvarji, King Harishchandra, Shri Rama, Achalbhrata, and the ninth Gandhara of Mahavir Swami.\nThe Atharva Veda called Ayodhya \"a city built by gods and being as prosperous as paradise itself\".\nSoron Shukar Kshetra is salvation land of Lord Varah and birthland of Sant Tulsidas.\n\n\n=== Naimisaranya ===\nNaimisaranya also known as Neemsar, Nimsar or Nimkhar is a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu located in Sitapur district in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.

The temple is counted as one of the eight temples of Vishnu that self-manifested and is classified as Swayamvyaktha Kshetra.

          "Went to Victoria park to watch the fireworks and it was amazing. One of the best displays i have ever seen and it was free. The price of the mulled wine was a little annoying and it burnt my hand as it came in a plastic non-insulated cup.",

          "OK, I love this park but ...not worth crossing London just to visit the park itself. Now, if you happen to be in the area or can combine your visit with other local amenities it is a great addition to your day. The park is large but not huge. It has quite a few different areas,",

          "This park runs both sides of a road and one side of the road is quite tacky, and the other side is much nicer. We didn't explore the whole of the park, rather we just riding across London view the most green and pleasant route. We thought the pavilion was in a very unattractive",

        "wiki": "The Koh-i-Noor (; lit. \"Mountain of light\"), also spelt Kohinoor and Koh-i-Nur, is one of the largest cut diamonds in the world, weighing 105.6 carats (21.12 g). It is part of the British Crown Jewels.\nProbably mined in Kollur Mine, India, during the period of the Delhi Sultanate, there is no record of its original weight \u2013 but the earliest well-attested weight is 186 old carats (191 metric carats or 38.2 g). The diamond was part of the Mughal Peacock Throne. It changed hands between various factions in south and west Asia, until being ceded to Queen Victoria after the British annexation of the Punjab in 1849.\nOriginally, the stone was of a similar cut to other Mughal-era diamonds, like the Darya-i-Noor, which are now in the Iranian Crown Jewels. In 1851, it went on display at the Great Exhibition in London, but the lacklustre cut failed to impress viewers. Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, ordered it to be re-cut as an oval brilliant by Coster Diamonds. By modern standards, the culet (point at the bottom of a gemstone) is unusually broad, giving the impression of a black hole when the stone is viewed head-on; it is nevertheless regarded by gemologists as \"full of life\".Because its history involves a great deal of fighting between men, the Koh-i-Noor acquired a reputation within the British royal family for bringing bad luck to any man who wears it. Since arriving in the UK, it has only been worn by female members of the family. Victoria wore the stone in a brooch and a circlet. After she died in 1901, it was set in the Crown of Queen Alexandra, wife of Edward VII. It was transferred to the Crown of Queen Mary in 1911, and finally to the Crown of Queen Elizabeth (later known as the Queen Mother) in 1937 for her coronation as Queen consort.\nToday, the diamond is on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London, where it is seen by millions of visitors each year. The governments of India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan have all claimed rightful ownership of the Koh-i-Noor and demanded its return ever since India gained independence from the UK in 1947. The British government insists the gem was obtained legally under the terms of the Last Treaty of Lahore and has rejected the claims.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe diamond may have been mined from Kollur Mine, a series of 4-metre (13 ft) deep gravel-clay pits on the banks of Krishna River in the Golconda (present-day Andhra Pradesh), India. It is impossible to know exactly when or where it was found, and many unverifiable theories exist as to its original owner.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBabur, the Turco-Mongol founder of the Mughal Empire, wrote about a \"famous\" diamond that weighed just over 187 old carats \u2013 approximately the size of the 186-carat Koh-i-Noor. Some historians think Babur's diamond is the earliest reliable reference to the Koh-i-Noor. According to his diary, it was acquired by Alauddin Khalji, second ruler of the Khalji dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate, when he invaded the kingdoms of southern India at the beginning of the 14th century and was probably in the possession of the Kakatiya dynasty. It later passed to succeeding dynasties of the Sultanate, and Babur received the diamond in 1526 as a tribute for his conquest of Delhi and Agra at the Battle of Panipat.Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, had the stone placed into his ornate Peacock Throne. In 1658, his son and successor, Aurangzeb, confined the ailing emperor to Agra Fort. While in the possession of Aurangzeb, it was allegedly cut by Hortenso Borgia, a Venetian lapidary, reducing the weight of the large stone to 186 carats (37.2 g). For this carelessness, Borgia was reprimanded and fined 10,000 rupees. According to recent research, the story of Borgia cutting the diamond is not correct, and most probably mixed up with the Orlov, part of Catherine the Great's imperial Russian sceptre in the Kremlin.\n\nFollowing the 1739 invasion of Delhi by Nadir Shah, the Afsharid Shah of Persia, the treasury of the Mughal Empire was looted by his army in an organised and thorough acquisition of the Mughal nobility's wealth. Along with millions of rupees and an assortment of historic jewels, the Shah also carried away the Koh-i-Noor. He exclaimed Koh-i-Noor!, Persian for \"Mountain of Light\", when he obtained the famous stone. One of his consorts said, \"If a strong man were to throw four stones \u2013 one north, one south, one east, one west, and a fifth stone up into the air \u2013 and if the space between them were to be filled with gold, all would not equal the value of the Koh-i-Noor\".After Nadir Shah was killed and his empire collapsed in 1747, the Koh-i-Noor fell to his grandson, who in 1751 gave it to Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the Afghan Empire, in return for his support. One of Ahmed's descendants, Shuja Shah Durrani, wore a bracelet containing the Koh-i-Noor on the occasion of Mountstuart Elphinstone's visit to Peshawar in 1808. A year later, Shuja formed an alliance with the United Kingdom to help defend against a possible invasion of Afghanistan by Russia. He was quickly overthrown, but fled with the diamond to Lahore, where Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh Empire, in return for his hospitality, insisted upon the gem being given to him, and he took possession of it in 1813.\n\n\n=== In Ranjit Singh's possession ===\nRanjit Singh had the diamond examined by jewelers of Lahore for two days to ensure that Shuja had not tricked him. After the jewelers confirmed its genuineness, he donated 125,000 rupees to Shuja. Ranjit Singh then asked the principal jewelers of Amritsar to estimate the diamond's value; the jewelers declared that the value of the diamond was \"far beyond all computation\". Ranjit Singh then fixed the diamond in the front of his turban, and paraded on an elephant to enable his subjects to see the diamond. He used to wear it as an armlet during major festivals such as Diwali and Dusserah, and took it with him during travel. He would exhibit it to prominent visitors, especially British officers.One day, Ranjit Singh asked the diamond's former owners - Shuja and his wife Wafa Begum - to estimate its value. Wafa Begum replied that if a strong man threw a stone in four cardinal directions and vertically, Koh-i-Noor would be worth more than the gold and precious stones filled in the space. Ranjit Singh grew paranoid about the Koh-i-Noor being stolen, because in the past, another valuable jewel had been stolen from him while he was intoxicated. He kept the diamond within a high-security facility at the Gobindgarh Fort when it was not in use. When the diamond was to be transported, it was placed in a pannier on a guarded camel; 39 other camels with identical panniers were included in the convoy; the diamond was always placed on the first camel immediately behind the guards, but great secrecy was maintained regarding which camel carried it. Only Ranjit Singh's treasurer Misr Beli Ram knew which camel carried the diamond.In June 1839, Ranjit Singh suffered his third stroke, and it became apparent that he would die soon. On his deathbed, he started giving away his valuable possessions to religious charities, and appointed his eldest son Kharak Singh as his successor. A day before his death, on 26 June 1839, a major argument broke out between his courtiers regarding the fate of Koh-i-Noor. Ranjit Singh himself was too weak to speak, and communicated using gestures. Bhai Gobind Ram, the head Brahmin of Ranjit Singh, insisted that the king had willed Koh-i-Noor and other jewels to the Jagannath Temple in Puri: the king apparently supported this claim through gestures, as recorded in his court chronicle Umdat ul-Tawarikh. However, treasurer Beli Ram insisted that it was a state property rather than Ranjit Singh's personal property, and therefore, should be handed over to Kharak Singh.After Ranjit Singh's death, Beli Ram refused to send the diamond to the temple, and hid it in his vaults. Meanwhile, Kharak Singh and prime minister Dhian Singh also issued orders stating that the diamond should not be taken out of Lahore.\n\n\n=== In Gulab Singh's possession ===\nOn 8 October 1839 the new emperor Kharak Singh, was overthrown in a coup by his prime minister Dhian Singh. The prime minister's brother Gulab Singh, Raja of Jammu, came into possession of the Koh-i-Noor. Kharak Singh later died in prison, soon followed by the mysterious death of his son and successor Nau Nihal Singh on 5 November 1840. Gulab Singh held onto the stone until January 1841, when he presented it to emperor Sher Singh in order to win his favour, after his brother Dhian Singh negotiated a ceasefire between Sher Singh and the overthrown empress Chand Kaur. Gulab Singh had attempted to defend the widowed empress at her fort in Lahore, during two days of conflict and shelling by Sher Singh and his troops. Despite handing over the Koh-i-noor, Gulab Singh as a result of the ceasefire returned safely to Jammu with a wealth of gold and other jewels taken from the treasury.\n\n\n==== Worn by child emperor Duleep Singh ====\nOn 15 September 1843, both Sher Singh and prime minister Dhian Singh were assassinated in a coup led by Ajit Singh Sandhawalia. However, the next day in a counter coup led by Dhian's son Hira Singh the assassins were killed. Aged 24, Hira Singh succeeded his father as prime minister, and installed the five year old infant Duleep Singh as emperor. The Koh-i-noor was now fastened to the arm of the child emperor in court at Lahore. Duleep Singh and his mother empress Jind Kaur, had till then resided in Jammu, the kingdom governed by Gulab Singh.Following his nephew Prime Minister Hira Singh's assassination on 27 March 1844, and the subsequent outbreak of the First Anglo-Sikh War, Gulab Singh himself led the Sikh empire as its prime minister, and despite defeat in the war, he became the first Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir on 16 March 1846, under the Treaty of Amritsar.\n\n\n=== Acquisition by Queen Victoria ===\nOn 29 March 1849, following the conclusion of the Second Anglo-Sikh War, the Kingdom of Punjab was formally annexed to Company rule, and the Last Treaty of Lahore was signed, officially ceding the Koh-i-Noor to Queen Victoria and the Maharaja's other assets to the company. Article III of the treaty read: \"The gem called the Koh-i-Noor, which was taken from Shah Sooja-ool-moolk by Maharajah Ranjeet Singh, shall be surrendered by the Maharajah of Lahore to the Queen of England (sic)\".The lead signatory of the treaty for the eleven-year-old Maharaja Duleep Singh was his commander-in-chief Tej Singh, a loyalist of Maharaja Gulab Singh who had previously been in possession of the Koh-i-noor and gained Kashmir from the Sikh empire, via treaty with Britain, following the First Anglo-Sikh War.\nThe Governor-General in charge of the ratification of this treaty was the Marquess of Dalhousie. The manner of his aiding in the transfer of the diamond was criticized even by some of his contemporaries in Britain. Although some thought it should have been presented as a gift to Queen Victoria by the East India Company, it is clear that Dalhousie believed the stone was a spoil of war, and treated it accordingly, ensuring that it was officially surrendered to her by Duleep Singh, the youngest son of Ranjit Singh. The presentation of the Koh-i-Noor by the East India Company to the queen was the latest in a long history of transfers of the diamond as a coveted spoil of war. Duleep Singh had been placed in the guardianship of Dr John Login, a surgeon in the British Army serving in the Presidency of Bengal. Duleep Singh would move to England in 1854.\n\n\n==== Journey to the United Kingdom ====\n\nIn due course, the Governor-General received the Koh-i-Noor from Dr Login, who had been appointed Governor of the Citadel, on 6 April 1848 under a receipt dated 7 December 1849, in the presence of members of the Board of Administration for the affairs of the Punjab: Sir Henry Lawrence (President), C. G. Mansel, John Lawrence and Sir Henry Elliot (Secretary to the Government of India).\nLegend in the Lawrence family has it that before the voyage, John Lawrence left the jewel in his waistcoat pocket when it was sent to be laundered, and was most grateful when it was returned promptly by the valet who found it.On 1 February 1850, the jewel was sealed in a small iron safe inside a red dispatch box, both sealed with red tape and a wax seal and kept in a chest at Bombay Treasury awaiting a steamer ship from China. It was then sent to England for presentation to Queen Victoria in the care of Captain J. Ramsay and Brevet Lt. Col F. Mackeson under tight security arrangements, one of which was the placement of the dispatch box in a larger iron safe. They departed from Bombay on 6 April on board HMS Medea, captained by Captain Lockyer.\nThe ship had a difficult voyage: an outbreak of cholera on board when the ship was in Mauritius had the locals demanding its departure, and they asked their governor to open fire on the vessel and destroy it if there was no response. Shortly afterwards, the vessel was hit by a severe gale that blew for some 12 hours.\nOn arrival in Britain on 29 June, the passengers and mail were unloaded in Plymouth, but the Koh-i-Noor stayed on board until the ship reached Spithead, near Portsmouth, on 1 July. The next morning, Ramsay and Mackeson, in the company of Mr Onslow, the private secretary to the Chairman of the Court of Directors of the British East India Company, proceeded by train to East India House in the City of London and passed the diamond into the care of the chairman and deputy chairman of the East India Company.\nThe Koh-i-Noor was formally presented to Queen Victoria on 3 July 1850 at Buckingham Palace by the deputy chairman of the East India Company. The date had been chosen to coincide with the Company's 250th anniversary.\n\n\n=== The Great Exhibition ===\n\nMembers of the public were given a chance to see the Koh-i-Noor when The Great Exhibition was staged at Hyde Park, London, in 1851. It represented the might of the British Empire and took pride of place in the eastern part of the central gallery.Its mysterious past and advertised value of \u00a31\u20132 million drew large crowds. At first, the stone was put inside a gilded birdcage, but after complaints about its dull appearance, the Koh-i-Noor was moved to a case with black velvet and gas lamps in the hope that it would sparkle better. Despite this, the flawed and asymmetrical diamond still failed to please viewers.\n\n\n=== 1852 re-cutting ===\nOriginally, the diamond had 169 facets and was 4.1 centimetres (1.6 in) long, 3.26 centimetres (1.28 in) wide, and 1.62 centimetres (0.64 in) deep. It was high-domed, with a flat base and both triangular and rectangular facets, similar in overall appearance to other Mughal era diamonds which are now in the Iranian Crown Jewels.Disappointment in the appearance of the stone was not uncommon. After consulting mineralogists, including Sir David Brewster, it was decided by Prince Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria, with the consent of the government, to polish the Koh-i-Noor. One of the largest and most famous Dutch diamond merchants, Mozes Coster, was employed for the task. He sent to London one of his most experienced artisans, Levie Benjamin Voorzanger, and his assistants.\n\nOn 17 July 1852, the cutting began at the factory of Garrard & Co. in Haymarket, using a steam-powered mill built specially for the job by Maudslay, Sons and Field. Under the supervision of Prince Albert and the Duke of Wellington, and the technical direction of the queen's mineralogist, James Tennant, the cutting took thirty-eight days. Albert spent a total of \u00a38,000 on the operation,  which reduced the weight of the diamond from 186 old carats (191 modern carats or 38.2 g) to its current 105.6 carats (21.12 g). The stone measures 3.6 cm (1.4 in) long, 3.2 cm (1.3 in) wide, and 1.3 cm (0.5 in) deep. Brilliant-cut diamonds usually have fifty-eight facets, but the Koh-i-Noor has eight additional \"star\" facets around the culet, making a total of sixty-six facets.The great loss of weight is to some extent accounted for by the fact that Voorzanger discovered several flaws, one especially big, that he found it necessary to cut away. Although Prince Albert was dissatisfied with such a huge reduction, most experts agreed that Voorzanger had made the right decision and carried out his job with impeccable skill. When Queen Victoria showed the re-cut diamond to the young Maharaja Duleep Singh, the Koh-i-Noor's last non-British owner, he was apparently unable to speak for several minutes afterwards.The much lighter but more dazzling stone was mounted in a honeysuckle brooch and a circlet worn by the queen. At this time, it belonged to her personally, and was not yet part of the Crown Jewels. Although Victoria wore it often, she became uneasy about the way in which the diamond had been acquired. In a letter to her eldest daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal, she wrote in the 1870s: \"No one feels more strongly than I do about India or how much I opposed our taking those countries and I think no more will be taken, for it is very wrong and no advantage to us. You know also how I dislike wearing the Koh-i-Noor\".\n\n\n=== Crown Jewel ===\n\nAfter Queen Victoria's death, the Koh-i-Noor was set in the Crown of Queen Alexandra, the wife of Edward VII, that was used to crown her at their coronation in 1902. The diamond was transferred to Queen Mary's Crown in 1911, and finally to The Queen Mother's Crown in 1937. When The Queen Mother died in 2002, the crown was placed on top of her coffin for the lying-in-state and funeral.All these crowns are on display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London with crystal replicas of the diamond set in the older crowns. The original bracelet given to Queen Victoria can also be seen there. A glass model of the Koh-i-Noor shows visitors how it looked when it was brought to the United Kingdom. Replicas of the diamond in this and its re-cut forms can also be seen in the 'Vault' exhibit at the Natural History Museum in London.During the Second World War, the Crown Jewels were moved from their home at the Tower of London to Windsor Castle. In 1990, The Sunday Telegraph, citing a biography of the French army general, Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, by his widow, Simonne, reported that George VI hid the Koh-i-Noor at the bottom of a pond or lake near Windsor Castle, about 32 km (20 miles) outside London, where it remained until after the war. The only people who knew of the hiding place were the king and his librarian, Sir Owen Morshead, who apparently revealed the secret to the general and his wife on their visit to England in 1949.\n\n\n== Ownership dispute ==\nThe Koh-i-Noor has long been a subject of diplomatic controversy, with India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan all demanding its return from the UK at various points.\n\n\n=== India ===\nThe Government of India, believing the gem was rightfully theirs, first demanded the return of the Koh-i-Noor as soon as independence was granted in 1947. A second request followed in 1953, the year of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Each time, the British Government rejected the claims, saying that ownership was non-negotiable.In 2000, several members of the Indian Parliament signed a letter calling for the diamond to be given back to India, claiming it was taken illegally. British officials said that a variety of claims meant it was impossible to establish the diamond's original owner, and that it had been part of Britain's heritage for more than 150 years.In July 2010, while visiting India, David Cameron, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, said of returning the diamond, \"If you say yes to one you suddenly find the British Museum would be empty. I am afraid to say, it is going to have to stay put\". On a subsequent visit in February 2013, he said, \"They're not having that back\".In April 2016, the Indian Culture Ministry stated it would make \"all possible efforts\" to arrange the return of the Koh-i-Noor to India. It was despite the Indian Government earlier conceding that the diamond was a gift. The Solicitor General of India had made the announcement before the Supreme Court of India due to public interest litigation by a campaign group. He said \"It was given voluntarily by Last Sikh Ruler to the British as compensation for help in the Sikh wars. The Koh-i-Noor is not a stolen object\".\n\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nIn 1976, Pakistan asserted its ownership of the diamond, saying its return would be \"a convincing demonstration of the spirit that moved Britain voluntarily to shed its imperial encumbrances and lead the process of decolonisation\". In a letter to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, James Callaghan, wrote, \"I need not remind you of the various hands through which the stone has passed over the past two centuries, nor that explicit provision for its transfer to the British crown was made in the peace treaty with the Maharajah of Lahore in 1849. I could not advise Her Majesty that it should be surrendered\".\n\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nIn 2000, the Taliban's foreign affairs spokesman, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, said the Koh-i-Noor was the legitimate property of Afghanistan, and demanded for it to be handed over to the regime. \"The history of the diamond shows it was taken from us (Afghanistan) to India, and from there to Britain. We have a much better claim than the Indians\", he said. The Afghan claim derives from Shah Shuja Durrani memoirs, which states he surrendered the diamond to Ranjit Singh while Singh was having his son tortured in front of him, so argue the Maharajah of Lahore acquired the stone illegitimately.\n\n\n=== Possible compromises ===\nBecause of the quadripartite dispute over the diamond's rightful ownership, there have been various compromises suggested to bring the dispute to an end. These include dividing the diamond into four, with a piece given to each of Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan, with the final piece retained by the British Crown. Another suggestion is that the jewel be housed in a special museum at the Wagah border between India and Pakistan. However this suggestion does not cater to Afghan claims, nor the reality of current British possession. These compromises are presently unaligned with the position of the British Government, which since the end of the British Raj is that the status of the diamond is 'non-negotiatable'.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Koh-i-Noor made its first appearance in popular culture in The Moonstone (1868), a 19th-century British epistolary novel by Wilkie Collins, generally considered to be the first full length detective novel in the English language. In his preface to the first edition of the book, Collins says that he based his eponymous \"Moonstone\" on the histories of two stones: the Orlov, a 189.62-carat (37.9 g) diamond in the Russian Imperial Sceptre, and the Koh-i-Noor. In the 1966 Penguin Books edition of The Moonstone, J. I. M. Stewart states that Collins used G. C. King's The Natural History, Ancient and Modern, of Precious Stones \u2026 (1865) to research the history of the Koh-i-Noor.The Koh-i-Noor also features in Agatha Christie's 1925 novel The Secret of Chimneys where it is hidden somewhere inside a large country house and is discovered at the end of the novel. The diamond had been stolen from the Tower of London by a Parisian gang leader who replaced it with a replica stone.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGolconda Diamonds\nList of diamonds\nList of largest rough diamonds\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to the Koh-i-Noor at Wikisource",

        "wiki": "Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.\nIt had been used by the early mughal rulers. The Fort stands on an ancient site and was traditionally known as Badalgarh. It was captured by Ghaznavi for some time but in the 15th century A.D. the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487\u20131517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556\u20131605).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli (step well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri's general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.\n\nRealising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, Abul Fazl, recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in Rajasthan. Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.It was only during the reign of Akbar's grandson, Shah Jahan, that the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the beautiful Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from white marble. He destroyed some of the earlier buildings inside the fort to make his own.The fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 Years. In the fort, they built the Ratan Singh ki haveli. The fort was invaded and captured by the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century. Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at Third Battle of Panipat by Ahmad Shah Abdali in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next decade. Finally Mahadji Shinde took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, in 1803.The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857, which caused the end of the British East India Company's rule in India, and led to a century of direct rule of India by Britain.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe 380,000 m2 (94-acre) fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river Yamuna and its walls are seventy feet high. Double ramparts have massive circular bastions at intervals, with battlements, embrasures, machicolations and string courses. Four gates were provided on its four sides, one Khizri gate opening on to the river.Two of the fort's gates are notable: the \"Delhi Gate\" and the \"Lahore Gate.\" The Lahore Gate is also popularly also known as the \"Amar Singh Gate,\" for Amar Singh Rathore.The monumental Delhi Gate, which faces the city on the western side of the fort, is considered the grandest of the four gates and a masterpiece of Akbar's time. It was built circa 1568 both to enhance security and as the king's formal gate, and includes features related to both. It is embellished with intricate inlay work in white marble. A wooden drawbridge was used to cross the moat and reach the gate from the mainland; inside, an inner gateway called Hathi Pol (\"Elephant Gate\") \u2013 guarded by two life-sized stone elephants with their riders \u2013 added another layer of security. The drawbridge, slight ascent, and 90-degree turn between the outer and inner gates make the entrance impregnable. During a siege, attackers would employ elephants to crush a fort's gates. Without a level, straight run-up to gather speed, however, that thing is prevented by this layout.Because the Indian military (the Parachute Brigade in particular) is still using the northern portion of the Agra Fort, the Delhi Gate cannot be used by the public. Tourists enter via the Amar Singh Gate.The site is very important in terms of architectural history. Abul Fazal recorded that five hundred buildings in the beautiful designs of Bengal and Gujarat were built in the fort. Some of them were demolished by Shah Jahan to make way for his white marble palaces. Most of the others were destroyed by the British troops of East India Company between 1803 and 1862 for raising barracks. Hardly thirty Mughal buildings have survived on the south-eastern side, facing the river, such as the Delhi Gate and Akbar Gate and one palace \u2013 \"Bengali Mahal\".\nAkbar Darwazza (Akbar Gate) was renamed Amar Singh Gate by Shah Jahan.  The gate is similar in design to the Delhi Gate. Both are built of red sandstone.The Bengali Mahal is built of red sandstone and is now split into Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal.\n\n\n== Other Historic sites inside Agra Fort ==\nJahangir's Hauz (tank) A.D. 1610: This monolithic tank (hauz) was used for bathing. It is 5 feet high, 8 feet in diameter and 25 feet in circumference. On the external side of the rim there is an inscription in Persian which mentions it as 'Hauz-e-Jahangir'. It was first discovered near the courtyard of Akbar's palace. In A.D. 1843 and later it was placed in front of Diwan-e-Am. In 1862, it was shifted to public garden (Company Bagh) where it suffered much damage. Later, Sir John Marshall brought it back to Agra Fort and placed there. Due to this hauz, the palace became famous as Jahangiri Mahal though it is part of Akbar's Bengali mahal.\nShahjahani Mahal (1628-35 A.D.): It is situated in between the white marble Khas Mahal and the red stone Jahangiri Mahal and is set transitionally in between these two residential complexes of two different ages. It is the earliest attempt of the Mughal emperor Shahjahan to convert an existing red stone building in accordance with his taste and it was his earliest palace in Agra Fort. It has a large hall, side rooms and an octagonal tower on the riverside. The skeletal construction of brick and red stone was all redone with a thick white stucco plaster and colourfully painted in floral designs. The whole palace once glistened white like white marble. On the face towards the Khas Mahal, is a large spacious white marble dalan, composed of five arches, supported on double pillars and protected externally by a chhajja. Its closed western bay houses, the Ghaznin gate, Babur's baoli and a well are situated beneath it.\nGhaznin Gate (1030 A.D.): The gate originally belonged to the tomb of Mahmud Ghaznavi at Ghazni. It was brought from there by the British in1842. Lord Ellenborough, the Governor General, in historic proclamation claimed, that these were the sandalwood gates of Somnath which Mahmud had taken to Ghazni in 1025, and the British had thus avenged an insult of 800 years back. This false claim was made just to win the goodwill of the Indian people. The gate is, in fact, made of local deodar wood of Ghazni and not of sandalwood. The style of decoration bears no resemblance to ancient Gujrati woodwork. There is also an Arabic inscription carved on the upper part. It mentions Mahmud with his epithets. Sir John Marshall had placed here a notice-board which described the whole episode about this gate. It is 16.5 feet high and 13.5 feet broad and its wight is about half a ton. It is made up of geometrical, hexagonal and octagonal panels which have been fixed, one with the help of the other into the frame without rivets. The idea to restore it at Somnath was ultimately given up and the gate was abandoned. Since then, it is stored in a room.\nJahangir's Chain of Justice (C. 1605 A.D.): This is the spot where Mughal king Jahangir instituted his 'chain of justice'(Zanjir-i-Adl) in c. 1605 A.D. He records in his memoir that after his accession, the first order he gave, \"was for the fastening up of the chain of justice so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practice hypocrisy, the aggrieved might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract my attention.\" It was made of pure gold. It was 80' in length and had 60 bells. Its weight was 1 Quintal. One end was fastened to the battlements of the Shah-Burj and the other end to a stone post on the bank of the river. This is not a myth. Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins personally saw it. It has also been depicted in a contemporary painting made in 1620 A.D. This was a way to redress the grievances of the people who could approach the king, the highest judicial authority of the empire, directly, without fee, fear or formality for immediate relief. There was no distinction of caste or creed or between poor and rich. Jahangir's administration of justice 'Adl-i-Jahangir' became a legend in Indian history.\nThe Muthamman Burj (Shah-Burj) & Jharokha (1632 -1640 A.D.): This beautiful palace surmounts the largest bastion of Agra Fort on the riverside, facing the East. It was originally built of red stone by Akbar who used it for jharokha darshan, as well as for sun worship, everyday at sunrise. Jehangir also used it as jharokha, as is faithfully shown in his painting made in 1620. He also instituted his 'Adl-i-Janjir'(the chain of justice) on its south side. Owing to its octagonal plan, it was called 'Muthamman Burj'. It has also been mentioned as 'Shah-Burj'(the imperial or king's tower) by Persian historians and foreign travellers. Its name jasmine tower or 'Samman-Burj' as recorded by the contemporary historian Lahauri is a misnomer. It was rebuilt with white marble by Shah Jehan around 1632-1640 A.D. He also used it for jharokha darshan which was an indispensable a Mughal institution as was 'Durbar'. It is an octagonal building, five external sides of which make a dalan overlooking the river. Each side has pillar and bracket openings, the eastern most side projects forward and accommodates a jharokha majestically. On the western side of this palace is a spacious dalan with Shah-Nasin (alcoves). A shallow water-basin (kunda) is sunk in its pavement. It is profusely inlaid. This dalan opens on a court which has a chabutara projected by a jali screen, on its northern side, a series of rooms leading to Shish Mahal on its western side; and a colonnade (dalan) with a room attached to its on the southern side. It is, thus, a large complex entirely built of white marble. It has deep niches on the walls, to break the monotony. Dados have repetitive stylized creepers inlaid on borders and carved plants on the centre pillars, brackets and lintels also bear exquisitely inlaid designs and it is one of the most ornamented buildings of Shah Jehan. This palace is directly connected to the Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas Mahal, and other palaces. and it was from here that the Mughal emperor governed the whole country. This burj offers full and majestic view of Taj Mahal and Shah Jehan spent eight years (1658-1666 A.D.) of his imprisonment in this complex, and it is said that he died here. His body was taken by boat to the Taj Mahal and buried.\nShish Mahal (A.D. 1631-40): It was built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan as a part of summer palace. Its most distinctive feature is glass mosaic work done on its walls and ceiling. These glass pieces have high mirror quality which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways in semi-dark interior. The glass was imported from Haleb of Syria. Shahjahan built glass palace also at Lahore and Delhi, but this is the finest of all.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Agra Fort won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2004. India Post issued a stamp to commemorate this event.\nThe Agra Fort plays a key role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery The Sign of the Four, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\nThe Agra Fort was featured in the music video for Habibi Da, a hit song of Egyptian pop star Hisham Abbas.\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj came to Agra in 1666 as per the \"Treaty of Purandar (1665)\" entered into with Mirza Raje Jaisingh to meet Aurangzeb in the Diwan-i-Khas. In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. Insulted, he stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nJama Masjid\nFatehpur Sikri\nLahore Fort\nRed Fort\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAgra Fort (1983), Uttar Pradesh \u2013 Archaeological Survey of India\nAgra Fort map (from Murray's travel guide, 1909)\n Geographic data related to Agra Fort at OpenStreetMap",

          "There is so much more to visiting the Tajmahal than admiring its architectural might, prowess, and secrets that many Harvardians cannot decipher! There is a story. There are stories. You have to immerse in them and sink into oblivion to truly travel back in time and enjoy the",
          "This is my fourth visit to tajmahal. It always looks more better and beautiful than previous. December end is high time for tourist so it's better to be there on time. Hiring guide will be better way to see it. Entry ticket for tajmahal and Tom's entry ticket is different. One",
          "What can one say about this famous monument and building? We have always wanted to see the Taj and were not disappointed. It is an amazing structure and the story behind it is also such a vital part of India\u2019s history. Our group stayed at a nearby hotel which was only about 1.5",
          "This was my second visit to the Taj Mahal. The first time I visited Taj I was a teenager and its beauty stayed with me. This time I wanted my 12 year old daughter to see the Taj and I didn't expect myself to be enchanted again, but I was. The first glimpse of Taj Mahal through",
          "been on the bucket list for a while. It was stunning. Got there at the end of the day so you could see the sun playing on the building as it went down. Will never ever forget this day. Take you time do not rush and sit down on the many chairs.",
          "Neither words nor pictures can do this amazing piece of architecture justice. It truly is something to be experienced. At first I was disappointed because heavy fog prevented our planned sunrise visit. But I now realize that anytime of day, this marvel will remain a wonder to",
          "Having seen and read so much about the Taj Mahal that I was both impressed and underwhelmed. Impressive because it truly is a magnificent example of Mughal architecture, and underwhelming because it\u2019s the same as it looks in photos and documentaries. The best bit of actually",
          "Because of its world-wide familiarity we thought it would be a bit of a cliche, but not so. It is stunningly, breathtakingly beautiful and I was surprised to be quite moved. We visited early morning but unsurprisingly there were many other visitors. However, our entry wasn't",
          "Up very early and off to Taj Mahal with our driver and guide, Guide today did a great job and was very satisfactory. Long walk in to the Taj. Walk by the stables and into the center between four gates. Took 22 years to build the complete complex (1631 to 1653). Built by the 5th",
          "You literally cannot appreciate the sheer beauty and splendour until you see it with your own eyes. It is absolutely magnificent. Its so amazing that it almost doesn't seem real. You MUST see it!",
          "This is probably one of the most beautiful man made construction I have seen in my life. Words cannot really explain what you feel when you enter the gate and have a first look on it. It just takes your breath away! I went there during the sunrise time as its the best time to",
          "The Taj Mahal is absolutly breath taking. It's a place you have to see in your lifetime. Must be the most impressive place I have ever been.",
          "We visited Taj Mahal whilst in India last year. An absolutely incredible experience! We got there at sun set for when the gates opened and I would definitely recommend doing this because there was hardly anyone in our photographs!",
          "An unbelievable experience, I thought I knew what to expect but being there was so much better. In the evening we viewed the sun setting from the garden across the river on the other side of the Taj Mahal. Then went into the Taj Mahal the next morning.",
          "A beautiful place often visited by tourists. However, on-site construction is not as impressive as on postcards. If you have time, you can visit, but it's definitely not a must-see for traveling around India. Prices for white tourists as per Indian conditions. The fountain",
          "The Taj is set in the middle of a large garden area next to a river. It is fabricated of all hand carved white marble and the detail once inside is stunning. Be sure to look up also. No pictures, food/water are allowed inside. Definitely best to come early to avoid the worst of",

          "Magical experience, except for people asking for selfies and it was busy it was just so beautiful and amazing experience",
          "It worth it for sure :) Lot of poverty in all Agra. Wish that the expensive entrance fees may be use to help people from Agra ... Where is going all these money that's the question?",
          "This is a stunning building and don't believe all you read that you must be there for sunrise to see a pink hue on the building! I went on a very cold, wintry day and silver light made the visit quite etheral. Of course the cold also meant there were far less visitors than",
          "You may ask and I'll tell you. The Taj Mahal is Spectacular without a doubt. A wonderful story but lets not forget he was a Moghul Emperor who had the coffers to build this fantastic edifice to profess his love but Joe average didn't have that chance. So, the building is",
          "Best way to see the Taj is at Sun rise (making sure the day you visit, you have checked the weather forecast), be there 30 minutes before this time, to avoid any lengthy queues, queuing will happen most times during the day. There are four entrances which can be used. One",

          "Too much has been said about it already, but no picture or words could do the sheer spectacle justice!",
          "Taj Mahal (=crown palace) is a beautiful building. Except architecture, You can find many other Persian elements (Like poem, calligraphy, etc.) there, which looks like mosques and palaces in Isfahan. But Taj Mahal has a unique ivory-white color that differs it from other",
          "Photos dont do this justice its simply amazing. You have to see it for yourself to appreciate the true magnificence. Helps on the day we went only 14,000 visitors instead of the normal 22,000!",
          "What ever you have seen or heard about the Taj is true. This is a fabulous place to visit. The only downside is the total chaos at the entrance. For a World Heritage Site, the organisers have very little control. Pushing and shoving appear to be the order of the day. Suggest",
          "The main reason for visiting Agra is to visit the Taj Mahal. It is a splendid building, remarkably grand and better in life than photos. We had an excellent guide (PK) who gave us good tips on the best views, quietest spots and loads of fascinating information about the Taj.",
          "A Must to visit and a guided tour. Outstanding place and gardens. Ticket is valid 3 hours once you are in. Not to be missed if you visit India and March is a great time to visit as if is not too hot but still shorts and T-shirt weather. The locals are annoying outside the gates",
          "Obviously, the Taj Mahal means different things to different people. It is a temple of love. It is a place where travellers have made it a lifelong ambition to get to. It is a worthy experience, as this building is truly glorious. It inspires you and it gives you peace. My",
          "The history of the Taj Mahal coming to life. Beautiful architecture and grounds with such rich heritage.",
          "We had been dreaming for a long time about some day visiting the magnificent Taj Mahal after reading about it and seeing it on TV. However, just seeing the Taj Mahal on TV and in magazines do not even compare to the \"feeling\" that you get while visiting this marvelous structure",
          "You just have to see it. The photos don\u2019t do it justice. One of the Seven Wonders of the World, it is well worth the visit. The Taj was at its best the day we were there as President Trump was arriving later in the day.",
          "Do the Agra Fort first to set the scene for your visit. The Taj Mahal was everything we expected and more. Hugely impressive and the highlight of our Indian tour.",
          "The Taj Mahal lives put to all expectations and is a breathtaking sight to see. Be mindful you have 2 hours to get round everything and be prepared for lots of people. Nothing will prepare you for the first sight you have of this magnificent building and it\u2019s history. You",
          "Didn't dissappoint, the sun was shining and it was absolutely stunning. The highlight of the trip to India",
          "Truly awe inspiring. First glimpses take your breath away. If you wish a professional photographer is on hand to take those iconic shots at INR100 for each photograph you buy.",
          "Our tour group was given the option to go for sunrise which we all jumped on. We were the first in line and it was definately worth it, we were able to get photos without to many people in the way. By the time we left, the crowds were really coming in. It is a very impressive",
          "What could I possibly say that hasn't already been said? Yup....its the Taj. It just twinkles when the sun light hits it.",
          "More than lived up to expectations. Lots of people but still didn\u2019t feel too overcrowded. Knowing the story behind the building makes it more poignant. Once in a lifetime visit, would recommend adding it to your list of travel musts.",
          "This building was everything we had hoped for and expected. We went at dawn and whilst it was busy it wasn\u2019t overcrowded. Some great photo opportunities. The main reason to go to Agra.",
          "Loved seeing the Taj Mahal. We had two visits with our guide, one in the afternoon and one first thing in the morning for the sunrise. Unfortunately, it was foggy so we could not see the sunrise but the structure is beautiful. It was very busy so get there well before the",
          "A nice, clean well known attraction of India. The differences between the dirt outside to the cleanliness inside is amazing.",
          "It is a monument by King Shajahan for his lovely wife Mumtaj, Built in AGRA on the banks of Yamuna. It took 22 years to complete the Monument. Made up of White Marbles.The stones fixed on the Marbles are from Afganistan, AFRICA, Belgium, and India, It is one of the Seven wonders",
          "Wonderful. As I said in the title, it's rare for an iconic place to live up to all the hype, but the Taj Mahal certainly did. Visited in late February (two days after Trump!). The weather was sunny but not blistering. The crowds were there but this is a bigger building and",
          "I'm glad that I saw the Taj Mahal 25 years ago during sunrise and at dusk so I can recall how beautiful that day was. This visit was bitterly cold with dense fog which persisted during our visit and not letting up in time with our morning schedule. A few of us went back later",
          "One of the few places on earth that actually lives up to - and surpasses - expectations. We got there at around 3.30pm when the crowds had thinned and the changing hues - and mood - of the structure could be appreciated fully as the slowly sinking sun reflected off the Taj's",
          "Most people have seen that Taj Mahal in numerous photographs such as the \"Diana\" one and expectations are very high. The walk down to the ticket area is pleasant enough but watch out for thieving monkeys. We visited on a sat when the Taj had been closed for a VIP visit so it was",
          "A fantastic experience which lived up to all of our expectations. The inlay work on the white marble is majestic and the recent cleaning and repairs to the buildings have returned the Taj to its full splendour. Coupled with story of its construction it truly is a wonder.",
          "We arrived before sunrise ( to watch the sun rise over the building and to beat the crowds) I was very much afraid that I\u2019d built this place way too big in my head and that when I saw it I\u2019d go \u201c ok that was alright, what\u2019s next\u201d but that\u2019s not what happened, it was awesome,",
          "Arrived at sunset and even though raining was stunning. Bit of a queue for epic photos but well worth it. Quite a walk for those you are less able bodied but a once in a lifetime must do. We arrived the day after Donald Trump so was looking exceptionally pretty with flowers",
          "Truly one of the biggest huge monument in this world, if you wish to visited keep on mind three simple thinks to duet, go at sunrise very early in the morning, the light reflecting the monument return as magic warm feeling, avoid crowdedness and confusions duet to lots and lots",
          "C'mon, do I have to spell it out for you? The king who commissioned this nearly bankrupted his kingdom and had to be placed under house arrest by his son. You can safely assume that the Pearl of India is worth close scrutiny. Just don't go on Friday- that's a worship day.",
          "There's not really much I can write about the Taj Mahal that people don't already know. It's one of the wonders of the world. Lots of tourists so try to get there early although you will still need to queue. Our tour group got there before 6am and still wasn't first. After",
          "I watched the evening light fall on Taj Mahal from across the river and then visited early the next morning. It was shrouded in fog and beautifully mysterious. It is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen.",
          "Used Gate 1 Travel for an 18 day tour of Northern India and Kathmandu. Highly recommend their service. India and Nepal are places where only the most experienced travelers should head out on their own. Let Gate 1 take care of everything for you.",
          "Absolutely breathtaking! Quite strict on what you can take into the Taj - have to scan handbags etc! Not really much else to say but definitely worth a visit!!",
          "Built as the final resting place for a favorite wife of a king, the Taj Mahal is simply stunning. You can't take a bad picture of the buildings and grounds. And if you're lucky, you'll see some monkeys to boot! If you are anywhere near the area, go!!! You'll be so glad you did.",
          "Go early. Sunrise is amazing. Sunset on the opposite bank of the river in the park is beautiful too.",
          "When visiting the Taj Mahal it is easy to see why it is one of the seven wonders of the world. It is elegant , beautiful and is a unique ,architectural masterpiece located in Agra. We attended at 6:30 in the morning in the second week of March 2020.{ Note: Very few people are",
          "The place lives up to its hype. Magnificent. Tour guides dwell on the fact that the king built it out of love for his wife. Beautiful! Of course, there is one nagging detail: He built it on the backs of thousands of slaves. Oh, the complexity of life. Go as early in the morning",
          "The monument itself is very beautiful. Here are some tips for Indian and Foreign tourists: - Book tickets online. During peak season, this will help you avoid the queue for tickets. - 5 - 10 mins on wikipedia will tell you all that you need to know about the Taj Mahal. Spend",
          "Banane wale ne bhi kya bana daala.... superb work at that era when there was no technology and no resources. I wish just Govt takes care of it, which they arnt. Not the taj but surroundings needs a make over big time. Only trump visit made it possible for 2 days.",
          "Taj Mahal is beautiful and a site to see. You cannot miss this when visiting India. A must see!! You have to go early, best to arrive at sunrise to avoid the crowds.",
          "I must say this was on my wife's bucket list not mine but after visiting the Taj Mahal it changed my mind. The enormity and detailing of the grounds and the structures blew me away. Pictures certainly do not do it justice. If you are in India it is definitely worth visiting",
          "Taj Mahal was our favorite, I can clearly say that. You might think it's overcrowded, but in Feb it was relaxed. We entered around late morning and there were not too many groups around. Our guide, we wanted to have someone with us to tell us more about it - keep it authentic,",
          "This was spectacular! We were extremely impressed. The photos don\u2019t do it justice. The size is much larger than we expected and the grounds were lovely. If you can, try to see it at sunrise and sunset. The light constantly changes as the sun rises and sets reflecting off the",
          "This is a work of art! We had so much fun with Ajmal. He knows all the right angles and lighting to get all the Instagram worthy shots! I own a bohemian boutique in the UK and he was SO good. Not only is he a good photographer but he is very knowledgable, polite, kind. He got us",
          "Everything you have seen and read about but more. Once passed the outside world full of hustle and noise you enter a truly amazing and tranquil place. Security was good in comparison to other places. Gardens were very well kept and the numbers were reasonable but this may have",
          "We were fortunate there were blue skies o our view of the Taj were fantastic. We booked our visit to the Taj with a tour guide and by god it was a blessing. I think if we tried to venture by ourselves we would have regretted it big time! My biggest tip is prepare for lots and",
          "Blessed with the most gorgeous weather. The very reason to visit India and we switched our plans from a sunrise visit to sunset on recommendation from guide due to haze in morning lately. Amazing place and did not disappoint- feel very blessed",
          "We went to see the TAj Mahal for a belated 25th wedding anniversary. It was worth the wait and everything we had expected plus more. You can read up on the history but this guy must have really loved his wife \ud83d\ude01 To get to the entrance you need to take an electric car. No petrol",
          "A stunningly beautiful place to visit, with beautiful surrounding gardens and buildings. Good to visit in the sunshine and also as the sun begins to set. Surpasses all the hype!",
          "I learned about this building since I was in school about 50 years ago. The building is impressive and so a lot of hype came along with it. The background story of this famous building has an equal epic proportion. There are no carved out markings where the diamonds and",
          "This is my second time visiting Taj Mahal. The first time, I was a kid and the day was clear and sunny. That was impressive and beautiful. This time it was a winter day, foggy and cold. So, the full glory of the Taj Mahal was not revealed. So, if you can, do not go to Taj Mahal",
          "Words cannot describe how fabulous this monument is and photographs do not really do it justice. The first glimpse we had through the arch was breathtaking. It was extremely crowded however when we arrived in the middle of the afternoon and the traffic was so heavy that the we",
          "It is a world-known Place and famous for its architectural work. I did visit this place where I remained awestruck. This place is worth seeing and moreover famous for its glory all over the world.",

          "well everybody loves a love story and that what youll find here, an absolute must do and go back in the morning at day break, the pink hue on the side of the Taj is spectacular. pay the extra 200rp and go into the main hall, its worth it",
          "Unbelievable experience with lot of cultural and unique monument of love which one can feel, a true story of love",

          "Wow, wow, wow. Iconic and everything people say it is. Must be on everyone's bucket list. Don't worry about trying to see it at sunset if it is smoggy. It just fades quietly into nightfall",
          "We opt for the sunrise time and we could not do better. Yes, we had to wait in the queue for 20-30 minute, just because they opened a bit later, but worth the time to be there before the crowd. Around 8 there was much more people, and queues to the mausoleum were really long.",
          "Words can hardly do justice to this amazing monument - one of the few places I have been that fully deserves all the hype and superlatives given to it. We visited in the early morning, arriving just as the gates opened at dawn and were amazed at how relatively quiet it was.",

          "A visit to the Taj Mahal was part of the itinerary on my recent tour of India. I was happy to go along with it as it's one of the Seven Wonders of the World after all. I was simply unprepared for the beauty and tranquility of the place in spite of the crowd of visitors there.",

          "We got there just after sunrise. I'd highly recommend this as it was still busy but not overwhelming. You can't take your eyes off it, just beautiful to look at. You'll only be inside for about 5 minutes, but the beauty of it lies looking at the outside, the other buildings",
          "We had our visit the day before Donald Trump arrived so the Taj Mahal was looking at its best and to be fair they were trying to clean up Agra as best as they could. If you can - GO EARLY before the bulk of the visitors arrive as its the only way you will get pictures that do",
          "Just WOW! We booked this holiday a year ago and have looked forward to seeing the Taj ever since. It was amazing, everything we had imagined and more! What a love story. If you get chance, nearb is a theatre to watch the drama of the story of the Taj - well worth a visit to get",
          "My second visit here after a space of 25 years. Absolutely stunning. Gardens were immaculate- perhaps after Donald Trumps visit earlier this week! Note it is shut on Fridays. An absolute must see!",
          "There is no dearth of tourist places in Agra. Agra is one of the most beautiful tourist destinations in Uttar Pradesh. Taj Mahal is an important place in Agra where every year a large number of tourists come from all over the country and abroad. Our experience of visiting Agra",
          "Magnificent but elegant Islamic style building, a tourist destination should never miss while visiting India. To most tourists, the main attraction of this place is the building itself, and it will takes you a long time taking pictures everywhere.",
          "A fantastic experience, only ruined by amount of so called guides & so called official photographers. It\u2019s unfortunate that we have to pay 10 times the amount in entrance money than Indian people, we were also caught out BY THE NEW RULE THAT IF YOU ARE THERE LONGER THAN 3 HOURS",
          "This wonder of the world must be seen to be believed, it requires a long journey to get there but oh so worth it. We arrived just on sunrise and yes you will be harassed to buy trinkets from the many many locals trying to earn a living but we were advised not to say no as that",

          "So finally we have come to see this and oh boy, big WOW, massive gasp, breathtaking. Nothing I have ever seen compares to Taj Mahal after Kaaba (Mecca) as a mosque or holy place. Our G Adventure guide took us from our hotel at 04:55 hrs to arrive to Taj Mahal at 05:00, we were",

Some do and some don\u2019t but you don\u2019t have to worry about the Taj Mahal since it over delivers on almost every measurement that I can think of. Yes it\u2019s busy, no one will give you space to take",

          "I highly recommend visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise. It\u2019s even more strikingly beautiful at this time of day. The sky turns a marvelous pink, and the site gets increasingly interesting as the fog rolls in and out. Also recommend seeing it with a local tour guide to both hear",
          "We arrived early to get into the queue early. So glad we did as by the time they opened at 6. 45am the queue was huge. When the gate opens it is like a black Friday everyone pushes forward. Quite an experience. This place is weirdly so peaceful considering how many people were",
          "Wow what can I say. One of the best days ever! Really enjoyed our trip to the Taj Mahal, we had a guide called Asif who looked after us from start to finish. We were able to take some lovely photographs with the help of our guide, we also had some professional ones taken, to",
          "We enjoyed the architecture and the gardens, people were friendly and our guide told the story\u2019s that surround this wonder...quite sad really. We did enjoy our stay.",
          "Obviously this is a must on any visit to Agra. It is truly beautiful, but does get very crowded. We were there in January, and it had been raining so we were quite lucky, and it was not that busy. The gardens are fabulous as is the building. You need a guide to fully appreciate",
          "India in general was a huge eye opener, getting to Agra was an eventful 4 hours in a car (and same back). We visited in the cooler month so great that way, no major fog, motorway was quite, not many western tourists but no issues and no moon. Beautiful architecture, I would",
          "Simply the most wonderful experience and not to be missed. Allow time to spend here. To enter in the afternoon and stay for sunset allows you to see the change in colour as the sun goes down. Check up on what you can and can\u2019t take in with you - it\u2019s quite restrictive.",

          "Nothing more to say but it\u2019s definitely part of of the seven wonder of the world! It\u2019s crowded when we went there since it\u2019s the peak season but everything was still spectacular!",
          "Can anyone give this site a score less than 5?! The only point of note is the huge price difference for locals versus tourists. Is this a form of racism?",
          "This is surly a place worth visiting. Mughal emperor Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, as a tribute to his favourite wife, who died in childbirth in 1631. The construction began in 1632 and was completed in 1653. It is a UNESCO world heritage site since 1983. it",

          "For crores that the administration earn in entry fees you would expect them to be far more organized and clean. The whole route to the Taj is full of touts and people trying to fleece you. There are no clear guidelines or information kiosks. We didn't even know that our two kids",

          "Although we paid 1300 Rupees to enter the Taj Mahal it was a Majestic. We went at Sunrise. It was nice and empty but foggy. We were pestered to take a guide on numerous occasions. But still something worth seeing. The mausoleum wasn't worth the money though.",

          "Have been visiting the wonder of the world for many years. Taj looks exquisite now. Have not seen the Marble shine so much and it\u2019s white now. While the over all management of the crowds inside the monument has improved , the selling of tickets , security check , cloak rooms",
          "The crowds this winter evening were overwhelming. But the Taj itself compensated well for this. We were there at sunset with the thinning crowds and were rewarded with emptying grounds.",

          "No photo by any camera in world can give you the real feeling of visiting Taj mahal in person. Its grand, its beautiful. Its symmetric. Its based on layout of Heaven (Jannat) Its a architectural masterpiece. and Its FLOATING...... on wooden platform over 180 wells taking water",
          "The entrance to the site was not accessible by car, so we took an exciting ride on a tuk tuk (which was slightly hit by the car behind when the driver stopped too quickly!) then a short walk towards the north gate, which opened up to a stunning view of the Taj Mahal. I got a",
          "My review is based not on the building and structure, yes, it was built by a silly king for a wife that he loved..bla bla bla on the love stuff of the yesteryears. It was breathtaking for a minute and then I could smell BO, urine etc etc on the outskirts of the building. Hoards",
          "Taj mahal very beautiful place to visit. This is also religion tour especially for moslem. Enjoy Taj Mahal.",

          "A unique experience visiting one of the wonders of the world. Though our visit was during the Christmas holiday time, the crowds were manageable. The only issue we had was that the weather in December can be foggy and cold.",
          "A once in a lifetime experience.wah Taj!Never to be missed.The entire city comes alive because of the Taj.",
          "I visited the Taj Mahal on Dec 1st 2019 in a small group tour of Rajasthan. There are no words to fully express this amazing place. Nothing I had ever read or seen about it (or India) came anywhere near this experience of actually being at this place. Regardless of your beliefs",
          "Standing out, tall and pristine, milky white, on the banks of the river Yamuna, the Taj Mahal is a tribute and monument to the love Shah Jahan had for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. This white marble architectural marvel is known for its symmetry standing amid the water ways casting its",

          "We woke up at 6:00 am to make our way to the Taj Mahal at 6:30, still a bit dark, goofy and polluted. It was worth getting there early and have the early morning view of this magnificent architectural structure. Avoid any and all so called \u201cGovernment approved guides\u201d Do some",
          "Truly a must see!! This world wonder is one of the most beautiful structures I've ever laid my eyes one! There were tons of visitors the day I went.",
          "The Taj is much more impressive outside than inside. The inside ceiling is very low compared to the actual height of the dome. Super crowded of course but probably the only reason you're in Agra. In March it was already very very hot.",
          "Tourists come to Agra with one purpose - to see Taj Mahal. With all those fairy tale love story and amazing documentary of the monument, people's desire and expectation to see the Taj are rocket high. We visited Taj in early December. In terms of weather, the temperature (16",

          "A highly underrated wonder, a master piece that every person should see. I had lesser expectations honestly, but once you see it, the sheer beauty of the Taj will mesmerise you. What could get better surely, is the way tourists are managed, given the huge potential it has, the",

          "A great guide who knew all the history made it a fascinating story. A monument which signifies a great love story. Beautiful artistry and symmetry. Nothing compares. India has amazing buildings and temples which go back to the 12th century. It is really worth a visit. Much",
          "Worth seeing this monument. Such a beautiful landmark in India. Must view for everyone. Lots of people outside India also enjoy visiting this.",
          "Despite the cold and the smog, the Taj is a truly amazing place to visit. Do your research first as ticket prices vary depending on whether you're a local or foreigner. We bought foreigner tickets online which made it easier to enter. This also gave us shoe covers and two",
          "We came early at 8am and successfully avoided the crowds. After 10am it starts being a lot busier. Entry is a bit on the pricey side (1300 INR), but then again there is only one Taj Mahal in the world :) Two hours are more than enough to see the entire complex.",
          "Picturesque! Such an iconic landmark so beautiful you are lost for words! Not too crowded which made it even better. There is some people that go around and try and get paid for taking photos of you though, the only downfall",
          "Definitely worth seeing, such a beautiful monument which is very well maintained. For foreign tourists the price is 1300 rupees each. This includes shoe covers (shoes must be covered to walk on the Taj Mahal) and water bottle (both picked up from nearby table). Don\u2019t trust",
          "The Taj Mahal was on my bucket list so I was so excited to visit in person. On arrival in Agrar we couldn't see a metre in front of us due to the smog . The dawn rising was postponed with a 0930 arrival in the hope of getting in earlier than than the mobs but late enough to see",
          "Loved the experience at the monument per se, one to be for ever cherished. I just have a comment regarding the bathroom at the gate where the tickets are bought. The hygienic conditions were really bad, dirty floors, and the smell was awful. It would help if this is taken care",
          "Booked the 6am entry online (in winter it opens at dawn but th crowd at 6:35 was ok. Yes it is a tourist \u201cmust do\u201d, but it really is fabulous. The organisation is v good. The crowds and selfie-takers are everywhere but there you go.",
          "Lovely edifice and surrounded by structures of red stone and gardens lots of interesting optical illusions Careful of touts",
          "We were fortunate that when we visited the sun shone and we had a wonderful guide. The Taj was not too busy actually, the place was clean and indeed the building itself is very impressive. Glad to have been able to tick this off our bucket list!",
          "I took a day trip to Agra from Jaipur with Rajasthan Discovery. I had read some reviews stating that the city of Agra was not really nice. In fact, it is located halfway between Delhi and Jaipur and c. 3 1/2 h drive, so I chose Jaipur for my base. The drive was pretty intense -",
          "We arrived in the morning when the Taj was covered in thick dense fog. By the time we left her beauty was revealed like lifting a vail. The beauty of the Taj is really mesmerizing. The story as told by the guide is alluring just like the majestic Taj Mahal. The crowds include",
          "I was on a business trip in Mathura and was encouraged by my colleagues to visit the Taj Mahal since it\u2019s only few kilometers away. They even provided me with a guide, and grabbing the opportunity was definitely a good decision on my part. Being a foreigner, I have to pay 1,300",
          "We visited in early November & although it is a spectacular site it was spoilt by not seeing in it's true splendor with the sun shining on it in fact we never did see the sunshine all day. Do not be put off visiting the Taj Mahal if you the weather is going to be bad it's",
          "Such a popular destination that it\u2019s hard sometimes to be stunned but had a good guide and really enjoyed the visit. Hard to put the design perfection into words. While the place is always filled w tourists, it seems manageable and you can still find the slots for that must",
          "Ahmad is such a warm personality and highly motivated guide (recommendable!). I truly enjoyed walking with my sister of us through the area. taj mahal was beautiful and it was a relieve to walk in such a quiet and peaceful environment. he is very smart to take photo shoot...",
          "What can possibly be said about one of the 7 modern wonders of the world that has not been said? This is number 6 of the 7 for me and Wow, wow, wow, oh wow!! You cannot prepare yourself for this experience - it is absolutely breathtaking. We were blessed with glorious sunshine",
          "Good monument which is still not destroyed by rulers like Hampi, else there are plenty of other monuments which are in ruins.",
          "No matter how many photos you see of the Taj Mahal, nothing prepares you for the beauty of this building. Visiting the Taj Mahal should be on everyone's bucket list. It is beyond beautiful and that it was completed in 22 years, without modern technology, using 22000 labourers",
          "It was a few years ago since I was here. They have developed some nice walkway areas and you have plenty of walking without the motorists. Entry and paying is smoother. You don\u2019t have to buy the footwear cover anymore. It is now included in the fee (which has gone up again).",
          "So glad that we took the time to visit the Taj Mahal it was an amazing experience. We were lucky that the fog disappeared while we were there. Would not recommend more than one day in Agra thou.",
          "Do your research before you go. We entered by East Gate which I hear is the most quiet entrance. Go first thing in the morning, rug up and embrace the cold weather because then will be the fewest crowds. Explore the gardens and take photos from every angle. There are amazing",
          "Definitely worth a visit but check if you go make sure you check the weather! I arrived @ 6am with a guide and could not visualise ANYTHING! It was a bit of a joke, so CHECK!",
          "The Taj Mahal is one of those places that you read about in books and imagine what it must be like to visit. It was more than I could ever imagine. The size and shape of the white marble structure is amazing to witness, allowing you to pause and sit and just take in the",
          "Truly breathtaking and completely awestruck by its beauty. From the moment I saw it and till I came out of it, I was engrossed to it. Classic example of Mughal architecture and you can see tinge of Iranian and Turkish architecture too. Must Visit :-)",
          "I was touched by the love story behind it. It is amazing how Shah built this magnificent place to burry his loved wife. He engraved the rare marble of it with her favorite flowers made of her favorite gemstones. It is a must see place.",
          "Legend has it that Shah Jahan ordered that all the chief artisans who built the structure be blinded and maimed so that the Taj Mahal\u2019s unique beauty could not ever be replicated. Historians have only been able to determine that workers did suffer from deformities.",
          "For some reason we were sceptical before we went, it could never be as magnificent as people say. It is. We went at Sunrise and as the Sun comes up the light changes and the Building changes colour. As go through the archway to enter the area it almost seems one dimensional but",

          "I first saw it in 1970 ,then in 2014 and now 2019. Each time for two consecutive days .it is amazing. Can\u2019t stop looking for hours at the huge white structure in the back drop of blue sky and empty space all around, every half exactly symmetrical , and pure white, Needs touring",
          "An iconic building that must be seen once, but I am not sure the experience is worth a second visit. The building itself is beautiful, but understand that depending upon the time of day you visit, the site will be very, very crowded. Like most tourist groups we were forced to",
          "Stunning. Be aware that at this time of year haze/fog can mean that sunset/sunrise are not at all spectacular. We went at 3pm and had lovely light.",
          "There is so much to love about this place and having a credible guide pre-arranged made all the difference to our understanding of the logistics and aspects of the construction and ongoing events around this building and environs. very impressive indeed.",
          "A bucket list visit although part of a spiritual tour. It was a pity there was so much smoke etc but that I think is part of a winter visit. An interesting place with some great history non your own you may be able to explore that at greater Leisure",
          "Okay, so this is an iconic structure and from a distance is magnificent. We had a guide to take us around, which is just as well, because there is no information (literally no information) anywhere within the boundaries of the Taj Mahal. If we hadn't had a guide, or not done any",
          "Very crowded in Dec, due to their 15 days public holidays. Keep close when you go in a group! Need a proper guide to tell the story of Taj Mahal & take you with good story of its beautiful things on it. It was made by various religion from many countries. Show how the people",
          "After many years of traveling to India for work, I FINALLY got to see the Taj Mahal. The timing was perfect - weather not too hot, a slight breeze, not overly crowded. It was truly an inspiring site. We had an amazing tour guide - his name was \"PC\". He knew so much history and",
          "We hired a guide which turned out to be the best thing we did. He knew where to take the best photos, was very informative etc. Guide only asked for 300R but we have him 1000R as he did such a great job. Queued a while at the East Gates to get tickets. We didn\u2019t go for sunrise",

          "Architetural wonder, truly beautiful as is the story behind its origin. Its very crowded and the guides will try to pressure you to buy all sorts of unecessary junk, as with rest of India. Apart from that, one of the most beautiful sites and the landmark of India.",

        "wiki": "The Shah Jahan Mosque (Urdu: \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u062c\u06c1\u0627\u06ba \u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f\u200e), also known as the Jamia Masjid of Thatta (Urdu: \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0679\u06be\u0679\u06c1\u200e), is a 17th-century building that serves as the central mosque for the city of Thatta, in the Pakistani province of Sindh. The mosque is considered to have the most elaborate display of tile work in South Asia, and is also notable for its geometric brick work - a decorative element that is unusual for Mughal-period mosques. It was built during the reign of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, who bestowed it to the city as a token of gratitude, and is heavily influenced by Central Asian architecture - a reflection of Shah Jahan's campaigns near Samarkand shortly before the mosque was designed.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe mosque is located in eastern Thatta - the capital of Sindh in the 16th and 17th centuries before Sindh's capital was shifted to nearby Hyderabad. It is located near the Makli Necropolis, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The site is approximately 100 kilometres from Karachi.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nShah Jahan sought refuge in Thatta from his father Emperor Jahangir, after he had rebelled against his father. Shah Jahan was impressed by the hospitality he received by the Sindhi people, and ordered construction of the mosque as a token of gratitude. Construction of the mosque may have also been partially motivate by a desire to help alleviate the effects of a devastating storm that impacted the region in 1637, and which had nearly destroyed Thatta.Shah Jahan's campaigns in Central Asia during this era influenced the mosque's architectural style, as Timurid influences were introduced into the Mughal Empire as his armies pressed towards Samarkand, in modern-day Uzbekistan. Despite the fact that the Emperor was not in the region during its construction, and so was unlikely directly involved in its construction, its profuse tile-work and intricate brick work indicate that it was funded by the Mughal's imperial coffers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPersian inscriptions at the mosque indicated that it was built between 1644 and 1647, during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. An eastern addition was completed in 1659, during the reign of Emperor Aurangzeb.\nThe mosque's mihrab had initially been incorrectly aligned with Mecca. The Sufi mystic, Makhdum Nooh, who is buried in the nearby city of Hala is said to have been approached by the mosque's planners in order to correct its alignment.  Popular tradition maintains that Makhdum Nooh then corrected the error overnight by the power of his prayer, thereby ensuring his status as a saint. Historical records show that the mosque's mihrab had actually been rebuilt a century after the mosque's construction.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Shah Jahan Mosque's architectural style is overtly influenced by Turkic and Persian styles. The mosque is characterized by extensive brickwork and the use of blue tiles, both of which were directly influenced by Timurid architectural styles from Central Asia \u2212 from where the previous rulers of Sindh, the Tarkhans, had hailed before the region was annexed by the Mughals in 1592.\n\n\n=== Decorative elements ===\n\n\n==== Tile work ====\n\nThe profuse use of tiles is considered to be the most elaborate display of tile work in the Indian Subcontinent. Unlike the Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore, another Shah Jahan era mosque, the mosque in Thatta does not employ the use of fresco.\nThe mosque's tiles represent a direct influence of the Timurid style. The mosque employs Cobalt blue, turqoise, manganese violet, and white tiles.\nThe mosque's dome is embellished with exquisite blue and white tile-work arranged in stellated patterns to represent the heavens. Its walls feature calligraphic tile work, signed by Abdul Ghafur and Abdul Sheikh.The tiles' location and arrangement displays Persian Safavid influence, and features several colours on a single tile, unlike tile work at Lahore which featured a single colour on each tile. The use of multicolour tiles and floral patterns reflects Persian Kashani influences.\n\n\n==== Brick work ====\n\nThe mosque features extensive brickwork laid in geometric patterns, which is a decorative element unusual for Mughal era mosques, and is an element of Timurid architecture adopted for use in the mosque. The mosque's brickwork was also influenced by Sindhi vernacular styles, which in turn was influenced by Persian architecture.  Brick work is most notable in the arcades surrounding the central courtyard, while concentric rings of brick are used to embellish the underside of peripheral domes.\n\n\n=== Layout ===\n\nThe layout of the mosque may have been influenced by the conservative Timurid-style Humayun Mosque in Kachhpura, near the city of Agra, in modern-day India. The main entryway into the mosque complex is through a Persian-style Charbagh, or quadrangle garden.\nThe main prayer hall is set to the west of its central courtyard, which features iwans, or portals, in each of its four cardinal directions. The courtyard is rectangular in shape, and measures 169 feet by 97 feet. It is surrounded by aisled galleries, which are lined with 33 arches.\nThe mosque's mihrab features pierced screens - an element that is commonly employed on Mughal funerary monuments, but unusual in Mughal mosques. The mosque features excellent acoustics; a person speaking on one end of the dome can be heard from the other end when the speech exceeds 100 decibels. Prayers in the main prayer hall can be heard throughout the entire building.The mosque is unusual for its lack of minarets. It has a total of 93 domes, the most of any structure in Pakistan.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nRestoration works were carried out by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1692, as well as by Murad Ali Khan Talpur in 1812. The mosque was inscribed on the tentative UNESCO World Heritage list in 1993, but has not been conserved to the same high standards as the Wazir Khan Mosque or Badshahi Mosque in northern Pakistan.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKhan, Ahmed Nabi and Robert Wheeler.

          "Sure the sign says 300 rupees for mobile phones (even if you do not intend to use it as a camera) but the charge is very selectively enforced. When I challenged one gate keeper he said no they were not being charged because they were muslims going for prayers. Another said no",

        "wiki": "Agra ( (listen)) is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is 206 kilometres (128 mi) south of the national capital New Delhi. Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh and 24th in India.It has been speculated that in Mahabharata the city Agra is referred to as Agravana which translates as \u201cfront of the forest\u201d. It is mentioned that the Shurasena dynasty of Lord Krishna maintained an outpost at Agravana. Greek geographer Ptolemy referred to Agra by its modern name in his Geographia and placed it in his world map in 2nd century AD. The 11th-century Persian poet Mas'\u016bd Sa'd Salm\u0101n writes of an assault on the fortress of Agra, then held by King Jaypal, by Mahmud of Ghazni. Despite his surrender, Mahmud sacked the place. It was mentioned in 1080 AD when a Ghaznavide force captured it. A 17th century chronicle called the Agra before Sikandar Lod\u012b's time (1488\u20131517) as an old settlement which was merely a village, owing to its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sikandar was the first sultan to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1504, its administration having previously been under Bayana. He governed the country from here and Agra assumed the importance of the second capital. He died in 1517 and his son, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b, remained in power there for nine more years. Several palaces, wells, and a mosque were built by him in the fort during his period. He was finally defeated at the Battle of Panipat in 1526. Between 1540 and 1556, Afghans, beginning with Sher Shah Suri, ruled the area. It was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1648. The city was later taken by the Marathas and later still fell to the British Raj.\nAgra is a major tourist destination because of its many Mughal-era buildings, most notably the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur; and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with Lucknow and Varanasi. Agra is in the Braj cultural region.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nAgra features a semiarid climate that borders on a humid subtropical climate. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season. However, the monsoons, though substantial in Agra, are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India. This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a humid subtropical climate.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nAs of 2011 India census, Agra city has a population of 1,585,704, while the population of Agra cantonment is 53,053. The urban agglomeration of Agra has a population of 1,760,285. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Agra city has an average literacy rate of 73%, below the national average of 74%. Literacy rate of males is considerably higher than that of women. The sex ratio in the city was 875 females per thousand males while child sex ratio stood at 857. Agra district literacy rate is 62.56%.According to the 2011 census, Agra district has a population of 4,380,793, roughly equal to the nation of Moldova or the US state of Kentucky. This gives it a ranking of 41st in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of 1,084 inhabitants per square kilometre (2,810/sq mi) .\n52.5% of Agra's population is in the 15\u201359 years age category. Around 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nHindus are 88.8% while Muslims are 9.3% of the population in Agra district. Hinduism, Islam and Jainism are the major religions in Agra city with 80.7%, 15.4% and 1.0% of the population adhering to them; others are 2.9%. The Catholic minority is served by its own Metropolitan Archdiocese of Agra.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval era ===\nMasud Sa'd Salman claims to have been there when Mahmud assaulted Agra, claiming the Raja Japal surrendered after seeing a nightmare. Mahmud however proceeds to pillage the city. The history of the city before the Muslim conquerors is unclear. The 17th century chronicler named Abdhullah said it was a village before the reign of Sikandar Lodi. The king of Mathura had used the Agra fort as a jail. The degradation in the status of the site was a result of the destruction brought upon it by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sultan Sikandar Lod\u012b, the Muslim ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, shifted his capital to Agra in the year 1504. Before this, it was under the lordship of Bayana. After the Sultan's death, the city passed on to his son, Sultan Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b. He ruled his Sultanate from Agra until he fell fighting to Mughal Badshah B\u0101bar in the First battle of Panipat fought in 1526.\n\n\n=== Mughal era ===\n\nThe golden age of the city began with the Mughals. Previously known as Akbarab\u0101d, Agra was the capital of the Mughal Empire under the Badshahs Akbar, Jah\u0101ng\u012br and Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. Akbar made it the eponymous seat of one of his original twelve subahs (imperial top-level provinces), bordering (Old) Delhi, Awadh (Oudh), Allahabad, Malwa and Ajmer subahs. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted his capital to Sh\u0101hjah\u0101nab\u0101d in the year 1648.Since Akbarab\u0101d was one of the most important cities in India under the Mughals, it witnessed a lot of building activity. Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of the river Yamuna. The garden is called the Ar\u0101m B\u0101gh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson Akbar the Great raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarab\u0101d called Fatehpur Sikri. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.\n\nHis son Jah\u0101ng\u012br had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort or L\u0101l Qil'a. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Akbarab\u0101d its most prized monument, the Taj Mahal. Built in loving memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, the mausoleum was completed in 1653.\nSh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted the capital to Delhi during his reign, but his son Aurangzeb moved the capital back to Akbarab\u0101d, usurping his father and imprisoning him in the Fort there.\n\n\n=== Later periods ===\nThe Jat kingdom of Bharatpur waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra.After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of Marathas and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the British Raj in 1803.\n\nIn 1835 when the Presidency of Agra was established by the British, the city became the seat of government, and just two years later it was witness to the Agra famine of 1837\u201338. During the Indian rebellion of 1857 British rule across India was threatened, news of the rebellion had reached Agra on 11 May and on 30 May two companies of native infantry, the 44th and 67th regiments, rebelled and marched to Delhi. The next morning native Indian troops in Agra were forced to disarm, on 15 June Gwalior (which lies south of Agra) rebelled. By 3 July, the British were forced to withdraw into the fort. Two days later a small British force at Sucheta were defeated and forced to withdraw, this led to a mob sacking the city. However, the rebels moved onto Delhi which allowed the British to restore order by 8 July. Delhi fell to the British in September, the following month rebels who had fled Delhi along with rebels from Central India marched on Agra but were defeated. After this British rule was again secured over the city until the independence of India in 1947.\n\n\n=== Legacies ===\nAgra is the birthplace of the religion known as D\u012bn-i Il\u0101h\u012b, which flourished during the reign of Akbar and also of the Radhaswami Faith, which has around two million followers worldwide. Agra has historic linkages with Shauripur of Jainism and Runukta of Hinduism, of 1000 BC. The Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri are all UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n== Administration and politics ==\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\n\n==== General administration ====\nAgra division which consists of four districts, and is headed by the divisional commissioner of Agra, who is an IAS officer, the commissioner is the head of local government institutions (including municipal corporations) in the division, is in charge of infrastructure development in his division, and is also responsible for maintaining law and order in the division.

Agra is commonly identified as the \"City of Taj\".Completed in 1653, the Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal king Shah Jahan as the final resting place for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Finished in marble, it is one of India's many beautiful monuments and is set amidst landscaped gardens. Built by the Persian architect, Ust\u0101d '\u012as\u0101, the Taj Mahal is on the south bank of the Yamuna River. It can be observed from Agra Fort from where Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n gazed at it for the last eight years of his life, a prisoner of his son Aurangzeb. Verses of the Quran are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are 22 small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Taj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant dome of the Taj Mahal has a diameter of 60 feet (18 m), and rises to a height of 80 feet (24 m); directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Shah Jah\u0101n's tomb was erected next to hers by his son Aurangzeb.

The red sandstone fort was converted into a palace during Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's time, and reworked extensively with marble and pietra dura inlay. Notable buildings in the fort include the Pearl Mosque or Mot\u012b Masjid, the D\u012bw\u0101n-e-'\u0100m and D\u012bw\u0101n-e-Kh\u0101s (halls of public and private audience), Jah\u0101ng\u012br's Palace, Kh\u0101s Mahal, Sh\u012bsh Mahal (mirrored palace), and the Musamman Burj.The forbidding exteriors of this fort conceal an inner paradise. The fort is crescent-shaped, flattened on the east with a long, nearly straight wall facing the river. It has a total perimeter of 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi), and is ringed by double castellated ramparts of red sandstone punctuated at regular intervals by bastions. A moat 9 metres (30 ft) wide and 10 metres (33 ft) deep surrounds the outer wall.\nChhatrapati Sh\u012bvaj\u012b visited the Agra Fort, as a result of the conditions of the Treaty of Purandar entered into with Mirz\u0101 R\u0101j\u0101 Jaisingh to meet Aurangzeb in the D\u012bw\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101s (Special Audience Chamber). In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. An insulted Sh\u012bvaj\u012b stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666. Fearing the dungeons and execution he escaped on 17 August 1666.The fort is a typical example of Mughal architecture, effectively showing how the North Indian style of fort construction differed from that of the South.

In the literal meaning, 'Go' translates to 'cows', and 'vardhana' translates to 'nourishment'. Another meaning of 'Go' is 'the senses' and 'vardhana' can also mean 'to increase' - thus the name is also translated by devotees of Krishna as 'that which increases the senses' in their attraction to Krishna. In this connection, it is believed that the personality of Govardhan blesses the devotee by increasing his devotion (bhakti). Thus, by residing in the foothills of Govardhan Hill, all the senses and the respective duties of a soul attain divinity and are more inclined to perform service to Krishna.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGovardhan Hill, stretching from Radha Kund to south of Govardhan, is a long ridge that, at its highest, stands a mere 100 feet (30 m) above the surrounding land, belying artistic depictions of it as a steep hill. At the southern end of the hill is the village of Punchari, while at the crest stand the villages of Aanyor and Jatipura..The parikarma path of Govardhan hill is intersected by some part of district Bharatpur of Rajasthan.\n\n\n== Background ==\nGovardhan Hill is considered a sacred site because it is the setting for many legends relating to the life of Lord Krishna, the deity believed to be embodied in the earth of the hill. Krishna and his brother Balaram are said to have spent many happy hours roaming among its shady groves, pools, caves and lush cow-pastures. An Eden-like sanctuary, the area's waterfalls, garden-grove (van), arbour (nikunj), water tank (kund), and flora are depicted in scenes of Krishna's adventures and raas with Radha.\n\n\n== Sites ==\n\nThe buildings and other structures on the Hill date from the sixteenth century. As of 2013, there is no known archaeological evidence of any remains of greater age.A few of the sites include:\n\nThe sandstone monument and lake of Kusum Sarovar.\nGiriraj Temple\nShri Chaitanya Temple, built of red sandstone and adorned with paintings of Krishna and Radha\nRadha Kund Temple\nMansi Ganga Lake\nDanghati Temple\n\n\n== Legends ==\nThere are legends of Krishna\u2019s saving the hill from a flood, \"dalliances with gopis (cow-herdresses)\u2019\u2019 and interactions with demons and gods. Artwork has been created of the Hill represented as a bull and a peacock, Krishna in a cave, the Hill as a mountain of food Annakut, depicted in the floods brought on by Indra, and with the Yamuna River.According to the Giriraj Chalisa (a forty verse hymn dedicated to Govardhan Hill) Govardhan in human form, went to Vrindavan with Pulastya and decided to stay there evermore. The sight of Govardhan Hill and Yamuna River in Vrindavan attracted the demigods who took forms of trees, deers and monkeys to live in Vrindavan.\n\n\n=== The lifting of Govardhan ===\n\nGovardhan Puja is celebrated on the day after Diwali. It is the day upon which Lord Krishna defeated Indra, the deity of thunder and rain. As per the story, Krishna saw huge preparations for the annual offering to Indra and questions his father Nanda about it. He debated with the villagers about what their 'dharma' truly was. They were farmers, they should do their duty and concentrate on farming and protection of their cattle. He continued to say that all human beings should merely do their 'dharma', to the best of their ability and not pray or conduct sacrifices for natural phenomenon. The villagers were convinced by Krishna, and did not proceed with the special puja (prayer). Indra was then angered, and flooded the village. Krishna then lifted Mt Govardhan and held it up as protection to his people and cattle from the rain. Indra finally accepted defeat and recognized Krishna as supreme. This aspect of Krishna's life is mostly glossed over - but it actually set up on the basis of the 'karma' philosophy later detailed in the Bhagavad Gita.According to ancient Vaishnava legends the Vedic Deva (demigod akin to guardian angel), Indra (god of rain & lightning) was feared by human beings because he would either give the people no rain or flood them if he was not satisfied with their worship. When Krishna found out, he opposed the performance of sacrificial worship for Indra. He emphasized the importance of karma and doing ones duty. This made Indra angry at the boy Krishna (one of the incarnations of the Supreme God ).\nIndra thus invoked many clouds to appear in the sky and schemed to flood the region with rains lasting for seven days and seven nights. Krishna in reply then lifted Govardhan Hill, under which all the animals and people of the region took shelter, safe from the rains of Indra's fury. Ultimately, Indra accepted defeat. He offered his prayers and left to his heavenly kingdom.\nIt also represents the downfall of Indra, and a new beginning in Hindu philosophy, from a more sacrificial/ appeasement oriented worship, to a more spiritual plane of thought. This evolution of thought in Hinduism was brought about by Krishna, and therefore he has been the most important Hindu deity since then - considered an 'avatar' of the supreme.\n\n\n== Recent development ==\nIn 2018, the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath declared Govardhan as a pilgrimage centre (teerth sthal) along with Mathura, Baldev, Nandgaon, Radhakund and Gokul. Yogi Adityanath Government has also planned to rejuvenate Govardhan Parvat with Dvapara Yuga flora like kadamb, karoli, tamal, pakkad and tilkan.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHare Krishna\nVrindavan\nGovardhana sila\nGovardhan Puja\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRajasekhara Dasa (2001).

        "wiki": "Agra ( (listen)) is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is 206 kilometres (128 mi) south of the national capital New Delhi. Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh and 24th in India.It has been speculated that in Mahabharata the city Agra is referred to as Agravana which translates as \u201cfront of the forest\u201d. It is mentioned that the Shurasena dynasty of Lord Krishna maintained an outpost at Agravana. Greek geographer Ptolemy referred to Agra by its modern name in his Geographia and placed it in his world map in 2nd century AD. The 11th-century Persian poet Mas'\u016bd Sa'd Salm\u0101n writes of an assault on the fortress of Agra, then held by King Jaypal, by Mahmud of Ghazni. Despite his surrender, Mahmud sacked the place. It was mentioned in 1080 AD when a Ghaznavide force captured it. A 17th century chronicle called the Agra before Sikandar Lod\u012b's time (1488\u20131517) as an old settlement which was merely a village, owing to its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sikandar was the first sultan to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1504, its administration having previously been under Bayana. He governed the country from here and Agra assumed the importance of the second capital. He died in 1517 and his son, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b, remained in power there for nine more years. Several palaces, wells, and a mosque were built by him in the fort during his period. He was finally defeated at the Battle of Panipat in 1526. Between 1540 and 1556, Afghans, beginning with Sher Shah Suri, ruled the area. It was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1648. The city was later taken by the Marathas and later still fell to the British Raj.\nAgra is a major tourist destination because of its many Mughal-era buildings, most notably the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur; and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with Lucknow and Varanasi. Agra is in the Braj cultural region.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nAgra features a semiarid climate that borders on a humid subtropical climate. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season. However, the monsoons, though substantial in Agra, are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India. This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a humid subtropical climate.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nAs of 2011 India census, Agra city has a population of 1,585,704, while the population of Agra cantonment is 53,053. The urban agglomeration of Agra has a population of 1,760,285. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Agra city has an average literacy rate of 73%, below the national average of 74%. Literacy rate of males is considerably higher than that of women. The sex ratio in the city was 875 females per thousand males while child sex ratio stood at 857. Agra district literacy rate is 62.56%.According to the 2011 census, Agra district has a population of 4,380,793, roughly equal to the nation of Moldova or the US state of Kentucky. This gives it a ranking of 41st in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of 1,084 inhabitants per square kilometre (2,810/sq mi) .\n52.5% of Agra's population is in the 15\u201359 years age category. Around 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nHindus are 88.8% while Muslims are 9.3% of the population in Agra district. Hinduism, Islam and Jainism are the major religions in Agra city with 80.7%, 15.4% and 1.0% of the population adhering to them; others are 2.9%. The Catholic minority is served by its own Metropolitan Archdiocese of Agra.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval era ===\nMasud Sa'd Salman claims to have been there when Mahmud assaulted Agra, claiming the Raja Japal surrendered after seeing a nightmare. Mahmud however proceeds to pillage the city. The history of the city before the Muslim conquerors is unclear. The 17th century chronicler named Abdhullah said it was a village before the reign of Sikandar Lodi. The king of Mathura had used the Agra fort as a jail. The degradation in the status of the site was a result of the destruction brought upon it by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sultan Sikandar Lod\u012b, the Muslim ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, shifted his capital to Agra in the year 1504. Before this, it was under the lordship of Bayana. After the Sultan's death, the city passed on to his son, Sultan Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b. He ruled his Sultanate from Agra until he fell fighting to Mughal Badshah B\u0101bar in the First battle of Panipat fought in 1526.\n\n\n=== Mughal era ===\n\nThe golden age of the city began with the Mughals. Previously known as Akbarab\u0101d, Agra was the capital of the Mughal Empire under the Badshahs Akbar, Jah\u0101ng\u012br and Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. Akbar made it the eponymous seat of one of his original twelve subahs (imperial top-level provinces), bordering (Old) Delhi, Awadh (Oudh), Allahabad, Malwa and Ajmer subahs. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted his capital to Sh\u0101hjah\u0101nab\u0101d in the year 1648.Since Akbarab\u0101d was one of the most important cities in India under the Mughals, it witnessed a lot of building activity. Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of the river Yamuna. The garden is called the Ar\u0101m B\u0101gh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson Akbar the Great raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarab\u0101d called Fatehpur Sikri. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.\n\nHis son Jah\u0101ng\u012br had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort or L\u0101l Qil'a. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Akbarab\u0101d its most prized monument, the Taj Mahal. Built in loving memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, the mausoleum was completed in 1653.\nSh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted the capital to Delhi during his reign, but his son Aurangzeb moved the capital back to Akbarab\u0101d, usurping his father and imprisoning him in the Fort there.\n\n\n=== Later periods ===\nThe Jat kingdom of Bharatpur waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra.After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of Marathas and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the British Raj in 1803.\n\nIn 1835 when the Presidency of Agra was established by the British, the city became the seat of government, and just two years later it was witness to the Agra famine of 1837\u201338. During the Indian rebellion of 1857 British rule across India was threatened, news of the rebellion had reached Agra on 11 May and on 30 May two companies of native infantry, the 44th and 67th regiments, rebelled and marched to Delhi. The next morning native Indian troops in Agra were forced to disarm, on 15 June Gwalior (which lies south of Agra) rebelled. By 3 July, the British were forced to withdraw into the fort. Two days later a small British force at Sucheta were defeated and forced to withdraw, this led to a mob sacking the city. However, the rebels moved onto Delhi which allowed the British to restore order by 8 July. Delhi fell to the British in September, the following month rebels who had fled Delhi along with rebels from Central India marched on Agra but were defeated. After this British rule was again secured over the city until the independence of India in 1947.\n\n\n=== Legacies ===\nAgra is the birthplace of the religion known as D\u012bn-i Il\u0101h\u012b, which flourished during the reign of Akbar and also of the Radhaswami Faith, which has around two million followers worldwide.

It is one of the New Seven Wonders of the world, and one of the three World Heritage Sites in Agra. Agra is commonly identified as the \"City of Taj\".Completed in 1653, the Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal king Shah Jahan as the final resting place for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Finished in marble, it is one of India's many beautiful monuments and is set amidst landscaped gardens. Built by the Persian architect, Ust\u0101d '\u012as\u0101, the Taj Mahal is on the south bank of the Yamuna River. It can be observed from Agra Fort from where Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n gazed at it for the last eight years of his life, a prisoner of his son Aurangzeb. Verses of the Quran are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are 22 small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Taj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant dome of the Taj Mahal has a diameter of 60 feet (18 m), and rises to a height of 80 feet (24 m); directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Shah Jah\u0101n's tomb was erected next to hers by his son Aurangzeb. The interiors are decorated with fine inlay work, incorporating semi-precious stones.\n\n\n=== Agra Fort ===\n\nAgra Fort (sometimes called the Red Fort), was commissioned by the conquering Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great in 1565, and is another of Agra's World Heritage Sites. A stone tablet at the gate of the Fort states that it had been built before 1000 but was later renovated by Akbar. The red sandstone fort was converted into a palace during Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's time, and reworked extensively with marble and pietra dura inlay. Notable buildings in the fort include the Pearl Mosque or Mot\u012b Masjid, the D\u012bw\u0101n-e-'\u0100m and D\u012bw\u0101n-e-Kh\u0101s (halls of public and private audience), Jah\u0101ng\u012br's Palace, Kh\u0101s Mahal, Sh\u012bsh Mahal (mirrored palace), and the Musamman Burj.The forbidding exteriors of this fort conceal an inner paradise. The fort is crescent-shaped, flattened on the east with a long, nearly straight wall facing the river. It has a total perimeter of 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi), and is ringed by double castellated ramparts of red sandstone punctuated at regular intervals by bastions. A moat 9 metres (30 ft) wide and 10 metres (33 ft) deep surrounds the outer wall.\nChhatrapati Sh\u012bvaj\u012b visited the Agra Fort, as a result of the conditions of the Treaty of Purandar entered into with Mirz\u0101 R\u0101j\u0101 Jaisingh to meet Aurangzeb in the D\u012bw\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101s (Special Audience Chamber). In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. An insulted Sh\u012bvaj\u012b stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666. Fearing the dungeons and execution he escaped on 17 August 1666.The fort is a typical example of Mughal architecture, effectively showing how the North Indian style of fort construction differed from that of the South. In the South, the majority of forts were built on the seabed like the one at Bekal in Kerala.\n\n\n=== Fatehpur Sikri ===\n\nThe Mughal Emperor Akbar built Fatehpur Sikri about 35 km (22 mi) from Agra, and moved his capital there. Later abandoned, the site displays a number of buildings of significant historical importance. A World Heritage Site, it is often visited by tourists.

Then the Mughal Emperor Akbar wanted to make Fatehpur Sikri his headquarters, so he built a majestic fort; due to the shortage of water, however, he had to ultimately move his headquarters to Agra Fort.\nBuland Darw\u0101za or 'the lofty gateway' was built by the great Mughal emperor, Akbar in 1601 CE. at Fatehpur Sikri. Akbar built the Buland Darw\u0101za to commemorate his victory over Gujarat. The Buland Darw\u0101za is approached by 52 steps. The Buland Darw\u0101za is 53.63 metres (175.95 feet) high and 35 metres (115 feet) wide. it is made of red and buff sandstone, decorated by carving and black and white marble inlays. An inscription on the central face of the Buland Darw\u0101za demonstrates Akbar's religious broadmindedness, it is a message from Jesus advising his followers not to consider this world as their permanent home.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== I'tim\u0101d-Ud-Daulah ===\n\nThe Empress N\u016br Jah\u0101n built I'tim\u0101d-Ud-Daulah's Tomb, sometimes called the \"Baby T\u0101j\", for her father, Mirz\u0101 Ghiy\u0101s Beg, the Chief Minister of the Emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br. Located on the left bank of the Yamuna river, the mausoleum is set in a large cruciform garden, criss-crossed by water courses and walkways. The area of the mausoleum itself is about 23 m2 (250 sq ft), and is built on a base that is about 50 m2 (540 sq ft) and about one metre (3.3 feet) high. On each corner are hexagonal towers, about thirteen metres (43 feet) tall. Small in comparison to many other Mughal-era tombs, it is sometimes described as a jewel box. Its garden layout and use of white marble, pietra dura, inlay designs and latticework presage many elements of the Taj Mahal.\nThe walls are white marble from Rajasthan encrusted with semi-precious stone decorations \u2013 cornelian, jasper, lapis lazuli, onyx, and topaz in images of cypress trees and wine bottles, or more elaborate decorations like cut fruit or vases containing bouquets. Light penetrates to the interior through delicate j\u0101l\u012b screens of intricately carved white marble.\nMany of N\u016br Jah\u0101n's relatives are interred in the mausoleum. The only asymmetrical element of the entire complex are the tombs of her father and mother, which have been set side-by-side, a formation replicated in the Taj Mahal.\n\n\n=== Akbar's Tomb, Sikandra ===\n\nSikandra, the last resting place of the Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great, is on the Delhi-Agra Highway, only 13 kilometres (8.1 miles) from the Agra Fort. Akbar's tomb reflects the completeness of his personality. The vast, beautifully carved, red-ochre sandstone tomb with deers, rabbits and langurs is set amidst a lush garden. Akbar himself planned his own tomb and selected a suitable site for it. To construct a tomb in one's lifetime was a Turkic custom which the Mughals followed religiously. Akbar's son Jah\u0101ng\u012br completed construction of this pyramidal tomb in 1613. The 99 names of Allah have been inscribed on the tomb.\n\n\n=== Jam\u0101 Masjid ===\n\nThe J\u0101ma Masjid is a large mosque attributed to Shah Jahan's daughter, Princess Jahanara Begum, built in 1648, notable for its unusual dome and absence of minarets.

It lies about 2.34 km (1 mi) north of the Taj Mahal. The pavilions in this garden are designed so that the wind from the Yamuna, combined with the greenery, keeps them cool even during the peak of summer. The original name of the gardens was \u0100r\u0101m B\u0101gh, or 'Garden of Relaxation', and this was where the Mughal emperor B\u0101bar used to spend his leisure time and where he eventually died. His body was kept here for some time before sending it to Kabul.\n\n\n=== Mariam's Tomb ===\n\nMariams Tomb, is the tomb of Mariam, the wife of great Mughal Emperor Akbar.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Wildlife SOS (WSOS) is a conservation non-profit in India, established in 1995 with the primary objective of rescuing and rehabilitating wildlife in distress in the country, and preserving India\u2019s natural heritage. It is currently one of the largest Wildlife Organisations in South Asia.\nAlthough internationally known for groundbreaking work of eradicating the cruel and barbaric practice of dancing bears from the streets of India while creating alternative livelihoods for the nomadic communities that depended on the exploitation of the bears, WSOS is also known for their efforts at rescue and rehabilitation of sloth bears and more recently elephants. Wildlife SOS also runs active projects focused on mitigation of human wildlife conflict with regard to species like leopards, macaques, elephants, moon bears, snakes, and other animals across several states in India. In addition, their work includes projects targeted at biodiversity and habitat conservation, awareness workshops and anti-poaching operations, as well as the rehabilitation of communities dependent on performing or working animals for their livelihood.\n\n\n== History ==\nWildlife SOS was founded in 1995 by Kartick Satyanarayan and Geeta Seshamani with the motive of protecting and preserving India's natural heritage, forests and wildlife. Initially dedicated to the eradication of the centuries-old practice of 'dancing' bears, the organisation now runs several projects across the country focused on rescuing wildlife in distress, mitigating man-animal conflict, habitat restoration, raising awareness, training enforcement officers, conducting scientific research and conservation studies, combating illegal wildlife poaching and trafficking and rehabilitating wildlife-dependent communities.\n\n\n== Mission ==\nWildlife SOS aims to protect and preserve India\u2019s wildlife, run rehabilitation and rescue centres for wildlife, conserve habitats, raise awareness, conduct research, study biodiversity and provide sustainable alternative livelihoods for communities otherwise dependent on wildlife to earn a livelihood.\n\n\n== Projects ==\n\n\n=== Sloth bears ===\n\nThe sloth bear (Melurus ursinus) is a medium-sized omnivorous species of bear found in the Indian subcontinent, predominantly India, with a small population in Nepal and Bhutan, and a sub-species in Sri Lanka. It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red list.One of the major causes of this is the exploitation of sloth bears as \u2018dancing\u2019 bears by members of a nomadic tribe known as the Kalandars or Qalandars (a trade declared illegal under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972), poaching and mistreatment of the animals to support the same, and trafficking of bear parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine \u2013 contributing to the declining numbers of sloth bears in the wild.\n\nWildlife SOS is credited with the eradication of the \u2018dancing bear\u2019 practice in India, rescuing bears from abusive owners and poachers and rehabilitating them in one of four centers in India-\n1. Agra Bear Rescue Facility (2000) in Agra\n2. Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Facility (2005) in Karnataka\n3. Van Vihar Bear Rescue Facility (2006) in Bhopal\n4. Purulia Bear Rescue Centre (2007) in West Bengal\nHere, the bears are given the medical care required, fed and allowed to socialize and roam in large, free-range areas. So far, more than 640 sloth bears have been rehabilitated by the organization. Wildlife SOS also carries out ex-situ conservation studies on the bears to enhance existing conservation measures for the species\u2019 survival and provides sustainable, alternative livelihoods to the bears\u2019 former owners and their families.\n\n\n=== Elephants ===\nThe Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus) is one of three recognized subspecies of the Asian elephant, native to mainland Asia and is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red list.\nElephants are under threat due to poaching, habitat destruction, man-animal conflict and encroachment. Ignorance and a lack of awareness have resulted in the continuous enslavement of these animals as working elephants- to beg, for display in temples, for performances and entertainment, ceremonies and physical labour.Wildlife SOS works in collaboration with the Government of India\u2019s Project Elephant and in partnership with the Haryana Forest Department at Ban Santour and the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department at Mathura to confiscate abused and mistreated elephants and provide them safe and healthy retirement in one of the two elephant sanctuaries it manages - the Elephant Conservation and Care Centre (set up in 2011) in Mathura and the Elephant Rescue Centre (set up in 2010) in Haryana. Wildlife SOS is currently caring for 23 rehabilitated elephants at these two centers. Medical treatment is made available for injured or sick elephants, and handlers, known as mahouts, are trained in humane treatment and management of the animals to improve their working conditions and reduce illicit poaching and mistreatment of the animals.\nIn 2014, Wildlife SOS announced its mission to rescue the then 67 remaining elephants from circuses in India.\n\nAt the beginning of 2016, 8 circus elephants were already in the care of the organization.\nThe Wildlife SOS Elephant Conservation and Care Centre (ECCC) was established in 2009 in collaboration with the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department to address the conservation issues facing Asian elephants in India. The main objectives of the centre are to eradicate illegal trafficking and holding of elephants, creating a platform for public awareness about the threats faced by Asian elephants, and ensuring the safety and protection of elephants in the wild while pioneering humane, modern and scientific management of elephants in India as a replacement of traditional methods of management that are fraught with risks to the elephants, owners and mahouts. ECCC serves as a model centre where humane management and training of elephants is practiced in a country where traditional management methods involving abuse and starvation have been in wide use for centuries.\n\nIn 2018, Wildlife SOS established India's first elephant hospital at its Elephant Conservation and Care Centre to provide specialized medical treatment to sick and aged elephants.\n\n\n=== Moon bears ===\nThe Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), also called the Moon bear, is one of four species of bear found in India. The range of the Asiatic black bear extends across the Himalayas, from Bhutan to Pakistan. It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red list.Wildlife SOS works in Kashmir to mitigate human-animal conflict that arises when bears wander into human settlements, incidents of which increase with deforestation and encroachment. Wildlife SOS has been working with the Jammu and Kashmir Wildlife Protection Department and the Forest Department since 2007, attempting to mitigate the conflict situation in the area.\nAs part of this project, known as the Moon Bear Conservation Project, Wildlife SOS conducts training workshops for the staff of the J&K Wildlife Protection Department with focus on capacity building and training in the use of specialized tranquilizing equipment and avoidance behaviour, carries out extensive studies on man-animal conflict situations and treats and rehabilitates animals that fall victim to confrontation- in particular moon bears and leopards. If possible, the animals are released back into the wild, else they are cared for and treated by Wildlife SOS staff at centers in Pahalgam and Dachigam in Kashmir.\n\n\n=== Leopards ===\nThe leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of five big cats found in India (also found in Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Pakistan) and is listed as near-threatened on the IUCN Red List.The animals are under threat due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to habitat encroachment and poaching.\nThe scrub jungle of Maharashtra was ideal habitat for the leopard until incentives for the cultivation of sugarcane lead to rampant callous farming practices and encroachment of the leopards\u2019 habitat, causing man-animal conflict to escalate. In 2008, Wildlife SOS collaborated with the state government on the expansion of the existing Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre in Junnar, near Pune, which currently houses 30 leopards. In addition, Wildlife SOS veterinarians and biologists conduct awareness workshops and training programs for local communities, the Forest Department, law enforcement, educational institutions and forums to help raise awareness and mitigate conflict situations.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity conservation ===\nWildlife SOS\u2019 habitat conservation project is situated near the Ram Durga valley in Koppal, Karnataka, and aims at protecting critical sloth bear habitat, threatened by illegal mining activities, rampant deforestation and encroachment by human settlements and industries which, along with poaching, massacred the wildlife of the region. In 2007, Wildlife SOS purchased nearly 40 acres of land in the region, creating a crucial wildlife corridor by allowing at-risk habitats to link up with a patch of Reserve Forest.The project was expanded in 2012, with the acquisition of an additional 10 acres of land, made possible by the support of BHEL, PSSR, Chennai. In consultation with experts, appropriate species of vegetation were selected and an extensive afforestation project was undertaken- planting nearly 10,000 saplings. A bore well, drip irrigation system and solar powered electrical fencing were acquired. Local community members were employed to manage and patrol the land, allowing the project to achieve a 90% plant survival rate in just 2\u20133 years. The vegetation flourished and, in areas where conservation efforts had been initiated earlier, species of wildlife have begun returning, including sloth bear, leopards and endangered species like the pangolin and star tortoise.\nIn addition, Wildlife SOS works with local communities and stakeholders, and works to educate them so as to increase their involvement in forest protection. The organization works to secure agricultural land along forested area, to serve as safe buffers for wildlife.\n\n\n=== Anti-poaching ===\nWildlife SOS works to curb the illegal trade and trafficking of wildlife and wildlife products - birds, mammals and reptiles, along with skins, bones and other body parts harvested from poached animals. Efforts at eradicating the practice of \u2018dancing\u2019 bears and related poaching have resulted in a marked reduction in bear poaching as per statistics. However, it still persists to feed demand in neighboring countries and Wildlife SOS has had to rescue more than 73 sloth bear cubs from poachers over ten years. Wildlife SOS\u2019 anti-poaching squad, Forest Watch, consists of a complex network of informants gathering critical information on poachers and criminals involved in the illegal wildlife trade. Forest Watch has assisted the forest department, the police department and law enforcement agencies to crack down on traffickers and smugglers, recover animal skins, body parts, ivory and sometimes live animals from poachers, and even provide legal assistance where required.Wildlife SOS offers further assistance by conducting grassroots-level training workshops focusing on capacity building and wildlife crime prevention in the field.\n\n\n=== Conservation Awareness ===\nUnderstanding that human involvement is crucial to conservation efforts, Wildlife SOS works with local communities in urban and rural areas to educate people regarding their local wildlife and ecosystem. Programs focus on teaching locals how to live sustainably with their environment, helping people deal with man-animal conflict in vulnerable areas and involving locals in conservation efforts such as tree-plantation drives in Jammu and Kashmir, plastic removal drives in Bannerghatta and cleaning the Dal lake with the help of students from local schools and colleges.\n\nWildlife SOS also routinely hosts workshops with law officers, forest department enforcement officers, police and customs officials to educate them about the wildlife trade, recognition of contraband, basic understanding of related law in the field, conflict mitigation and rescue techniques to control human-animal conflict.\n\n\n=== Rescue Helplines ===\nIn addition to its conservation projects, Wildlife SOS runs a 24-hour animal rescue with a team trained to perform emergency rescues of wild animals in three states \u2013 Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. The initiative was started in 1998, and now responds to nearly 300 rescue calls a month. The team rescues animals and birds that have been injured, abandoned or trapped in urban areas. Common rescues include monkeys, jackals, snakes, monitor lizards, deer and birds. These are given immediate medical attention and then released in suitable, safer locations in the presence of Forest Department officials. If release is not possible, the animals are relocated to the WSOS Rescue Centre in Gurgaon, set up in 1999. Since 2010, Wildlife SOS has been working in collaboration with the Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) to rescue wildlife trapped in urban localities, particularly snakes and crocodiles in Gujarat. Wildlife SOS\u2019s rescue team has animal-control contracts with Indira Gandhi Airport, Delhi Golf Club, Agra Developmental Authority, Delhi Jal Board, Akbars Tomb, residential colonies in the city and the Commonwealth Games village for the 2010 Commonwealth games hosted in India.\n\n\n=== Tribal Rehabilitation Program ===\nAs part of its project to eradicate the erstwhile practice of dancing bears in India, Wildlife SOS runs a simultaneous rehabilitation program for the Qalandar (Kalandar) tribals, for whom the bears provided a source of livelihood. The program, started in 2001, includes incentives for the bear-owners, in the form of sustainable livelihood alternatives. Wildlife SOS may provide seed funds for ventures or assist in the purchase of shops, handcarts, bicycles, cycle-rickshaws, auto-rickshaws or something that could support an alternative career for the individual, as well as providing training for alternative jobs as drivers, small scale poultry or goat farmers, metallurgy or gem-cutting and stone polishing for costume jewelry. Rehabilitated tribals form nearly 50% of the workforce at Wildlife SOS\u2019 rescue centres.\nWildlife SOS also organizes vocational courses and seed funding for the womenfolk of the community to start businesses in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, sets up self-help groups and provides them with marketing links, wherever necessary. This allows them to become secondary breadwinners for the family and empowers them through financial independence.\nFurther, Wildlife SOS provides educational opportunities for the children of Kalandars, helping them break out of the cycle of poverty and oppression and eliminating dependency on \u2018dancing\u2019 bears for income, thereby reducing poaching and mistreatment of the animals.Wildlife SOS is also involved in the rehabilitation of other traditionally wildlife-dependent communities including the Saperas, an originally nomadic, Muslim tribe of snake-charmers, hiring the community members to work with them as animal rescue workers.\n\n\n== Publications and Papers ==\nNotable publications include:\n1.

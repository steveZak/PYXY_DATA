        "wiki": "The Roger Williams Park Zoo of Providence, Rhode Island contains more than 150 animals from around the world in natural settings. In 1986, it became the first Zoo in New England to earn accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Founded in 1872, it is one of the oldest zoos in the nation.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Roger Williams Park Zoo first opened in 1872 as a limited collection of small animals, including raccoons, guinea pigs, mice, squirrels, rabbits, hawks, peacocks, and anteaters. Its first building was the Menagerie which opened in 1890. In the 1900s, the facility began to spread out over the entire park, featuring a variety of animals such as monkeys, hoofstock, bears, and big cats. In 1929, the Menagerie building was converted to a birdhouse; this was followed by the opening of an elephant barn in 1930 (which would later be converted to the Tropical America building). In the 1930s, a new sea lion pool was constructed. Bunny Village opened in 1949, one of the zoo's most popular exhibits.\nIn the mid-1960s, the zoo started to show signs of neglect. In 1962, Sophie Danforth founded the Rhode Island Zoological Society to increase public awareness of the neglect and to raise funds for improvement, and it remains the organization that supports and manages the Zoo. The Society opened a gift shop and food concessions in 1970, and all funds benefited the zoo. The zoo closed from 1978\u201380 to undertake an upgrade project. A children's nature center was added, as well as a naturalistic polar bear exhibit, a boardwalk through a wetlands area, and a North American bison exhibit. In the 1980s, a South American Pampas exhibit and a lemur exhibit were built. In 1986, the zoo's old stable/barn - which for many years had been home to the park's workhorses - was converted into an animal hospital, education department, and administrative offices. As a result, the zoo became the first in New England to receive accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.In 1987, a new master plan was formulated to dramatically expand the zoo. Over time, many new exhibits were built, including a new sea lion exhibit (1987), a humboldt penguin exhibit (1988), Plains of Africa (1991\u201393), Madagascar (1995), and Marco Polo Trail (1996). In 1989, the old Menagerie building was once again renovated, this time into a new gift shop. A new veterinary hospital opened in the spring of 2011. Hasbro's Our Big Backyard opened in 2012 as an interactive play space, with a second phase completed in 2014 featuring native New England animals. In the summer of 2012, the zoo opened new exhibits for takins, red river hogs, and king vultures.A new master plan was unveiled in 2015 for the next 20 years. It includes constructing a new rainforest building to be completed in 2018, a new exhibit for California sea lions and Humboldt penguins, a shorebird aviary, and a new tiger habitat. A complete reworking of the North America exhibit will feature grizzly bears, moose, and bighorn sheep.\n\n\n== Animals and exhibits ==\nThe zoo is home to more than 150 rare and fascinating animals from around the world. Major exhibits at the zoo include:\n\nAlex and Ani Farmyard: opened in 2014. It serves as a petting zoo where visitors can feed the animals food provided by the zoo. It primarily features domesticated fauna such as Flemish giant rabbits, Guinea hogs, Huacaya alpacas, Kunekune pigs, mini Anglo-Nubian goats, a miniature donkey, Shetland sheep, and various chicken breeds. It also features wildlife closely associated with farmland, such as barn owls. There are also interactive stations meant to mimic life on a farm, which are sponsored by the local businesses Munroe Dairy, Little Rhody Farms, and Bank RI.\nFabric of Africa: opened in April 1991, expanded in 1993, and renovated in 2008. It is the exhibit closest to the zoo's entrance. It features species indigenous to Africa, including African spurred tortoises, Ankole-Watusi cattle, aoudads, cheetahs, Grant's zebras, grey crowned cranes, red river hogs, and wildebeests. It also contains Jambo Junction.\nJambo Junction: features African bush elephants and Masai giraffes. Visitors can learn more about how the zoo cares for these large animals in the Elephant & Giraffe Pavilion, an indoor component of Jambo Junction. It is the only zoo in New England that contains African elephants, which occupy a 13,500 sq. ft. (1,254.191 sq. meters) enclosure. Though the three elephants they have are all females, the zoo plans to acquire a male in the near future so that they may breed. The Fabric of Africa was renovated in 2008 to revamp Jambo Junction, specifically to better accommodate the elephants. Jambo Junction is sponsored by the Robert F. Stoico/FIRSTFED Charitable Foundation and Textron.\nFaces of the Rainforest: A state-of-the-art building first opened in 2018 for neotropical life featuring a free-flight aviary, cascading waterfall, open concept primate habitat and more. Animals in and around the building include agoutis, blue-capped motmots, Bolivian gray titis, Chilean flamingos, dyeing poison dart frogs, giant anteaters, giant river otters, golden lion tamarins, green anacondas, guira cuckoos, hyacinth macaws, keel-billed toucans, Linne's two-toed sloths, pinktoe tarantulas, prehensile-tailed porcupines, ringed teals, smooth helmeted iguanas, southern black howlers, southern tamanduas, sunbitterns, white-faced sakis, white-faced whistling ducks, yellow-banded poison dart frogs, and yellow-rumped caciques.\nFeinstein Junior Scholar Wetlands Trail: a walk through area that reflects the natural wetland environments of Rhode Island, which are becoming increasingly rarer as the state continues to be urbanized. All wildlife is indigenous to Rhode Island, and while the animals are protected by the zoo they are not the property of them. It is known to feature Canada geese, great blue herons, several species of freshwater fish and turtles, and wood ducks. The trail is sponsored by the Feinstein Junior Scholar through the local Feinstein Foundation.\nMarco Polo's Adventure Trek: opened in 1996. It is one of two areas to focus on animals from Asia. It features fauna encountered (or likely to have been encountered) by the explorer Marco Polo, including dromedary camels, moon bears, red-crowned cranes, red pandas, Sichuan takins, and snow leopards.\nNorth America: features American bison, bald eagles, golden eagles, harbor seals, North American porcupines, Northern copperhead snakes, pronghorns, red wolves, timber rattlesnakes, and wild turkeys. The harbor seals can be viewed through an underwater window.\nOur Big Backyard: an interactive live play space for children and families. It promotes outdoor, free-ended play. The playspace is funded by the toy company Hasbro and the pharmaceutical company CVS Health. There are also exhibits for Aldabra tortoises and common ravens.\nWorld of Adaptations (formerly Australasia): it features animals primarily from Southeast Asia and Oceania, including Australian snake-necked turtles, babirusas, Bali mynahs, Bennett's wallabies, binturongs, common peafowl, eastern rosellas, emerald tree boas, Jambu fruit doves, king vultures, Komodo dragons, laughing kookaburras, Matschie's tree kangaroos, North American river otters, northern white-cheeked gibbons, radiated tortoises, tawny frogmouths, and wrinkled hornbills. The Komodo dragon at the zoo is the first of its kind in New England.There is also a multi-species exhibit for elegant crested tinamous, South American red-footed tortoises, and Reeves's muntjacs at the start of the wetlands trail.\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoger Williams Park\nRoger Williams (theologian)\nRoger Williams National Memorial\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "We visited on a rainy winter day and we may have been the only people there. This zoo is lovely. We understood that with the rain we wouldn\u2019t see all the animals. But we got to see many of them since multiple enclosures included an indoor viewing area in addition to the outdoor",

          "We had an enjoyable visit to the Roger Williams zoo. The zoo grounds were beautiful and the animals were wonderful. This zoo gave us the opportunity to get more up close with some of the animals that I had come to expect. Attended during off season which helped with the crowds.",

          "The zoo put us off the moment after we paid. No trail maps were present. When I asked about this, it was because they were \"under a conservation campaign.\" That's fabulous. Can I download one on the website? No. Is there one right here that I can take a photo of? No. I",
          "I unknowingly went to the pumpkin spectacular event with my children- having no idea that you actually walk through the zoo. I would never visit a zoo intentionally, no animals should be in these unnatural prisons. As we turned a corner we saw the three elephants - the music",

          "We went to the Pumpkin Spectacular and, although the traffic was a nightmare and the lines were VERY long, it was worth it. If you have never been, you need to put this Halloween event on your list. There are not words to describe this that would even come close to how great it",
          "We enjoy visiting every year. This time we visited the rain forest animals. We all really enjoyed them. This alone was worth the walk! I especially enjoyed the adorable monkeys and the Toucan. I suggest you print the map before you visit because they are \u201cgoing green\u201d and no",

          "Roger Williams is a beautiful park to visit. They schedule diverse activities for fami lies and friends to enjoy. There are concerts, food trucks, a merry-go-round, Swan paddle boats, an arboretum, a small zoo, festivals etc. Watch the schedule for offerings.",
          "Great place of kids and adults alike! Lots to see and do. Wish the cafe served better food, but the actual zoo is fun. Lots of different animals, petting and feeding places indoor and outdoor things to look at. Knowledgeable staff.",
          "Small and friendly yet covers the bases for seeing animals. We went on a cloudy Friday afternoon in Oct. Hardly anyone there and as such, many exhibits were closed. They were prepping for a pumpkin fest of sorts that night I think. Know the schedule before you go. But it was",

          "It is very clean and the animals seem well cared for. It wasn't crazy crowded even on labor day weekend. There are places to get food and plenty of clean restrooms. You can see everything in less than 3 hours which is a plus to me.",
          "Do not visit this zoo on a cloudy/rainy day since mostly every kind of outside activity is closed. All the kiosks were closed and none of the shows were running. It was not worth the expensive price and we could not find any workers throughout the park. It was abandoned and",
          "I heard it was the best zoo in New England but it certainly was not. I went to see the giraffes and was disappointed that you never really got close even if you feed them. I was able to see the entire zoo in 3 hours.",
          "This is a nice zoo and a good place to bring children. It is noticeable that the zoo is updating its displays to give the animals the room they deserve and more natural habitat. The rain forest area is beautiful and modern. There are other areas that need work to give the",
          "My family (husband, 14 month old, and myself) traveled from Northern New Hampshire to spend a night away in RI and visit the zoo. I work at a family owned and operated amusement park and receive tickets to other organizations in New England through the NEAAPA organization. I'm",

          "Good admission prices, lovely zoo, nice setting, a big selection of animals from elephants and giraffes to frogs, birds etc. The only animal that seemed unhappy was the bear which was continually pacing. We had a lovely day, good gift shops, reasonably priced photos. The real",
          "So our family loves zoo\u2019s. I think I would have given this a higher rating if we went on a different day. This was a Saturday and the zoo was having an event that evening so they were closing the zoo at 1pm....... but still charging the same admission fee.....the zoo seemed fine",
          "On the south side of Providence in a less congested area. 17.00 per adult and 12 per child or 129.00 for an annual pass for the family. Good array of animals in nicely kept and very clean exhibits. Pretty cool periodic events. Kids can feed the goats, sheep and giraffes. Enjoyed",
          "First let me say why only 4 stars. The zoo is 5 stars- the food at the zoo 0. The zoo gets better and better every year. I have been coming here for more than 30 years. It always amazes me. Today we got to pet armadillos! The otters are really fun to watch. From snow leopards,",
          "We definitely expected more but it was still pretty fun. Kids loved playing with the goats . Thought there would be more exhibits and shows",
          "We had a pleasurable visit here and saw some standard zoo animals. The kids enjoyed it. We have decent zoos in Baltimore and DC so this zoo didn't blow us away, but definitely not a waste of time.",
          "While visiting the Providence area, went to the zoo on a hot afternoon in August. The Roger Williams Park Zoo, has a nice variety of animals in well-maintained habitats. It took about 3 hours to se everything the zoo had to offer.",
          "We had a wonderful time at the zoo. My daughter who is 4 and I went on a special mommy/daughter day. Even with the heat we found plenty of shade and indoor attractions. We loved seeing the giraffes and elephants, the cheetah and the snow leopards were so close it was amazing.",
          "I was at the zoo with my grandchildren - everyone had a great time. The animals were interesting for the kids, the grounds are pleasant to walk and safe for the children to run around a little.",
          "Nice variety of animals, a newly built Amazon rain forest section! It might be cheaper to buy an annual membership if you are travelling with a bigger group!",
          "This zoo is clean and laid out very well. Can see everything in a couple of hours. Animals appeared cared for. Large park also for picnicking, walking, and general fun. Reasonable price,senior discount.",
          "I loved this place there's all kind of animals from all over the world the animals look healthy and well taken care of. I'm definitely impressed by this place and all the employees, they have a big, hard job to do and they do it with a smile. I will definitely be back there no",
          "Good time here with plenty of different animals to see. Not very crowded, so good views of everything. The zoo highlight for the day we visited was being able to pet armadillos but I liked the camel the best :)",
          "Great zoo with easy access and easy defined trails. It is clean and the animals looked well cared for. Pleasant staff make for a good outing.",
          "The Zoo is ok but the train ride is a big rip off. $3 per person regardless of age and membership. We thought it would be a tour. It took 5 minutes tops, (i\u2019m being generous) and went down a very short route and returned. Cars are very small for adults. Even my 7 year old",
          "Clean and great park for family with young kids. Not very crowded when we went which was great. We brought our stroller and our own lunch. Plenty of space with picnic tables to eat, again not overly crowded during the weekday that we went. The animals were awesome. Most of the",
          "Does not have much collection of animals. I found ticket rates are expensive. They could improve it better.",
          "Not the better zoo that I've seen, but neither the worst too! Great time at RWPZ, 18$ for the entrance not too expensive for what you gonna get. Always a good place to bring children.",
          "I arrived at this zoo, having taken a Lyft ride from the hotel. First animal I saw there was a zebra, so I stopped to look at the herd. Along the way, I also saw giraffes, elephants, and farm animals. I just wish I'd been able to walk the Marco Polo Trail, and chill in the",
          "Visiting the city to catch a flight and found this zoo to be the perfect activity for our family. A reasonable price with a lot to see. We visited during the summer so not sure how it would be in the winter but it worked out for us. They didn\u2019t open until 10 am, so by noon",
          "Beautiful setting and well planned zoo! The animals are spread out with a nice wide walking path so there are no \"traffic jams'. Many different species of animals from around the world and brief information on each one is well presented. Great place to visit!",
          "Came from out of town. There was a deal with our home zoo membership which saved us a bunch on the entrance fee. I had never seen anteaters or snow leopards before. Nice spot to take the kids",
          "I like this Zoo very much and we generally come several times over the course of the spring and summer. Each year it seems that the Zoo had added something new and improved upon the grounds etc. The variety of animals is impressive and the staff is friendly. I think it can be a",
          "Staff was friendly. Animals looked great, lots of knowledge. I have never seen a zoo where you could purchase wine or beer to drink",
          "I have moved a bunch and the first thing I try to do is find a local zoo to get my animal fix. The park was clean and full of animals. Easy to walk around and something that can last a few hours. Bunch of kids running around laughing and playing. Great day out with the family.",
          "The zoo was good, especially because we went on a weekday, so it wasn't overcrowded. The only downside for us was the limited restaurants in the area. The zoo itself has food kiosks, but we weren't interested in fast food. In order to get a full/healthy meal, we ended up going",
          "We had heard about this zoo and wanted to visit it on our day-trip to Providence. Well, this is the only place we went to in Providence that day! We stayed for nearly 5 hours, and we didn't have any kids with us! We thought it was going to be a relatively small zoo like the",

          "My wife and I don't like zoos because we don't like seeing wild animals in a cage or pen which is outside their natural habitat. We do understand why these animals are in these zoos, and the Roger Williams Park Zoo also made us appreciate the work zoo keepers, research and",
          "Took my girls to zoo. It is on small side, a lot of passes, nice shady walks. But for zoo it was hard to see animals. Nice places to ear, a lot of benches, great parking. But with nice weather it was hard walk around zoo.",
          "We were very surprised at just how nice this city zoo is. We had a great time viewing the elephants, giraffes and other animals. It was nice to see they do a lot for conservation, too. Although it is a small zoo, we highly recommend it and we have visited countless zoos",
          "Roger William's park and zoo, is in the south side of the city of providence, the zoo is very small, but a good place to bring youngsters, someanimals, like elephant, zebras and others kids like to see, and adults too, so, it has large botanical garden, lakes to where a",

          "My son and I enjoyed the elephants, the giraffes, and the red panda exhibits. Everything else we breezed quickly by and skipped the rain forest exhibit due to the long line. It was a small zoo. I enjoyed eating and watching the elephants, and surely they planned the layout",
          "Well starting from the entry to the entire visit the zoo is very well kept and there were really a good number of aninals. Kids had a great time there.",
          "Traveling from CT with the lil ones and teenager. Great small zoo for kids...older ones wont be impressed. Food was overpriced and cold. Great walk around...only downside was protestors...definitely go on weekday not so crowded.",
          "Great layout and well staffed. We went on the first Sunday in April and had a great time! Highly recommend if you're in the area. It was one of the better zoos I have been to. The rainforest section was our favorite-where we got up close and personal with a sloth!",
          "Zoo was a giant part of my childhood growing up. Has been around since before I was born. Has grown and gotten better over the years. For a small local zoo it is better then most bigger ones in bigger states. Lots of animals and plenty of things to do for kids of all ages.",
          "We took our grandchildren here and they loved it! Lots of animals to see and many things for the kids to do.",
          "My mom and I went to the zoo and we loved it we live in Providence and the first Saturday of the month is free and we got to go in for free it was so much fun we live like five minute away from the zoo and we never though it was going to be that good. The have so many species",
          "First of all there is a bus that takes you right to the front of the zoo. It is bus 6 and runs once an hour. Definitely take that one. There is so much to see at the zoo. We got there around 11 and left around 2pm. The food at Wilderness Cafe is pretty decent. There just aren\u2019t",
          "Taking a tour of a Zoo never is a sure view of animals on display. As we entered it was a slow day and noticed the first enclosure was clean and the Widabeast was happly standing in view for all to view but Zebra was not out do to cold temptures. Although all animals were not on",
          "Looking for something to do we decided to visit the zoo. I haven't been to a zoo in years and thouroughly enjoyed it. The two children, 3 and 5 year old had a great time also. Many of the animals were indoors dur to the time of year but were visitable without problem. The jungle",
          "Nothing is wrong with the zoo. It seems to be one of the nicer smaller size zoos\u2019 we\u2019ve visited. And as with what many reviews noted, it is half price for February. If you intend on visiting the zoo next month, read the bulletins online to see what exhibits are opened if you",
          "A lot of the exhibits were closed and the crowds were small due to the temperature. Favorite parts were the treehouse and the rainforest room. Lots of different animals and all of them were really active. Limited food options this time of year.",
          "located in the fantastic park in Prov.RI this is a really well run zoo.. all kinds of animals from birds,water,land just every kind of animal and they are well taken care of and in natural habitat areas. nice places to sit down to relax. huge parking area. very nice people are",
          "After visiting this place for the first time it blew me away! I immediately decided to become a member so I could get more out of my visits I highly recommend anybody that comes here who lives in Rhode Island to do so as well if that's the best bang for your buck ! At the same",
          "With all the fantastic upgrades of late, the Faces of the Rainforest is the best! The giant otters are so fun being interactive and just so playful. All the animals in the exhibit are so special and they just make you want to stay and watch for hours. And the building is WARM!",
          "We headed to the zoo in December since it was a nice toasty 50 degree winter day. Some exhibits were closed for the season, but nothing that disappointed our kids enough to really notice. The new rainforest exhibit will definitely warm you up as the temperature is the same as",
          "Went to the zoo for my 59th birthday, January 4th. The weather was 45 degrees and sunny. As a photographer this was a perfect day for a visit. Not all of the animals were out, but the ones I was most interested were out and about. I was very curious to visit the new FACES in",

          "Went to this zoo with my husband and toddler in December. The exhibits looked well maintained but some did look a bit cramped. Plenty of signage to tell you facts about the animals and to navigate the park. Due to the season, some animals and areas of the zoo were closed but",
          "We took our grand daughters (ages 2 & 4) to the zoo the day before Thanksgiving. It was pretty cool walking around but the zoo was great. We had it almost totally to our selves. They have many excellent exhibits including elephants, zebras, cheetahs, giraffes, and many other",
          "Nice zoo plenty of animals of all kinds nice gift shops and food plus has a nice park to walk through",
          "On thanksgiving day the zoo is open for free. They take donations of tinned foods though that go to charity. We werent expecting much. Were going to spend an hour or so. Realized there was much to do and see inside. Plenty of animals from all over the world. Clean, spacious,",
          "Went there with my wife and some friends, as we go yearly now. The price is reasonable, and the pumpkin carving is fantastic, with diiferent themed areas every year. Definitely recommend to couples or families looking for a traditional fall event to have.",
          "This is a nice zoo in a beautiful park like area. Fees to get in are reasonable so this is a good value. While not the largest or the best zoo we have visited, this has a large variety of animals. You should plan two or three hours although if you rush, you can get through it",

          "Phenomenal find!!! Breathtaking. Excellent for all ages. Walk along path showing 5,000+ carved pumpkins. Great for Halloween family fun!!",
          "The zoo is maintained very well. It is clean and in great shape. There are a lot of bathrooms which also seemed to be well maintained. The animals seem content and don't look miserable. The spaces to see the animals are great, too. It's a small zoo but it isn't lacking. It's",
          "We visited the Roger Williams Zoo on Columbus Day weekend. We attended the Jack O' Lantern Spectacular on Saturday night. We were in town for a hockey tournament and took the team. The price point is a bit high for the value. I think $12 adult and $10 for child is better price",
          "Hi All! This Zoo is very interactive, a rare find for many. It had many hand on activities for young children (ours are 7, 4, and 3), including a tree house, artwork area, and farm life. In the farm life area, the kids walk up to a large playset, can milk cows, collect eggs, and",
          "This is WAY better than Boston's zoo. Not that far from Boston, so GO if you are in or near Boston area. Some unusual animals here that I had not seen at other zoos. All the animals seemed happy, well cared for, and with natural looking exhibits and room to move around",
          "Zoo was clean overall and had nice facilities. Animal habitats seemed well kept. Was nice to see how engaging zoo staff was with children. Was also much larger than anticipating.",
          "Not many people in MA think of this place but I married a Rhody and I think this is way better than the MA zoos. Expansive and growing. Lots of animals. A great play area for the kids to run around when you\u2019re done. You can bring your own food for lunch, too. A great time",

          "It was a rainy day but we were able to visit all the zoo before the downpour. It is a nicely laid out area and they have some animals that I have never seen or heard of before. Worth a visit",
          "...I am not sure how to feel about zoos in general, for a small zoo it had quite a lot of animals and a good variety, but some of the enclosures were small. The African elephants were a treat. We arrived at feeding time for them which was a treat. They had a feed the giraffe",
          "My family enjoyed this zoo very much. Animals were very well cared for and the zoo was nice and clean. Would recommend for family\u2019s or even couples.",
          "Bigger than we expected and really cleverly put together so see a lot of different animals without any massive gaps between enclosures. Good value and very easy to spend a couple of hours here.",
          "I wanted to review this particular zoo on its own merits, and not so much comparing it to much larger ones in much larger cities (elsewhere in the U.S.). What mattered most to me was that the staff comes across as caring & concerned for their charges, and the place is kept tidy;",
          "So, we love going to zoo's, maybe by this point we have seen it all. But we were not impressed with it. It has the Disneyfied music in parking and appeal in the grounds. But we must have gone on a sleepy day for animals n guests. The zoo only opened 9-1pm due to a private event.",
          "We had a fantastic day! We got to see our favorite animals and my kids discovered the red panda making it their new favorite! We got the opportunity to have our faces painted and feed the giraffe, pet goats and alpacas and even pet an armadillo, we also went on a camel ride too!",
          "Great Zoo to visit with children. Lots of animals and a large area to walk around the different animals. They also have a Feed The Giraffe experience. Great zoo to spend a lot of time with kids.",
          "Visited August 18. Loved this zoo. Easy walking around, map provided very good. Just visited on route home to airport, a good way to fill 4hrs. Great to see the North American animals, esp the Bison and Bald Eagles. The eagle enclosure was brilliant for photos as looked so",
          "First of all the animals looked very kept care of and happy. The zoo was very clean and the food was good and good priced. The armidilos were amazing too touch.",
          "We have visisted the zoo many times, it's a great place for children to be themselves and enjoy nautre.",
          "Solid medium size zoo, with a wide variety of animals to see and experience. Not an inexpensive day for a medium to large families. Especially if you plan on grabbing a bite to eat here. But, young children to early teens are all smiles, all day. There are staff members",
          "I went here to spend a few hours before catching a flight, and boy was I surprised. This was a top notch zoo experience. And, I am used to big zoos, having been a zoo member in DC and Miami. Well, I had a chance to experience a large exhibit where wildebeests and zebras were",
          "First, I was reluctant to go to this zoo since a few people posted some bad reviews about it. In the end I went to this zoo and it was awesome, and i'm happy that I came here. This zoo was great and had animals I don't usually come across in other zoos like elephants, camels",
          "I chose to take my family here after reading the glowing reviews and I have to say we were all disappointed. It\u2019s a small zoo with a fairly small and uninspiring selection of animals. Previous reviews have highlighted how great the enclosure sizes are.. I don\u2019t agree. The",
          "I go to RW Zoo frequently with my toddler grandchildren. The animals are interesting, well cared for, and fun to see. The play area is spectacular with swings, a tree house, a small maze, all sorts of fun ways to burn off energy and have fun learning. It's very interactive.",
          "I visited the zoo for the first time in a year-and-a-half ago with my kids and I have to say that it is one of my local favorites. If you've been to any of the bigger zoos in Washington DC or California then this will seem small to you but compared to other zoos in Massachusetts",
          "The only thing worthwhile seeing are the elephants and giraffes. The elephant exhibit is beautiful! They have a great space. The giraffe feedings are a must. The other exhibits were a bit boring. Some exhibits the grass was so tall you couldn't see the animals. Also, some",
          "Perfect size for families. Lots of varied exhibits that are well maintained. All the animals are well cared for and a lot of effort seems to go into education and conservation. Well laid out for an enjoyable day with lots of interactive options throughout the facility.",
          "This is a rather small city zoo with limited number of animals. But its small size makes it walkable and probably good for younger children. Some areas could use better signage as it can be hard to know which way is out. We came around 4 pm and many animals were hiding, and some",
          "This zoo has beautiful grounds with plenty of shade as you walk around, even on a sunny day. The staff were super friendly. The exhibits looked well maintained. The highlight of our trip was the \"wetlands\" walk where we saw large fish and huge snapping turtles in the pond,",
          "Living in the Boston area, I've had many friends tell me that this zoo is definitely worth the trip compared to the local zoos -- and after visiting, I see why it was so highly recommended! This is a relatively small zoo, but the exhibits were great, and the small size meant",
          "This wonderful place is located within a larger city park and is a beautifully landscaped and maintained zoo. The exhibits are fun and educational as well as very natural looking. I can\u2019t wait for the new expansion to open with the otters and flamingos!",

          "This is a really nice zoo with lots of animals and it's worth checking out and is good for kids. We spent almost the whole day at the zoo and there were still some places we skipped. What's great - * There are some attractions (like feeding the giraffe) (for a fee) that",
          "The animal exhibits are well maintained, and the lay-out is well organized. While interaction opportunities seemed limited, there was one area where visitors could be close to farm animals (in addition to opportunities for a small additional fee, i.e feed the giraffe for $5) The",

          "We've been coming here for years and always have a great time. It's never been super crowded where you can't see the animals. It's clean which is great. They're always cleaning up. I like that there's different windows surrounding the enclosures so you can see at different",
          "Had a nice time viewing animals from Africa and Australasia. The otters were extremely cute and playful and the snow leopard was gorgeous. Most animals were in the shade and relaxing away from the viewing area, but that's not their fault. They were hot! Spent $50 on tickets and",

          "Visited this zoo in the morning before driving home (6 hour drive). We loved it. The layout was easy to walk through and there were plenty of animals to see - including ones we had never seen before. Employees were very friendly and engaging with my kids. There were plenty",
          "It\u2019s the perfect day trip for families, friends, and even an adorable date idea. It\u2019s big enough and has different things to do and so many beautiful animals to see. The elephants were my favorite. You can walk around the park area or sit by the lake or ride boat swans. It\u2019s",
          "Good parking, great animals, park was clean. I suggest going early morning or late afternoon, animals just lay around in the shade mid-day.",
          "Great 2 to 2 1/2 hour walk looking at the animals. Good layout and no bad smells. Great little area for the kids to play in the sprinklers while parents take a break. Animals were to hot to be very active but still beautiful. We didn\u2019t bring children and still had a amazing",
          "My husband and I love animals and we thought we\u2019d try the zoo out because we were visiting. I will say that it wasn\u2019t all bad. We enjoyed the elephant exhibit. However, the zoo is definitely geared for kids. They have several places in the zoo dedicated just for kids",
          "It seems that over the years the selection of animals has dwindled, and the pricing has gone up. It was clean though. Parking can be extremely difficult on a busy day, and they do not seem to move the lines quickly sorry to say, I will take Southwick Zoo over RW Zoo",
          "Went here with my wife and 4 year old on a rare Tuesday we all had off. $48 for the 3 of us with no deals or discounts for a birthday. Seems kind of pricey but I get that it costs a lot to provide proper care for all the animals. The zoo is on the smaller side but there were",
          "This is a tiny zoo and it costs almost 18 USD to get in. They don't have a lot of animals, but the ones that they have are really nice and well taken care. So it is a nice zoo, but super small and if you compare it to other zoos that charge the same, the value is not good.",
          "Been going to Roger Williams Zoo for at least 40 years, with my children and now with my grandchildren. Everyone always has a great time, animals/exhibits are always changing so there is always lots to see. Great outdoor activity!",

          "We had some time to kill and so we went to the zoo. It was cold, but they had a ticket special so why not? It was not too big, so we could walk through in just a couple hours. They had some awesome animals like giraffes and elephants. A great day with your bf or gf.",
          "Small zoo, needs major tlc. One thing that bothered me, the camel rides. One of the camels was chained to a fence by a two foot rope , and could not move at all. NO need for camels to be ridden.",
          "We spend 2 hours here with a 4 year old and 1 year old over Mother\u2019s Day weekend. The zoo was big enough with a good variety of animals and attractions to keep the attention of both kids without being overwhelming. We had a good time checking out all the exhibits and being able",

          "Went here with my husband and two teenagers and really enjoyed it. The zoo was bigger than I expected and had a nice variety of animals although we were disappointed they don\u2019t have any big cats like lions and tigers. They do have Snow Leopards and Cheetahs, though, so that was",
          "We weren't expecting much from this small zoo, but were so impressed! Well kept, flowers everywhere even in chilly spring weather. Walking paths were pleasant and we felt very close to most animals. Due to cold weather, giraffes and elephants were together inside and it was",

          "Just a spectacular event for everyone. Carved pumpkins hang from trees, sit in the ponds, while music from each display plays. The artistic pumpkins are amazing and will leave you wondering how they are created. There's plenty of fun foods, beer and non-alcoholic drinks. Sorry I",

          "Nice park and the Swan Boat rides were fantastic, Reasonable price for this adventure. Not so sure about the ZipLine attraction next to it though, A lot of noise for this ride that was very short ( one ascent and descent) . We got the impression from ads that it was a zip line",

          "We came here with our granddaughter on a hot Sunday morning. The car park was quite packed by 11am but the zoo itself didn't feel overcrowded. It was great seeing and reading about the animals but the highlight was the camel ride that felt like a nice end to our US visit.",

          "Although the rhinos and gorillas were missing, it was worth visiting and I would go again. I'm hoping when I do, that the Bison \"quarters\" receive a complete \"makeover\". The poor things, 3 of them, were in, I thought a small enclosure, not big enough for three big beasts.",
          "My family and I visited this zoo on a Saturday. It was nice and clean and the animals were fun to look at. It was a little smaller than others we have visited, but still a nice way to spend the morning.",

          "I was gifted a membership to the zoo when I had my first baby and it is the best present to get! I took my daughter once a week even though she was a baby and wasn't interested in the animals at the time. She did, however, love the Big Backyard. Now I take her and my baby boy",

          "What I like about this zoo is, they have many exhibits and every year they hold The lighting of the pumpkins! It's a great fun filled family place, lots to do at the zoo, ride duck pedaling boats, ride the carasaul with the kids. visit the awesome animals, or butterfly exhibit,",
          "Came to Providence for weekend. After spending hours in the pool we decided to head to the zoo. Great selection of animals. Kids loved it.",
          "Not the best zoo you'll ever visit, but it tries to be one of the best. Very reasonably priced, always trying to upgrade. It's a shame they got rid of the polar bears and some of the other animals seem.. well lonely. But all in all, worth a visit.",
          "Great collection of animals. Park and Zoo are very well maintained. Exhibits change often so always something of interest.",

          "When I was a child, we used to go to Roger Williams, or simply, the Zoo - often. I mean, once a week Sunday-drive often. But as I grew - the visits became something of the past. We moved away. We didn't visit. BUT - in June, we took the time to drive to the Zoo - to visit",

          "Went on Sunday afternoon to see. Was told the zoo is incredible. Unfortunately I didn't think it was. The animals weren't really out because it was hot out, walk ways are very narrow especially when people have strollers and a lot of stuff was closed. Not worth the price.",
          "I'm from the St Louis area. So if you've been to the zoo there (which is free and big), that's what I'm comparing to in my mind. This zoo has a very small selection of animals. It's nicely done but I'm not sure I'd pay $15 for each of us to get in again (that's the adult price).",
          "We drove about 1.5 hours from CT to visit this zoo. It's really nice, clean, and the animals look well taken care of. I wish it were a little bigger, but it's actually a great size if you have young children because it's manageable and not overwhelming. The size was just right",
          "This zoo just keeps getting better. They continually make improvements and it shows. It is not an enormous zoo. It is a good size to see the whole thing before the kids get cranky. It tends to be much less crowded in the afternoons after all the schools and camp groups go home.",
          "It has been a favorite spot of ours since before we had our daughter. Great layout and Awesome animals - really nice enclosures! The animals seem pretty happy - we particularly love the elephants and otters! Great membership reciprocity too. Our daughter loved the farmyard area",

          "Zoo standards have changed dramatically in recent decades, and this urban zoo doesn't have the space necessary to appropriately accommodate many of the large animals it houses. Even in the small space necessary, they could do more to provide something closer to original",

          "This was a wonderful experience; the staff is friendly, kind and caring. The animals are well kept and quite diverse. The walking paths are so lovely and expertly gardened. If you want to see wild animals, this is the place to go. Expect to be there for a couple of hours and",

          "This famous Zoo should be a MUST when visiting Rhode Island. The memories I and my children have of this most incredible reserve shall remain forever. The Zoo is extremely well kept with the utmost care of it's animals...all of which are housed in their natural habitat. This",
          "The park and the zoo are great places to spend time. Zoobalee is the best time to experience local foods and see various animals. Always enjoy visiting and spending time on park grounds. Fun for the whole family.",
          "I was amazed at this zoo and the expanse of size. What a perfect place to take kids or just go as a couple. Many species to see and a nice walk throughout the zoo. Clean and neat, easy to get around. They do lack some food choices, so plan accordingly. This is a MUST go for",
          "Really great zoo for a city so small! Well kept, reasonably priced, friendly, exciting and interactive. Paddle boating, petting zoo, horseback-riding, the carousel, the large park and great animal exhibits only make it better. It is nice for big and little kids alike as there",
          "Roger Williams Park Zoo is constantly improving for the animals they are in stewardship of. From spending the day to the Jack-O-Lantern Spooktackular, it's a great time for the family",
          "Great little zoo in the middle of Providence, enough for big and small kids alike. Year round things to do.",
          "Thank you Big Back Yard! Thank you Zoo animals! Thank you local attractions! You have made our 2 yr old very happy! Can't wait for summertime!",
          "I have really mixed feelings about zoos to begin with. This one is small, nestled inside a large park. There are some wonderful large animals like drafts and elephants, but I don't feel that the environment is best suited for them. So far, the best thing I've ever seen at the",
          "The Roger Williams Zoo is a great place to take young kids and grandparents alike. Easy walking terrain is good for pushing strollers. The zoo offers many animals and exhibits, but can be thoroughly seen in about 3 hours. Guests are allowed to bring coolers and enjoy the",
          "This is such a beautiful zoo, in the RW Park system, just off of I95. The animals and exhibits are attractively laid out, and the grounds are immaculate. Great place to relax and get close to nature's creatures.",

          "RWP Zoo is a wonderful zoo. I have been to zoos around the world, and this is one of my favorite. It is small, but it has a wonderful nature walk and an explore center for children of all ages. The staff at the zoo are also wonderful. They really care about the environment",
          "Love the place. Some of the animals were \"away\" due to the cold weather. Nice place to walk around and see all the animals. We are defiant taking advantage of our membership!",
          "Lots of wicked cool pumpkins! Lots of people be prepared to go slow, lots of little kids and strollers. It was cool but I wouldn't do it again!",
          "Years ago, this zoo was the best, the high point being the polar bears. They're gone now and they filled in the exhibit. They remodeled and, although clean, the zoo doesn't flow nice and the exhibit are so-so. The only reason it gets 4 stars is the addition of a phenomenal play",
          "This classic zoo placed at the center of Roger Williams Park in Providence is a great family hangout in a large, green park.",
          "First time here. Went for the Jacko lantern spooktacular and it was so much fun. Amazing work and a fun night off different than the normal things to do. We really enjoyed ourselves.",
          "We bought the tickets for Saturday on line. Everyone was mesmerized by the carvings, the number of pumpkins EVERYWHERE. Crowded, but well organized and moved at a gentle pace. Worth the trip from anywhere!",
          "We visited for the jack o lantern spectacular and it was absolutely amazing !! Parking is right there and they also serve beer and wine for you to drink on your walk through the trail . Good for couples like us and also families I'd imagine . Only recommendation is wait til",

          "The zoo isn't really open as a zoo as its dark and it's focused on the pumpkins for this event so that's my review...the pumpkin spectacular. They do a great job at keeping the line moving. There is plenty of coffee wine beer and hot chocolate to enjoy while walking around.",
          "A group of us from our Garden Club went to this event during this past week and were overwhelmed with the fantastic display of Jack-O-Lanterns. Before the event begins, while you are in line, some of the staff entertain you by telling Halloween jokes which was great especially",
          "Took a day trip to Proivdence ,RI and went to the Roger William's zoo & park. The zoo had many different animals and exhibits there. Grounds well kept. Great for kids. The park has a merry go round that has wooden horses like years ago. You can rent a paddle boat and",
          "Zoo Admission $15 adult, $10 children. They also have some great discounts for Military and Seniors. Feeding the Harbor Seals is the most fabulous activity for young and old and it's only $25 per person. Feeding the giraffes is only $5. Feeding the birds is $3 there are over",
          "kids love seeing a animals and like the fun backyard area but wish it was a little bigger with some more animals",
          "We went during our anniversary trip. It wasnt crowded and they have a great variety of animals. Only problem was finding something to eat (off season). Most concession stands closed for year. But the food we found was good. Loved the zoo",

          "Great display of many carved at lit pumpkins. It is suitable for all ages! We had a great time. Don't forget your camera!!",
          "This review is for the Jack-o-lantern spectacular (JOLS) at the Zoo. We went on a weekend so we had to do the online tickets, as the website said you would not be able to buy tickets there. Our tickets were for 8:30-9:30pm. We arrived at the address the site said to use, but",
          "I took a trip to the zoo on a Friday afternoon in October. I planned to see the animals by day and the pumpkins at night. I learned that the pumpkins exhibit required timed tickets to be purchased online before arriving at the zoo. I recommend this and from what it sounds like",
          "The jack-o-lantern spectacular was again a great experience with the change to a timed entry this year kept the lines down and manageable. In the past you could expect to wait HOURS in line to get into the park to see the the display and be expected to walk a very you long way.",
          "Came here with another couple after dinner. Fun trip for the evening for people of all ages!! The pumpkins are beautiful! Great scenic walk with pumpkins over 15 feet high in some areas. Movie characters, politicians, cartoons, animals, famous people, and works of famous art are",
          "A great place to visit. The kids love all the animals in a great setting. A special nite is the Jack O Lantern's that are lite up. It is a magical nite and something to be seen",
          "I have been to several of the Jack-o-lantern spectacular shows over the years, but this one was the best ever. A must see. The new timed ticketing was a great idea and has really helped improve the experience. The zoo is awesome and they always put together quality programming",
          "This is always a great place for anyone and families . The zoo is a fantastic experience for all ages. You can picnic ride padle boats take a walk ride a bike .Definitly a must visit for everyone",
          "Family friendly and well planned by park staff. Thousands of jack o lanterns displayed for easy viewing by all age visitors. Concession stands available throughout with snacks from popcorn to hot chocolate. Pumpkins grouped by theme with accompanying music. I had seen a tv",
          "You will spend about 1hr in the trail with nonstop cameras. No fee for parking unless premium $10, Lots and lots of pumpkins kind of sad that there wasn't anything to support troops but a whole lot of music and actors. Tuesday night at 6p and their parking lot was full so",
          "As part of our bus tour we had a buffet dinner catered at the zoo then walked through the Jack O'Lantern spectacular. It was so beautifully arranged. Each section included music and pop culture icons carved into or painted on the pumpkins. Plan on an hour to walk through and",

          "I have now visited this a few times but in the past it was such a madhouse, I tended to avoid it. This for some reason was the first year they got smart and did timed entry and ticket purchases online and what a difference. In the past it was a free-for-all of crowds fighting",
          "Saw lots of beautifully carved pumpkins of all shapes and sizes. Took roughly an hour to walk thru the Roger Williams Jack O' Lantern Spooktacular, but could have spent longer if we didn't have kids with us. Everywhere you looked there were pumpkins including hanging from trees.",
          "This place has improved dramatically since I came to town and saw it first in the 1970s. It has a nice walk-through feel, and the animals seem relatively happy, and it's a comfortable environment for both tourists and the animals who live there.",
          "Visited Sept 30,2016. Love the paths throughout and how clean the zoo is. The animals were so beautiful and well kept. All the workers and volunteers are very friendly and informative. Great areas for children.",
          "We came here for the Jack-O-Lantern Spectacular. It was fun and definitely worth the visit. Very nicely done. A real treat for all ages.",
          "This zoo was perfect for our three young children and the food was actually pretty good here too. My kids loved the petting zoo part, the seals, and watching the elephants eat. It was also nice since it wasn't super crowded. A very enjoyable day.",
          "This park still is an awesome place, majority of attraction well maintained! Brought my children back after 40 years and it was a real treat. One point of pride that has gone down the drain is the Japanese Gardens, one of my favorites growing up...avoid that area at all cost.",
          "A good variety of animals. Great for kids and families. Great for animal lovers as well. Located in the Roger Williams Park. Good parking and easy to find.",
          "We had a nice day at the zoo. It was big enough for 3 families with kids aged 5-12 to spend half a day roaming around. They gave us a discount since we had a large group. The food was decent. There were quite a few animals I had never heard of before.",
          "Not in a class with zoos like the Bronx, National Zoo in DC, San Diego, etc., but a nice-enough place to tour for a few hours and more manageable with young children than the larger venues. The red panda's are stars, and the giraffes and three old elephants are fun. It is not",
          "I have visited this event every years for over 5 years and loved it; always excellent! When it does get poor reviews it is because of the wait and the lines; even the adults start to cry. Last year my review included hints about how to avoid the lines 'cause I want my readers",
          "Never any wait to get in, not overly packed.. always a nice time. I enjoy the Hasbro play park with the little one. If the animals get old; the park and all the different activities for the kids keep them busy- especially in the summer with the great water park!",
          "This zoo is better than many I have been to and they really try to get the animals in the best habitat while still giving viewers a chance to see them up close.",
          "I lived next to Roger Williams Park for a while and the park itself is very nice, as well as the zoo that's in it. I'm a big fan of zoos and have been to numerous. This is a good one. Worth the drive if you need to do so. Definitely a lot better than some I have been to. Good",
          "I love the elephants! They give baths while the audience watches! And last year a baby Giraffe! Oh how cute. This zoo is wonderful. \"All creatures, great and small\". Let the kids go on ahead and you read the informative signs! Snack bars easy to get to and easy parking, too.",
          "Great way to spend the day with the family. Not only can you see all kinds of wonderful animals, but there is also a playground and an area to get lunch.",
          "Great zoo here in RI, my children have attended summer camp here as well and they LOVED it :) Just a great zoo all around.",
          "We visited the zoo this past weekend. The food is actually well priced, along with entrance fee. The zoo exhibits was all clean. I wish they took a little more pride in their bathroom facilities. My husband used the bathroom 2 times, both times he came out telling me his",
          "Wife and I took her niece (almost 3 years old) one Saturday. Zoo has big parking lot (free parking) about 150' from the front gate. Zoo is very clean and well maintained. Layout is pretty well spread out so you don't see huge groups of visitors in any one spot. There is a goat",
          "This was a nice zoo. There were alot of empty exhibits. Which was kind of disappointing. Clean and well maintained.",
          "I went to the zoo yesterday with my two kids, 9 and 7. The zoo is great, we spent almost four hours there and the kids wanted to keep going.My kids favorite were the crowned crane which was performing a dance and the red panda who is the cutest animal in the world! The seals",
          "Brought my girlfriend her for her birthday. They have so many enclosures and things to look at, definitely one of my favorite zoos!",
          "We love RWPZ and have had a membership for a few years now. The Zoo is great and is always renovating and adding new exhibits. Aside from the animal exhibits, there is The Big Backyard with lots of stations for kids to play in, like water stations, a small library area, a stage,",
          "The zoo was one of the reasons why we stayed in Providence. We got there about half an hour after it opened and actually saw many of the animals. They weren't hidden away sleeping. The zoo has a great layout so you can actually see the animals. Very impressed with the",
          "Small, overpriced and not worth the drive out from the city center. I just don't think that I can recommend coming here where there are more interesting things to do in the center of town.",
          "This zoo is amazing. There is plenty to see for both children and adults, and the zoo is handicapped accessible. There are opportunities to pet some animals (e.g., goats) and to feed birds. The parking lots are deceptively small, but there is additional space if you keep",
          "Don't miss this Beautifully laid out, handicapped accessible, helpful staff and delightful animals. The day was hot but most comfortable walking with shaded area. Just wish the animals were up and a bit activate but they were hot too",
          "This is not \"just\" a zoo. It is a mini haven for a variety of animal encounter experiences. My favorites include the bird house where you can feed the birds as the land on or around you. Walk through a double gated door and you are in the wallabies home! Zoo staff members are",
          "We didn't get off to a great start. We have a zoo membership where we live and were supposed to receive 50 percent reciprocity. When we got to the gate, the girl told us it was 50 percent off for the first 2 adults and full price for the rest. (We had 4 in our group - my",
          "The Roger Williams Park Zoo is a great day trip for the family - only about an hour from just north of Boston, so not a bad ride with the toddler in the car. The giraffe and elephant exhibits are worth the price of admission (which by the way, is not too bad). You can get so",
          "We took our grandchildren there ages 9 and 11 This is a great Zoo,lots of animals,definitely geared toward young children...they had a blast. In the middle of the zoo was a Bounce house ,so they played in there for 10 minutes..$3.00 for 5 minutes of playtime,worth it for us gave",
          "We used to visit this zoo when we were kids. It's still a great place to visit. The zoo is large enough to exhibit a good variety of animals, but small enough to comfortably get through in a few hours.",
          "I went with my 23 year old daughter. Nice and clean, small zoo geared for younger kids. We went on a Saturday in August and it was not overly crowded, easy to move around, which was a good thing. We were pleasantly surprised to find in or near a city like Providence a zoo",
          "The zoo has a nice collection of animals. Many of them can be viewed at quite close range. On our recent visit we saw many of the animals being fed and eating, including the elephants, giraffes and seals. We visited on a blistering hot day and appreciated that many of the",
          "We love the zoo. Actually we buy a season pass every year. Well worth the price if you live close. The zoo has made some great accomplishment's over the last few years. There is an area just for children to play in that includes interaction with water, ropes, books, etc. A huge",
          "This was my family's second visit to this zoo, which is on the smaller side of things (comparable with the Stone Zoo outside of Boston, and nowhere near as extensive as the Philadelphia, Bronx, Columbus, or National Zoos). It is set inside a large park (which has a nice",
          "Get the yearly membership, it's worth it. There are reciprocal agreements that make it a great value.",
          "Very nice park. Nice variety of animals and they all appeared n great health. In fact, the goats in the petting area had amazingly shiny coats.",
          "Had a good time with my friend at this zoo. However some of the exhibits were not open as they told us it would be.",
          "Located within a beautiful park a few minutes away from downtown providence. Great place to take the family!",
          "This is a beautiful zoo in a beautiful park. My 8 year old and 4 year old loved it. There is a nice kids/farm animals area for little ones and a good variety of animal exhibits. I would say it takes about an hour to walk the whole zoo, and while there are some hilly areas it was",
          "This is a really nice zoo with a lot to offer.. There are Many different animals to observe and some you can even interact with. lots of hands on things for the children to experience. It's best to get here early because it gets pretty busy. One other nice thing is they offer a",
          "I enjoyed this zoo very much. It took me a little over an hour to walk the entire zoo and look at every (free) exhibit. If I was here with my family it would've been a 3 hour trip most likely. The zoo has several interactive exhibits to include animal feedings, a farm yard,",
          "This is a wonderful little walking zoo in a beautiful location. There are many animals here that I hadn't seen at large, well known zoos. The animals are easy to see. It is clean with plenty of parking and you can't beat the price of $9.99 for kids!! So if you driving through RI",
          "I recently went to the zoo with our grandchildren. The zoo continually has upgraded the exhibits. It is just the right size. You can stay for an hour or spends hours wandering around. For small children, there are easy viewing areas. The petting zoo and small farm area were a",
          "I trip to the zoo was really fun I've heard so many good things about it so when we got there we were really excited after seeing a few animals it really started to go downhill a little bit the public areas were beautiful but the indoor access to see the monkeys in a few other",
          "I spent the morning here with my 11 son. After reading the reviews and seeing the park outside the zoo I was a bit unsure. However the zoo was great! The animals were well taken care of, the grounds were clean and well kept. They had a lot of different animals and the exhibits",
          "Love seeing all the animals . I'm an animal lover . Saw some new animals there . I saw a wolf which is my favorite animal.",
          "This was my first time at this zoo. They had plenty of staff checking in guests which made the line go very quickly. The grounds were extremely clean as well as the animals enclosures. There seem to be plenty of Room for them. I was with a family member in a wheel chair and",
          "Went here for hubby's birthday. Went first thing Sunday morning. Thank God cause as we were headed out, strollers everywhere. The zoo is great, laid out well. Got to see everything and it was clean. The kids working there were nice and admission was fair.",
          "I remember the days when the polar bears would swim right up to you and look you in the eye in the underground viewing area. While this place has made improvments it seems to have less of the charm it used to. You can watch the elephants get their Saturday bath and that is",
          "My friend and I stopped at this zoo on our way home from Newport last week. We got there right as it was opening so we didn't have to fight through a lot of school groups (because there were tons) and we wanted to see the animals before it got too unbearable hot. What a great",

          "Overall, I would say this is a fun zoo. They have a wide variety of animals to see from several different regions of the world. The layout of the park is good with multiple ways to move around. There is a cool kangaroo enclosure where you walk through their habitat (staying on",
          "My family and I went in late July when it was super hot. Despite the heat most of the animals were out and we were able to see them. I think there might have been 2 or 3 that were hiding in their enclosure to escape the heat. The mist sprayer felt fabulous on such a hot day.",
          "I am a docent in my home town and love checking out other zoos to get ideas. Roger Williams has an interesting collection on animals; their IndoAsia animals are unique. Clean and easily walkable. Lots of shade for hot summer days.",

          "Friends have been recommending this zoo to me for a long time, and we finally made it down (about 1.5 hours from home). While I'm not sure it would be worth the drive on its own, as we were pretty much done in a little over three hours. It does make a great stop for a weekend",
          "Lions, tigers and bears; oh no. But they do have zebras, elephants, giraffes, and all the other usual standbys. No matter how many times you visit, the zoo is entertaining, educational, and a good place to walk.",
          "Good zoo with many animals. We liked the Giraffes, elephants, and the ant eater. They had a hero day with all sorts of movie and comic book hero characters in uniform throughout the park which made it more fun that day.",
          "The zoo is a gem right in the middle of Providence. I like that the animals are in a natural setting and there are so many different species there from elephants, to giraffes, to penguins, flamingos, pigs, donkeys, seals, etc. It's a great place to take children. I would",

          "This zoo really is as good as any in New England. I've been to all of them and I'd take this one over any other. Absolutely no bias there due to being local. It's honestly how I feel. Some other zoos and aquariums in the area have a ton of charges once you get in. Roger",
          "This is a lovely family day out. It's also fairly wheelchair friendly - though there are some steep-ish ramps so if you don't have electric help you'll need a strong friend. I saw one animal I've never even heard of and as I'm going to Nepal later this year, I'll be looking for",
          "Roger Williams Park is quite large and beautiful... The zoo is in the park and was a pleasant surprise. It had some nice touches... The outback walk, the ability to feed the giraffes for example. There were several animals I had never seen or even heard of before, which",

          "All of the interesting exhibits are gone and the best part is now a small farmhouse exhibit with an area that you can walk with some kangaroos. This zoo used to have polar bears and be a real destination, now it's hardly worth the drive or admission which of course has gone up",

          "Really nice zoo with some great exhibits. The elephant enclosure really stands out, but all of the exhibits are large and well put together.

That being said by the time we were heading out most of the animals had moved to there inside enclosures or were taking shelter.",

          "Worst trip ever!!! Halloween spectacular was so poorly planned 3 hrs in traffic to get in then to find out no more parking. Then a 1/2 mile walk to get to the gate,Got my tickets in advance and still stood in line for an hour. Oh and don\u2019t \u2026",
          "We went first thing in the morning right as they opened. It was great! We've never seen the animals so active. My daughter was disappointed that they close the giraffe feeding in the fall/winter, but the Halloween decorations were really \u2026",
          "Love the zoo! It wasn't too crowded even though there were other groups there. The weather was perfect and the staff was nice. The monkey house is so cool! I kept telling the kids not to yell at the animals. Animals don't like it and it \u2026",
          "Great place to take young children",
          "Great place to visit with children. They have made new additions within the past couple of years. Providence residences can go for free on certain Saturdays. Went on a group trip, pretty quick access. Food is expensive like resorts of this type; but great seating areas available if you bring your own lunch.",
          "Great display as always. Sadly You would think with all the years having this event they would find a better solution for traffic and parking. Once on arrival at the park, It took over an hour to get through the driveway/entrance just to park. We almost missed our ticket time.",
          "I have a great time every time I bring the kids here. It is the perfect size zoo and the cost is reasonable. I enjoy the animals they have on display and all of the features they offer to get people safely close to the animals. It is good \u2026",
          "So disappointed. We drove two hours to get here just see maybe 10 animals total.   It was pretty depressing",
          "Beautiful park. We took a ride through while waiting to pick up my father. Lots of fond memories of this Park. They are some areas under construction. And they have changed the park areas, but still beautiful. We had just enough time to walk through the stunning gardens",
          "Peaceful Japanese Garden. ..waiting for the  pinkie blossoms for added joy",
          "The zoo itself is great but they also offer many environmental trainings.",
          "One of the nicest zoos we have visited.  Very friendly staff.  Well kept grounds and good service at food counters.  Best 10 minutes were watching the elephant getting a shower from her handler.  At his direction she followed each command \u2026",
          "Cute zoo that is clean and accessible. The armadillo encounters are awesome and I would highly recommend that. The snow leopard enclosure is very nice; beautiful animals. Red pandas are the best! Not the biggest zoo but is good for small children. The price is good for what you get.",
          "I have been going to this zoo since I was a baby, and now it's a family tradition to go once every summer. I've memorized the walkways and paths, where each animal is. With every new addition I get a new surprise, it's always exciting. It's \u2026",
          "Truly beautiful zoo and surrounding area. Great space to spend an afternoon, young or old. Lots of dining options and the gift shop was very nicely curated.",
          "Great, clean zoo. Staff is friendly. A lot of information about animal conservation. Always have events going on. Definitely recommend.",
          "My grandson had so much fun here.  I've been going since I was his age and although I miss the polar bear exhibit there are a lot of new things to do.  Easily spend the entire day here between the zoo and the park ... And you can't leave without going on a carousel ride!",
          "Big enough to have an interesting collection of animals, plants, bugs and birds.  Small enough to complete an entire visit in 4 - 5 hours.  Plenty of places to escape the sun and heat, buy water and snacks. Loads of areas to interact with various animals and a very welcoming staff who seem to be everywhere.",
          "My grandnieces really enjoyed the goat brushing pen...yes,you can brush the goats, and they love it. The petting of the armadillo was a close second. A beautiful day for a visit to the zoo.",
          "This is such a fun place to visit. I have been going with family ever since I have been just a little girl. It is now becoming more and more elaborate, and it is an enjoyable time. You're getting exercise while seeing these beautiful \u2026",
          "Wonderful zoo, I recommend the annual pass, it also gives you free access to the Boston museum of science and others",
          "So much fun! Very clean and the animals are well taken care of. We loved the elephants, red panda and the moon bears. Will definitely be buying a membership on our next trip!",
          "A ton of positive energy! Tree kangaroos are now our favorite, along with red pandas",
          "This is such a great zoo. They maintain the all the exhibits really well. If you have little ones it's a great way to spend part of day.",
          "It was my first time at the Roger Williams Park Zoo and it was very nice and cozy. I enjoyed seeing the elephants and giraffes the most. I'd recommend arriving to the park before 12pm or you'll miss all of the daily animal encounters they have set up, like feeding the giraffes.",
          "Wentfie the jack o lantern spectacular and was pleasantly surprised.  It was really nice.  Enjoyed the walk and some very creative and beautiful pumpkin displays.",
          "Family friendly, handicap accessible.  Animals appeared well cared for and their environments/enclosures clean. Only compliant was that the gentleman selling the tickets had a difficult time adding.  I knew to watch as I was paying \u2026",
          "This place is awesome. But if you don't like crowds try to see it early when it first opens because it's quite the long line of traffic to get in and another long line to get a ticket and then very crowded if you go closer to Halloween, but very worth it!",
          "had a great time with the kids over the weekend. They loved it. pretty packed, but not as bad. took some great pics for the family album. heres to next year",
          "Roger William's is one of the best zoo's I have been to. It is always clean and the staff is usually very friendly. We've been in good and bad weather and it's a completely different experience with what the animals are doing. Plus the not so great weather keeps the crowds away. We'll definitely keep coming back.",
          "Nice winter day for a zoo trip....loved seeing the babies in the rainforest",
          "This place is a gem with plenty to see even thought it might be considered smaller. I especially loved the atrium area; we were able to get up close to the small primates and parrots. We made sure to hit every spot to see and had a wonderful time.",
          "A reasonably clean and fun zoo for family and friends. the exhibits are decently well designed so you are typically most likely to see the animal.  A wide range of your standard animals. Negatives are it's very close to the highway and airport so there is a lot of background noise.",
          "So much fun! Great for kids of all ages but we went with a 3 year old and there was so much for her to do and be entertained by. What an awesome day. It was wonderful to see the elephants and giraffes so close up.",
          "We come here yearly for the pumpkin spectacular. This years was a bit disappointing( not enough on trend pumpkins) but every year no complaints the zoo is very well run, the animals always look clean and healthy.",
          "Beautiful park, was clean and had many animals, my 3 year old had a great time here",
          "I love this zoo. It's so entertaining to view and overall wonderful.",
          "i love this zoo. the animals are very well cared for. keep up the great work RWPZ",
          "Beautiful place, they don\u2019t have a large variety of animals.",
          "I like it here, I want to touch the elephants though.  I love elephants, beautiful animals special animals",
          "Good bird watching. Good for Pokemon Go. Good for nearby escape from the hustle & bustle.",
          "If you have kids - its a must.\nLots of animals and fun activities to do, especially in the summer where you can go to the splash garden and the kiddos can enjoy water play.\nLots of  things to see and do, love the new exhibits they built with all the new animals.\nhighly recommended.",
          "Love rain forest hall! Free for RI resident the first Sat of every month.",
          "I visited the zoo for the jack-o'-lantern festival. My first time and what an incredible event, full of artistry and wonder and magic. The detail and the obvious love that went into the event was breathtaking. I wasnt even aware of the zoo \u2026",
          "Great fun to be had for all ages! Reasonable prices on refreshments but you're also allowed to bring j  your own food and drinks! Could easily spend all day here and enjoy myself. Highly recommend!",
          "The zoo is nice, lots of animals to see. The docents are helpful.  Good to see their conservative programs and how they are helping with conservation of species.",
          "The activities for children were fantastic. Lots and lots of shaded areas, very clean zoo, and the animals looked healthy and very well cared for. The zoo size just enough for little ones and elderly. Would definitely go back !!!!!",
          "This is a great zoo. Lots of animals to see, also LOTS of walking, beware! There is a kids' play area that to be honest my kids could easily spend the entire day in if I let them. We fed giraffes and that was pretty darn cool! There are \u2026",
          "Awesome Zoo in Providence Rhode Island , My fav animals were the Elephant and Snow Leopard",
          "Great place for a date. Saturday morning coffee with my gf at the zoo happens quite a bit for us over the summer!",
          "We haven\u2019t gone to the Roger Williams zoo in at least 15 years. We brought the family on a recent vacation and everyone had such a good time. Plenty of walking trails, shady spots, benches to sit on and food or drinks if you get hungry or \u2026",
          "A nice zoo. Animals appear have a decent amount of space and don't appear stressed. The staff and docents were nice and informative.",
          "I've been going to this zoo since I was a kid. Very fond memories and more to come! I bring my daughter here now and its very special to me to share that with her!",
          "Had a great day at the zoo! We got a membership for xmas and we couldnt wait to use it. The zoo is still totally fun in the winter, plus you pretty much have the whole place to yourself! We really loved the new building too! It was a nice \u2026",
          "This was my first time going and I really enjoyed it!! The artistic skills needed to carve such amazing pumpkins   \ud83c\udf83",
          "Went for the pumpkin gallery. The pumpkins were really well done, but finding parking was a nightmare. They told us the lots were full, but a friend who went ahead of us was standing in one of the lots and told us there were spaces \u2026",
          "Great place to have a nice day or in my case night with the entire family. Went to the pumpkin patch with the family. Nothing but fun. Lights everywhere.",
          "GO! This is a wonderful October experience! Extremely well done and choreographed. Appropriate for all ages.",
          "Well maintained, one should go around the whole thing to appreciate the place. Some animals are really rare. Few activities for kids are included as part of general admission. Sitting area, drinking water and restrooms are plentiful \u2026",
          "One of the best zoos I have been to. Big and spread out. Didn't feel over crowded. Plenty of fun hands on stuff for the kiddies also. My daughter loved getting to brush the goats and the pet an armadillo experience. The animals were wonderful to see. Overall a great zoo that we are excited to go back to visit.",
          "awesome and great place to bring your kids to see elephant and giraffe.",
          "Beautiful space with lovely events. Amazing zoo!",
          "Providence is always working hard to keep the park fresh and clean, with plenty to do. It's been a beautiful sight to see for years \u2661 Besides the zoo there is police horses , gardens , swan boats, wooded walking paths , carousel,  inclusive playground that is WHEELCHAIR FRIENDLY \u2661",
          "This was a very nice mid sized zoo, great for families with small children. The animals all looked happy and healthy, with plenty of space. The administration price was reasonable, but as expected the concessions were expensive. The one \u2026",
          "Our favorite zoo to visit. Parking is a little crazy, although there does seem to be a ton of it. No matter how busy it is, you can always see the animals fairly close. They do a great job of positioning some of the enrichments for the animals close to where you view them, so you get a chance to see them. Always clean and well kept.",
          "Excellent place to go zoo is amazing with all the wild life they keep there very good place for family outings",
          "Great zoo with well done exhibits. Closest we've been to the elephant and sloths! Perfect for family's with young kids.",
          "Went during the Pumpkin Spectacular. Loved it! Highly recommend for the whole family.",
          "I love this place because my son loves the animals and icecream! Unfortunately, I get a pang of sadness when I see the animals. Animals don't belong in zoo's...However, they do promote conservation and that I can get with. My son also loves \u2026",
          "Lovely zoo, has good flow and lots of good animals.",
          "Great zoo! Friendly staff always willing to point out the animals if you can't find them. Perfect spot for a corporate picnic.",
          "We enjoyed going to Roger Williams Park Zoo very much. We saw all the animals in their natural habitat and enjoyed it very much. We were there on a perfect weekend weather day so it was challenging to find a parking space, but we did. I enjoyed seeing the eagles and watching the animal eating the ice cream.",
          "Drove over an hour one way to attend the Jack-O-Lantern display that was listed on the website to happen \u201crain or shine\u201d only to discover they closed for the evening \u201cdue to weather.\u201d It wasn\u2019t even raining by the time the event was \u2026",
          "Great little family friendly zoo! So many amazing rare animals and very affordable food, drinks and amenities. They have a zip line, train rides and much much more. Can walk the entire loop in close to 2 hours. Go!!!",
          "Brought the kids here over the weekend here and they had a totally had a blast. Some amazing exhibits and animals on display.",
          "Great zoo. Smaller than the Bronx Zoo but a good place for little ones. We did the entire zoo before my son's afternoon nap so it worked out well!",
          "Love this Zoo...A pleasant experience..A must see!",
          "Great family fun day!! Lines were a little long but it was very busy and it was free zoo day",
          "This is a fun  place to be with the family.  I have visited the Zoo a few times and went to check if there were new additions and what is housed in the building that was constructed .  There several African wildlife to see. It  needs time to visit every part of the zoo so make time if you want to see all the animals.",
          "The best array of animals out of all the zoos around. The ongoing protection efforts and the rehabed animals are a huge plus in my book!! This will always be my families favorite zoo :)",
          "Great for a smaller zoo. Staff was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. My daughter had a great time! Definitely will be back!",
          "Totally worth visiting. A good variety of animals to see out there.",
          "Went for the jack-o'-lantern display... really worth it!! The detail was amazing and the set up was beautiful!",
          "The zoo was great, and I honestly feel a bit guilty leaving a less than glowing review for a zoo I visited for free. But, it took more than twenty minutes just to order my family's meal at the Tuskers restuarant (the only main restaurant \u2026",
          "Great place to sit, walk, and relax.",
          "BEST zoo experience everyone.really a joy being here.thanks guys especially all the nice staff you have.",
          "Lots of animals & beautiful grounds. Especially loved the Rainforest enclosure with free flying birds & monkeys climbing over head.",
          "The staff is very helpful and always smiling. Face painting is amazing! The restrooms are very clean and there is food for kids in many locations within the zoo. Animals are kept well. A must see",
          "Pumpkin spectacular awesome. Well worth the price of admission. A must see!!",
          "The pumpkin displays were totally awesome. Unlike any other, I've seen..",
          "Get play to walk around and enjoy the fresh air",
          "Gorgeous zoo!!  I have been to many, and this one is not the biggest or necessarily the best, but absolutely an amazing experience!  They have an experience you cannot get elsewhere with their winding paths in the wetlands area to the bird \u2026",
          "Gorgeous zoo!! The animals were wonderful to see. Overall a great zoo. I would definitely take a family back there.",
          "Great day trip with the kids. We went with children 1-14 years old, they all had a blast.",
          "Really cool place to bring the kiddos. But be aware you have to walk quite a ways. Matter of fact the whole park is a trail to walk to each exhibit. WHICH CAN BE hard on the elderly and the little ones. They do have wheelchairs and \u2026",
          "We went to pumpkin event. The drive in is long and parking limited. Very busy and got bummed into alot. Carved pumpkins amazing thou.",
          "Really enjoyed seeing the cheetah so close and was able to see several different kinds of animals. My concern is I'm wondering if their enclosures are big enough. I also miss the polar bear that used to live at the zoo. I was told it passed away but they never replaced it with another.",
          "Antipasto to die for! Pasta and chicken so good!",
          "Coming back to a park I grew up on was the best thing. So many different area's to go to it took me all day.  But it was worth it.",
          "The recent visit I had was literally the best time l\u2019ve ever had there. Like most people from Rhode Island, I\u2019ve been there plenty of times but their recent renovations have definitely made it a more enjoyable/memorable experience. My \u2026",
          "First of all there is a bus that takes you right to the front of the zoo. It is bus 6 and runs once an hour. Definitely take that one. There is so much to see at the zoo. We got there around 11 and left around 2pm. The food at Wilderness \u2026",
          "New rainforest exhibit is beautiful. Staff is friendly and welcoming. Definitely hit or miss on a lot of the exhibits, plan ahead according to weather and season, even times of the day make a difference. Membership benefits are worth it, giving access to some special events throughout the year.",
          "Best zoo in the area! Go early to see most of the animals eating their breakfast. The new rainforest building is great also, but it is hot in there (it is a rainforest). Plenty of zoo staff around to answer questions and plenty of viewing \u2026",
          "Beautiful Zoo - A real gem in Rhode Island. They throw quite a lot of community events as well and are very affordable to boot!",
          "Good value visit for the whole family. We arrived 15 minutes before open and the proceeded through the park. Probably a 4-6 hour activity plus long stops or breaks. Park was well staffed and maintained. Many attractions and a place for kids to cool off in the water play area. I think the giraffes were the best.",
          "My kids just love this zoo. . It is in excellent, well maintained and variety of animals are seen here from all over the world including rain forest and Australia too. Planning to visit again soon...",
          "This park is wonderful. It\u2019s more than 300 acres of beauty. It has lots of amenities including carousel for kids. Parking was not an issue and dogs are allowed as long as they are on their leash.",

          "The longest \"shortcut\" in Providence...Food Truck Fridays in the summer is Def something to check out",
          "AMAZING STAFF!!! The zoologists in red are eager to educate and they float around the zoo. We (my fiance and me) were approached twice in the Wetlands and at the giraffes. We had a great time! We do wish they had pandas but the adorable tree kangaroos made up for it!!!!!!",
          "It\u2019s the perfect size for toddlers to around ten years old. They have lots of stuff for toddlers to do around the whole zoo my sons favorite thing was going in the goat pen and grooming the goats. They were very friendly and u could feed \u2026",
          "Wide variety of animals and you can actually get very close... safely! RIP Harambee",
          "Medium sized zoo, easy to get around seldom very crowded with a good variety of animals. Be sure to visit the red panda! Snow leopards, tree kangaroo, macaws, golden lion tamarin are some of the more unusual animals. Also has elephants, giraffes, a wolf and sea lions. No lions, hippos or rhinos.",
          "I don't like zoos because my heart breaks for the animals in cages.  THIS zoo, however is as close to the animal's natural environments as I've ever seen.  The animals are SO well cared for and the grounds are spotless.  A true destination for families of all ages!!",

          "Took my son today and it was very enjoyable. Weather was perfect, all the animals were out. The petting farm was our favorite",
          "Conservation forward and educational for both adults and children.  Interactions with staff are always pleasant and the animals seem fit and stimulated.  Great zoo!",
          "It was ok slightly disappointing you need to pay full price when certain areas were closed due to the Halloween special and the soaring eagle is $12 per person for a ride that doesn't even last a minute is a rip off.",
          "Great experience, less 1 star for cost, size and membership fee",
          "Very good selection of animals and helpful staff.",
          "Festival of Jack-o-lanterns was great.",

          "Pumpkins are 5 stars but the crowds of people who don't follow directions and blind you with the flash on their camera knock it down to 3 stars.",
          "This zoo is AWESOME.  The animals are clearly well cared for, have lots of enrichment in their environment, plenty of beautifully-designed space, and happy caretakers :)  Plus, there are docents galore if you or your littles are the inquisitive type!  Great way to spend a day!",

          "Love this zoo. Always fun but always so crowded! Still the best around no doubt",
          "Nice zoo. Well maintained. Nice stretches of shade so you're not in straight sun on a nice day. Recomend going on a day in the mid 70's as most of the animals retreat inside when it's really hot. New rainforest attraction is really nice.",
          "Awesome! I have been coming here my whole life!",
          "Very good zoo. They have many events regularly. You can feed Giraffes, goats, cows.. Kids will love this place.",

Get too see plenty of beautiful animals, live the fact that there's a restroom everywhere and how friendly is the staff !",
          "Pass on the pumpkin \u201cspectacular\u201d. The only thing spectacular about it is the traffic to get into the place to see a show that gets smaller every year",
          "Simply beautiful. Love how the park is sectioned into different themes.",
          "Not a complete bust but not worth the $15 either.  Plus it took 40 minutes to park and another 15 minutes to get tickets.  Can skip the ticket line by getting them online but then there's a service charge.",
          "Had a great experience with my family here recently. We enjoyed the rain forest exhibits. There has been some decent upgrades since we last visited that were refreshing.",
          "Hey the animals are all so well kept! The monkey reminds me of my BF!",

          "Always a fun time. Not too crowded, barrels for recycling all over the place keep everything clean. The new Rain Forest building is really cool. They mimick the rain forest humidity, so be prepared. They also have a bunch of goats for the kids to brush and pet.",
          "Great as usual. But why did they have to cut the old tree back near the snakes den. Some of the old branches rerouted themselves making a new tree but attached to orginal tree. It was beautiful.",
          "Lots of animals. Located in a big park. The kids area is great. Could spend the day and not do all you wish to do. There are a bunch of interactive spots. Bring a bathing suit for the splash area.",
          "It was AMAZING here.. I loved it here, my girlfriend brought me here for a date n it was WONDERFUL.. It really made me HAPPY too see the animals on the East Side since I live on the West Side..",

          "This little treasure comprises four green houses that are kept at tropical temperature and humidity all year round. It's a rare opportunity to take your coat off and walk thru gardens in the dead of winter. The plants are interesting as well. They have the biggest Bird of Paradise I have ever seen. Cool short take.",
          "Never a disappointing day at Roger Williams Zoo. Not just the Zoo but the entire surrounding park as well. There's been so much done to the park since I was kid to improve it and it continues to grow. Can't wait to go and check out the new Rain Forest exhibit this summer.

          "Great Zoo. Very reasonable prices. Good variety of animals.",

I do feel bad for zoo animals but some cannot be left out in the wild, I get it.  They seem to be very well cared for at Roger William's Zoo which is a plus!",
          "Beautiful zoo and animals look well kept. The zoo is plenty big to spend a few hours touring. There is also a carousel and park located on the zoo property. It is worth it to buy the family pass as it has unlimited usage throughout the year.",
          "Lots of shade. Easy to navigate. The interactive animal education displays were interesting and the kids loved them. \n\nMy only complaint is it looks like they have neglacted basic cleaning. We went fairly early and the glass viewing areas \u2026",

I was especially moved by the holocaust memorial with the separate stones for each camp-I didn\u2019t realize",

          "Just a lovely walk alongside the reasonably clean river. A place very tranquil in an otherwise busy city.",

          "A hot day but a constant breeze made it bearable - great way to get 10,000 steps in no time! Appreciated the 9/11 tiles and misc sculptures. A quick hike up a hill towards Benefit st yielded impressive views and old homes to enjoy. A very nice public space! HOWEVER not super",
          "I thought the lighting of fire on the river was very nice. Problem noticed, people came early for seats and late comers would just stand in front of them blocking their view. Should rope off a stand only area away from seats. It was just too crowded for me.",
          "This feature is a noble attempt to make the most of the Providence River, which is more like a canal. There is a lot of concrete and stone, so the park is sterile, but it is lined with high-end eateries and perhaps in warm weather there are kiosks and muscians and crowds, which",

          "In an age where people want to build condominiums along rivers blocking public access, I must commend Providence preserving this tranquil space for public access. Yes, it could be more tidy, but that is a small issue. It is there for us to use. Thank you, Providence!",
          "It could be better with some clean up. Litter detracts from the experience. But it is certainly a great effort for a city that restructured itself to enhance it's downtown. It was a short walk and weather was not on my side. A good activities for families .",
          "I can't believe that Providence was so ugly (the original I-95 and river-blocking roads ruined everything, coupled with the city's previous pure industry background) not so long ago and now...everyone here likes to take a walk by the beautiful riverwalk from time to time",

          "Of course you have to dress for the weather. And it's always better when there is no crowd. But it's a great place to view downtown, and if you don't examine the water too closely, it's very nice. Providence needs to take better care of it, but it's fine as is.",

        "wiki": "Rhode Island School of Design (RISD ) is a private art and design school in Providence, Rhode Island. It was founded in 1877 and offers bachelor's and master's degree programs across 19 majors.\nRISD's campus is located at the base of College Hill and contiguous with the Brown University campus. The two institutions, which share social, academic, and community resources, offer a joint degree program and students can cross register for classes.The RISD community includes 181 full-time and 421 part-time faculty members, and 2,009 undergraduate and 492 graduate students. The school has nearly 30,000 alumni.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Centennial Women were a group formed to raise funds for a separate Women's Pavilion showcasing women's work at the 1876 Centennial Exposition. In a little over a year the RI women raised over $10,000 with spectacles such as: a recreation of the burning of the Gaspee that drew a crowd of 9,000, the writing and publication of a monthly newspaper, Herald of the Century, and an art exhibition. The Women's Pavilion at the 1876 Centennial successfully highlighted women's \"economic right to self-sufficiency\" and included exhibits from recently founded design schools, displays of new patents by women entrepreneurs, and a library containing only books written by women. The Rhode Island Centennial Women submitted their newspaper, Herald of the Century, to this Women's Pavilion's library.\nAt the end of the World's Fair, the RI Centennial Women had $1,675 left over and spent some time negotiating how best to memorialize their achievements. Helen Adelia Rowe Metcalf proposed that the group donate the money to found what would become Rhode Island School of Design, and this option was chosen by a majority of the women on January 11, 1877. The school was incorporated on March 22, 1877 and opened its doors the following fall at the Hoppin Homestead in downtown Providence, RI. Metcalf directed the school until her death in 1895. Her daughter, Eliza Greene Metcalf Radeke, then took over until her death in 1931.\n\nThe Rhode Island General Assembly ratified \"An Act to Incorporate the Rhode Island School of Design\" on March 22, 1877, \"[f]or the purpose of aiding in the cultivation of the arts of design\". Over the next 129 years, the following original by-laws set forth these following primary objectives:\n\nThe instruction of artisans in drawing, painting, modeling, and designing, that they may successfully apply the principles of Art to the requirements of trade and manufacture.\nThe systematic training of students in the practice of Art, in order that they may understand its principles, give instruction to others, or become artists.\nThe general advancement of public Art Education, by the exhibition of works of Art and of Art school studies, and by lectures on Art.\n\n\n=== Presidents ===\n\n\n== Rankings ==\nIn 2014, U.S. News & World Report ranked RISD first amongst Fine Arts programs. In 2019 RISD was ranked 4th by the QS World University Rankings amongst Art & Design programs. Its undergraduate architecture program ranked 6 in DesignIntelligence's ranking of the Top Architecture Schools in the US for 2019. In 2018, the institution was also named among Forbes\u2019 America's Top Colleges and the Chronicle of Higher Education's Top Producers of US Fulbright Scholars.\n\n\n== RISD Museum ==\n\nThe RISD Museum was founded in 1877 on the belief that art, artists, and the institutions that support them play pivotal roles in promoting broad civic engagement and creating more open societies. The RISD Museum stewards works of art representing cultures from ancient times to the present from around the globe.\n\n\n== Athletics ==\nRISD has many athletic clubs and teams.  As might be considered fitting for an arts school, the symbolism used for the teams is unique.  The hockey team is called the \"Nads\", and their cheer is \"Go Nads!\" The logo for the Nads features a horizontal hockey stick with two non-descript circles at the end of the stick's handle.\nThe basketball team is known simply as the \"Balls\", and their slogan is, \"When the heat is on, the Balls stick together.\" The Balls' logo consists of two balls next to one another in an irregularly shaped net.Lest the sexual innuendo of these team names and logos be lost or dismissed, the 2001 creation of the school's mascot, Scrotie, ended any ambiguity.  Despite the name, Scrotie is not merely a representation of a scrotum, but is a 7-foot tall penis, with scrotum and testes at the bottom.  In 2016, the school reported that the 2009 incarnation of the mascot had been deemed not appropriate for younger fans, and so the mascot would return to its earlier, \"more cartoonish\" appearance.\n\n\n== RISDmade & RISD Craft ==\nGoods by RISD makers and designers can be found on RISDmade, an online marketplace of alumni-produced products, and at RISD Craft, a juried sale held each October in Providence.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\n\n== Notable faculty ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "RISD Museum is worthy of a visit. Very nice exhibits on several floors. Interesting gift shop. Thursday evenings are free!",
          "The museum is very fun and very small. We had no idea what the exhibit was - turned out to be Gorham silver - 1850-1970. It was interesting. We enjoyed a lot of the interactive student work on the second floor. This was a perfect for us to spend an hour while waiting for our car",
          "Pick an artist of note, and RISD will have them. Pick a period or a type of medium, it's here. Great masters, modern art, marble frome rome, textiles, weapons, tea pots, a whole revolutionary period house, 20 foot tall wooden buda, mummy....getting the picture?",
          "When my wife said she\u2019d like to see the exhibit on Gorham silver I was a little dubious. But it was really interesting to see the fantastic work done by this RI institution. Little hard to get to given the building renovation but worth the effort",
          "Absolute treasure of a museum with fabulous examples of Barbizon landscapes, Impressionism, and decorative arts and design. The current exhibition on Gorham silver is an absolute must see.",
          "I visited on a Sunday afternoon (free admission) and was impressed with their diverse collection of art from ancient Egyptian artefacts to contemporary works of art from all over the globe. I ran out of time to see as much (as thoroughly) as I would have liked. Thanks would",
          "We were lucky enough to arrive in Providence on the third Thursday evening of the month...when the RSID museum is free. So, without a concrete plan for the evening, we decided to puruse the museum before we went to dinner. Wow! What a wonderful museum. The museum is packed",
          "This is a treasure of a museum. You can find pretty much every style of artform within. The staff is friends and you can easily take it all in within a couple of hours. You will leave feeling quite cultured and full of joy from all the beauty you've taken in.",
          "To be honest I went in with low expectations since we have some of the best art museums in the world in NYC. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the museum and the collection. My students and I enjoyed the ancient artifacts. The number of world renowned painters",
          "My partner and I decided to take a few days to stay in Rhode Island. One of the things we wanted to make sure we caught was this museum. The Bona Drag temporary exhibit and the Greek and Roman room were on the top of my list and they didn't disappoint. I would recommend this to",

          "We were expecting a museum focused on design, but saw that in fact, the design displays in this museum are only a small fraction of the collection. There is an antique home that has been incorporated into the museum, and there are Asian, Greek and Egyptian components, among",

          "I knew I wanted to tour the RISD Museum but did not know much about it's collection. Extremely surprised by the Impressionists and some of the other unexpected pieces. I've seen Chihuly glass at the V&A in London and the MFA in Boston, and was thrilled to learn more about this",
          "The museum has a wide variety of artifacts from ancient Egypt and the Mediterranean through current day. The modern art section, 20th century, is a focus of course, but the museum has large presence of Impressionists - very rewarding.",
          "The RISD museum has something for everyone. Special visiting exhibits, classical, modern, European, Asian and more. I never tire of repeat visits. Check it out on Sundays for FREE! I brought my 8 year old niece this past summer and she was hooked. Left the museum and drove to",
          "The RISD Museum has a surprisingly large, varied, and high-quality collection -- everything from painting and sculpture to textiles and furniture, dating from 3000 BCE to yesterday. The exhibits are very professionally staged and curated, but the hodge-podge building makes it",

          "This museum is a gem and should be a destination for any one interested in art. The collection is extensive and the well displayed. The museum is just large enough to provide an very nice visit for a morning or an afternoon. On the first floor there is a collection of student",

          "My girlfriend and I have had this place on our list for a while. We went on a Sunday because it's FREE on Sundays which is great. My one complaint about that was there were lots of kids with their families - some sort of community arts function - so it was a bit on the loud",

          "This is a great museum - and far too big to visit properly in one day. Fabulous modern European masters (think quality not quantity) - representing Cassatt, Monet, Pissaro, Van Gogh, Picasso and more. Good collection from the middle ages and an acbsolutely stupendous collection",
          "We did a free (with admission) art hour program for kids with my 8 year old and it was awesome. It was interesting, informative, and engaging. Great way to introduce kids to art. The museum was also great. It has what I would almost call a sampling from many different",
          "Sure, it's not as grand or enormous as the Met or Louvre but, nevertheless, absolutely worth visiting. The permanent collection is fine, and every special exhibit I've seen has been curated so thoughtfully and, sometimes, even provocatively. Sometimes visiting a small museum",
          "The exhibit that was on was very liberal& contemporary, not my taste. The other floors were interesting & historical.",
          "RISD Museum is an eclectic yet expansive selection of art from colonial America through the current era. A half day would be useful to be able to see the whole collection but that would be at a very fast pace. The museum is spread across multiple buildings and multiple floors,",
          "We went to the museum on a Friday. We obtained passes from our local library. But, the cost for the museum is small and worth it. Parking is available in lots near the museum. You receive a 50% discount for parking. Just get the ticket validated at the entrance to the museum.",
          "Interesting museum that is small but not as small as it first appears, and has a range of different collections. Although I have never had to pay for admission I would be happy to shell out $10 or so.",
          "The museum is free on Sundays. Not sure I would have considered it worth the money had we had to pay, to be honest. It has a nice collection of design pieces, but the curation is somewhere between awful and haphazard. The layout of the exhibits is confusing. We spent less",
          "A lovely museum with a large and eclectic collection, including clothing, furniture, jewelry, paintings and sculpture -- spanning the ancient Greeks to today. We saw a fascinating special exhibit on the meaning of liberty and imprisonment and much of their permanent collection.",

          "What an amazing museum. I had no idea how big or how comprehensive this museum was. I loved the section that focused on RISD student submissions.",
          "We went on a Sunday, which is free admission. The exhibits are beautifully presented and feature quite a few big names in modern art, some of which had a political dimension that may upset some people (which made them all the more interesting). We didn't try the caf\u00e9 but it was",

          "As most other reviewers have indicated, this small museum is a real revelation. Although it is not the most well-laid out art museum I have ever visited, the modest-sized galleries are jam-packed with an astonishingly eclectic collection, from works of ancient Babylon and Egypt",

          "There were many famous paintings in the impressionistic section, very impressive collection in a small museum. It's very easy to tour and spent about 2 hours but, that was all due to the move and reconstruction of the museum with a few floors closed. In the one \"storage room\"",
          "This is one of the better mid-size art museums one is likely to encounter. Not surprising, considering its association with one of the nation's most respected design schools. Even so, the breadth and depth of the collections is impressive, and not to be missed if you are",
          "I was so blown away by the incredible amount of art in this little museum! I didn't expect there to be so many floors, and sections. I especially loved the Egyptian and Asian sections, as well as the section on Impressionism. The fact that it's free on Sunday was an especially",

          "The maze of the lay out reminds me of the streets in Boston. But I actually like that it makes it more fun to explore. The people working there are really helpful. They do not mind any and all questions. The different sections are laid out for easy viewing. I am not a big fan",

          "You would think a School of Design could provide a decent map of its collections, but the one I got here was useless! I ended up wandering aimlessly through the galleries, which led to several great discoveries, not least a historic home with remarkable Rhode Island furnishings.",

          "It's a bit confusing to navigate but elevators and friendly security guards were able to direct us to all parts of the museum. I most e joyed the Impressionists and fine sculptures. The museum is being updated but during renovations still excellent. The coffee shop is good too",
          "Great Art. Wonderful Bldg. & huge in size. I don't think one can appreciate the whole Bldg. in 1 visit. There is just too much to see. Open Late on Thursdays until 9pm. I love this place & I can't wait to visit again. Don't forget to visit the Gift Shop & buy some of the Artists",

          "I've lived in walking proximity of the museum for a year and a half, and had never been in until today! I don't know what took me so long to visit this small, but great musuem. Home to one of the largest Buddah statues in America, this attraction houses many awe inspiring",
          "A delightful museum with a much larger collection than expected. It has a peculiar layout, combining perhaps three buildings, so that in order to exit the way we came in, we had to go up to the 4th floor and then down another elevator. Very enjoyable.",
          "Its amazing that most of the people that go to this museum are from out of the state visitors. Such a great museum that even local Rhode Islanders do not know about. It has a little of everything and the place is deceiving from the outside as the how big it is after you",

          "So many great works in the permanent collection. The period rooms are a treat for small ones. all staff welcoming and informed. Not perfect for smallest amongst us but hey enjoyed the active booklet.",
          "The RISD Museum has different exhibitions and will interest many people. The museum is easy to get lost in (different interconnecting buildings). Staff is friendly and helpful. It is worth checking out if there are student exhibitions, we visited one which was nice.",
          "Excellent museum, with a wide selection of art available for viewing and interacting. Be sure to find the fabric section--and to ask for assistance in having them open drawers and bring out items you might not expect. Frequent lectures available, terrific new coffee shop with",

          "It would be a pity not to visit this smallish powerhouse of a museum if you are in Providence. While the museum is small compared to, say, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it packs in quite a variety of artwork, from Ancient Egypt and Asia to current trends in art and design.",
          "Nifty current impressionist show, Manet, Monet, others and some nice context. You do wander quite a bit when you're there and it's hard to understand the floor maps--mostly you don't believe them--but theyre accurate. No handout upon entry to know where the various exhibits are.",
          "This is a small art gallery in comparison to some of the Major museums but it has quality. The museum is compact and delightful.",
          "Their present show on \"Impressionism\" was worth the visit alone. But also don't miss their ancient artifacts.",
          "Around every corner, up every twisting staircase, up every elevator from floor 6 Egyptian, down to the Chace Plaza GS, you will find something surprising and enchanting. Loved the Nick Cave Sound Suit and the Chihuly glass work. The small but representative 'Inventing",

          "If you're an art lover in Providence, this is the place to be. I was left in awe with every artist displayed there! (Monet, Van Gogh, Picasso) and the curatorship was absolutely beautiful! They close at 5pm, and we got there an hour before so we didn't have time to see",

          "We happened to catch the Todd Oldham exhibit and WOW would be an understatement.. check out their website for current exhibits and times when they offer free admisssion.. Parking in the area is metered and there are a couple of nearby lots... definitely worth a visit",
          "Many Museums can be overwhelming and mentally exhausting like the Metropolitan Museum in New York, which is amazing, but takes virtually 4-5 days to truly explore. This museum is effective yet just the right amount of size that it doesn't feel as overwhelming as other museums",
          "This Museum has an extremely varied and eclectic collection. Modern Art, Colonial Art, Egyptian collection, Furniture, etc.etc.etc. It's housed in several interconnected buildings. One of the best small museums we have ever been to..",

          "That tells it all and explains the confusing layout that extends over multiple buildings that are on a steep hill. So the entrance level into the first floor of the historic mansion is on the third (I think) floor of the museum. That said, it's an imaginative museum with",
          "Excellant collection of fashion exhibited at the museum! RISD is such a fascinating campus to visit.",
          "I was so impressed with the depth of this collection. There is something for everyone here: textiles, porcelain, furniture, sculptures as well as Monet, Degas, Braque, Picasso, Warhol and the rest of the more well known artists. This place would hold the interest of many.",

          "We had been recommended to go here by our Airbnb host - a great choice! For a museum on a small site there is so much to see - we ended up going back on a separate day as there were things we had not been able to look at and other items that we wanted to see again. There are",
          "Located right on Benefit street, this museum is within walking distance of some of the last few free places to park in the city. This was our first time visiting the museum and we had no idea what to expect. We thought, perhaps, that we would be seeing the art and fashion",
          "Three linked museums; one general museum with stuff from ancient Egypt to modern times, one period house and one of modern art. A very pleasant couple of hours",
          "I have been going to the RISD Museum since the 1980s, and go several times a year. The regular collections - the big wooden Buddha, and the Egyptian exhibits (which are impressive, and include a mummy), and the incredible first-floor gallery of portraits and landscapes - are",
          "You wouldn't expect much since there's not much to see from the outside. We got free admissions from Bank of America but it's apparently free on Sundays. There's is a fair amount of abstract pieces and of course industrial designs and textiles. The Rennaisance art collection is",
          "A nice way to spend a couple of hours. It's right on Benefit Street. The gift shop as a lot of things that have been designed by RISD grads, some which you might have seen in stores, but many which are not ones you will usually find at your local Target.",
          "I was thoroughly blown away to enter rooms filled with Claude Monet's and Vincent Van Gogh's paintings! The docent was very knowledgeable and shared the rich history of how the museum acquired such fine paintings for it's collection! We were very grateful to have learned so",
          "A wonderful collection of Ancient, European, Early American , American , and Modern Art and Design .",
          "A solid good museum with a good collection. The focus is largely on furniture and we enjoyed the Todd Oldham collection. While this collection ended last week, you will not be disappointed by the other exhibits. Plan on spending 1-2 hours here and it certainly is worth it.",

          "I have been twice and would love to go more often. It is such manageably sized museum with a large variety of exhibits. I have stars in my eyes from having just seen Todd Oldham's fashions on special exhibit. Truly spectacular. I was fortunate to make it there on the last day.",

          "This is a beautiful museum with a nice variety of items on display, from Egyptian artifacts to paintings by the masters to a replica of a colonial home including furnishings, porcelain items and silver. Beautiful! And free on Sundays!",
          "A reasonably sized museum, with a variety of pieces. It mainly focuses on furniture, but it includes paintings. It is bigger than expected. Reasonably priced at $12.",
          "RISD Museum does not belong to the citizens of RI, it is an extension of Rhode Island School of Design, therefore a Museum accessible to both the community and legions of visitors who visit the city of Providence. Unlike the great Museums of the world, like the MET in NY City,",
          "The RISD museum was a delightful surprise. They had a fabulous Todd Oldham retrospective when we were there and it was an amazing array of beautifully displayed \"costumes\" from this high fashion designer. Unfortunately this exhibit closes on September 11, 2016, but if you can",
          "From the outside, especially entering near the cafe, it doesn't seem like the museum will be like much. Boy were we wrong. This museum was HUGE and easy to get lost in (but in a good way!!). It contained a variety of materials, exhibits, and more! We had such a great time.",
          "The price is just right with this place and with some pieces by Van Gogh and Picasso definitely worth the visit. The security guards were a bit overzealous but I can understand with some of the loud and clueless patrons that were there.",
          "Providence is small. It's art museum is also small. Having said that, this museum has wonderful amount of art both contemporary and historical. I am never disappointed when I visit. Another wonderful thing is that they offer free membership to artists who live in Rhode Island.",
          "This is a beautiful art museum. The giant blue room with all of the paintings is outstanding! If you visit on Sunday, the admission is for free! What a better and relaxing way than to complete any weekend trip or adventure with a free exploration of the powerful art within!",
          "The RISD Museum has wonderful exhibits, and the current fashion extravaganza is no exception. The galleries are great space and the curatorial staff are superb. However, be patient as the organization of the collection is a bit hodge podge.",
          "With all the wonderful reviews this museum got I was excited for my visit. Parking is impossible. If you are trying to locate handicapped parking, there wasn't any available. There is a lot you can park in and pay over $20, but with a wheelchair finding handicapped entrance",
          "Wonderful place to take the kids. We went Sunday because it was free and the kids loved it. So much different art work, the kids had a ball",
          "I love the Rhode Island School of Design Museum. It is an excellent small museum that you can visit in a couple of hours. It is on a different scale from the NYC museums like the Met, the Guggenheim or the MOMA or the Boston Museum of Fine Arts but if you are visiting Provi, it",

          "The RISD museum shows a great collection in a great city. They offer a nice little coffee shop hosted by Bolt Coffee that opens early before the museum, too. The scope of the collection is broad, and being operated under the auspices of a higher ed institution, they present",
          "We stopped at the museum before driving home on Sunday since it's free on Sundays. They have a good collection - it took us a little over and hour to see the stuff that we were interested in.",
          "RISD once you figure out how to get in the building is a fine visit for a short time. They cover many different subjects from fashion to ancient Egypt but none very deep so it a good survey location. I went for the federal period furniture and indeed the 6 or so room",

          "This is a really cool museum with some world class art and artifacts. I've been by it many times, but never knew it would be so good. Great staff and gift shop too. Very manageable if you are on a tight schedule and definitely worth the trip.",
          "A great range of art from Egyptian to modern art. Quite a few famous artists paintings as well as Rodin sculptures. Also the fashion exhibition was very interesting by Todd. Layout can be tricky to navigate but it was well worth the effort",
          "Had a wonderful afternoon visiting the museum while in Providence. There was a special Tod Oldham exhibit was was wonderful . Dozens of dressed mannequins, videos, behind there fashion stories and scenes -- really great. Lots of other things to see as well and I'd make it a must",
          "I was surprised how many rooms were in the museum. There were so many things to see. It covered various places in the world such as Egypt, Europe, and China. It also covered many time periods. Definitely enjoyed the Todd Oldham collection.",
          "This museum was free with a military ID. It was hard to find free parking, but once inside this was an world-class museum. The exhibits had detailed placards for every object and they were not crowed. We saw the temporary exhibit \"All of Everything Todd Oldham Fashion\" which",
          "The RISD museum is small and can be covered in about an hour if you are not stopping to sketch or rest. Their space and their collection are both outstanding, Tends to run to contemporary art, which is right up my alley, but they have an interesting mix as well.",
          "A very good museum with high quality. I especially loved their glass collection, but I also found quite a few gems along their paintings. There is really something for everybody. The special exhibition on fashion and clothes design was terrific and fun. The building itself is",
          "An amazing Todd Oldham exhibit was on while we were there. I'm not all that into fashion, but this was truly spectacular. However, the student gallery was tremendous. Make sure you visit while in Providence. You can be in and out in under an hour, as well.",
          "More than I expected. Art from around the globe and from every time period. I especially love the big blue room full of paintings. Cute gift shop where some serious damage could be done if you don't practice self control! But also a good place to find special gifts.",
          "Wonderful selection of artistic styles and antiquities, but a little disappointed at the lack of more modern sculptures. The layout of he floors and accessibility of the elevators/levels is very confusing. It is definitely worth the price of admission as there is so much to see!",
          "I was surprised at how much this museum has to offer. Thoroughly enjoyed walking thru with the kids for about 2 hours.",
          "The RISD has such a great reputation that I was a little disappointed. They have a fine arts museum, and were showing avant-garde works by students and a fashion designer with roots in Turin, Italy. But, I wanted more. I wanted their store to be like the MOMA's in NYC. Full of",
          "I wish we could have spent several more hours at this wonderful museum. It is a great balance between works of RISD alums and other artists. It is bigger than I thought it would be. We will go back.",
          "As my personal expectation and as a designer myself, I was hoping for a more contemporary exhibit, but the building is gorgeous (albeit difficult to navigate inside, even with the map), and the different exhibits were interesting. Nice checking the gift shop on our way out! Went",
          "A great museum - not overwhelming but expansive. They have great selective works from major artists from every era. Free on Sunday.",
          "I loved visiting this museum as a child and spending time in the Buddha room enjoying the peacefulness. Coming back as an adult is wonderful, too; the museum has expanded considerably and hosts amazing exhibits, like this summer's Todd Oldham retrospective.",

          "I took my niece (12) to RISD Museum because they had a fashion display. Knew she'd love it, and she did. But she also loved the furniture and interiors. She was especially attracted to the minimalist and arts and crafts tables. That was surprising to me. She walked out of",
          "beautiful pieces by several of the master painters and sculptors as well as ones you won't find elsewhere.",
          "Had a great relaxing day admiring the artwork. Not many people when I went so I was able to thoroughly enjoy and take my time. Will be back.",
          "This museum was beyond my expectations. It is small enough to be manageable, but so.ehow had lots of goodies, including classics, stored away inside. Lovely, creative building. A must do!",

          "First for new things: there is a coffee shop (Benefit St. Entrance) with a limited menu of the most expensive coffee in Providence, some baked goods and small plates. The space is quite nice and I think when school is in session it will be impossible to get a seat. The museum",
          "Nothing much to add. I have said it all but I appreciate the reviews. A major drawback in this museum is the lack of seating in the special exhibit. They had some great videos and no where to sit and watch. I got tired and left after seeing some American decorative arts b",

          "Had no idea his was so expansive; we scheduled a few hours, but there are actually about 5 distinct museums buildings connected together. We spent as long as we could until we were all so hungry we had to leave for our lunch, which ended up so late we didn't bother with",

          "We arrived at RISD and were pleasantly surprised at the breadth of the collection. The docents were knowledgable. The cafe was also very nice. Take time to go to the student collections. There is a nice museum store but the better shopping experience is at the art materials",
          "The RISD museum has an amazing collection, everything from Old Masters and Impressionist paintings to Asian art and \"decorative\" arts, including some masterpieces of design. It is not a huge museum -- you can indeed see it all on one long-ish visit -- but allow at least a few",

          "There was so much to really see and experience in the galleries that blend from one room and building too the next. There is something for everyone and more! We went on a sunny winter Sunday when it was free and it was not too crowded. I look forward to a return visit.",
          "I love art museums, especially small-scale museums at colleges/universities. I did not fall in love with this one, though. That may say more about my frame of mind at the time than the museum itself, however. It costs $12 for admission. There is a mix of contemporary art,",
          "I have always liked artsy things. When I taught school, the fourth grade trip was to RISD. It was fabulous! The docents are so nice, and for the most part they are great with kids. The exhibits change regularly, so if you were there last year there will be something new to",

          "This museum is on the medium-small side, but it's collection is solid. What it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality (pardon the cliche). One of the great perks of its size is that the art seems more palatable-- it doesn't feel overwhelming or heavy, and you don't have",
          "This museum was much bigger and better than I expected. I went with my daughter who had to do an assignment for a college course expecting it to be RISD student art, which would have been fine. It is a large, very well laid out museum of art from many periods of time. There",
          "We went to the Museum on a warmish January day. The paintings are laid out very well with some work done by well known and not well known artists. Every aspect of what would you see in a museum was there. The house attached gave two looks into history.",
          "I must take exception to the assumption made that this museum is for the students at RISD! The RI Art Association began its crusade to establish the Museum long before RISD was established as a school- and for a museum this size, it manages to display an amazingly rich and",

        "wiki": "Prospect Terrace Park is a park located on Congdon Street in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. The park was founded in 1869, on land that was given to the city by residents of the neighborhood. The park is known as \"The Jewel of the City\" for its dramatic elevated view of Providence's \"downcity.\"\nAuthor and Providence native H. P. Lovecraft frequently visited the park.\n\n\n== History ==\nA statue of theologian Roger Williams (designed by architect Ralph Thomas Walker) was built in the late 1930s after Williams' descendant Stephen Randall made a deed of gift for the monument. It was dedicated on 29 June 1939. The approximate 15-foot tall granite statue commemorates Williams' founding of the state of Rhode Island and his promotion for religious freedom, and the statue depicts Williams gazing over the city.In 1939, Roger Williams' remains were moved into a tomb that lies directly beneath the statue. His body had been overgrown by the roots of an apple tree next to his original grave. The roots grew over the form of his body so that it looked similar to a human form. The remainder of his bones were reburied in a bronze casket and placed beneath his statue in Prospect Terrace. The so-called \"Williams Root\" is preserved and is now on display at the John Brown House Museum on the East Side of Providence.In 2006, vandals removed all five fingers of the statue's left hand, along with the thumb of his right hand. The damage was repaired in 2010.In December 2016, efforts were started by the College Hill Neighborhood Association to raise funds for improvements and restoration to the park. New benches, signs, and landscaping, were planned. Previously, the park had not been renovated for 28 years.\n\n\n== The view ==\n\nProspect Terrace Park attracts visitors and locals alike for its panoramic view of the city. From the elevated location of the park, one can see many of Providence's most prominent landmarks, from Providence Place Mall to the Rhode Island State House to the Meeting House of the First Baptist Church in America. The park's west-facing view makes it ideal for taking in the sunset.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Don't get me wrong, I love a good lookout/vista but I feel like this one was a bit overrated. It's not a sweeping view of the city. It's more like a few pockets of city-line between the trees. I suggest it to be a quick stop on the way to somewhere. Not a destination. There",

          "My friend and I first came here at night as it was the meeting place for the ghost tour. We came back during the day and found the park to have a beautiful view of the city. It was a bit weird that the statue faced out towards the city, but I understand the concept of William",
          "I found this tiny park and huge statue highly representative of Providence, very contradictory issues of scale in play. As for the views, again, there are issues. Trees blocking the bulk of the view of the city below. Back of the statue is the view from the park. Front of",
          "This is the site of the sometimes-maligned statue of Roger Williams overlooking Providence from a high hillside. (I agree that the statue does look a bit stiff and featureless, but its very size makes it impressive.) Since 1939, Williams's remains have rested in a tomb directly",

        "wiki": "Providence is the capital and most populous city of the state of Rhode Island and is one of the oldest cities in the United States. It was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams, a Reformed Baptist theologian and religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He named the area in honor of \"God's merciful Providence\" which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers. The city is situated at the mouth of the Providence River at the head of Narragansett Bay.\nProvidence was one of the first cities in the country to industrialize and became noted for its textile manufacturing and subsequent machine tool, jewelry, and silverware industries. Today, the city of Providence is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning which have shifted the city's economy into service industries, though it still retains some manufacturing activity.\nThe city is the third-most-populous city in New England after Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nProvidence was settled in June 1636 by Roger Williams and grew into one of the original Thirteen Colonies. Williams was compelled to leave Massachusetts Bay Colony due to his differing religious views, and he and others established Providence Plantations. This settlement merged with others to become the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and it was a refuge for persecuted religious dissenters from the beginning.Providence Plantations was burned to the ground in March 1676 by the Narragansetts during King Philip's War, despite the good relations between Williams and the sachems with whom the United Colonies of New England were waging war. Later in the year, the Rhode Island legislature formally rebuked the other colonies for provoking the war.Providence residents were among the first Patriots to spill blood in the lead-up to the American Revolutionary War during the Gaspee Affair of 1772, and Rhode Island was the first of the Thirteen Colonies to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown on May 4, 1776. It was also the last of the Thirteen States to ratify the United States Constitution on May 29, 1790, once assurances were made that a Bill of Rights would become part of the Constitution.Following the war, Providence was the country's ninth-largest city  with 7,614 people. The economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, in particular machinery, tools, silverware, jewelry, and textiles. By the start of the 20th century, Providence hosted some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country, including Brown & Sharpe, Nicholson File, and Gorham Manufacturing Company.\n\nProvidence residents ratified a city charter in 1831 as the population passed 17,000. The seat of city government was located in the Market House in Market Square from 1832 to 1878, which was the geographic and social center of the city. The city offices outgrew this building, and the City Council resolved to create a permanent municipal building in 1845.  The city offices moved into the Providence City Hall in 1878.\n\nLocal politics split over slavery during the American Civil War, as many had ties to Southern cotton and the slave trade. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, the number of military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union. Providence thrived after the war, and waves of immigrants brought the population from 54,595 in 1865 to 175,597 by 1900.By the early 1900s, Providence was one of the wealthiest cities in the United States. Immigrant labor powered one of the nation's largest industrial manufacturing centers. Providence was a major manufacturer of industrial products, from steam engines to precision tools to silverware, screws, and textiles. Giant companies were based in or near Providence, such as Brown & Sharpe, the Corliss Steam Engine Company, Babcock & Wilcox, the Grinnell Corporation, the Gorham Manufacturing Company, Nicholson File, and the Fruit of the Loom textile company.From 1975 until 1982, $606 million of local and national community development funds were invested throughout the city. In the 1990s, the city pushed for revitalization, realigning the north-south railroad tracks, removing the huge rail viaduct that separated downtown from the capitol building, uncovering and moving the rivers (which had been covered by paved bridges) to create Waterplace Park and river walks along the rivers' banks, and constructing the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Alex and Ani City Center) and the Providence Place Mall.Despite new investment, poverty remains an entrenched problem. Approximately 27.9 percent of the city population is living below the poverty line. Recent increases in real estate values further exacerbate problems for those at marginal income levels, as Providence had the highest rise in median housing price of any city in the United States from 2004 to 2005.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Providence city limits enclose a small geographical region with a total area of 20.5 square miles (53 km2); 18.5 square miles (48 km2) of it is land and the remaining 2.1 square miles (5.4 km2) is water (roughly 10%). Providence is located at the head of Narragansett Bay, with the Providence River running into the bay through the center of the city, formed by the confluence of the Moshassuck and Woonasquatucket Rivers. The Waterplace Park amphitheater and riverwalks line the river's banks through downtown.\nProvidence is one of many cities claimed to be founded on seven hills like Rome. The more prominent hills are: Constitution Hill (near downtown), College Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and containing New England's largest Italian district outside of Massachusetts). The other four are: Tockwotten Hill at Fox Point, Smith Hill (where the State House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston and Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill at the lower end of Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early 1880s.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nProvidence has 25 official neighborhoods, though these neighborhoods are often grouped together and referred to collectively:\nThe East Side is a region comprising the neighborhoods of Blackstone, Hope (aka Summit), Mount Hope, College Hill, Wayland, and Fox Point.\nThe Jewelry District describes the area enclosed by I-95, the old I-195, and the Providence River. The city has made efforts to rename this area the Knowledge District to reflect the area's newly developing life sciences and technology-based economy.\nThe North End is formed by the concatenation of the neighborhoods of Charles, Wanskuck, Smith Hill, Elmhurst, and Mount Pleasant.\nThe South Side (or South Providence) consists of the neighborhoods of Elmwood, Lower South Providence, Upper South Providence, Washington Park, and the West End.\nWest Broadway is an officially recognized neighborhood with its own association. It overlaps with the southern half of Federal Hill and the northern part of the West End.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city of Providence is geographically very compact, characteristic of eastern seaboard cities that developed prior to use of the automobile. It is among the most densely populated cities in the country. For this reason, Providence has the eighth-highest percentage of pedestrian commuters. The street layout is irregular; more than one thousand streets (a great number for the city's size) run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places such as Market Square.Downtown Providence has numerous 19th-century mercantile buildings in the Federal and Victorian architectural styles, as well as several post-modern and modernist buildings located throughout the area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development. West Exchange Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two.\nThe newer area, sometimes called \"Capitol Center\", includes Providence Place Mall (1999), the Omni Providence Hotel (1993) and The Residences Providence (2007), GTECH Corporation (2006), Waterplace Towers condominiums (2007), and Waterplace Park (1994). The area tends toward newer development, since much of it is land reclaimed in the 1970s from a mass of railroad tracks referred to colloquially as the \"Chinese Wall\". This part of Downtown is characterized by open spaces, wide roads, and landscaping.\nThe historic part of downtown has many streetscapes that look as they did 80 years ago. Many of the state's tallest buildings are found here. The largest structure at 426 feet (130 m) is the art deco-styled Industrial National Bank Building (formerly Industrial Trust Tower). By contrast, nearby to it is the second tallest One Financial Plaza, designed in modern taut-skin cladding, constructed a half-century later. In between the two is 50 Kennedy Plaza. The Textron Tower is also a core building to the modest Providence skyline. Downtown is also the home of the Providence Biltmore and Westminster Arcade, the oldest enclosed shopping mall in the U.S., built in 1828.The city's southern waterfront, away from the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Russian Submarine Museum was located here until 2008, when the submarine sank in a storm and was declared a loss. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found here, built to protect Providence from storm surge like that which it endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol.The majority of the cityscape comprises abandoned and revitalized industrial mills, double- and triple-decker housing (though row houses are rare, found so commonly in other Northeast cities), a small number of high-rise buildings (predominantly for housing the elderly), and single family homes. Interstate 95 serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods such as Federal Hill and the West End.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nProvidence has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa) bordering a humid subtropical climate with hot summers, cold winters, and high humidity year-round. The USDA places the city in hardiness zone 6b, with the suburbs in zones 6a \u2013 7b. The influence of the Atlantic Ocean keeps the state of Rhode Island warmer than many inland locales in New England. January is the coldest month with a daily mean of 29.2 \u00b0F (\u22121.6 \u00b0C) and low temperatures dropping to 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) or lower an average of 11 days per winter, while July is the warmest month with a daily mean of 73.5 \u00b0F (23.1 \u00b0C) and highs rising to 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) or higher an average of 10 days per summer. Extremes range from \u221217 \u00b0F or \u221227.2 \u00b0C on February 9, 1934 to 104 \u00b0F or 40 \u00b0C on August 2, 1975; the record cold daily maximum is 1 \u00b0F (\u221217.2 \u00b0C) on February 5, 1918, while the record warm daily minimum is 80 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C) on June 6, 1925. Temperature readings of 0 \u00b0F or \u221217.8 \u00b0C or lower are uncommon in Providence and generally occur once every several years. The year which had the most days with a temperature reading of zero degrees or lower was 2015 with eight days total\u2014one day in January and seven days in February. Conversely, temperature readings of 100 \u00b0F or 37.8 \u00b0C or higher are even rarer, and the year with the most days in this category was 1944 with three days, all of which were in August.Monthly precipitation in Providence ranges from a high of 4.43 inches (112.5 mm) in March to a low of 3.17 inches (80.5 mm) in July. In general, precipitation levels are slightly less in the summer months than the winter months, when Nor'easters can cause significant snowfall and blizzard conditions. Hurricanes are not frequent in coastal New England, although Providence's location at the head of Narragansett Bay makes it vulnerable to them.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2000, the population consisted of 173,618 people, 162,389 households, and 35,859 families. The population density was 9,401.7 inhabitants per square mile (3,629.4/km\u00b2), characteristic of other small cities in New England such as New Haven, Connecticut; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut.  Its population peaked in the 1940s, just prior to the nationwide period of rapid suburbanization.\nProvidence has a racially and ethnically diverse population. In 2010, white Americans formed 49.8% of the population, including a sizable white Hispanic community. Non-Hispanic whites were 37.6% of the total population, down from 89.5% in 1970. Providence has had a substantial Italian population since the start of the 20th century, with 14% of the population claiming Italian ancestry. Italian influence manifests itself in Providence's Little Italy in Federal Hill.  Irish immigrants have also had considerable influence on the city's history, with 8% of residents claiming Irish heritage. The city also has a sizeable Jewish community, estimated at 10,500 in 2012 or roughly 5% of the city's population.\n\nIn 2010, people of Hispanic or Latino origin composed 38.1% of the city's population and currently form a majority of city public school students. The majority of Hispanics in Providence are of Dominican descent, having one of the largest Dominican populations in the United States. Other Hispanic groups present in large numbers are Puerto Ricans and Guatemalans. Hispanics are most concentrated in the neighborhoods of Elmwood, the West End, and Upper and Lower South Providence.  The city elected its first Hispanic mayor in 2010, Dominican-American Angel Taveras.\nAfrican Americans constitute 16% of the city's population, with their greatest concentrations found in Mount Hope and the Upper and Lower South Providence neighborhoods. Asians are 6% of Providence's population and have enclaves scattered throughout the city. The largest Asian groups are Cambodians (1.7%), Chinese (1.1%), Asian Indians (0.7%), Laotians (0.6%), and Koreans (0.6%). Another 6% of the city has multiracial ancestry. American Indians and Pacific Islanders make up the remaining 1.3%. Liberians compose 0.4% of the population; the city is home to one of the largest Liberian immigrant populations in the country.Providence has a considerable community of immigrants from various Portuguese-speaking countries, especially Portugal, Brazil, and Cape Verde, living mostly in the areas of Washington Park and Fox Point. Portuguese is the city's third-largest European ethnicity, after Italian and Irish, at 4% of the population; Cape Verdeans compose 2%.The Providence metropolitan area includes Providence, Fall River, Massachusetts, and Warwick, and is estimated to have a population of 1,622,520. In 2006, this area was officially added to the Boston Combined Statistical Area (CSA), the sixth-largest CSA in the country. In the last 15 years, Providence has experienced a sizable growth in its under-18 population. The median age of the city is 28 years, while the largest age cohort is 20- to 24-year-olds, owing to the city's large student population.The per capita income as of the 2000 census was $15,525, which is well below both the state average of $29,113 and the national average of $21,587.  The median income for a household was $26,867, and the median income for a family in Providence was $32,058, according to the 2000 census. The city has one of the highest rates of poverty in the nation with 29.1% of the population and 23.9% of families living below the poverty line in 2000, the largest concentrations being found in the city's Olneyville, and Upper and Lower South Providence areas. Poverty has affected children at a disproportionately higher rate, with 40.1% of those under the age of 18 living below the poverty line, concentrated west of downtown in the neighborhoods of Hartford, Federal Hill, and Olneyville.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nCompared to the national average, Providence has an average rate of violent crime and a higher rate of property crime per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2010, there were 15 murders, down from 24 in 2009. In 2010, Providence fared better regarding violent crime than most of its peer cities. Springfield, Massachusetts has approximately 20,000 fewer residents than Providence but reported 15 murders in 2009, the same number of homicides as Providence but a slightly higher rate per capita.  The police chief asserted that Providence's violence was not stranger-to-stranger, but relationship-driven.  The pattern of violent crime was highly specific by neighborhood, with the vast majority of the murders taking place in the poorer sections of Providence such as Olneyville, Elmwood, South Providence, and the West End.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAround 1830, Providence had manufacturing industries in metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Manufacturing has declined since, but the city is still one of the largest centers for jewelry and silverware design and manufacturing. Services also make up a large portion of the city's economy, in particular education, healthcare, and finance. Providence also is the site of a sectional center facility (SCF), a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service. It is the capital of Rhode Island, so the city's economy additionally consists of government services.\n\nProminent companies headquartered in Providence include Fortune 500 Textron, an advanced technologies industrial conglomerate; United Natural Foods, a distributor of natural and organic foods; Fortune 1000 Nortek Incorporated; Gilbane, a construction and real estate company; and GTECH Corporation, which recently moved its world headquarters to downtown Providence. Citizens Bank is also headquartered in Providence and is the 15th largest bank in the country.The city is home to the Rhode Island Convention Center, which opened in December 1993. Along with a hotel, the convention center is connected to the Providence Place Mall, a major retail center, through a skywalk. The Port of Providence is the second largest deep-water seaport in New England. It handles cargos such as cement, chemicals, heavy machinery, petroleum, and scrap metal. Providence is also home to some of toy manufacturer Hasbro's business operations, although their headquarters are in Pawtucket.\n\n\n=== Top employers ===\nAccording to the City's 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top twenty employers in the city are:\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the state capital, Providence houses the Rhode Island General Assembly, as well as the offices of the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor in the Rhode Island State House.

F. Green Airport in Warwick, and general aviation fields also serve the region. Massport has been promoting T. F. Green as an alternative to Boston's Logan International Airport because of over-crowding. Providence Station is located between the Rhode Island State House and the downtown district and is served by Amtrak and MBTA Commuter Rail services, with a commuter rail route running north to Boston and south to T.F. Green Airport and Wickford Junction. Approximately 2,400 passengers pass through the station per day.I-95 runs from north to south through Providence; I-195 connects the city to eastern Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, including New Bedford, Massachusetts and Cape Cod. I-295 encircles Providence, while RI 146 provides a direct connection with Worcester, Massachusetts. The city began the long-term project Iway in 2007 to move I-195 for safety reasons, to free up land, and to reunify the Jewelry District with downtown Providence, which had been separated by the highway.

Of particular note is the East Side Trolley Tunnel running under College Hill, whose use is reserved for RIPTA buses. RIPTA also operates the Providence LINK, a system of tourist trolleys in downtown Providence. From 2000 to 2008, RIPTA operated a seasonal ferry to Newport, Rhode Island between May and October, but SeaStreak began operating that ferry route in 2016.  In 2018, RIPTA began construction of the \"Downtown Transit Connector\", an upgraded BRT service to run from Providence Station to the Hospital District.\n\n\n==== Walking and bicycling ====\nThe city serves as the end point for four of the state's major traffic-free bicycle paths: the East Bay Bike Path, Washington Secondary Rail Trail, the Woonasquatuck Greenway Bike Path, and the Blackstone River Greenway. There are several dedicated on-road bicycle lanes within the city.In 2017, the city signed a $400,000 contract with a private Silicon Valley company to introduce Providence's first bicycle sharing program, supported by local hospitals and RIPTA. Shortly after the program started in September 2018, the bicycles became associated with a \"wave of vandalism and criminal activity\" including widespread thefts of bicycles, bikes tossed into the Providence river, and even a company tech held at gunpoint. The company suspended the program in August 2019.In August 2019, a pedestrian bridge opened, spanning the Providence River and connecting the east and west sides of downtown. It was built on the granite piers of the old Route 195 bridge.In January 2020, mayor Jorge Elorza unveiled a \"Great Streets\" initiative to create a framework of public space improvements to encourage walking, riding bicycles, and public transit. The plan includes establishing an \"Urban Trail Network\" which includes 60 miles of bicycle paths, bike lanes, and greenways within Providence.\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\nElectricity and natural gas are provided by National Grid. Providence Water is responsible for the distribution of drinking water, ninety percent of which comes from the Scituate Reservoir about ten miles (16 km) west of downtown, with contributions coming from four smaller bodies of water. Drinking water in Providence has been rated among the highest quality in the country.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nAs of 2016, Providence had five sister cities: \n Praia (1994)\n Florence (2002)\n Santo Domingo (2004)\n Zhuhai (2015)\n Guatemala City (2016)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of people from Providence, Rhode Island\nList of tallest buildings in Providence\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Providence, Rhode Island\nNeighborhoods in Providence\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"EDC Profile City of Providence\".

          "Great place to take small children. My toddler loves almost all of the exhibits here. The water room is on the first floor and is his favorite, but we always save it for last because he usually gets wet. Even with the smock on, water can run down his arms onto his shirt, and",
          "If you are looking for a super gift for families that have young children, a season pass to the Providence Children's Museum is a great one to consider. The Museum has many, mamy hands-on exhibits for children of all ages (less so for adolescents). They can have fun, be loud,",
          "We have taken several of our grand kids here. They love it! Always a worthwhile trip. Plenty of places to play and learn. I like that the gift shop was turned into a room for snacks.",

          "We love coming here almost as much as the kids. The water activity room is awesome, but be careful you will ultimately get a little wet....if your child is younger or messy suggest bringing a change of clothing just in case. Bathrooms on each floor with stools for the kids (",
          "We love this museum. It is superior to Boston\u2019s much more ballyhooed museum. There is a wide variety of functions and interests. We\u2019ve been four time with s child aged 18 mo- 2 1/2 and she finds new discoveries each time The staff is great. The layout is very family",
          "took my grandson here age 19 months. Lots of things for the little guy to see and do. some things he does not understand yet but the next time I am sure he will as he is a smart little guy. It was great seeing him smile at the things he did understand and he ran aroung looking",
          "On a rainy day or sunny, toddlers and young ones need to be kept occupied with different activities often. Here, they will be kept busy all the time. There are things to touch and play with which would keep your little ones busy for a couple of hours. Hopefully, by then, it\u2019ll",
          "Awesome museum, tons of activities, very self-directed (which lets a parent kind of sit back and allow them to handle most of it themselves). Nice outdoor area for when that is an option. Good location for a birthday party, too (and if you tell your guests they get a free pass",
          "We took our 16 month old here this weekend and she had a blast! The must sees are the water room and the \"light-bright\" corner. Very friendly staff and not too crowded. We got there right at 9am and had the whole parking lot to ourselves. When we left at 11, it was packed. Not",
          "Took my 3 years daughter and baby to museum. It is nice and not big place with a lot of fun stuff to do. My daughter loves it. It was raining day and it was a lot of people, but it was still enough space for everyone. Has free parking, some out outside activities but because of",
          "Our 4 year old and 15 month old sons loved the museum! There was plenty for both boys to do. The baby loved the Lite Bright-type wall. Older son loved the construction roller and the wooden blocks. The water room was so fun!! Brilliant idea having the rubber smocks for the",
          "great children\u2019s museum! My children 7 and 2 love the water section and I had a great time with them. Cool vacuum hoses which reminded me of old bank teller drive through boxes. Definitely worth the stop!",
          "This is a nice museum for kids. There are a lot of wonderful activities for them, and even on a day when there are lots of kids around, it still was a pleasant experience. It is easy to get to, parking is free (although the lot was filling up by 11am), and for the price it\u2019s a",
          "It was very busy when we were there on a rainy day and it definitely felt tight. We were bumping into each other constantly. It's really good for an hour/ hour and a half and then you've seen everything. Pretty standard children's museum on the smaller side. There's like one",
          "Let me begin by saying this is a great children's museum. So good, that we have purchased a family membership every year. Kids love this place, lots of hands on, fun things to do. We bring a lunch ( they don't sell food but there's a little cafeteria for you to eat in ) and make",
          "Spent the afternoon with my daughter and wife here and we had a blast. My daughter absolutely loved the water tables and had fun in every little nook and cranny of this place. The place was clean and well maintained with a lot of interesting and educational areas. As parents,",
          "We have been to many children\u2019s museums, and this is one of our favorites because our 9, 6, and 2 year old can be occupied engagingly for 3 hours with its many hands on activities. Size is manageable, and not crowded weekdays. Very friendly staff. Very easy to get to. Parking",
          "We visited on Marathon Monday in 2018 which was rainy and very cold so there were MANY families there. This meant it was hard for the children to thoroughly engage with the activities. The paper airplane construction area was the most popular with the children in our party who",
          "Though the Providence Children's Museum is smaller than its counterpart in Boston, there are a lot of the same features -- such as the water tables and the areas for infants to play. We enjoyed this very much with our 6 year old -- lots to do and see, and she was thoroughly",
          "Kids (7 & 11) loved the water room, but went through the rest of the rooms rather quickly. Outdoor space (It was unfortunately raining/sleeting when we went.) looked neat and the toddler area as well. We (the adults) appreciated the history of Rhode Island exhibit, which more",

          "There aren\u2019t very many rooms but what they do have is very nice. My four year old had fun particularly in their outdoor play area where there are a series of tunnels they can play in and the water room. For such a small place it packs at least an hour to two hours of fun for",
          "What a lovely children's museum. So much to see, touch and do! If the kids gets antsy, there's even a small playground to give your child something else to do! Great for busy hands and feet! Great place to spend a couple of hours. The earlier in the day you can go, the less",
          "Great place to take the kids or grandkids! The water room alone will keep them busy for hours! It can be very busy on a rainy day.",
          "My kids love visiting the Providence Children's Museum, they have a great variety of activities but can be overcrowded on the weekends.",
          "We were in town just for a few days to visit family. Because of rain, our original plans fell through and we went here instead. The place was packed! According to their website they provide umbrella strollers and ask you to leave your big bulky stroller at home. However",
          "We live in the south shore of Massachusetts so Providence and Boston are almost equidistant from our house. I took my son here for something to do while the wife was away and couldn't have been more impressed. It's half the cost of the Boston Children's museum, has free parking",
          "We had a pass for 1/2 off from our local library, so it was a really good deal. While the museum is quite small, there are a couple of really fun activities. My 5-year old loved loved it.",
          "While in Narragansett for a family vacation, we got ambushed by cold wet weather. Needing to get out of the house for a while, we went to this museum. The cost was $9 per person, but due to a partnership with a local kids museum we are members of, we got 3 passes for free.",
          "We were driving through and when because that are a part of the blue star program (free for military) for a month or so. Glad we did the kid loved it and didn't want to leave. Come prepared for your kid to get wet the water learning center is great. They have aprons but it's",
          "This place is great to let you kids have an educational day and explore! The water table was a big hit for the kids and the extra large light-brite was a big hit for me...oh the memories! Theres so much for the kids to see and interact with. Great summer time activity to get out",
          "Great spot on a hot day for the kids! Limited outdoor tables in the enclosed outside play area with an amazing beanstalk to climb! Kids really enjoyed the Water and air activities however, the store, ship, construction, farm displays allowed them to perform tasks to enhance",
          "A great place to take the kiddos, there is so many hands on activities my daughter and I love to go here! If you go before 11 on a weekday, you almost have the place to yourself!",

          "We stayed in Providence for 2 nights. My daughter was just a couple days shy of her 2nd birthday and the hotel recepton told us about this place and she loved it. So much to do and even we had fun with her and we just loved the wee park upstairs even thought I was nervous",
          "I took my two kids, ages 2 and 6, during April vacation. There was an animal experience that day. My son loved it, he smiled so much during the presentation and then being able to hold the animals, he had a great time. Frogs, alligator, hedgehog, and snakes. The regular exhibits",
          "There are tons of interactive exhibits for kids to play with. It's definitely geared towards younger children. Great spot to create fun childhood memories!",
          "Spent a lovely afternoon at this museum with my little niece. Lots of interesting things to do and see. Fun and educational. There is a small parking lot as well as metered street parking.",
          "We have been fortunate enough to visit this museum several times with our young daughter, and she has loved every visit and gotten something different out of it each time. The curators have almost endless hands-on exhibits, which is exactly what any good children's museum is",
          "We went on a super cold Saturday afternoon, arriving around 1PM and stayed for about 2 hours. Our 15-month-old twins were overwhelmed, as the place seemed totally overrun with out-of-control children. There was a lot to do, but too many children to truly enjoy anything. The",
          "This place must be toddler heaven and grandparent hell. 'Just kidding about the Hades reference. For some granddads, this is a fun place to let your little one cut loose and have a blast. Yes, and for others...yours truly is no exception...it's call for a good stiff drink.",
          "Great museum for toddlers and young kids. Clean, safe and very interactive! Well done! We spent about 2 hours here with our three year old and she loved it!",
          "Off the beaten path visit on a road trip, and had a bogo- so why not. Small museum, but spent a couple hours in each hands on exhibit. My then 4 year old son loved all the activities. Probably an awesome place for a rainy or hot day.",
          "One of the best places to take kids on a rainy day. And there's an outdoor play area on sunny days. Lots of interactive exhibits. And, seriously, kids can play for hours in the water room building things. It can get crowded, especially during school vacation weeks and holidays",
          "We took our 21 month old granson here and he loved it. He kept moving and walking and was so excited. If you go, I would suggest you start on the upper floor and work your way down. The highlight for our granson was the water exhibits. Staff was wonderful throughout.in the water",
          "This museum is nice but it's rather small, kids did have fun but after about 2 hours was not much left to see or do. Facilities are nice and staff very helpful, just wish it would have been bigger with more exhibits.",
          "This is a fantastic interactive museum for young children. Our two year old grandson enjoyed the hands on play and learning. Many of the exhibits were themed for the time of year, others were more standard, all were educational. Staff were friendly and non-obtrusive.",
          "I thought there were be more to it! My grand daughter who is 6 was bored and only wanted to go outside and my grandson who is one and half really has no interest. And like most family places....it could be more reasonable.",
          "Hands on activities for all ages. We spent 3 hours and still didn't get to play and interact with everything! For small children it can be a bit overwhelming, I recommend leading them through one area at a time and pacing yourselves. We went on a Sunday which seemed perfect as",
          "Having a 5 year old I have been to 4 other Children's Museums; Dover NH, Portland ME, Boston MA, and Washington DC. The Providence Children's Museum packs a lot into a relatively small space. We loved the upper level with the variety of themed areas that you could actually go",
          "We have been to many children's museums , but all our expectations were exceeded! We took our four grandchildren ages 18 months to nine years. My older grandson loves the electric circuit room and they all loved the water play. Even the youngest could participate . They also",
          "We drove 11/2 hours to spend the day with our 3 grandchildren here and it was OUTSTANDING. It is creative, well organized and fun. It even has a small outdoor area. They have a water room with all kinds of activities that left the kids soaked but happy. Two negatives- teeny",
          "My two year and her four year old cousin had a blast here, on a rainy summer afternoon. We pack lunches and spent the whole day. The biggest challenge was getting them to leave.",
          "When my children were little, I had a yearly membership to the museum. The activities are hands on, fun and educational. They also have a lot of special performances by local artists, storytellers, puppeteers, etc. It is well worth the price of a membership.",
          "Great place to play and explore with your children. Water games, crafts and role play to name a few.",
          "My two year old loves coming to the children's museum. The water room is large with long tables to play at. The imagination/play area upstairs is also a lot of fun. It is small enough not to feel overwhelmed but large enough that there are a variety of activities for kids.",
          "A great day to spend with the grandchildren. They were actively engaged. There was much for them to do. A great visit anytime.",
          "Its a smaller museum but did its job. My kids were happy with it especially with the water part and the outdoor activities.",
          "My husband was attending a school at the military base in Newport for a few weeks, and I took the train up to meet him with our three boys who were 5, 2, and two months (I know, I'm insane). He had to work one morning, and we spent it at the Providence Children's Museum. It",
          "My husband and I took our 4 and 7 year old here while in town. It was a great place for the kids to enjoy playing for an afternoon. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that parking was free:). I think my kids favorite part was the water area. There was plenty of room for",
          "We went with a 17 month old and an 18 month old. I couldn't envision anything better for them. From the water tables to the ship to the \"little woods\" area, our kids were kept busy and loved it! They have done a great job here, especially for kids under age 5. I am so grateful",
          "What a fun place to take children or grandchildren to. Lots if activities for all ages. The water room was great. My husband and I enjoyed the build it feature where one was the talker and the other the listener. Very funny to do.",
          "In today's age children are glued to their ipad. If you can tare them away this is fun for little ones. Love the giant doll along with activities. I liked it better when it was in Pawtucket. Times change so I would say it depends on you child as to wether they would like it.",
          "We went with a 2 year old who was fascinated with the \"water room\"! The multitude of things for all ages in there is impressive. Activities to do with your child or to let the child explore on there own. Sweet day.",
          "Great strip of stores and restaurants. Check out Andreas if you like Greek food and the Avon cinema is old and charming",
          "Good place for kids as there is plenty of things to do and it's two floors. There's an outside area, water area, building area and some other exhibits. It's $9 a person and children but babies under 12 months are free. I felt the admission for kids is sort of expensive as it's",
          "Great \"hands on\" place to go with your children. I'd say, probably best for ages 3-9. Very thing is interactive. Fills a good part of the afternoon!",
          "We went with two young children - both had a really great time! There are lots of activities for various ages. Best part - it was way less crowded than going into Boston. Our favorite was the water room. They provide smocks - but you may want to bring extra shirts or save this",
          "We took our 18 month old grand daughter twice in one week. The place has been improved 10 times over since they moved from Pawtucket. Plenty of parking and something for every age group.",
          "My husband and I came here with our 2 year old daughter. We were spending the weekend in the city and wanted an indoor activity to keep us all occupied and the Children\u2019s museum didn\u2019t disappoint. I have been to several other children\u2019s museums and this one was/is hands down",
          "This is an amazing museum! We enjoyed staying there with my 5 years old son and his friends. Every corner and room have great themes and creative spaces. Outside is great too! I highly recommend this museum!",
          "This museum is best for children 5 and under. My older children 5 and 7 at time did enjoy it but a lot was meant for toddler/preschool. So we were out of there in an hour.",
          "We were in town for a conference. While my husband was speaking, I took my two boys and we had a blast. The water room was by far the biggest attraction - we started and ended there. The vacuum tubes, engineering/construction area, and outside climbing area were also popular. I",
          "Great size for little ones...not too overwhelming. Plenty to keep them interested! Lots of hands on and nicely set up. Grandkids loved it!",
          "There was a lot there for our son to play with but we thought it would be bigger and have more information . A lot of the things there were not labeled /didn't explain what the kids were supposed to learn by doing the activity . My son enjoyed playing but we were hoping",
          "Really great small children's museum. I think it is great for the 1-4 age range. We had our daughter's 2nd birthday here and it was really nicely done and managed.",
          "Providence Children's Museum is a fun and very hands on museum. Our grandchildren loved it. Many many fun and educational activities and exhibits that utilize all the senses. Good educational family fun. And never overly crowded. Parking is convenient.",
          "Great place to go to with preschoolers/kindergarten age. A lot of learning, and hands on activities. This is where you can learn that children learned to read using \"Our Father\" prayer in those days.",
          "Great on a rainy or winter day if you have kids under 10 yrs to entertain. We have been here 2X and recommend it",
          "Our family tends to hit kids museums everywhere we travel. This one is nice and has a good variety of stuff, but I feel like it is definitely geared for the younger kids. A couple of hours was sufficient for my 7 and 9 year olds. It's not a huge museum, but it's got a great",
          "Many of the exhibits were multi lingual and very hands on. The kids, ages 5 and 8, had plenty to do. They ran all around from exhibit to exhibit. It was a bit small, but there is a lot packed in there. More Purell please !!",
          "Everything looked quite pedestrian to me and I was a little taken aback by the $9 price tag per person including adults but the children (6-9) had a great time.",
          "The children museum is quaity time to spend with youre children.since i learn about it i bring my kids and they have fun",
          "I have two kids, 8 and 5, and they both had fun! It has plenty of things to keep kids, young and old, interested. The outdoor play area was so nice!",
          "I have been to a few children's museum throughout the years and this is by far my favorite. It seemed to make the kid in all the adults want to play as well. It is well thought out and exceeds on the execution. I didn't see one unhappy face there. My children both loved it",
          "Went to visit the museum after reading great reviews with our 4 year old. He absolutely loved it. The parking lot was full at about 1pm on a party cloudy Sunday, but we waited for about 5 minutes and were able to get a spot. Free parking. The area surrounding the museum seems to",
          "You could come and stay forever. The water room alone can occupy many children for hours. In the good weather there is a great creative outdoor play area.",
          "Children can do everything on this mus\u00e9um, play with Walter, wind ... They CAN discover a lot of think about Rhode Island",
          "My 18 month old daughter had a great time here. She particularly enjoyed the water room. She loved the fountains, the whirl pools and the fog. The museum is small but there's a lot to do for young kids. My only gripe is that they don't have a changing station in each bathroom.",
          "Visited on a snowy day so my kids could run around. Its not very large, but there are a lot of hands on activities for the kids that are done very nice. The building is clean, well lit, and colorful. One of the stations broke while we were there and the staff were very quick",
          "My 4 year old had a lot of fun here, and didn't want to leave! The price was reasonable. The place isn't huge, but they section it off nicely. The play areas seemed clean enough, considering the amount of people the day we went. The bathroom was adequate. I saw staff actively",
          "We visited on a Sunday when it was Seuss day, and lots of birthday parties. The place was crowded, but not crazy. Our grandkids loved the water station and the boat they could climb on. We were worn out after 2 hours, but had a ton of fun. We will visit again.",
          "Great to have your kids run around not having to worry what happens next. A cool place to hang around, enjoy your parenthood and know you actively contribute to the well-being of your beloved. I miss the place",
          "Enjoyed the water room and the scarfs that blow up the tubes..... too much snow to enjoy outside, guess we'll wait for the spring.",
          "The perfect place to take young kids when the weather isn't permitting outside. My kids loved the water play room- bring some extra clothes in case they get wet!",
          "It is an excellent place to visit with kids and enjoy several hours over there. They offers activities that will challenge all ages kids imagination and thinking.",
          "We go there with our grandsons, age 8 and 4, and they are thoroughly entertained for hours. Staff is very pleasant and exhibits are a lot of fun.",
          "My 3 year old loved this museum. I loved it too. Much of the museum is broken up into little theme rooms. We were able to discuss different times in american history with the kids.",
          "Had the pleasure of coming for the first time for a birthday party. This place is great! Our 4 and almost 3 year olds had a blast. The skill stations, play areas, and silly stuff had the kids worn out after an hour and a half. They loved all of it. The outdoor area is really",
          "We were loitering around the brown university and then finally said lets go the kids museum. Best decision made. Got time to get the kids hungry and enjoy their journey",
          "I did look it up on the internet but did not see any warning that it would be closed so we were disappointed that we arrived at the Children's Museum on Monday to find it closed so we ended up at the Zoo and enjoyed it.",
          "Hi I believe this musem is a great place to come with the family and enjoy the day. This museum is very fun and educational at the same time. In the warm weather it has the out the play area. On some days you can get in for free I think is Fridays.",
          "As children's museums' go, this one is very nice. Always filled with interesting things to do, reasonable prices.",
          "My family comes here once in a while and they love the water room. My husband has a great time upstairs with our 7 year old and the woods play area is great for the baby which also have a seat where I can nurse my baby.",
          "The best Children's museum we have seen so far! It is very compact, yet has many various activities. All my kids ranging from 2 to 6 y.o. found something to do for 4 hour visit. Just beware: the museum does not serve food, and all cafeterias within walking distance close at 4,",
          "We brought our two and a half yr. old grandson here today. Will definately return! Could easily spend the entire day there. Lots of hands on learning and playing. Easy to find, right off Rt. 95, with free parking ( though limited...we got there when they first opened ). Bring a",
          "Great place for little ones, but my older kids 9-11 were getting awkward glances by other adults as if they had no business being there. My kids loved the Boston children's museum as well as the Cape Cod Children's Museum so I thought we'd try this one. Over run by babies and",

          "great place for kids to discover science,nature",
          "There were interesting facts about RI, but most children are young and are not reading. Was disappointed that they didn't have the Twister's game like Boston. My grandgirl at two thought it was a disco and enjoyed dancing.",
          "My nephew had the best time at the Providence children's museum. I decided to buy him a membership on the spot!",
          "My kids (1.5 and 3.5) loooove everything about this place! Easily hours of fun. Well laid out, friendly staff. The water room is a highlight, as is the outdoor climbing tower for my big kid.",

          "This place was awesome.  We're from Saint Louis and we have The Magic House which is similar but this blew it out of the park.  My daughter loves playing in water and is small for a two year old, so it's hard for her to play at The Magic \u2026",
          "Small, lacks variety in stations, water feature on first floor is ok, activity stations where children are supposed to draw and write don't have any paper or pencils, a bit disorganized.  Overall, you can go through the whole museum in 15 \u2026",

          "We have been to many Children's Museums, and I have to say the staff at Providence Children's Museum were by far the most engaged.  The started at entry with a \"She's going to love it\", to a meltdown eliminating sticker when it was time to \u2026",
          "Absolutely delightful! The water room was so much fun. The rooms to explore Providence's history were a lot of fun. The toddler area was a nice break. The staff weren't above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience in all the exhibits. We loved it!",

          "Pros: 1) Tons of creative, hands on play.\n2) Great for kids from toddler through Elementary school age.\nCons: 1) No lockers so bring a backpack for an easier way to carry items while there.\n2) Areas get very crowded and hard to maneuver around.",
          "We like this place so much, we've both the family membership. I would comment for those without a membership to keep an eye out for free Friday's. More than once I've seen this. I would also say that this children's museum more than others \u2026",

          "This is such a great fun educational place for kids. They get to have fun with pretend play and learn new things. I only wish parents would understand that it's not okay to bring your sick children here. We've been twice and have run into some many sick kids. 2 days later my kids have the flu.",

          "My toddler loved it. It's his favorite Children's Museum so far.  Wonderful variety of things to keep toddlers busy.",
          "I can't overstate what a great time my two-year-old son and I had at the museum. Wonderful exhibits and a great indoor play space for children's four years old and under. Be sure not to miss the really cool water play room on the first floor.",
          "It was pretty fun. It\u2019s a great place for little kids but it\u2019s tough for bigger kids. It is a bit outdated. They haven\u2019t changed to much since I had last visited 6 ish years ago and this year. To be fair they did update the water room, added a new room, and moved some stuff around. Overall it\u2019s a good little trip",

          "Well worth the price of membership.  My kids can spend endless hours here.",
          "It is a wonderful museum and they are constantly making changes, so it feels fresh.  Sadly, the museum ignores the 8+ demographic of children.  My 9year old and her friend were bored after an hour, because there just isnt much to do.  I do wish there was a section for older kids, just as they have Little Woods for small toddlers.",

          "Fantastic children's museum. My 2 year old had a BLAST. They have an awesome water table room and all activities are great from toddler through early elementary years. We can't wait to go back.",

          "A jewel in Providence!  Something fun is always happening at the Providence Children's Museum!  An amazing place to take your child or grandchild.",
          "It was a great place for kids ages 1 to 7, lots of fun activities. The water room and truck area were a big hit with my boys. If your child isn't walking yet I wouldn't recommend it. It was a little crazy because of school vacation so if \u2026",

          "Love, love, love",
          "We walked in and turned right back around.  Reminded us of a Chuck E Cheese or FunZone type of place.  Kids running all over while their parents are zombified by their cell phones.  Probably a lot of fun for some, but definitely not a learning environment.",

        "wiki": "The Federal Hill neighborhood has a salient role in the history of Providence due to its central location within the city. This part of Providence is best known for its Italian American community and abundance of Italian restaurants.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nFederal Hill is bounded by Westminster Street to the south, Route 6 and Route 10 to the west and north, and Interstate 95 to the east. The area borders Downtown to the east, Smith Hill and Valley to the north, Olneyville to the west, and the West End and South Providence to the south.\nAtwells Avenue is the cultural centerpiece of the neighborhood, with many famous restaurants densely clustered along it between Interstate 95 and Harris Avenue. It also contains a mix of other typical urban businesses such as sandwich and pizza shops, convenience stores, a hotel, and tattoo parlors. The gateway arch over Atwells Avenue near Downtown is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Providence. The La Pigna (or The Pine Cone) sculpture hanging from its center \u2014 a traditional Italian symbol of welcome, abundance, and quality \u2014 is often mistakenly referred to as \"The Pineapple\" and has become the symbol of Federal Hill. Other important streets in the neighborhood include Broadway, home to restaurants as well as professional, medical and legal offices, but also to the historic Columbus Theater now used for movies and live performances. Other than a commercial and warehouse section in the area of Dean and Washington Streets, most of the rest of the neighborhood is residential, often catering to college students. Johnson and Wales University maintains the Renaissance Hall dormitory on Federal Hill as well.\nMost cross streets in the historic neighborhood between Atwells Avenue and Broadway are one-way due to their narrowness. A few streets remain paved with cobblestone.\n\n\n=== DePasquale Plaza ===\n\nDePasquale Plaza, sometimes referred to as \"the heart of the neighborhood,\" is a popular spot for outdoor dining and people-watching. The plaza features a central grand fountain surrounded by restaurants and outdoor dining. In the summer of 2018 the plaza's \"famous\" fountain was in a state of partial disrepair, with only two levels flowing and the base filled with plants. In May 2019 the fountain was partially restored and working, despite restoration work having set back by an automobile collision only a month earlier.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFederal Hill received its name after a 1788 Fourth of July ox roast celebration on the plain adjacent to the hill. The organizers of the celebration intended to celebrate the ratification of the Federal Constitution by the 9 of the 13 states needed to create the United States. Because anti-federalist sentiment was strong in Rhode Island, General William West led 1,000 armed farmers to Providence to stop the celebration. Eventually, a compromise was reached and the celebrants agreed to celebrate Independence Day only and not the ratification of the Federal Constitution. The issue remained hotly controversial in Rhode Island for two more years until the state finally became the last of the original thirteen states to join the union.\nThe area of Federal Hill was originally called Nocabulabet, believed to be an anglicized version of either a Narragansett or Wampanoag phrase meaning \"land above the river\" or \"land between the ancient waters.\"Federal Hill's Atwells Avenue is named for Amos Maine Atwell, who led a syndicate of businessmen developing the western areas of the city in 1788. The area developed into a working class area during the early 19th century in part due to reverses in commercial shipping.In 1840, only the lower streets of the hill were occupied, and that mostly by Irish immigrants who worked in the nearby textile shops and foundries. Yet, by the early 1850s, the part of Atwells Avenue that we think of today as \"Little Italy\" was clustered with two and three story tenements that housed the large influx of those who fled the famine of 1845 to 1851. A third of these people came from the Barony of Truagh and surrounding townlands. This area, encompassing Northern County Monaghan and Southern County Tyrone, had for centuries been the fiefdom of the McKenna clan. Not incidentally, McKenna was, by far, the most common name on Federal Hill in the 1860s.\nThe 1870s saw the first arrival of immigrants from southern Italy, with greater numbers arriving in the next two decades. By 1895, the Hill was divided almost evenly between Irish and Italians. These were tension-filled times, as both groups fought for jobs and respect from the Yankee majority.\nMore can be read about the Irish period on the Hill at http://federalhillirish.com/.\nThe first two decades of the 20th century witnessed heavy Italian-American immigration into Federal Hill, making it the city's informal Little Italy. Though the area today is  more diverse, Federal Hill still retains its status as the traditional center for the city's Italian-American community. Providence's annual Columbus Day parade marches down Atwells Avenue.\nIn 1954, Raymond Loreda Salvatore Patriarca Sr, the newly appointed boss of the New England Faction of La Cosa Nostra (Now known as the Patriarca Crime Family), made drastic changes to the family, the biggest being moving the family's base of operations from Boston to Atwells Ave in Federal Hill. He ran the crime family from 1954 until 1984 from the National Cigarette Service Company and Coin-O-Matic Distributors, a vending machine and pinball business on Atwells Avenue. The business was known to family members as \"The Office.\"\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2000 census, the racial makeup of the 02903 zip code, in which Federal Hill is located, was 65.8% White, 12.4% Black or African American, 7.2% Asian, 0.7% American Indian, and 8.4% from other races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 15.2% of the population.\nAccording to the Providence Plan, a local nonprofit aimed at improving city life, 47% of residents are white, 32.1% Hispanic, and 14.8% are African-American. These are all slightly above the citywide averages. Nearly 50% of public school children speak a language other than English as their primary language.The median family income is $27,288, below the citywide average of $32,058. 28% of families live below the poverty line with 10% of residents receiving some form of public assistance.One in four children has been exposed to unsafe levels of lead.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nNearly all of Federal Hill is within Ward 13, which is represented in the Providence City Council by Democrat Bryan Principe. A small portion of Federal Hill is in Ward 15, represented by Democrat Josephine DiRuzzo.The Providence Public Safety Complex is located on Federal Hill at 325 Washington Street. The complex is the headquarters of the Providence Police Department, the Providence Fire Department and the city's municipal courts. The building was dedicated in 2002 by former Mayor Vincent Cianci Jr. The courts and particularly Judge Frank Caprio have been made famous locally by the television show Caught in Providence, which documents the proceedings of the municipal court.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nFederal Hill includes three green spaces along Atwells Avenue:\n\nGaribaldi Square is a half-acre square featuring a monumental bust of Giuseppe Garibaldi.\nDePasquale Plaza is a plaza used for outdoor dining.\nJohn's Park is a small park at the former location of St John's Church.Another large green space is Franciscan Park, a two and a half acre park, located off Broadway near Route 6.Also, the Spruce Street Bocce Courts on the northwest corner of Spruce and Dean streets has benches and two lighted bocce courts and serves as the home of several local bocce leagues, the largest being the popular Nocabulabet Bocce League which hosts games on Wednesday nights during its spring and fall seasons.\n\n\n== Culinary reputation ==\nFederal Hill is often characterized by its culinary reputation. Atwells Avenue has over twenty restaurants within a quarter mile section, such as Angelo's Civita Farnese.  The area's proximity to Johnson and Wales University has allowed Providence to attract and retain skilled chefs, many of whom work in the many restaurants on Atwells Avenue.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nFederal Hill plays a central role in the story \"The Haunter of the Dark\" by Providence-born writer H.P. Lovecraft. It is the site of a church which in the story was used by a sect called the Church of Starry Wisdom for their services, and houses the Shining Trapezohedron and the 'Haunter' itself - a creature summoned from time and space and said to be an avatar of Nyarlathotep. The church that figures prominently in the story was based on St. John's Church, an actual church on Atwells Avenue that was built in 1873 and demolished in 1992. It was, in Lovecraft's day, the principal Catholic church in the area. The description of the interior and belfry of the church is quite accurate.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nProvidence at Curlie\nFederal Hill, Providence Commerce Association",

        "wiki": "Providence is the capital and most populous city of the state of Rhode Island and is one of the oldest cities in the United States. It was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams, a Reformed Baptist theologian and religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He named the area in honor of \"God's merciful Providence\" which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers. The city is situated at the mouth of the Providence River at the head of Narragansett Bay.\nProvidence was one of the first cities in the country to industrialize and became noted for its textile manufacturing and subsequent machine tool, jewelry, and silverware industries. Today, the city of Providence is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning which have shifted the city's economy into service industries, though it still retains some manufacturing activity.\nThe city is the third-most-populous city in New England after Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nProvidence was settled in June 1636 by Roger Williams and grew into one of the original Thirteen Colonies. Williams was compelled to leave Massachusetts Bay Colony due to his differing religious views, and he and others established Providence Plantations. This settlement merged with others to become the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and it was a refuge for persecuted religious dissenters from the beginning.Providence Plantations was burned to the ground in March 1676 by the Narragansetts during King Philip's War, despite the good relations between Williams and the sachems with whom the United Colonies of New England were waging war. Later in the year, the Rhode Island legislature formally rebuked the other colonies for provoking the war.Providence residents were among the first Patriots to spill blood in the lead-up to the American Revolutionary War during the Gaspee Affair of 1772, and Rhode Island was the first of the Thirteen Colonies to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown on May 4, 1776. It was also the last of the Thirteen States to ratify the United States Constitution on May 29, 1790, once assurances were made that a Bill of Rights would become part of the Constitution.Following the war, Providence was the country's ninth-largest city  with 7,614 people. The economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, in particular machinery, tools, silverware, jewelry, and textiles. By the start of the 20th century, Providence hosted some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country, including Brown & Sharpe, Nicholson File, and Gorham Manufacturing Company.\n\nProvidence residents ratified a city charter in 1831 as the population passed 17,000. The seat of city government was located in the Market House in Market Square from 1832 to 1878, which was the geographic and social center of the city. The city offices outgrew this building, and the City Council resolved to create a permanent municipal building in 1845.  The city offices moved into the Providence City Hall in 1878.\n\nLocal politics split over slavery during the American Civil War, as many had ties to Southern cotton and the slave trade. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, the number of military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union. Providence thrived after the war, and waves of immigrants brought the population from 54,595 in 1865 to 175,597 by 1900.By the early 1900s, Providence was one of the wealthiest cities in the United States. Immigrant labor powered one of the nation's largest industrial manufacturing centers. Providence was a major manufacturer of industrial products, from steam engines to precision tools to silverware, screws, and textiles. Giant companies were based in or near Providence, such as Brown & Sharpe, the Corliss Steam Engine Company, Babcock & Wilcox, the Grinnell Corporation, the Gorham Manufacturing Company, Nicholson File, and the Fruit of the Loom textile company.From 1975 until 1982, $606 million of local and national community development funds were invested throughout the city. In the 1990s, the city pushed for revitalization, realigning the north-south railroad tracks, removing the huge rail viaduct that separated downtown from the capitol building, uncovering and moving the rivers (which had been covered by paved bridges) to create Waterplace Park and river walks along the rivers' banks, and constructing the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Alex and Ani City Center) and the Providence Place Mall.Despite new investment, poverty remains an entrenched problem. Approximately 27.9 percent of the city population is living below the poverty line. Recent increases in real estate values further exacerbate problems for those at marginal income levels, as Providence had the highest rise in median housing price of any city in the United States from 2004 to 2005.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Providence city limits enclose a small geographical region with a total area of 20.5 square miles (53 km2); 18.5 square miles (48 km2) of it is land and the remaining 2.1 square miles (5.4 km2) is water (roughly 10%). Providence is located at the head of Narragansett Bay, with the Providence River running into the bay through the center of the city, formed by the confluence of the Moshassuck and Woonasquatucket Rivers. The Waterplace Park amphitheater and riverwalks line the river's banks through downtown.\nProvidence is one of many cities claimed to be founded on seven hills like Rome. The more prominent hills are: Constitution Hill (near downtown), College Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and containing New England's largest Italian district outside of Massachusetts). The other four are: Tockwotten Hill at Fox Point, Smith Hill (where the State House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston and Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill at the lower end of Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early 1880s.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nProvidence has 25 official neighborhoods, though these neighborhoods are often grouped together and referred to collectively:\nThe East Side is a region comprising the neighborhoods of Blackstone, Hope (aka Summit), Mount Hope, College Hill, Wayland, and Fox Point.\nThe Jewelry District describes the area enclosed by I-95, the old I-195, and the Providence River. The city has made efforts to rename this area the Knowledge District to reflect the area's newly developing life sciences and technology-based economy.\nThe North End is formed by the concatenation of the neighborhoods of Charles, Wanskuck, Smith Hill, Elmhurst, and Mount Pleasant.\nThe South Side (or South Providence) consists of the neighborhoods of Elmwood, Lower South Providence, Upper South Providence, Washington Park, and the West End.\nWest Broadway is an officially recognized neighborhood with its own association. It overlaps with the southern half of Federal Hill and the northern part of the West End.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city of Providence is geographically very compact, characteristic of eastern seaboard cities that developed prior to use of the automobile. It is among the most densely populated cities in the country. For this reason, Providence has the eighth-highest percentage of pedestrian commuters. The street layout is irregular; more than one thousand streets (a great number for the city's size) run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places such as Market Square.Downtown Providence has numerous 19th-century mercantile buildings in the Federal and Victorian architectural styles, as well as several post-modern and modernist buildings located throughout the area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development. West Exchange Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two.\nThe newer area, sometimes called \"Capitol Center\", includes Providence Place Mall (1999), the Omni Providence Hotel (1993) and The Residences Providence (2007), GTECH Corporation (2006), Waterplace Towers condominiums (2007), and Waterplace Park (1994). The area tends toward newer development, since much of it is land reclaimed in the 1970s from a mass of railroad tracks referred to colloquially as the \"Chinese Wall\". This part of Downtown is characterized by open spaces, wide roads, and landscaping.\nThe historic part of downtown has many streetscapes that look as they did 80 years ago. Many of the state's tallest buildings are found here. The largest structure at 426 feet (130 m) is the art deco-styled Industrial National Bank Building (formerly Industrial Trust Tower). By contrast, nearby to it is the second tallest One Financial Plaza, designed in modern taut-skin cladding, constructed a half-century later. In between the two is 50 Kennedy Plaza. The Textron Tower is also a core building to the modest Providence skyline. Downtown is also the home of the Providence Biltmore and Westminster Arcade, the oldest enclosed shopping mall in the U.S., built in 1828.The city's southern waterfront, away from the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Russian Submarine Museum was located here until 2008, when the submarine sank in a storm and was declared a loss. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found here, built to protect Providence from storm surge like that which it endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol.The majority of the cityscape comprises abandoned and revitalized industrial mills, double- and triple-decker housing (though row houses are rare, found so commonly in other Northeast cities), a small number of high-rise buildings (predominantly for housing the elderly), and single family homes. Interstate 95 serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods such as Federal Hill and the West End.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nProvidence has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa) bordering a humid subtropical climate with hot summers, cold winters, and high humidity year-round. The USDA places the city in hardiness zone 6b, with the suburbs in zones 6a \u2013 7b. The influence of the Atlantic Ocean keeps the state of Rhode Island warmer than many inland locales in New England. January is the coldest month with a daily mean of 29.2 \u00b0F (\u22121.6 \u00b0C) and low temperatures dropping to 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) or lower an average of 11 days per winter, while July is the warmest month with a daily mean of 73.5 \u00b0F (23.1 \u00b0C) and highs rising to 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) or higher an average of 10 days per summer. Extremes range from \u221217 \u00b0F or \u221227.2 \u00b0C on February 9, 1934 to 104 \u00b0F or 40 \u00b0C on August 2, 1975; the record cold daily maximum is 1 \u00b0F (\u221217.2 \u00b0C) on February 5, 1918, while the record warm daily minimum is 80 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C) on June 6, 1925. Temperature readings of 0 \u00b0F or \u221217.8 \u00b0C or lower are uncommon in Providence and generally occur once every several years. The year which had the most days with a temperature reading of zero degrees or lower was 2015 with eight days total\u2014one day in January and seven days in February. Conversely, temperature readings of 100 \u00b0F or 37.8 \u00b0C or higher are even rarer, and the year with the most days in this category was 1944 with three days, all of which were in August.Monthly precipitation in Providence ranges from a high of 4.43 inches (112.5 mm) in March to a low of 3.17 inches (80.5 mm) in July. In general, precipitation levels are slightly less in the summer months than the winter months, when Nor'easters can cause significant snowfall and blizzard conditions. Hurricanes are not frequent in coastal New England, although Providence's location at the head of Narragansett Bay makes it vulnerable to them.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2000, the population consisted of 173,618 people, 162,389 households, and 35,859 families. The population density was 9,401.7 inhabitants per square mile (3,629.4/km\u00b2), characteristic of other small cities in New England such as New Haven, Connecticut; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut.  Its population peaked in the 1940s, just prior to the nationwide period of rapid suburbanization.\nProvidence has a racially and ethnically diverse population. In 2010, white Americans formed 49.8% of the population, including a sizable white Hispanic community. Non-Hispanic whites were 37.6% of the total population, down from 89.5% in 1970. Providence has had a substantial Italian population since the start of the 20th century, with 14% of the population claiming Italian ancestry. Italian influence manifests itself in Providence's Little Italy in Federal Hill.  Irish immigrants have also had considerable influence on the city's history, with 8% of residents claiming Irish heritage. The city also has a sizeable Jewish community, estimated at 10,500 in 2012 or roughly 5% of the city's population.\n\nIn 2010, people of Hispanic or Latino origin composed 38.1% of the city's population and currently form a majority of city public school students. The majority of Hispanics in Providence are of Dominican descent, having one of the largest Dominican populations in the United States. Other Hispanic groups present in large numbers are Puerto Ricans and Guatemalans. Hispanics are most concentrated in the neighborhoods of Elmwood, the West End, and Upper and Lower South Providence.  The city elected its first Hispanic mayor in 2010, Dominican-American Angel Taveras.\nAfrican Americans constitute 16% of the city's population, with their greatest concentrations found in Mount Hope and the Upper and Lower South Providence neighborhoods. Asians are 6% of Providence's population and have enclaves scattered throughout the city. The largest Asian groups are Cambodians (1.7%), Chinese (1.1%), Asian Indians (0.7%), Laotians (0.6%), and Koreans (0.6%). Another 6% of the city has multiracial ancestry. American Indians and Pacific Islanders make up the remaining 1.3%. Liberians compose 0.4% of the population; the city is home to one of the largest Liberian immigrant populations in the country.Providence has a considerable community of immigrants from various Portuguese-speaking countries, especially Portugal, Brazil, and Cape Verde, living mostly in the areas of Washington Park and Fox Point. Portuguese is the city's third-largest European ethnicity, after Italian and Irish, at 4% of the population; Cape Verdeans compose 2%.The Providence metropolitan area includes Providence, Fall River, Massachusetts, and Warwick, and is estimated to have a population of 1,622,520. In 2006, this area was officially added to the Boston Combined Statistical Area (CSA), the sixth-largest CSA in the country. In the last 15 years, Providence has experienced a sizable growth in its under-18 population. The median age of the city is 28 years, while the largest age cohort is 20- to 24-year-olds, owing to the city's large student population.The per capita income as of the 2000 census was $15,525, which is well below both the state average of $29,113 and the national average of $21,587.  The median income for a household was $26,867, and the median income for a family in Providence was $32,058, according to the 2000 census. The city has one of the highest rates of poverty in the nation with 29.1% of the population and 23.9% of families living below the poverty line in 2000, the largest concentrations being found in the city's Olneyville, and Upper and Lower South Providence areas. Poverty has affected children at a disproportionately higher rate, with 40.1% of those under the age of 18 living below the poverty line, concentrated west of downtown in the neighborhoods of Hartford, Federal Hill, and Olneyville.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nCompared to the national average, Providence has an average rate of violent crime and a higher rate of property crime per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2010, there were 15 murders, down from 24 in 2009. In 2010, Providence fared better regarding violent crime than most of its peer cities. Springfield, Massachusetts has approximately 20,000 fewer residents than Providence but reported 15 murders in 2009, the same number of homicides as Providence but a slightly higher rate per capita.  The police chief asserted that Providence's violence was not stranger-to-stranger, but relationship-driven.  The pattern of violent crime was highly specific by neighborhood, with the vast majority of the murders taking place in the poorer sections of Providence such as Olneyville, Elmwood, South Providence, and the West End.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAround 1830, Providence had manufacturing industries in metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Manufacturing has declined since, but the city is still one of the largest centers for jewelry and silverware design and manufacturing. Services also make up a large portion of the city's economy, in particular education, healthcare, and finance. Providence also is the site of a sectional center facility (SCF), a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service. It is the capital of Rhode Island, so the city's economy additionally consists of government services.\n\nProminent companies headquartered in Providence include Fortune 500 Textron, an advanced technologies industrial conglomerate; United Natural Foods, a distributor of natural and organic foods; Fortune 1000 Nortek Incorporated; Gilbane, a construction and real estate company; and GTECH Corporation, which recently moved its world headquarters to downtown Providence. Citizens Bank is also headquartered in Providence and is the 15th largest bank in the country.The city is home to the Rhode Island Convention Center, which opened in December 1993. Along with a hotel, the convention center is connected to the Providence Place Mall, a major retail center, through a skywalk. The Port of Providence is the second largest deep-water seaport in New England. It handles cargos such as cement, chemicals, heavy machinery, petroleum, and scrap metal. Providence is also home to some of toy manufacturer Hasbro's business operations, although their headquarters are in Pawtucket.\n\n\n=== Top employers ===\nAccording to the City's 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top twenty employers in the city are:\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the state capital, Providence houses the Rhode Island General Assembly, as well as the offices of the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor in the Rhode Island State House.

The city is also home to the Roger Williams Medical Center, St. Joseph Hospital For Specialty Care (a division of St. Joseph Health Services Of Rhode Island), The Miriam Hospital, a major teaching affiliate associated with the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, as well as a VA medical center.\nThe Rhode Island Blood Center has its main headquarters in Providence. Since 1979, the Rhode Island Blood Center has been the sole organization in charge of blood collection and testing and distribution of blood products to 11 hospitals in Rhode Island.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nProvidence is served by T. F. Green Airport in Warwick, and general aviation fields also serve the region. Massport has been promoting T. F. Green as an alternative to Boston's Logan International Airport because of over-crowding. Providence Station is located between the Rhode Island State House and the downtown district and is served by Amtrak and MBTA Commuter Rail services, with a commuter rail route running north to Boston and south to T.F. Green Airport and Wickford Junction. Approximately 2,400 passengers pass through the station per day.I-95 runs from north to south through Providence; I-195 connects the city to eastern Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, including New Bedford, Massachusetts and Cape Cod. I-295 encircles Providence, while RI 146 provides a direct connection with Worcester, Massachusetts. The city began the long-term project Iway in 2007 to move I-195 for safety reasons, to free up land, and to reunify the Jewelry District with downtown Providence, which had been separated by the highway. The project was estimated to cost $610 million. \n\n\n==== Bus ====\nKennedy Plaza in downtown Providence serves as a transportation hub for local public transit as well as a departure point for Peter Pan Bus Lines and Greyhound Lines. Public transit is managed by Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA). Through RIPTA alone, Kennedy Plaza serves more than 71,000 people a day. The majority of the area covered by RIPTA is served by traditional buses, but RIPTA also runs a \"Rapid Bus\", the R-Line which connects the suburbs of Pawtucket and Cranston with downtown Providence.  Of particular note is the East Side Trolley Tunnel running under College Hill, whose use is reserved for RIPTA buses. RIPTA also operates the Providence LINK, a system of tourist trolleys in downtown Providence. From 2000 to 2008, RIPTA operated a seasonal ferry to Newport, Rhode Island between May and October, but SeaStreak began operating that ferry route in 2016.  In 2018, RIPTA began construction of the \"Downtown Transit Connector\", an upgraded BRT service to run from Providence Station to the Hospital District.\n\n\n==== Walking and bicycling ====\nThe city serves as the end point for four of the state's major traffic-free bicycle paths: the East Bay Bike Path, Washington Secondary Rail Trail, the Woonasquatuck Greenway Bike Path, and the Blackstone River Greenway. There are several dedicated on-road bicycle lanes within the city.In 2017, the city signed a $400,000 contract with a private Silicon Valley company to introduce Providence's first bicycle sharing program, supported by local hospitals and RIPTA. Shortly after the program started in September 2018, the bicycles became associated with a \"wave of vandalism and criminal activity\" including widespread thefts of bicycles, bikes tossed into the Providence river, and even a company tech held at gunpoint. The company suspended the program in August 2019.In August 2019, a pedestrian bridge opened, spanning the Providence River and connecting the east and west sides of downtown. It was built on the granite piers of the old Route 195 bridge.In January 2020, mayor Jorge Elorza unveiled a \"Great Streets\" initiative to create a framework of public space improvements to encourage walking, riding bicycles, and public transit. The plan includes establishing an \"Urban Trail Network\" which includes 60 miles of bicycle paths, bike lanes, and greenways within Providence.\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\nElectricity and natural gas are provided by National Grid. Providence Water is responsible for the distribution of drinking water, ninety percent of which comes from the Scituate Reservoir about ten miles (16 km) west of downtown, with contributions coming from four smaller bodies of water. Drinking water in Providence has been rated among the highest quality in the country.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nAs of 2016, Providence had five sister cities: \n Praia (1994)\n Florence (2002)\n Santo Domingo (2004)\n Zhuhai (2015)\n Guatemala City (2016)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of people from Providence, Rhode Island\nList of tallest buildings in Providence\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Providence, Rhode Island\nNeighborhoods in Providence\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"EDC Profile City of Providence\".

          "We simply loved it. The ambience has to be experienced to understand. My wife is an avid reader and could have stayed there all day ... the names on the shelves are amazing. For me, I enjoyed sitting and reading the paper. There was no effective aircon, so best to visit on a",

          "We enjoyed the Athenaeum, but it was rather hot on the day we visited and they were not cooling down the building very much. Otherwise, we would have stayed longer. There were several visitors who were in the lower level of the building due to the heat. We're certainly glad that",
          "I went to a Children's Film Festival there. It was a lot of fun-checking out film shorts & reviewing them on paper & discussing them.They have many events there-some are free & some are not. I get Emails to keep up with the Happenings/Events. Definitely worth a visit. They have",

          "What a beautiful library! This was my favorite part of my trip to Providence. Not only is it picturesque on the inside, but there is a wonderful variety of unusual books there that I could have spent hours looking through. Of course it is a library, not a tourist destination,",

          "When I walked in the door, I imagined that I was in the 1800s when the library was founded. I spent two hours wandering around, perusing the books, listening to the creaky floors, exploring the dark corners filled with books I had never imagine existed. Wonderful place to",

          "This place has history oozing out of its walls. There are little nooks where you can sit, surrounded by books and read or just enjoy the atmosphere and think (or daydream). The lower level is more like a lounge -lovely leather seats and lighting you can adjust as you like. One",
          "I had never wondered what people did before there were public libraries. This is a subscription library with a very extensive collection of books, including a children's area. It is very historic and is still operating. It is worth stopping by for a quick look.",
          "I happened on to this beautiful place, privately funded, and, a tribute to libraries and their collections anywhere! The building is beautiful, the selection of books, reference materials, and, periodicals, is vast! The atmosphere old- worldy, and, very nice. If you love",

          "This is a beautiful, historical & small library, created by people of culture! It is restful and inviting place to read, rest, look at books. The inside was so thoughtfully constructed, it must have been a place of pride for the founders back in the day. Lovely place to",

          "This was the best! Of course I am a retired librarian, so I may be biased. Great Edgar Allen Poe exhibit. And the card catalogs with hand written cards were fascinating... Cozy seating downstairs. Much better than the John Hay library in the same area...",

          "The children's space is wonderful and separate from the rest of the library so you are not as worried about your children disturbing other patrons. Staff is wonderful and I love the playroom with blocks, art supplies and other fun stuff. My 4 year old loves it here and so do",
          "This is a library as libraries should be, with rows of old and new books and periodicals, knowledgeable librarians, and nooks where you can curl up and read. The Friday afternoon Salons are a signature Providence event. It's member-supported but open to the public (though only",
          "We came to explore the downtown area and stopped at this library for a brief visit. The building was completed in 1838. The interior is unique and full of character. Even though it takes a short amount of time to walk through the library, I enjoyed the beautiful architecture,",

          "How wonderful to be where Poe and Lovecraft read. Beautifully and carefully preserved historic library. You really get a sense of earlier centuries. The library has busts of litereary notables - its most recent is one of H.P. Lovecraft handsomely rendered in bronze. A stop here",
          "We loved it. I love books and it was neat to think that Edgar Allen Poe was there at one time. The staff talked to each other the whole time and were not helpful but it did not take away from my experience",
          "The sense of this being a repository of knowledge is overwhelming as you walk in, with books on every side stored on high shelves as they probably have been since this institution's founding in 1838. This place also has a role in literary history beyond its storing its artifacts",
          "This is why people love libraries. The staff is especially helpful and friendly. There's a raven self-tour to honor Edgar Allen Poe. There's a quiet reading room where you can sit in an easy chair and read magazines. they have a book sale and free paperbacks. The skylights,",

          "The Athenaeum, a handsom grey stone building in severe Greek revival style facing the state court house, is the oldest private library in the United States, and visitors can read books but not take them out. They have wonderful programs for children of various ages, and it's a",
          "I absolutely adored this library. The Providence Athenaeum was built in 1836 and is the fourth oldest library in the country! The history is apparent in the layout of the library, the old volumes lining the shelves, and the handwritten card catalog. If you have an appreciation",
          "Disappointing to see it was closed. Sign said it is closed from August 6 - 19, 2012. I wish I knew before coming.",

          "Lots of history, charm, quiet. For those looking for an alternative to the business or collegiate party scenes, here it is. Spend a peaceful hour stepping back in time at this intimate old library. A favorite spot to bring friends who've never been to Providence, providing they",
          "Before free libraries were in existence, libraries were supported by patrons and this library is a perfect example those type of libraries. Small, initimate and very quiet, it is a perfect place to visit and just read a good book. Enjoy a trip back in time as they have a card",
          "A must see if you are in the area. I found it romantic and very charming",

          "it's an old and small building, but it has an \"antique\" feeling",
          "My only regret is that I did not know about this Library sooner. It is more than a library, actually, it has little nooks and alcoves where you can get lost in whatever reading material suits you. It also has a downstairs sitting area with the daily papers and coffee (for a",

        "wiki": "The Roger Williams National Memorial is a landscaped urban park located on a common lot of the original settlement of Providence, Rhode Island, established by Roger Williams in 1636, bounded by North Main, Canal, and Smith Streets, and Park Row. The memorial commemorates the life of the co-founder of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations and a champion of the ideal of religious freedom. Williams was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his beliefs, and he founded this colony as a place where all could come to worship as their conscience dictated without interference from the state. This park is the 20th smallest National Park System unit in the nation.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Roger Williams National Memorial is a 4.5-acre (1.8 ha) park located near the eastern bank of the Moshassuck River, east of the Rhode Island State House and north of downtown Providence. It stands at the base of College Hill, a National Historic Landmark District that is the city's oldest and most historically significant area. It is separated from the river by Canal Street, and bounded on the other three sides by Smith Street, Park Row, and North Main Street. The southern portion of the park has a relatively open grassy area ringed by trees, while the northern portion is more landscaped, with the visitor center housed in the early 18th century Antram-Gray House  at the northeast corner, and a parking area on the west side. Major features in the northern section include the Bernon Grove and the site of the spring which prompted Williams to select the site.The park's visitor center features an exhibit and video about Roger Williams and the founding of Rhode Island, as well as information about historic sites in Providence.  \n\n\n== Administrative history ==\n\nThe national memorial was authorized on October 22, 1965. The memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The site was developed in the late 1970s after land acquisition was completed and the buildings on the land were demolished.  It was the only unit of the National Park System in Rhode Island until 2014 when the Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park was designated as a National Park Service unit. (Touro Synagogue National Historic Site in Newport is an affiliated area of the National Park Service, but not formally part of the system.)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of National Memorials of the United States\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Providence, Rhode Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial National Park Service website: Roger Williams National Memorial",

          "A very nice green space in the middle of Providence. A fitting tribute to Roger Williams and his efforts to establish a civil existence in the New World. Small and beautiful!",
          "This could easily be the smallest national park in the US. It is about two blocks long. The main attraction, the Roger Williams water source was fenced off. The visitor's center has helpful park rqngers and five minute video.",
          "It was nice to talk to the officer in the visitor center. She was very well informed and personable. Liked the white board comments too.",
          "Free parking, small visitor's center. My son printed the Junior Ranger booklet from the website at home so he had most of it filled out before we got here. We watched a 5 minute video about Roger Williams, who seems to have had such modern ideas for his time. We spent about 15",
          "A nice spot in downtown Providence. With that being said there is not much to see here, but if you\u2019d like a quick stroll it\u2019s a nice spot for it.",

          "5 acres of nice park, a spring, some crops and a cool visitor center. Roger Williams is every where in this town and for good reason; he founded it and secured the charter to become an official colony with a condition for no state mandated religion (first of its kind). I enjoyed",
          "My daughter and I were in the area for a wedding. She enjoys getting NPS Passport book stampes and earning Junior Ranger badges, so we made a point to visit. It is definitely worth your time. We'd never heard of Roger Williams, and feel it is sad that we didn't, as he was an",
          "The Memorial & history of Roger Williams is very interesting. The surrounding park is lovely but my favorite thing was the wonderful views of Providence. The park is in the Brown University area and certainly worth the stop.",
          "One of the smallest national memorials, but the staff is most expert and uniquely suited to interpreting the founding of Rhode Island by Roger Williams.",
          "Worth a quick visit, the memorial reminds us of one of America's original religious freedom advocates. The film is interesting and the park would be spectacular in the fall with leaf color.",
          "This was a really pretty park near the downtown and Brown U. Do walk around if in the area and go to the visitor center next door.",
          "Before the spring foliage, this is a somewhat austere place, especially on a rainy day even though the settlement history of Providence does supply some interest. The spring that slacked the thirst of original settlers is seemingly inactive.",
          "You won't need to spend much time here, but it is worth a quick visit. There is a small visitor center with information and a video to explore.",

Roger Williams left England seeking religious freedom like many others did,",

          "I'm a little disappointed that when we study history in school there is no mention of Rodger Williams. I had never heard of him, and neither had anyone in my party. She absolutely was instrumental in the forming of our country. Do not miss this! It is a tiny building right in",
          "Small size park in the middle of city. Plenty of tree to have shade on sunny days. Nice pieces of arts.",
          "I LOVE this park!!! It's where Roger Williams founded RI! It's a good size park to bring kids to run around after touring the RISD Museum, and then have a picnic lunch! Plus.... there's free parking!",
          "Although it's not the biggest exhibit, the visitor's centre offers some insight into the life and beliefs of Roger Williams and the massive roll he played in American history. I had hoped to learn a little bit about the history of Rhode Island and this centre was able to give",

        "wiki": "Swan Point Cemetery is a historic rural cemetery located in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. Established in 1846 on a 60-acre (0.24 km\u00b2) plot of land, it has approximately 40,000 interments.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe cemetery was first organized under the Swan Point Cemetery Company, with a board of trustees. In 1858, a new charter was developed to make the cemetery administration non-profit, and it was taken over by a group known as the Proprietors of Swan Point Cemetery. In 1886, landscape architect H.W.S. Cleveland was hired to redesign the area.  It is a cemetery park with its design inspired by the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted's Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nAmong the first to make use of a tract of land within the cemetery was the First Congregational Society (now First Unitarian Society). They moved several interments from older plots in Providence to Swan Point. Over the years additional land acquisition has expanded the cemetery to 200 acres (0.81 km2), and is still open to new interments today.\nThe Swan Point Cemetery is widely considered to be the most prominent cemetery in Rhode Island due to the number of well known citizens of the state buried there.  There are more governors, senators and congressmen buried there than any other cemetery in Rhode Island.\nSwan Point Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.  It is one of the two largest cemeteries in Providence with the other one being the North Burial Ground.\n\n\n== Notable interments ==\n\nSwan Point has the burials of many notable Rhode Island figures:\n\nRachel Blodgett Adams, 1921 Ph.D., mathematician\nDavid Aldrich, American artist\nNelson W.

          "The storytelling was filled with Providence's rich history and lore, and the guide included little-known details that comes from a native-born knowledge of the area. There was a full moon that peeked through the Fall canopy of this historic brick-lined district that added to",

          "A few friends gathered on our last night in Providence for the ghost tour. Our guide was wonderful. Her knowledge of Providence and the spooky side was top notch. She was engaging and identified with each guest. We wish we had taken the tour early in our trip so we could visit",

          "Our tour guide was friendly and knowledgeable, the event itself was just not very good. I expected more, maybe go into a building or two. Just walking around the streets of Providence I could habe done myself with an audio book and gotten the same affect. We cannot recommend",

          "Stephanie, our guide, made the tour very ghostly. We toured Brown and the surrounding area. One person in our group took a picture which showed an orb. This was a daytime tour and it was still scary to hear all the ghostly stories. This a great tour and should not be missed.",
          "A nice way to spend an evening in Providence. The Brown University area is beautiful and historic. Guide was great! She is very knowledgeable and theatrical. Beautiful and appropriate dress. I would suggest a more \u201cperiod\u201d lantern. The LED one used broke the ghostly spell",
          "I am not unfamiliar with ghost tours (Go to one in every city I visit) and can say this is one of my favorites! The guide makes sure to really paint a picture of the time period and local color and weaves this into the ghost tales. Highly recommend!",

          "This was a spur of the moment evening and we thoroughly enjoyed it! We met at Prospect Park with about 30 other \"souls\" and were led by Stephanie through the streets of Providence's historic east side. We heard stories about people who had lived in some of the houses",
          "As a Rhode Island native was a great source of history with a little spook factor. Courtney was a fun,witty and a fund of knowledge. Great for locals and visitors",
          "The host was very nice and extremely informative. He knew a ton about local history. The walk was nice and pretty easy some reviews said there were hills but he said they revised their tour now almost no uphills. If you book online you save $2 per person. I would have done",

          "We love to go on ghost tours when available in whatever city we visit. I was excited about this one because it said it was one of the top ten in the country. It was entertaining but we have been in 6 other tours and they were all better. There were not enough scary stories. It",
          "We highly recommend this tour. Aurora was great to listen to and kept everyone engaged throughout. It was also great to hear about the history linked to the city!",
          "This was a really interesting tour. I wish I had went on the tour my first night so that the next day I could go back and visit the haunted places that were mentioned when the buildings were open. The only reason why I didn't give this tour 5 stars is because unlike some tours,",
          "Stephanie was the best guide - she had a fun personality and kept everyone engaged while she was telling the stories. Whether you believe in ghosts or not (we don't), you hear a lot about the history of Providence and get to see really cool things. I loved being on the Brown",
          "Took the tour last night. Stephanie was fantastic! Awesome way to learn some history of the East Side and also caught some orbs on camera. Would highly recommend to tourists and natives.",
          "Went with my 17 year old son before he started a class at Brown University. This was a lot of fun. If you like history this tour is for you. My son and I both loved the history we learned about Brown university and it's buildings. Our guide Stephanie was very entertaining",
          "Really fun. Don't believe in ghosts but, was very cool. Nice stories and great imagery to think about. Hots of walking for my dog and I. Would have loved to visit inside buildings. Alaura was great; answered all my spooky questions.",
          "This is a fun event. Lot's history is shared as you walk between historic buildings. Not sure we saw any ghosts, but than again had some things in our pictures we were unable to explain. Fun time!",
          "We didn't see any ghosts :) But Alaura was a great guide. Fun walk on a crisp fall night with friends.",
          "EXCELLENT experience. Kelly, the guide was PHNOMONAL. She was very outgoing, Extremely knowledgeable. and well spoken. I learned a lot about the history of Providence and the well known people that lived here. I highly recommend attending this event.",
          "I had one evening in Providence and decided to take a Ghost Tour since it was close to Halloween! Our tour guide Stephanie was dressed in Victorian clothing and carried a lamp during our 1.5 hour walking tour. We went by churches, universities, private homes, a design school",
          "Our tour guide Alaura did a fantastic job. She was great, she really knew all her stuff. We also had a sailor visitor listening to her randomly. I would love to go again!",
          "Having lived in Providence for almost 30 years you think you know the area -- the delightful, educational tour taught me much more about Providence than I ever knew -- the Brown University/RISD area is a wealth of ghostly tales -- the tour guide that we had was very",
          "I went to this ghost tour as a skeptic and left a believer. It was an amazing tour. Our tour guide was alura. She was dressed great and loved the lantern. She was skilled and knowledgeable in every place we went. She knew deatils, place, times, people and dates. Very",
          "We did the Providence ghost tour on a Sunday evening. My fianc\u00e9 or I have never been to Providence before and since we didn't have long in town we decided to take this tour mostly for the history. The tour starts at prospect park at 8pm. Our tour guide was Stephanie and she was",
          "Not really worth the cost, but it is something to do on a nice night when you feel like walking (beware of the hills). We were able to stop in and see the quad area on the campus of Brown University as part of the walk, so that was a plus for me. Stephanie was very engaging.",
          "Ridiculous waste of time and money. Tour guide was very nice and enthusiastic, but the stories seemed to be fabricated and drawn out.",
          "Our guide was named Stephanie and she was a delight. The tour does involved some uphill areas, but if you can handle it totally worth it. We learned so much about Providence and its legendary ghosts from hp lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe and loved all the stories that went along",
          "Previous reviews mentioned being guided by a man that was a very entertaining, that is NOT what we had. Our hostess tripped herself up several times during her recitation, lacked enthusiasm, and just made the whole tour seem really cheesy. Not at all scary, or even",
          "Smoking tolerated, weakly written below average ghost stories, poor tour guide, overall poorly executed. Don't waste your money!",
          "I have been on a few ghost tours and being in Providence for a few nights for my cousins dance competition, I was excited to find something educational, historial, and paranormal to occupy my time. And it was fabulous! I was not disappointed. Our tour guide was exceptional and",
          "Never have been in a Ghost Tour and so decided to try it out. Really enjoyed it. Learned a lot about the history of Providence and some of its darker and eerie secrets including that the founder had tree roots wrap around him in his grave. Very interesting, very fun,",
          "Met our tour guide in front of the Roger Williams statue at Prospect Park (look for the lantern!). She was fun and entertaining from the beginning and had lots of stories and information to share. We didn't capture any ghosts on our tour but it was still a great way to see parts",
          "I brought some bored teens here for a fun night and we all left enthusiastic! I had been to Providence many times but seeing it in a different light was quite eye opening. The energy here was great, old or young everyone loved their time and the tour guide was awesome. A must do",
          "Wonderful time what fun lot to see and great information to learn. The guide was enthusiastic love story was great of Poe and Annemarie",
          "Great time, tour guide was very knowledgeable. I brought my instamatic camera and got the ghosts not knowing I was taking their picture until I had my photos developed. For some reason people using their phones to take pictures didn't capture them. Very Eerie!",
          "This was definitely a fun experience. The tour guides were knowledgeable and had experiences to add to their stories making it more fun. It's well worth taking the tour even if you don't believe in the paranormal, because all the stories relate to history, including H.P.",
          "The tour was both informative and fun, highlighted by the charm of Providence. I walked from the Courtyard Marriott and though a bit of a hike totally doable. The guide Susan was wonderful and really made the tour a lot of fun and full of history. The love stories of Poe and",
          "We just returned from our 3rd year of going on one of these tours. They are always very entertaining. The guides are enthusiastic and knowledgeable. The tour is kind of a mixed bag of historical and paranormal sightings tour. Whether or not you believe in ghosts and orbs, it is",
          "I would thoroughly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Providence. We only had the night in the city and it was a great way to experience the sites and the history of the Brown university district, which looks beautiful by night. Our tour guide Erin was fantastic - friendly",
          "The Providence Ghost Tour is an excellent way to explore and learn about the oldest part of Providence city. Steeped in rich history and featuring the tales of many notable Providence figures, this tour takes visitors around the Brown University campus with pit stops at a RISD",
          "We felt the tour was good-to-great. We covered homes throughout several time periods, on Brown University grounds and beyond. The tour guide nailed the entire trip, rarely stumbled through her presentations and even occasionally made it theatrical. The history was great. Felt",
          "The tour we attended was large, and unfortunately, included some younger adults that tended to talk in groups which distracted from the tour guide's narrations. The sidewalks and streets around Brown University, where most of the tour was conducted, were uneven and sometimes",
          "Great history, ghost mix. I can say that at least one of the places we visited made me feel watched and made the hairs on my body stick out with intense goosebumps. Great city, nice walk, nice stories.. Why not? Do it!",
          "I think that the whole tour was great. My tour guide Mandy was fantastic she kept it entertaining and I could really feel the stories that she was telling. The stories were interesting and made me want to know more! I am so glad that I took this tour it was well worth it. I am",
          "Our tour guide was the founder herself, a very informative tour guide, clearly has a passion for what she does, and an excellent performer when reenacting certain occurrences. Had such a wonderful time! I found about this tour when they had an offer on Groupon for $15, but ended",
          "We stayed in Newport and heard about this tour so we figured we give it a try. Traffic a little crazy,all and all though not to hard to find. The tour was funny,entertaining and educational. Nice walk and view of the city. We all really enjoyed this and had a nice time. Over all",
          "This past October I went on the Providence Ghost Tour with friends. I have previously gone on ghost tours in New Orleans and Charleston, South Carolina. This was by far the worst ghost tour or any type of walking tour I have ever been on. Our guide was new and had",
          "On a quick trip to Providence, I joined this tour at the last minute. I find ghost tours to be an excellent way to see a new city; you learn the history of the city, and the people who shaped it while also visiting important landmarks as well as residential areas. Providence was",
          "The tour was interesting, both the ghost and history tales, and the view of the historic college hill area was awesome. Our guide seemed knowlegable and did a good job. Nothing too scary, so I think young children would be fine",
          "My friend and I took a ghost tour as a part of a random road trip to Rhode Island. Although there was nothing \"spooky\" about the tour, we thoroughly enjoyed hearing the stories and seeing historic parts of Providence and learning about its history. Our tour guide, Shawn, was",

          "We read the reviews, so we knew we weren't going into any houses, but were still very disappointed in the lack of chills or entertainment in our walk. Our guide was a co-owner of the company, and knew the stories, but they just didn't spark our awe or curiosity like a good ghost",
          "Great stories from our guide Max. He was very energetic and knowledgable. Loved the stories about Edgar Allen Poe and his love interest Sarah Helen Whitman. Thanks for a great time.",
          "It was excellent. you meet at prospect park, walk down the upper east side with rich history of brown, risd, h.p. lovecraft and edgar alan poe. In one photo I took at a building, with a story about a woman in a pink dress, I had photographed the building, only to find a",

          "It is fun. We had a lot of fun. But they kept talking about a lot of amazing ghost pictures... that are nowhere on their site. I'm kind of a skeptic, so all these amazing pictures sounded like something to take home and put on my fridge. None. I think all of the 'orb' pictures",
          "we purchased this tour through a groupon, and with that it was an excellent deal. it is a walking tour so not recommended for those who have difficulty walking expecially since some of the pavement and sidewalks are not the best. the tours are at night, of course, and they are",

          "I've been on a few different walking hunted tours and this one was rather disappointing. Their website plays it up nicely but the actual tour was lacking. If the 10 stories and stops 3 or 4 had nothing spooky or haunting about it. Everything was based around Brown university",
          "I've done several ghost tours and this one was just ok. It's very informative and the walk isn't tremendously difficult but I just wasn't that into it. The guide was super nice and funny but like I said it just wasn't as appealing to me.",

          "I went on the tour on the first Friday of May. It was everything I hoped it would be. Spooky, historical, fun, informative. I learned a great deal about the history of the East Side of Providence as well as having the hair on the back of my neck stand up more than a few",
          "Husband & I went on this tour Friday night, May 18th & had a great time... I DO believe & have several photos of \"orbs\" & other phenomena that I've taken in the past & I thought THEY were a big deal! However, on this tour, as we all learned creepy \"stories\" about each stop",
          "We went on the very last tour of the year. It was a chilly and beautiful evening with GREAT views of downtown Providence from the park where we met the tour. It was a little crowded in terms of number of people per group, but the guide did a good job of organizing us. The guide,",
          "My wife, daughter and I really looked forward to the ghost tour. It was a strange and a bit disappointing experience as several of the participants, including the tour guide, seemed to believe in ghosts and supernatural beings. Some stories were fascinating, but after several",
          "If you see this advertised you should definitely check it out. It is very educational and fun to do during the holiday!",
          "We had the most interesting guide who really entertained our group. He was quick to point out the history all around us (in addition to some questionable ghost stories) We had a young person in our group that he involved as a helper, which was a nice touch.",
          "Deb was a great tour guide and story teller. The stories were good and we were taken places that I would not have thought to visit on my own - wish we had more time in the city to go back and visit inside the places Deb told us about....like the library that has books covered",
          "Tour was OK but not as interesting as I thought it would be based on the other reviews. Our guide, although pleasant enough, could have been more interactive with our large group and perhaps a little more creepy in his narratives. From my perspective, he did not ask anyone",
          "We attended on July 9th. Our tour guide was amazing. Very interesting tour. Alot of information and really cool stories. It was about 2 hours long and there is a huge hill to walk up towards the end. Make sure you wear sneakers and bring a bottle of water with you. Really",
          "We went on the Providence Ghost Tour on Saturday and it was a lot of fun. Our guide Max was funny and very informative. It was a great tour of Providence and just a great trip. I must say I'm glad I wore sneakers as there are many hills during this tour, but it did not ruin",
          "This was more than just a ghost tour. We learned about the history in the area and enjoyed a good 1 1/2 hr. of walking through the east side of Providence. Our tour guide really got into it and made it interesting for us. Did we see Ghosts? Well.....you'll just have to go",
          "Providence is really neat place and the East side is the most beautiful and historical part of it. So I was so excited when I found out about this tour! And I wasn't disappointed...it was great! You get to hear stories about people that I didn't even know had ties to providence,",

          "I live in Massachusetts but I love Rhode Island. Lots of great places to visit, especially on the East Side of Providence. The ghost tour is great, but, yes, it would be a lot better if the guides skipped their political commentary..... If you're interested in knowing",
          "What would have turned out to be a good tour was regretfully peppered with anti-republican swipes by our curly-haired, goth guide. Given the current political storm we find ourselves in with the midterm elections looming, some people, like myself, opted to forget about politics",
          "Bought tickets for my wife and I. I am fairly skeptical about ghosts but she is open-minded. It was entertaining for both of us. I can tell you that, coming from the midwest, Providence is beautiful and especially at night when many of the beautiful buildings are lit up. It",

        "wiki": "Providence Canyon State Outdoor Recreation Area is a 1,003-acre (405.90 ha) Georgia state park located in Stewart County in southwest Georgia.  The park contains Providence Canyon, which is sometimes called Georgia's \"Little Grand Canyon\".  It is considered to be one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Georgia.  Providence Canyon actually is not a purely natural feature\u2014the massive gullies (the deepest being 150 feet) were caused by erosion due to poor farming practices in the 19th century. It is also home to the very rare plumleaf azalea.\nThis old story of the origin of the canyons has been commonplace since the 1940s. Although there were probably a few early arrivals before 1825, the first heavy influx of settlers in Stewart county came after the Treaty of Indian Springs (1825) by which the Creek Indians were forced to cede all their lands east of the Chattahoochee river. Evidence of the existence of the canyons is their mention in a deed by James S Lunsford to William Tatam recorded in 1836.\nThe park lies on marine sediments\u2014usually loamy or clayey, with small areas of sand. Loamy sand topsoils overlie subsoils of sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay in most of the uneroded section. Nankin, Cowarts, Mobila, and Orangeburg are the most prominent soil series. The canyons have much exposure of clay, over which water often seeps. Water is mobile in this well-drained area.\nOne of the quirkier attractions of the state park is an abandoned homestead including nearly a dozen rusty, 1950s-era cars and trucks. Due to the environmental damage that removing the vehicles would cause, park officials have decided to leave them alone.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n1,003 acres (406 ha)\n2 picnic shelters\n6 back country campsites\n3 pioneer campsites\n\n\n== Yearly events ==\nChristmas Workshop (December)\nAstronomy Night (September)\nFall Wildflower Day (October)\nGeology Day (October)\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nRed Bluff, Mississippi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "India Point Park is a park in the Fox Point neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island at the confluence of the Seekonk River and Providence River.  The park takes its name from the maritime activity connecting Providence with the East and West Indies. The East Bay Bike Path begins at the eastern end of the park, and crosses over the Washington Bridge before heading to Watchemoket Square in East Providence and continuing on to Bristol and the Mount Hope Bridge. The park is also a part of the Washington\u2013Rochambeau Revolutionary Route.\n\n\n== History ==\nIndia Point was Providence's first port. It was established in 1680 and flourished as a center of maritime trade for 250 years. John Brown established his tea and spice trade with the East Indies here, which is what gives the park its name. India Point Park remained an important trade center until the Great Depression.\n\n\n=== Transportation center ===\nDuring the early 1800s, Fox Point became a major transportation center for the city, serving as many as seven steamship lines. In 1835 a railroad opened on India Street at Ives Street.\n\n\n==== Cargo shipping ====\nDuring the 19th century, Providence was growing some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country, including Brown & Sharpe, Nicholson File, and Gorham Silverware. Many of these companies shipped their goods through the wharves at India Point. Providence shipped out cotton and woolen goods, hardware, machinery, steam engines, and other goods to the world. In return, the ships brought raw materials including cotton, wool, leather, iron, hides, and other products. By the late 1800s the ships were bringing coal to Providence. In 1878 coal imports peaked at nearly one million tons of coal, which were stored in storage yards and wharves along the harbor. Many of these wharf pilings were still visible a century later.\n\n\n==== Passenger lines ====\n\nOn August 22, 1821, the steamboat Robert Fulton became the first steamboat to travel direct from New York to Providence. In addition to cargo, Fox Point was host to several passenger steamship lines, including the Providence and Stonington Line, the Long Island Sound Steamship line, the New England Steamship Company, the Merchants & Miners Steamship Line, and others. These large, fast, and comfortable ships brought passengers from ports such as Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, and Miami. In the 1920s, Merchants & Miners had six ships and three sailings per week from Baltimore to Providence. Service continued until 1941, when steamships were requisitioned for the war effort.In June 1911, the French Fabre Line began trans-Atlantic service to Providence. Between June 30, 1912 and June 30, 1913, Fabre brought almost 12,000 mostly Italian and Portuguese immigrants to the Lonsdale Dock. The route was so popular that Fabre built an additional pier on Allens Avenue in 1914.\n\n\n=== Decline of shipping ===\nBy the 1940s, after being battered by the 1938 New England hurricane, and with many steamships having been requisitioned for the war effort, commerce largely ceased. The Port of Providence was moved to Allens Avenue, which had deeper waters. As diesel fuel replaced coal, the coal yards of India Point were turned into scrap yards.In the 1960s, the construction of Interstate 195 cut India Point off from the rest of the neighborhood. Architectural historian William McKenzie Woodward believed the effect was poorly mitigated by the pedestrian walkway.\n\n\n=== Beautification and park ===\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Providence underwent a concerted beautification effort, including, finally, the transformation of India Point into a public park dedicated in 1974.The original pedestrian bridge over I-195 was demolished in 2005 for an expanded linear park bridge which opened a few years later, providing greater access for the greater Fox Point neighborhood. Foot traffic has also benefitted from the George Redman Linear Park, which was completed in September 2015.\nThe long period of neglect is still reflected in the condition of the Green Jacket Shoal, the section of the Providence River between Fox Point and Riverside, which has accumulated a century's worth of debris. Remnants of destroyed docks, pilings, a dry dock, shipwrecks, abandoned ships, and other structures stick out of the water in many places around the shoal, owing to many years of natural disasters and economic hardship. The aesthetic of the surrounding water is closely associated with the park. As the character of the area moved away from its industrial past, and with increased public recreational use of the water via India Point Park and Bold Point, the detritus has come to be a noted source of urban blight and a safety concern for anyone using the water.\n\n\n== Panorama ==\n\n\n== Linear Park Bridge and Performing Arts Amphitheater ==\n\nThe new linear park pedestrian bridge over Interstate 195 is six times wider than the one it replaced, and connects to East Street. It features benches, decorative lighting and landscaping of flowers, shrubs and small trees on the bridge itself, and a stair/ ramp system on the park side. The watering system was installed in the fall of 2009. The ramp leading to the linear park bridge also serves as 'on the green' seating for the amphitheater formed at the base/ shoreline of the park. Such events as July 4 performances of the Rhode Island Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra have taken place in this performing arts space.Other amenities include the Hilton Garden Inn Hotel, the Marston Boathouse - Brown University and sports fields on the east end of the park.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFox Point, Providence, Rhode Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFriends of India Point Park",

        "wiki": "Providence is the capital and most populous city of the state of Rhode Island and is one of the oldest cities in the United States. It was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams, a Reformed Baptist theologian and religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He named the area in honor of \"God's merciful Providence\" which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers. The city is situated at the mouth of the Providence River at the head of Narragansett Bay.\nProvidence was one of the first cities in the country to industrialize and became noted for its textile manufacturing and subsequent machine tool, jewelry, and silverware industries. Today, the city of Providence is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning which have shifted the city's economy into service industries, though it still retains some manufacturing activity.\nThe city is the third-most-populous city in New England after Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nProvidence was settled in June 1636 by Roger Williams and grew into one of the original Thirteen Colonies. Williams was compelled to leave Massachusetts Bay Colony due to his differing religious views, and he and others established Providence Plantations. This settlement merged with others to become the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and it was a refuge for persecuted religious dissenters from the beginning.Providence Plantations was burned to the ground in March 1676 by the Narragansetts during King Philip's War, despite the good relations between Williams and the sachems with whom the United Colonies of New England were waging war. Later in the year, the Rhode Island legislature formally rebuked the other colonies for provoking the war.Providence residents were among the first Patriots to spill blood in the lead-up to the American Revolutionary War during the Gaspee Affair of 1772, and Rhode Island was the first of the Thirteen Colonies to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown on May 4, 1776. It was also the last of the Thirteen States to ratify the United States Constitution on May 29, 1790, once assurances were made that a Bill of Rights would become part of the Constitution.Following the war, Providence was the country's ninth-largest city  with 7,614 people. The economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, in particular machinery, tools, silverware, jewelry, and textiles. By the start of the 20th century, Providence hosted some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country, including Brown & Sharpe, Nicholson File, and Gorham Manufacturing Company.\n\nProvidence residents ratified a city charter in 1831 as the population passed 17,000. The seat of city government was located in the Market House in Market Square from 1832 to 1878, which was the geographic and social center of the city. The city offices outgrew this building, and the City Council resolved to create a permanent municipal building in 1845.  The city offices moved into the Providence City Hall in 1878.\n\nLocal politics split over slavery during the American Civil War, as many had ties to Southern cotton and the slave trade. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, the number of military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union. Providence thrived after the war, and waves of immigrants brought the population from 54,595 in 1865 to 175,597 by 1900.By the early 1900s, Providence was one of the wealthiest cities in the United States. Immigrant labor powered one of the nation's largest industrial manufacturing centers. Providence was a major manufacturer of industrial products, from steam engines to precision tools to silverware, screws, and textiles. Giant companies were based in or near Providence, such as Brown & Sharpe, the Corliss Steam Engine Company, Babcock & Wilcox, the Grinnell Corporation, the Gorham Manufacturing Company, Nicholson File, and the Fruit of the Loom textile company.From 1975 until 1982, $606 million of local and national community development funds were invested throughout the city. In the 1990s, the city pushed for revitalization, realigning the north-south railroad tracks, removing the huge rail viaduct that separated downtown from the capitol building, uncovering and moving the rivers (which had been covered by paved bridges) to create Waterplace Park and river walks along the rivers' banks, and constructing the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Alex and Ani City Center) and the Providence Place Mall.Despite new investment, poverty remains an entrenched problem. Approximately 27.9 percent of the city population is living below the poverty line. Recent increases in real estate values further exacerbate problems for those at marginal income levels, as Providence had the highest rise in median housing price of any city in the United States from 2004 to 2005.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Providence city limits enclose a small geographical region with a total area of 20.5 square miles (53 km2); 18.5 square miles (48 km2) of it is land and the remaining 2.1 square miles (5.4 km2) is water (roughly 10%). Providence is located at the head of Narragansett Bay, with the Providence River running into the bay through the center of the city, formed by the confluence of the Moshassuck and Woonasquatucket Rivers. The Waterplace Park amphitheater and riverwalks line the river's banks through downtown.\nProvidence is one of many cities claimed to be founded on seven hills like Rome. The more prominent hills are: Constitution Hill (near downtown), College Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and containing New England's largest Italian district outside of Massachusetts). The other four are: Tockwotten Hill at Fox Point, Smith Hill (where the State House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston and Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill at the lower end of Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early 1880s.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nProvidence has 25 official neighborhoods, though these neighborhoods are often grouped together and referred to collectively:\nThe East Side is a region comprising the neighborhoods of Blackstone, Hope (aka Summit), Mount Hope, College Hill, Wayland, and Fox Point.\nThe Jewelry District describes the area enclosed by I-95, the old I-195, and the Providence River. The city has made efforts to rename this area the Knowledge District to reflect the area's newly developing life sciences and technology-based economy.\nThe North End is formed by the concatenation of the neighborhoods of Charles, Wanskuck, Smith Hill, Elmhurst, and Mount Pleasant.\nThe South Side (or South Providence) consists of the neighborhoods of Elmwood, Lower South Providence, Upper South Providence, Washington Park, and the West End.\nWest Broadway is an officially recognized neighborhood with its own association. It overlaps with the southern half of Federal Hill and the northern part of the West End.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city of Providence is geographically very compact, characteristic of eastern seaboard cities that developed prior to use of the automobile. It is among the most densely populated cities in the country. For this reason, Providence has the eighth-highest percentage of pedestrian commuters. The street layout is irregular; more than one thousand streets (a great number for the city's size) run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places such as Market Square.Downtown Providence has numerous 19th-century mercantile buildings in the Federal and Victorian architectural styles, as well as several post-modern and modernist buildings located throughout the area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development. West Exchange Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two.\nThe newer area, sometimes called \"Capitol Center\", includes Providence Place Mall (1999), the Omni Providence Hotel (1993) and The Residences Providence (2007), GTECH Corporation (2006), Waterplace Towers condominiums (2007), and Waterplace Park (1994). The area tends toward newer development, since much of it is land reclaimed in the 1970s from a mass of railroad tracks referred to colloquially as the \"Chinese Wall\". This part of Downtown is characterized by open spaces, wide roads, and landscaping.\nThe historic part of downtown has many streetscapes that look as they did 80 years ago. Many of the state's tallest buildings are found here. The largest structure at 426 feet (130 m) is the art deco-styled Industrial National Bank Building (formerly Industrial Trust Tower). By contrast, nearby to it is the second tallest One Financial Plaza, designed in modern taut-skin cladding, constructed a half-century later. In between the two is 50 Kennedy Plaza. The Textron Tower is also a core building to the modest Providence skyline. Downtown is also the home of the Providence Biltmore and Westminster Arcade, the oldest enclosed shopping mall in the U.S., built in 1828.The city's southern waterfront, away from the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Russian Submarine Museum was located here until 2008, when the submarine sank in a storm and was declared a loss. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found here, built to protect Providence from storm surge like that which it endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol.The majority of the cityscape comprises abandoned and revitalized industrial mills, double- and triple-decker housing (though row houses are rare, found so commonly in other Northeast cities), a small number of high-rise buildings (predominantly for housing the elderly), and single family homes. Interstate 95 serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods such as Federal Hill and the West End.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nProvidence has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa) bordering a humid subtropical climate with hot summers, cold winters, and high humidity year-round. The USDA places the city in hardiness zone 6b, with the suburbs in zones 6a \u2013 7b. The influence of the Atlantic Ocean keeps the state of Rhode Island warmer than many inland locales in New England. January is the coldest month with a daily mean of 29.2 \u00b0F (\u22121.6 \u00b0C) and low temperatures dropping to 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) or lower an average of 11 days per winter, while July is the warmest month with a daily mean of 73.5 \u00b0F (23.1 \u00b0C) and highs rising to 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) or higher an average of 10 days per summer. Extremes range from \u221217 \u00b0F or \u221227.2 \u00b0C on February 9, 1934 to 104 \u00b0F or 40 \u00b0C on August 2, 1975; the record cold daily maximum is 1 \u00b0F (\u221217.2 \u00b0C) on February 5, 1918, while the record warm daily minimum is 80 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C) on June 6, 1925. Temperature readings of 0 \u00b0F or \u221217.8 \u00b0C or lower are uncommon in Providence and generally occur once every several years. The year which had the most days with a temperature reading of zero degrees or lower was 2015 with eight days total\u2014one day in January and seven days in February. Conversely, temperature readings of 100 \u00b0F or 37.8 \u00b0C or higher are even rarer, and the year with the most days in this category was 1944 with three days, all of which were in August.Monthly precipitation in Providence ranges from a high of 4.43 inches (112.5 mm) in March to a low of 3.17 inches (80.5 mm) in July. In general, precipitation levels are slightly less in the summer months than the winter months, when Nor'easters can cause significant snowfall and blizzard conditions. Hurricanes are not frequent in coastal New England, although Providence's location at the head of Narragansett Bay makes it vulnerable to them.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2000, the population consisted of 173,618 people, 162,389 households, and 35,859 families. The population density was 9,401.7 inhabitants per square mile (3,629.4/km\u00b2), characteristic of other small cities in New England such as New Haven, Connecticut; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut.  Its population peaked in the 1940s, just prior to the nationwide period of rapid suburbanization.\nProvidence has a racially and ethnically diverse population. In 2010, white Americans formed 49.8% of the population, including a sizable white Hispanic community. Non-Hispanic whites were 37.6% of the total population, down from 89.5% in 1970. Providence has had a substantial Italian population since the start of the 20th century, with 14% of the population claiming Italian ancestry. Italian influence manifests itself in Providence's Little Italy in Federal Hill.  Irish immigrants have also had considerable influence on the city's history, with 8% of residents claiming Irish heritage. The city also has a sizeable Jewish community, estimated at 10,500 in 2012 or roughly 5% of the city's population.\n\nIn 2010, people of Hispanic or Latino origin composed 38.1% of the city's population and currently form a majority of city public school students. The majority of Hispanics in Providence are of Dominican descent, having one of the largest Dominican populations in the United States. Other Hispanic groups present in large numbers are Puerto Ricans and Guatemalans. Hispanics are most concentrated in the neighborhoods of Elmwood, the West End, and Upper and Lower South Providence.  The city elected its first Hispanic mayor in 2010, Dominican-American Angel Taveras.\nAfrican Americans constitute 16% of the city's population, with their greatest concentrations found in Mount Hope and the Upper and Lower South Providence neighborhoods. Asians are 6% of Providence's population and have enclaves scattered throughout the city. The largest Asian groups are Cambodians (1.7%), Chinese (1.1%), Asian Indians (0.7%), Laotians (0.6%), and Koreans (0.6%). Another 6% of the city has multiracial ancestry. American Indians and Pacific Islanders make up the remaining 1.3%. Liberians compose 0.4% of the population; the city is home to one of the largest Liberian immigrant populations in the country.Providence has a considerable community of immigrants from various Portuguese-speaking countries, especially Portugal, Brazil, and Cape Verde, living mostly in the areas of Washington Park and Fox Point. Portuguese is the city's third-largest European ethnicity, after Italian and Irish, at 4% of the population; Cape Verdeans compose 2%.The Providence metropolitan area includes Providence, Fall River, Massachusetts, and Warwick, and is estimated to have a population of 1,622,520. In 2006, this area was officially added to the Boston Combined Statistical Area (CSA), the sixth-largest CSA in the country. In the last 15 years, Providence has experienced a sizable growth in its under-18 population. The median age of the city is 28 years, while the largest age cohort is 20- to 24-year-olds, owing to the city's large student population.The per capita income as of the 2000 census was $15,525, which is well below both the state average of $29,113 and the national average of $21,587.  The median income for a household was $26,867, and the median income for a family in Providence was $32,058, according to the 2000 census. The city has one of the highest rates of poverty in the nation with 29.1% of the population and 23.9% of families living below the poverty line in 2000, the largest concentrations being found in the city's Olneyville, and Upper and Lower South Providence areas. Poverty has affected children at a disproportionately higher rate, with 40.1% of those under the age of 18 living below the poverty line, concentrated west of downtown in the neighborhoods of Hartford, Federal Hill, and Olneyville.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nCompared to the national average, Providence has an average rate of violent crime and a higher rate of property crime per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2010, there were 15 murders, down from 24 in 2009. In 2010, Providence fared better regarding violent crime than most of its peer cities. Springfield, Massachusetts has approximately 20,000 fewer residents than Providence but reported 15 murders in 2009, the same number of homicides as Providence but a slightly higher rate per capita.  The police chief asserted that Providence's violence was not stranger-to-stranger, but relationship-driven.  The pattern of violent crime was highly specific by neighborhood, with the vast majority of the murders taking place in the poorer sections of Providence such as Olneyville, Elmwood, South Providence, and the West End.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAround 1830, Providence had manufacturing industries in metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Manufacturing has declined since, but the city is still one of the largest centers for jewelry and silverware design and manufacturing. Services also make up a large portion of the city's economy, in particular education, healthcare, and finance. Providence also is the site of a sectional center facility (SCF), a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service. It is the capital of Rhode Island, so the city's economy additionally consists of government services.\n\nProminent companies headquartered in Providence include Fortune 500 Textron, an advanced technologies industrial conglomerate; United Natural Foods, a distributor of natural and organic foods; Fortune 1000 Nortek Incorporated; Gilbane, a construction and real estate company; and GTECH Corporation, which recently moved its world headquarters to downtown Providence. Citizens Bank is also headquartered in Providence and is the 15th largest bank in the country.The city is home to the Rhode Island Convention Center, which opened in December 1993. Along with a hotel, the convention center is connected to the Providence Place Mall, a major retail center, through a skywalk. The Port of Providence is the second largest deep-water seaport in New England. It handles cargos such as cement, chemicals, heavy machinery, petroleum, and scrap metal. Providence is also home to some of toy manufacturer Hasbro's business operations, although their headquarters are in Pawtucket.\n\n\n=== Top employers ===\nAccording to the City's 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top twenty employers in the city are:\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the state capital, Providence houses the Rhode Island General Assembly, as well as the offices of the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor in the Rhode Island State House. The city itself has a Mayor-council government. The Providence City Council consists of 15 councilors, one for each of the city's wards, who enact ordinances and pass an annual budget. Providence also has probate and superior courts. The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island is located downtown across from Providence City Hall adjacent to Kennedy Plaza.\nIn November 2002, David N. Cicilline was elected mayor of Providence, becoming the first openly gay mayor of a United States state capital.The city's first Latino mayor was Angel Taveras, who assumed office on January 3, 2011. Current mayor Jorge Elorza succeeded him on January 5, 2015.\n\nThe headquarters of the city's fire and police departments is a 130,000 square foot, steel frame Public Safety Complex on Washington Street near Interstate I-95. The building was dedicated in 2002 by former Mayor Vincent Cianci Jr.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Postsecondary ===\n\nThe main campuses of five of Rhode Island's colleges and universities are in Providence (city proper):\n\nBrown University, an Ivy League university and one of nine colonial colleges in the nation\nJohnson & Wales University\nProvidence College\nRhode Island College, the state's oldest public college\nRhode Island School of Design (RISD)In addition, the Community College of Rhode Island, Roger Williams University, and University of Rhode Island have satellite campuses in the city. Between these schools, the number of post-secondary students is approximately 44,000.  Higher education exerts a considerable presence in the city's politics and economy, compounded by the fact that Brown University is the city's second-largest employer.\n\n\n=== Private and charter schools ===\nThere are several private schools in the city's East Side, including Moses Brown, the Lincoln School, and the Wheeler School. La Salle Academy is located in the North End (Elmhurst neighborhood), near Providence College.

The Providence Public School District features magnet schools at the middle and high school level, Nathanael Greene and Classical respectively. The overall graduation rate as of 2007 is 70.1%, which is close to the statewide rate of 71% and the national average of 70%.\nRhode Island also operates two public schools in Providence.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nMuch of Providence culture is synonymous with the culture of Rhode Island as a whole. Like the state, the city has a non-rhotic accent that can be heard on local media. Providence also shares Rhode Island's affinity for coffee, with the most coffee and doughnut shops per capita of any city in the country.  Providence is also reputed to have the highest number of restaurants per capita of major U.S. cities, many of which are founded or staffed by Johnson & Wales University graduates.\n\nProvidence has several ethnic neighborhoods, notably Federal Hill and the North End (Italian), Fox Point (Portuguese), West End (mainly Central American and Asians), and Smith Hill (Irish with miscellaneous enclaves of other groups). There are also many dedicated community organizations and arts associations located in the city.The city gained the reputation as one of the most active and growing gay and lesbian communities in the Northeast. The rate of reported gay and lesbian relationships is 75% higher than the national average, and Providence has been named among the \"Best Lesbian Places to Live\". Former mayor David Cicilline won his election running as an openly gay man, Former Mayor Cianci instituted the position of Mayor's Liaison to the Gay and Lesbian community in the 1990s. and Providence is home to the largest gay bathhouse in New England.\n\nDuring the summer months, the city regularly hosts WaterFire, an environmental art installation that consists of about 100 bonfires which blaze just above the surface of the three rivers that pass through the middle of downtown Providence.

Prospect Terrace Park features expansive views of the downtown area, as well as a 15-foot tall granite statue of Roger Williams gazing over the city. As one of the first cities in America, Providence contains many historic buildings, while the East Side neighborhood in particular includes the largest contiguous area of buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the U.S., with many pre-revolutionary houses.The East Side is also home to the First Baptist Church in America, which was founded by Williams in 1638, as well as the Old State House which served as the state's capitol from 1762 to 1904. Nearby is Roger Williams National Memorial. The dome of the State House is the fourth-largest self-supporting marble dome in the world and the second-largest marble dome after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The Westminster Arcade is the oldest enclosed shopping center in the U.S.\n\nThe Rhode Island School of Design Museum contains the 20th-largest collection in the United States.

From 1926 to 1972, the AHL's Providence Reds (renamed the Rhode Island Reds in their last years) played at the Rhode Island Auditorium. In 1972, the team relocated to the Providence Civic Center, where they played until moving to Binghamton, New York, in 1977.\nThe city has two rugby teams, the Rugby Union team Providence Rugby Football Club, and the Semi-Professional Rugby league team The Rhode Island Rebellion, which play at Classical High School. In 2013 the Rebellion finished the USA Rugby League (USARL) regular season in third place. Their playoff run took them to the USARL Semi-Finals, the first time the Rebellion made the playoffs in its short three-year history.\nThe Providence Hurling Club was founded in 2015 by Michael Kennelly, David O'Connor, and Michael Walsh. The club is part of the Boston Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). Since their inauguration the team has captured three cups. The league comprises Worcester, Hartford, Portsmouth, and Concord. UConn Huskies also put forth a team in various play and other university teams are in the process of being established. Home games are played at a pitch located at 50 Obediah Brown Road behind Pleasant View Elementary School. In November 2018, for the first time playoffs were hosted in Providence and Providence took the cup by defeating Worcester.\nThe NFL's New England Patriots and MLS's New England Revolution play in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is situated halfway between Providence and Boston. Providence was formerly home to two major league franchises: the NFL's Providence Steam Roller in the 1920s and 1930s, and the NBA's Providence Steamrollers in the 1940s. The Rhode Island Auditorium also hosted 29 of the 49 boxing fights of Rocky Marciano.The city's defunct baseball team, the Providence Grays, competed in the National League from 1879 through 1885. The team defeated the New York Metropolitans in baseball's first successful \"world championship series\" in 1884. In 1914, after the Boston Red Sox purchased Babe Ruth from the then-minor league Baltimore Orioles, the team prepared Ruth for the major leagues by sending him to finish the season playing for a minor league team in Providence that was also known as the Grays. Today, professional baseball is offered by the Pawtucket Red Sox, the AAA affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, which plays in nearby Pawtucket. Most baseball fans\u2014along with the local media\u2014tend to follow the Boston Red Sox.Major colleges and universities fielding NCAA Division I athletic teams are Brown University and Providence College. The latter is a member of the Big East Conference. Much local hype is associated with games between these two schools or the University of Rhode Island.\nProvidence has also hosted the alternative sports event Gravity Games from 1999 to 2001, and was also the first host of ESPN's X Games, known in its first edition as the Extreme Games, in 1995. Providence has its own roller derby league. Formed in 2004, it currently has four teams: the Providence Mob Squad, the Sakonnet River Roller Rats, the Old Money Honeys, and the Rhode Island Riveters. Providence is also home to the headquarters of the American Athletic Conference (The American).\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Health and medicine ===\nProvidence is home to eight hospitals, most prominently Rhode Island Hospital, the largest general acute care hospital in the state. It is also the Level I Trauma Center for Rhode Island, Southeastern Massachusetts and parts of Connecticut. The hospital is in a complex along I-95 that includes Hasbro Children's Hospital and Women and Infants Hospital. The city is also home to the Roger Williams Medical Center, St. Joseph Hospital For Specialty Care (a division of St. Joseph Health Services Of Rhode Island), The Miriam Hospital, a major teaching affiliate associated with the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, as well as a VA medical center.\nThe Rhode Island Blood Center has its main headquarters in Providence. Since 1979, the Rhode Island Blood Center has been the sole organization in charge of blood collection and testing and distribution of blood products to 11 hospitals in Rhode Island.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nProvidence is served by T. F. Green Airport in Warwick, and general aviation fields also serve the region. Massport has been promoting T. F. Green as an alternative to Boston's Logan International Airport because of over-crowding. Providence Station is located between the Rhode Island State House and the downtown district and is served by Amtrak and MBTA Commuter Rail services, with a commuter rail route running north to Boston and south to T.F. Green Airport and Wickford Junction. Approximately 2,400 passengers pass through the station per day.I-95 runs from north to south through Providence; I-195 connects the city to eastern Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, including New Bedford, Massachusetts and Cape Cod. I-295 encircles Providence, while RI 146 provides a direct connection with Worcester, Massachusetts. The city began the long-term project Iway in 2007 to move I-195 for safety reasons, to free up land, and to reunify the Jewelry District with downtown Providence, which had been separated by the highway. The project was estimated to cost $610 million. \n\n\n==== Bus ====\nKennedy Plaza in downtown Providence serves as a transportation hub for local public transit as well as a departure point for Peter Pan Bus Lines and Greyhound Lines. Public transit is managed by Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA). Through RIPTA alone, Kennedy Plaza serves more than 71,000 people a day. The majority of the area covered by RIPTA is served by traditional buses, but RIPTA also runs a \"Rapid Bus\", the R-Line which connects the suburbs of Pawtucket and Cranston with downtown Providence.  Of particular note is the East Side Trolley Tunnel running under College Hill, whose use is reserved for RIPTA buses. RIPTA also operates the Providence LINK, a system of tourist trolleys in downtown Providence. From 2000 to 2008, RIPTA operated a seasonal ferry to Newport, Rhode Island between May and October, but SeaStreak began operating that ferry route in 2016.  In 2018, RIPTA began construction of the \"Downtown Transit Connector\", an upgraded BRT service to run from Providence Station to the Hospital District.\n\n\n==== Walking and bicycling ====\nThe city serves as the end point for four of the state's major traffic-free bicycle paths: the East Bay Bike Path, Washington Secondary Rail Trail, the Woonasquatuck Greenway Bike Path, and the Blackstone River Greenway. There are several dedicated on-road bicycle lanes within the city.In 2017, the city signed a $400,000 contract with a private Silicon Valley company to introduce Providence's first bicycle sharing program, supported by local hospitals and RIPTA. Shortly after the program started in September 2018, the bicycles became associated with a \"wave of vandalism and criminal activity\" including widespread thefts of bicycles, bikes tossed into the Providence river, and even a company tech held at gunpoint. The company suspended the program in August 2019.In August 2019, a pedestrian bridge opened, spanning the Providence River and connecting the east and west sides of downtown. It was built on the granite piers of the old Route 195 bridge.In January 2020, mayor Jorge Elorza unveiled a \"Great Streets\" initiative to create a framework of public space improvements to encourage walking, riding bicycles, and public transit. The plan includes establishing an \"Urban Trail Network\" which includes 60 miles of bicycle paths, bike lanes, and greenways within Providence.\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\nElectricity and natural gas are provided by National Grid. Providence Water is responsible for the distribution of drinking water, ninety percent of which comes from the Scituate Reservoir about ten miles (16 km) west of downtown, with contributions coming from four smaller bodies of water. Drinking water in Providence has been rated among the highest quality in the country.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nAs of 2016, Providence had five sister cities: \n Praia (1994)\n Florence (2002)\n Santo Domingo (2004)\n Zhuhai (2015)\n Guatemala City (2016)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of people from Providence, Rhode Island\nList of tallest buildings in Providence\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Providence, Rhode Island\nNeighborhoods in Providence\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"EDC Profile City of Providence\".

        "wiki": "Burnside Park is a small park situated in downtown Providence, Rhode Island, adjacent to Kennedy Plaza.  Named for Ambrose Burnside, a general in the American Civil War from Rhode Island, an equestrian statue was erected in his honor in the late 19th century, and sits in the center of the park.\n\n\n== History ==\n\"Burnside Park\" was originally known as City Hall Park. Some of the current park is located on the land that was formerly part of the Cove Basin. The rest was purchased from the Old Colony Railroad Company and the New York and New England Railroad Companies. The park was dedicated in 1892 and landscaped following the completion of Union Station in 1898.  Monumental sculpture was added in the first decade of the 20th century, including the resetting of the equestrian portrait of General Ambrose E. Burnside (1887, Launt Thompson, sculptor) from Exchange Place in 1906.Burnside Park was the location of the camp of the Occupy Providence Movement (patterned after the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City) during the Fall of 2011.\n\n\n== Artworks ==\n\n\n=== Bajnotti Fountain ===\n\nThe centerpiece of the park is the Bajnotti Fountain, sculpted in 1902 by Enid Yandell. At the time of its erection, it was referred to as the Carrie Brown Memorial Fountain. The fountain was a gift to the City of Providence by Italian Diplomat Signor Paul Bajnotti. It was commissioned as a memorial to Bajnotti's wife, Carrie Mathilde Brown, daughter of Nicholas Brown III, for whom the Carrie Tower is also named.\n\n\n=== Burnside Statue ===\n\nA 20-foot tall bronze statue by Irish-American sculptor Launt Thompson depicts Rhode Island Governor, Senator, and Civil War general Ambrose Burnside on horseback. A public campaign raised $30,000 to build a statue in Burnside's honor. The statue was unveiled July 4, 1887. It was restored in early 2015, as part of an overall upgrade to the downtown Kennedy Plaza area.\n\n\n== References ==\nProvidence County, Rhode Island Parks",

          "RISD is a little gem of a museum. Holding a general collection, in less than an hour you can get a very satisfying aesthetic experience. And in two hours you can get an excellent, quick survey of art history. What makes a visit so perfect is the careful curation, thoughtful",

          "We've been to museums all over the world. This one has a little of everything that can work with your pace. The building is well designed and the staff (including security guards) are extremely courteous, kind and knowledgeable. We were lucky to be here on the first Sunday of",
          "RISD Museum is worthy of a visit. Very nice exhibits on several floors. Interesting gift shop. Thursday evenings are free!",
          "The museum is very fun and very small. We had no idea what the exhibit was - turned out to be Gorham silver - 1850-1970. It was interesting. We enjoyed a lot of the interactive student work on the second floor. This was a perfect for us to spend an hour while waiting for our car",
          "Pick an artist of note, and RISD will have them. Pick a period or a type of medium, it's here. Great masters, modern art, marble frome rome, textiles, weapons, tea pots, a whole revolutionary period house, 20 foot tall wooden buda, mummy....getting the picture?",
          "When my wife said she\u2019d like to see the exhibit on Gorham silver I was a little dubious. But it was really interesting to see the fantastic work done by this RI institution. Little hard to get to given the building renovation but worth the effort",

          "I visited on a Sunday afternoon (free admission) and was impressed with their diverse collection of art from ancient Egyptian artefacts to contemporary works of art from all over the globe. I ran out of time to see as much (as thoroughly) as I would have liked. Thanks would",
          "We were lucky enough to arrive in Providence on the third Thursday evening of the month...when the RSID museum is free. So, without a concrete plan for the evening, we decided to puruse the museum before we went to dinner. Wow! What a wonderful museum. The museum is packed",
          "This is a treasure of a museum. You can find pretty much every style of artform within. The staff is friends and you can easily take it all in within a couple of hours. You will leave feeling quite cultured and full of joy from all the beauty you've taken in.",
          "To be honest I went in with low expectations since we have some of the best art museums in the world in NYC. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the museum and the collection. My students and I enjoyed the ancient artifacts. The number of world renowned painters",
          "My partner and I decided to take a few days to stay in Rhode Island. One of the things we wanted to make sure we caught was this museum. The Bona Drag temporary exhibit and the Greek and Roman room were on the top of my list and they didn't disappoint. I would recommend this to",

          "Following a delightful Saturday lunch nearby, our daughter, her husband (both RISD alums) and their two children, ages 6 and 9mos. toured the museum for a couple of hours. Our grandson was hoping for some dinosaur fossils but was not unhappy about there being none, and enjoyed",
          "We were expecting a museum focused on design, but saw that in fact, the design displays in this museum are only a small fraction of the collection. There is an antique home that has been incorporated into the museum, and there are Asian, Greek and Egyptian components, among",

          "I knew I wanted to tour the RISD Museum but did not know much about it's collection. Extremely surprised by the Impressionists and some of the other unexpected pieces. I've seen Chihuly glass at the V&A in London and the MFA in Boston, and was thrilled to learn more about this",
          "The museum has a wide variety of artifacts from ancient Egypt and the Mediterranean through current day. The modern art section, 20th century, is a focus of course, but the museum has large presence of Impressionists - very rewarding.",
          "The RISD museum has something for everyone. Special visiting exhibits, classical, modern, European, Asian and more. I never tire of repeat visits. Check it out on Sundays for FREE! I brought my 8 year old niece this past summer and she was hooked. Left the museum and drove to",
          "The RISD Museum has a surprisingly large, varied, and high-quality collection -- everything from painting and sculpture to textiles and furniture, dating from 3000 BCE to yesterday. The exhibits are very professionally staged and curated, but the hodge-podge building makes it",
          "Museum covers most of a block between North Main and Benefit Streets, on the side of the hill. Exhibits integrated across diverse cultures, so that you can get a sense for comparison. Second floor has student exhibits, which were intriguing and definitely worth exploring.",
          "For first time art museum goers, RISD is perfect because it takes you from antiquity to contemporary art across the board.",
          "This is a lovely museum with an impressive collection of all kinds of art. I loved the Impressionist paintings and the Asian art collection. A very worthwhile visit!",
          "This museum is a gem and should be a destination for any one interested in art. The collection is extensive and the well displayed. The museum is just large enough to provide an very nice visit for a morning or an afternoon. On the first floor there is a collection of student",
          "ranked one of the finest art/design schools in the world what can you say. Great instructors who are into the arts themselves in a big way. some world know in their own right. well maintained buildings in walking distance to downtown Providence,RI. it has the best of all worlds.",
          "A nice sampling of art throughout different eras; the museum's collection has grown over time. Would appreciate seeing more in the way of design innovations.",
          "My girlfriend and I have had this place on our list for a while. We went on a Sunday because it's FREE on Sundays which is great. My one complaint about that was there were lots of kids with their families - some sort of community arts function - so it was a bit on the loud",
          "This is an excellent museum. They have wonderful displays. A great place to learn new things and discover.",
          "I've been to a number of museums around the world....Wow! RISD has an amazing collection - and the student galleries were fantastic! Easy to make a day of this with great local restaurants in the neighborhood and walkable from the Providence train station.",
          "The museum is just the right size to enjoy in one visit, with lots of artistic treasures. Well worth the visit.",
          "Museum that has impressive items around every turn from every era. This place is for everyone and place that is perfect for stirring up conversation with whoever you bring.",
          "This is a great museum - and far too big to visit properly in one day. Fabulous modern European masters (think quality not quantity) - representing Cassatt, Monet, Pissaro, Van Gogh, Picasso and more. Good collection from the middle ages and an acbsolutely stupendous collection",
          "We did a free (with admission) art hour program for kids with my 8 year old and it was awesome. It was interesting, informative, and engaging. Great way to introduce kids to art. The museum was also great. It has what I would almost call a sampling from many different",
          "Sure, it's not as grand or enormous as the Met or Louvre but, nevertheless, absolutely worth visiting. The permanent collection is fine, and every special exhibit I've seen has been curated so thoughtfully and, sometimes, even provocatively. Sometimes visiting a small museum",
          "The exhibit that was on was very liberal& contemporary, not my taste. The other floors were interesting & historical.",
          "RISD Museum is an eclectic yet expansive selection of art from colonial America through the current era. A half day would be useful to be able to see the whole collection but that would be at a very fast pace. The museum is spread across multiple buildings and multiple floors,",
          "We went to the museum on a Friday. We obtained passes from our local library. But, the cost for the museum is small and worth it. Parking is available in lots near the museum. You receive a 50% discount for parking. Just get the ticket validated at the entrance to the museum.",
          "Interesting museum that is small but not as small as it first appears, and has a range of different collections. Although I have never had to pay for admission I would be happy to shell out $10 or so.",
          "The museum is free on Sundays. Not sure I would have considered it worth the money had we had to pay, to be honest. It has a nice collection of design pieces, but the curation is somewhere between awful and haphazard. The layout of the exhibits is confusing. We spent less",
          "A lovely museum with a large and eclectic collection, including clothing, furniture, jewelry, paintings and sculpture -- spanning the ancient Greeks to today. We saw a fascinating special exhibit on the meaning of liberty and imprisonment and much of their permanent collection.",
          "This museum is a great place to visit. It has something for everyone. There is parking on the road. Admission is very reasonable and free on Sundays. It is located on the east side of Providence where there are plenty of other interesting things to do in see as well.",
          "What an amazing museum. I had no idea how big or how comprehensive this museum was. I loved the section that focused on RISD student submissions.",
          "We went on a Sunday, which is free admission. The exhibits are beautifully presented and feature quite a few big names in modern art, some of which had a political dimension that may upset some people (which made them all the more interesting). We didn't try the caf\u00e9 but it was",
          "This museum is a great way to spend 2 to 3 hours. A wonderful assortment of treasures in a truly beautiful setting. We loved discovering the unique treasures. Definitely worth your time.",
          "The Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Art is one of the finest art museums you will ever visit. The museum is, of course, the property of the art school and they are constantly exhibiting works of famous artist who attended the school and from artist around the world.The",
          "Every designer aspirant or otherwise must visit this place and see the wonderful art pieces designed by the students of RISD. One of the world's renowned and most popular design school and it's prestigious to graduate from this school.",
          "I have enjoyed to be there and seeing amazing art This is so far the best I have seen It\u2019s very reasonable priced",
          "I have had the pleasure of visiting the RISD Museum twice, and continue to be amazed by the diversity of the art and the wonderful manner in which the works are presented. What's even better, is the fact that all of this is right nearby (for me) in Providence. If RISD is not",
          "RISD museum has an eclectic collection of art and design pieces. Paintings, sculpture, jewelry, textiles, furniture, and a giant wooden Buddha. There's always something new to discover, and admission is free on Sundays!",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to this very interesting museum. Wonderful selection of exhibits. Friendly and helpful staff. Cafe on site.",
          "This was definitely the highlight of my trip to Providence. From Egyptian and Asian artefacts to modern art, from American colonial furniture to European paintings, the RISD museum has it all. Don't miss it, and allow at least 3 hours to see the whole collection.",
          "The Asian and Egyptian art collections offered an excellent sampling of the cultures. The difference in the Chinese, Japanese and Tibetan Buddhas was informative.",
          "Lots of different art, from different time periods, well organized, fun building, good price. We were looking for something to do in Providence and be inside on a hot day, this really fit the bill",
          "This is great little museum, that features a lot of works from current and past teaching staff and current and past students. Its also features art from the \"masters\", Picasso, Manet, etc. just to name a few. Asian art, Ancient art, contemporary art, sculpture, you name the",

          "We spent less than an hour here, and that was plenty. They do have a Rodin, and a few other classic pieces.",
          "This is great Museum and deserves more attention and attendance. Go by all means with family and visitors. You should need a map, the rooms are in the old building and new, modern areas. Walk from the old art into the new. The experience is enlightening and sharing, you are not",
          "Every birthday for years and years my Mom (Hazel Godfrey Bailey Essex) and I went to RISD Museum. It was a very special event. Mom graduated after 4 years of Interior Design studies in 1933. Many years later, I believe it was in the 80's, there was a special ceremony at RISD to",
          "The great hall alone is worth the trip. You'll see a little of everything... paintings, photography, statuary, even sarcophagi.. modern and antique. There's usually a student exhibit going on as well.",
          "A varied, interesting collection in a beautiful museum in an equally beautiful location in Providence, one of the best preserved late 18th - early19th century neighborhoods in the US.",
          "Wonderful place to spend an hour or a day. Around every corner is something that will catch your eye. Several buildings joined together create smaller intimate galleries that are not intimidating. The guards are very helpful and nice, and will guide you if you loose your way.",
          "The RISD Museum of Art is a charming small art museum. The permanent collection includes surprisingly good examples of work by Jackson Pollack, Mark Rothko and Louise Bourgeois, among others.",
          "The RISD Museum has excellent exhibits for all interests. Go there. The cafe has good, fresh, clean food and a pleasant atmosphere. We were there 7/3/17. We walked to it from our hotel.",
          "A well curated selection of contemporary art and design. I'd describe it as a mini Metropolitan Museum of Art. Beautiful building in a charming neighborhood.",
          "Beautiful Museum spread over several building with a large variety of exhibitions. Nicely spaced on paintings. Small coffee/snack shop.",
          "This museum experience was one of the best I have had. Though it is small, there are priceless pieces from most periods. Because of it's size, you don't have to just choose one or two sections to see. You can view most of the museum in a few hours. The Buddha is an amazing sight",
          "Great Museum. The architecture of the buildings is quite nice. We particularly enjoyed the variety of collections exhibited.",
          "I went with my family, including 2 kids. We enjoyed it but we have seen nicer similar museums in other cities (New York, Ottawa, \u2026). At least it wasn\u2019t expensive!",
          "Rhode Island is the smallest state in America yet, RISD is a crown jewel of art school around the world, and its museum well astonishes me with its collections/objects, from ancient to contemporary, more than enough for teaching, more than good enough to be found in a small",
          "RISD Museum is a gem and was so much more comprehensive and engaging than we had expected. Don't miss it, we will return.",
          "I was impressed with the caliber of pieces the museum has....everything from Picasso to Pollock. The Asian exhibit was my favorite - quite a few Tibetan pieces.",
          "Although the collection is small, it is very thorough as would be expected in a teaching museum. Some surprising artists represented. A chihuly from his RISD days. Some colonial era portraits and landscapes. Well worth an afternoon.",
          "We stopped in for the \"Inventing Impressionism\" exhibit (ending June 11) featuring C\u00e9zanne, Pissarro, Renoir, Cassatt, Degas and more. Classic paintings in an intimate setting! I say \"eclectic\" because in the room next door, there were a lot of contemporary pieces including one",
          "I think this is the best commercial Art and Design School in America. The Cinematography School at Rhode Island School of Design,is among ,the best in the world. There is a Cinematography Museum in Poland, of all places which is marvelous. Europe produces exceptional",
          "I was impressed by some of the biggest names in art history with wonderful works in this museum: Monet, Van Gogh, Kandinsky, Manet, Cezanne, Reynolds, Cole, Sargent. The collection is diverse and \"lively.\" There are challenging pieces arranged in stimulating ways. There is a",
          "This museum is like a small version of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. There are rooms of Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Eastern art as well as room settings from various furniture periods. The painting collection is also impressive and there are special exhibitions,",
          "I have been visiting this museum annually for about 50 yrs. The new site is welcoming, clean and great! Visit you'll enjoy it I'm sure",
          "Great museum! A surprisingly large collection of famous paintings. Quite interesting and user friendly, I enjoyed very much. However I would caution that it is not a place for children or even teens. Side note, it is free on Sundays which is a huge bonus",
          "This museum has the most incredible collection of art. It compares to the best art museums in the world. It also has tours for tots on some Saturdays.",
          "There were many famous paintings in the impressionistic section, very impressive collection in a small museum. It's very easy to tour and spent about 2 hours but, that was all due to the move and reconstruction of the museum with a few floors closed. In the one \"storage room\"",
          "This is one of the better mid-size art museums one is likely to encounter. Not surprising, considering its association with one of the nation's most respected design schools. Even so, the breadth and depth of the collections is impressive, and not to be missed if you are",
          "I was so blown away by the incredible amount of art in this little museum! I didn't expect there to be so many floors, and sections. I especially loved the Egyptian and Asian sections, as well as the section on Impressionism. The fact that it's free on Sunday was an especially",
          "We had no idea what a remarkable museum this is - the architecture, the collections, the intimacy of the galleries, it all was a pleasant surprise. Definitely should be a \"must see\" when visiting Providence. And don't rush - plan to stay for a few hours.",
          "Sunday is \"free\" day at the RISD Museum, so it was perhaps more crowded than on a pay day, but we never felt crowded. The Benefit Street entrance leads into an early-19th century house, with many rooms of antique furniture and accessories. The North Main Street side has more",
          "Check out this gem in the heart of Providence, and make sure to take a peek during their monthly free days Admission is free every Sunday (10 am\u20135 pm) and on the third Thursday evening of each month (5\u20139 pm).",
          "Took the advice of our fellow TA'S and with a raining weekend at hand explored the museum. The exhibits were well done and very interesting from glass to furniture to Impressionists to sculptures to mummies to Chuhuly to Greeks/Romans. The Cafe Pearl was small but the light",
          "Always enjoy seeing the work of designer disciplines! Has a great vibe. Spread out in the city. Close to Brown. Museum impressive.",
          "So many wonderful exhibits and so many locations throughout the Museum. Perfect anytime. Outstanding collection for a small local Art Museum. Worth gold as far as I am concerned.",
          "What a surprise to find such masterpieces in a college museum. We visited during renovations but found a huge collection of works in a large room with a string quartet playing and artists painting and sketching. Beautiful example of a working museum.",
          "They often have family museum tours and art classes on the weekend. It is a great place for families with children from about age 4 and up. They also have wonderful exhibits in the museum for all ages.",
          "We enjoyed the current Impressionist exhibit as well as the costume / fabric collection.. The attached historic home is very interesting.",
          "Nicely done museum, A little bit of everything. Impression paintings to dress design... even my husband enjoyed it. Nice coffee bar lunch area, reasonably priced. Sunday is free admission. Easy walk from most hotels. Would recommend to any traveler, even with kids.",
          "The interior of the museum was confusing and some of the exhibits were haphazardly displayed. The gift shop had the normal array of jewelry, books & art in difference mediums. Some of the RISD t-shirts were artful & funny.",
          "This is a great stop while also touring other city attractions and has something for everyone. The museum's collection is eclectic covering time from ancient to modern. I was fascinated by multi-media creations by RISD students. How far we have come from pencil on sketch pad!",
          "This museum was a wonderful surprise. An impressive and well curated collection in which to spend an hour or so. Interesting gallery spaces, welcoming staff at the front desk, and a vibrant store adds to the experience. Will stop in again when I am in Providence.",
          "The maze of the lay out reminds me of the streets in Boston. But I actually like that it makes it more fun to explore. The people working there are really helpful. They do not mind any and all questions. The different sections are laid out for easy viewing. I am not a big fan",
          "RSID museum has a wonderful collection of art from all over the world. The museum is assembled at a human scale, just enough of each type of art to get your interest.",
          "Manet, Monet, Renoir, Cassatt, Degas, Gaugin, Cezanne, Morisot. These artists' works are always a delight. We also toured the rest of the museum, but the impressionists were what we went there to see. Splendid works.",
          "- a small museum which makes it manageable and not overwhelming, yet contains beautiful representative pieces... Good break from seeing RSDI or Brown campus.",
          "You would think a School of Design could provide a decent map of its collections, but the one I got here was useless! I ended up wandering aimlessly through the galleries, which led to several great discoveries, not least a historic home with remarkable Rhode Island furnishings.",
          "Wonderful museum with a wide range of exhibits. We spent 2 hours here and it was a great experience. Definitely a must-see if you're in Providence.",
          "That's what she said. Really, though, I expected a small college museum with a few rooms and ended up with a whole afternoon worth of exploring both traditional and modern works. Nicely curated, and free on Sundays. I plan on going back!",
          "It's a bit confusing to navigate but elevators and friendly security guards were able to direct us to all parts of the museum. I most e joyed the Impressionists and fine sculptures. The museum is being updated but during renovations still excellent. The coffee shop is good too",
          "Great Art. Wonderful Bldg. & huge in size. I don't think one can appreciate the whole Bldg. in 1 visit. There is just too much to see. Open Late on Thursdays until 9pm. I love this place & I can't wait to visit again. Don't forget to visit the Gift Shop & buy some of the Artists",
          "Great stuff - extensive refurb on a number of floors so flow hampered slightly but some interesting and surprising stuff",
          "First a little caution: the museum is undergoing some renovations and so parts of the collection are unavailable now and there is some confusion in getting around, since a couple of areas are shut off blocking easy access. Nevertheless, the museum holds a very interesting range",
          "They have everything -it's a delight to wander through the beautifully and interestingly curated space.",
          "Would have liked to have stayed longer, but we arrived late in the afternoon. Much to see and enjoy from the 18th and 19th century paintings to the Greek and Roman antiquities. And it was all free! (on a Sunday)",
          "I've lived in walking proximity of the museum for a year and a half, and had never been in until today! I don't know what took me so long to visit this small, but great musuem. Home to one of the largest Buddah statues in America, this attraction houses many awe inspiring",
          "A delightful museum with a much larger collection than expected. It has a peculiar layout, combining perhaps three buildings, so that in order to exit the way we came in, we had to go up to the 4th floor and then down another elevator. Very enjoyable.",
          "Its amazing that most of the people that go to this museum are from out of the state visitors. Such a great museum that even local Rhode Islanders do not know about. It has a little of everything and the place is deceiving from the outside as the how big it is after you",
          "The museum has a little of a lot of styles of art. When we visited, it was undergoing renovation. Some floors were closed and it was a bit confusing to find our way around.",
          "My first visit to the RISD Museum really impressed me! The quality of the art was amazing for a small museum. The small rooms and the uncrowded atmosphere also made for a wonderful, relaxed visit.",
          "This museum offers such a variety of art and design from so many eras that there is bound to be something that appeals to everyone. I loved looking at sculpture, clothing, the old masters and modern furniture design then finding ourselves in a historic house. There are permanent",
          "The RISD museum has something for everyone. I was a particular fan of the decorative arts including the Chilhully chandelier and arts and crafts vases. The kids loved the colonial rooms and costumes.",
          "Lovely museum, its small size belies what a cornucopia of art treasures I saw here. Didn't expect so many greats. Everything from sublime Buddhist pieces (including one of the largest Buddha statues) to cool, Swedish minimalist furniture ....to textile and fashion pieces",
          "Whenever I'm in town, I check to see what the special exhibits are first...but often just wander among the permanent collection since it is full of unexpected treasures.",
          "We never expected to see such a wide variety of art in a college museum. From Egyptian to Roman to classical to contemporary, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Art had it all. The only thing missing was student artwork which was in the process of being set up. Friendly",
          "Please make a stop here you won't be disappointed! One of my favorite spots to go, mostly for the stories from the staff about the pieces they have. One of my favorites is about the owner of house walk through. They replicated a man's house I don't want to spoil anything just",
          "If design is an attractive issue for you, and you also like to see it in a historical perspective as well as in a global scale, you'll probably spend good time here. With various objects from Asia and Europe, a rich collection of post colonial US and a modest but striking",
          "I was fortunate to go to RISD back in the 1980's, while I was in school going to the museum was a perk. Now it's a treat, to go back, to see new acquisitions and shows. This is one of The MUST - go to places on a visitation list! To pass this by would be a cultural loss for",
          "This museum is not big, but it has some interesting exhibits. I like the sculptures and furniture exhibited in the museum, some of which are the work of RISD alums.",
          "The RISD Museum was always on my must see places to visit where it is only a 20 min., less than 14 mile drive from my home. The free Sundays from 10 am - 5 pm and free on street parking which can be a problem on Providence's College Hill anytime of the day or evening, plus a",
          "The free Thursday exhibits are fantastic and a great free night. The exhibits are as wonderful as any art museum!",
          "The RISD museum was being renovated so was a bit difficult to maneuver around. The displays were interesting and worth the visit. We enjoyed our time there.",
          "This museum was a great surprise! There were so many different exhibits covering ancient through contemporary art. Make sure you allow yourself enough time, you won't want to be rushed.",
          "Come for the classical artwork, stay for the history. This art museum has a bountiful collection of ancient and modern art. It has a 13 foot wooden Buddha the has awed children of all ages for years. it is an absolute must for lovers of art. And a pretty nifty gift shop to boot!",
          "I love the mixture of ancient art and contemporary exhibits. Eclectic and full of exciting art. I highly recommend it!",
          "This is one of my favorite places in Providence. I am sure people would be surprised to see that this little museum has a little bit of everything that you would otherwise have to travel the world to see. Mummies, a large Buddha, Picasso, an alter, various contemporary",
          "We visited the museum on a Sunday early afternoon, and it is a wonderful place! Lots of interesting exhibits, both artwork and sculpture, modern and not. Was not very busy, either. We didn't know this, but it is free every Sunday from 10 to 5. That was the icing on the cake!",
          "Excellent collection of art from masters and from the students of RISD. We were able to see a special exhibition that was spectacular. There are free exhibition days so be sure to check ahead, I believe in Sunday's.",
          "It is nestled into adjoining brownstones at the foot of College Hill and has a midsized collection spanning from the ancient to the modern era. Many major artists are represented. I love this little place!",
          "Been there twice, has modern art, paintings, antiques and furniture. compare with the size, they are really high quality collections. Museum itself also well designed, glass corridor connected two old buildings. Sunday free.",
          "This is a very interesting museum of art and design. Quite an eclectic collection ... well worth the time! The facility is a collection of buildings connected by enclosed bridges, which makes it a bit interesting to find your way around, but you will find great art pieces as",
          "This is a great place to spend a few hours while you are visiting Brown University or Providence. It is walking distance from downtown. and you can have lunch on historical Benefit St. Best kept secret free admission on Sundays. See the museum and eat at Korean restaurant one",
          "Beautiful museum with the recently added Bolt coffee cafe blends contemporary with historic architecture for a great variety of art genres.",
          "So many varied types of art and collections. There was something interesting at every turn. It would be helpful if there was actually a map of each floor, but this is a minor drawback to an otherwise fun and refreshing museum. If you have time to let yourself wander, you will",
          "You don't just visit the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD Museum), you allow it to envelop you. Stunning, diverse and cleverly curated. It is the quintessential university collection on steroids. The collections span ancient civilization in the east and west, contemporary",
          "So many great works in the permanent collection. The period rooms are a treat for small ones. all staff welcoming and informed. Not perfect for smallest amongst us but hey enjoyed the active booklet.",
          "The RISD Museum has different exhibitions and will interest many people. The museum is easy to get lost in (different interconnecting buildings). Staff is friendly and helpful. It is worth checking out if there are student exhibitions, we visited one which was nice.",
          "Excellent museum, with a wide selection of art available for viewing and interacting. Be sure to find the fabric section--and to ask for assistance in having them open drawers and bring out items you might not expect. Frequent lectures available, terrific new coffee shop with",
          "Have visited this museum many times for a wide variety of exhibits and film shows. Always innovative, exciting, varied, and pleasurable experience.",
          "its has allot and its free! Please make this a stop on your tour of the city. Its really a gem of a place and very very nice",
          "The designed items are one of a kind and amazing. The artwork includes many well known artists. A must see in Providence!.",
          "It would be a pity not to visit this smallish powerhouse of a museum if you are in Providence. While the museum is small compared to, say, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it packs in quite a variety of artwork, from Ancient Egypt and Asia to current trends in art and design.",
          "Nifty current impressionist show, Manet, Monet, others and some nice context. You do wander quite a bit when you're there and it's hard to understand the floor maps--mostly you don't believe them--but theyre accurate. No handout upon entry to know where the various exhibits are.",
          "This is a small art gallery in comparison to some of the Major museums but it has quality. The museum is compact and delightful.",
          "Their present show on \"Impressionism\" was worth the visit alone. But also don't miss their ancient artifacts.",
          "Around every corner, up every twisting staircase, up every elevator from floor 6 Egyptian, down to the Chace Plaza GS, you will find something surprising and enchanting. Loved the Nick Cave Sound Suit and the Chihuly glass work. The small but representative 'Inventing",
          "Love the museum store. Always can find a special gift at risd. What a Rhode Island treasure to gave so much talent.",
          "You won't be disappointed here. This is museum that perhaps is not well know, but worth every minute spent here. I particularly like the Egyptian items which I was first exposed to many decades ago.",
          "The best museum in Providence very good made and the collection is not so big but really interesting. Is a must when you are in Providence.",
          "There is something for everyone in this museum, from ancient Rome to Rothko, old and new. I recommend exploring the \"house\" part of the museum.",
          "If you're an art lover in Providence, this is the place to be. I was left in awe with every artist displayed there! (Monet, Van Gogh, Picasso) and the curatorship was absolutely beautiful! They close at 5pm, and we got there an hour before so we didn't have time to see",
          "I had read about this museum on TripAdvisor and was inspired to visit because of the reviews during a recent business trip to Providence. The museum lived up the reviews and did not disappoint! The museum is deceptively large and has some really great pieces. Admission was",
          "We happened to catch the Todd Oldham exhibit and WOW would be an understatement.. check out their website for current exhibits and times when they offer free admisssion.. Parking in the area is metered and there are a couple of nearby lots... definitely worth a visit",
          "Many Museums can be overwhelming and mentally exhausting like the Metropolitan Museum in New York, which is amazing, but takes virtually 4-5 days to truly explore. This museum is effective yet just the right amount of size that it doesn't feel as overwhelming as other museums",
          "This Museum has an extremely varied and eclectic collection. Modern Art, Colonial Art, Egyptian collection, Furniture, etc.etc.etc. It's housed in several interconnected buildings. One of the best small museums we have ever been to..",
          "MUST SEE: the buddah room and the portrait gallery. Great little cafe down below serves fantastic coffee and snacks. Check out any specialty exhibits - always worth the trip!",
          "This museum was highly recommended by family and it did not disappoint. There is art from Egypt, Rome, Asia and rooms completely set up with historical American furnishings. There is also contemporary art and design, as well as a student gallery. The museum winds its way",
          "The collections are wonderful, with plenty of work from artists who are not old white men, and not completely overwhelming. The art of RISD students is amazing.",
          "Great Egyptian, Greco-Roman collection,Medieval and Renaissance,Impressionism, Modern and Contemporary collections with conferences and guided tours. Has beautiful views of Providence skyline in the middle of historical College Hill.",
          "I was on a recent business trip in Rhode Island and decided to swing by the RISD Museum of Art. The entry fee is $12 and it takes about an hour to hour and half to get through the museum. You could spend more time if you wanted to read all of the information or listen to the",
          "Lots of important works and artfully arranged in an interesting maze of old and new building. Check out the Do Ho Suh wallpaper (art) in the cloakroom at the back entrance.",
          "That tells it all and explains the confusing layout that extends over multiple buildings that are on a steep hill. So the entrance level into the first floor of the historic mansion is on the third (I think) floor of the museum. That said, it's an imaginative museum with",
          "Excellant collection of fashion exhibited at the museum! RISD is such a fascinating campus to visit.",
          "I was so impressed with the depth of this collection. There is something for everyone here: textiles, porcelain, furniture, sculptures as well as Monet, Degas, Braque, Picasso, Warhol and the rest of the more well known artists. This place would hold the interest of many.",
          "Stunning collection of European Art which we were interested in. Lovely fashion exhibit too. Cafe a bit sparse but nice food.",
          "We had been recommended to go here by our Airbnb host - a great choice! For a museum on a small site there is so much to see - we ended up going back on a separate day as there were things we had not been able to look at and other items that we wanted to see again. There are",
          "Located right on Benefit street, this museum is within walking distance of some of the last few free places to park in the city. This was our first time visiting the museum and we had no idea what to expect. We thought, perhaps, that we would be seeing the art and fashion",
          "Three linked museums; one general museum with stuff from ancient Egypt to modern times, one period house and one of modern art. A very pleasant couple of hours",
          "I have been going to the RISD Museum since the 1980s, and go several times a year. The regular collections - the big wooden Buddha, and the Egyptian exhibits (which are impressive, and include a mummy), and the incredible first-floor gallery of portraits and landscapes - are",
          "You wouldn't expect much since there's not much to see from the outside. We got free admissions from Bank of America but it's apparently free on Sundays. There's is a fair amount of abstract pieces and of course industrial designs and textiles. The Rennaisance art collection is",
          "A nice way to spend a couple of hours. It's right on Benefit Street. The gift shop as a lot of things that have been designed by RISD grads, some which you might have seen in stores, but many which are not ones you will usually find at your local Target.",
          "I was thoroughly blown away to enter rooms filled with Claude Monet's and Vincent Van Gogh's paintings! The docent was very knowledgeable and shared the rich history of how the museum acquired such fine paintings for it's collection! We were very grateful to have learned so",
          "A wonderful collection of Ancient, European, Early American , American , and Modern Art and Design .",
          "A solid good museum with a good collection. The focus is largely on furniture and we enjoyed the Todd Oldham collection. While this collection ended last week, you will not be disappointed by the other exhibits. Plan on spending 1-2 hours here and it certainly is worth it.",
          "Just dropped in and would like to have spent more time. Easy to get to if you are staying in the downtown and touring by foot.",
          "I have been twice and would love to go more often. It is such manageably sized museum with a large variety of exhibits. I have stars in my eyes from having just seen Todd Oldham's fashions on special exhibit. Truly spectacular. I was fortunate to make it there on the last day.",
          "Loved this place and I do not care for museums in general. A nice varied collection and very nice informative staff.",
          "This is a beautiful museum with a nice variety of items on display, from Egyptian artifacts to paintings by the masters to a replica of a colonial home including furnishings, porcelain items and silver. Beautiful! And free on Sundays!",
          "A reasonably sized museum, with a variety of pieces. It mainly focuses on furniture, but it includes paintings. It is bigger than expected. Reasonably priced at $12.",
          "RISD Museum does not belong to the citizens of RI, it is an extension of Rhode Island School of Design, therefore a Museum accessible to both the community and legions of visitors who visit the city of Providence. Unlike the great Museums of the world, like the MET in NY City,",
          "The RISD museum was a delightful surprise. They had a fabulous Todd Oldham retrospective when we were there and it was an amazing array of beautifully displayed \"costumes\" from this high fashion designer. Unfortunately this exhibit closes on September 11, 2016, but if you can",
          "From the outside, especially entering near the cafe, it doesn't seem like the museum will be like much. Boy were we wrong. This museum was HUGE and easy to get lost in (but in a good way!!). It contained a variety of materials, exhibits, and more! We had such a great time.",
          "The price is just right with this place and with some pieces by Van Gogh and Picasso definitely worth the visit. The security guards were a bit overzealous but I can understand with some of the loud and clueless patrons that were there.",
          "Providence is small. It's art museum is also small. Having said that, this museum has wonderful amount of art both contemporary and historical. I am never disappointed when I visit. Another wonderful thing is that they offer free membership to artists who live in Rhode Island.",
          "This is a beautiful art museum. The giant blue room with all of the paintings is outstanding! If you visit on Sunday, the admission is for free! What a better and relaxing way than to complete any weekend trip or adventure with a free exploration of the powerful art within!",
          "The RISD Museum has wonderful exhibits, and the current fashion extravaganza is no exception. The galleries are great space and the curatorial staff are superb. However, be patient as the organization of the collection is a bit hodge podge.",
          "With all the wonderful reviews this museum got I was excited for my visit. Parking is impossible. If you are trying to locate handicapped parking, there wasn't any available. There is a lot you can park in and pay over $20, but with a wheelchair finding handicapped entrance",
          "Wonderful place to take the kids. We went Sunday because it was free and the kids loved it. So much different art work, the kids had a ball",
          "I love the Rhode Island School of Design Museum. It is an excellent small museum that you can visit in a couple of hours. It is on a different scale from the NYC museums like the Met, the Guggenheim or the MOMA or the Boston Museum of Fine Arts but if you are visiting Provi, it",

          "This is a really cool museum with some world class art and artifacts. I've been by it many times, but never knew it would be so good. Great staff and gift shop too. Very manageable if you are on a tight schedule and definitely worth the trip.",
          "A great range of art from Egyptian to modern art. Quite a few famous artists paintings as well as Rodin sculptures. Also the fashion exhibition was very interesting by Todd. Layout can be tricky to navigate but it was well worth the effort",

          "This museum was free with a military ID. It was hard to find free parking, but once inside this was an world-class museum. The exhibits had detailed placards for every object and they were not crowed. We saw the temporary exhibit \"All of Everything Todd Oldham Fashion\" which",
          "The RISD museum is small and can be covered in about an hour if you are not stopping to sketch or rest. Their space and their collection are both outstanding, Tends to run to contemporary art, which is right up my alley, but they have an interesting mix as well.",

          "An amazing Todd Oldham exhibit was on while we were there. I'm not all that into fashion, but this was truly spectacular. However, the student gallery was tremendous. Make sure you visit while in Providence. You can be in and out in under an hour, as well.",
          "More than I expected. Art from around the globe and from every time period. I especially love the big blue room full of paintings. Cute gift shop where some serious damage could be done if you don't practice self control! But also a good place to find special gifts.",
          "Wonderful selection of artistic styles and antiquities, but a little disappointed at the lack of more modern sculptures. The layout of he floors and accessibility of the elevators/levels is very confusing. It is definitely worth the price of admission as there is so much to see!",
          "I was surprised at how much this museum has to offer. Thoroughly enjoyed walking thru with the kids for about 2 hours.",
          "The RISD has such a great reputation that I was a little disappointed. They have a fine arts museum, and were showing avant-garde works by students and a fashion designer with roots in Turin, Italy. But, I wanted more. I wanted their store to be like the MOMA's in NYC. Full of",
          "I wish we could have spent several more hours at this wonderful museum. It is a great balance between works of RISD alums and other artists. It is bigger than I thought it would be. We will go back.",
          "As my personal expectation and as a designer myself, I was hoping for a more contemporary exhibit, but the building is gorgeous (albeit difficult to navigate inside, even with the map), and the different exhibits were interesting. Nice checking the gift shop on our way out! Went",
          "A great museum - not overwhelming but expansive. They have great selective works from major artists from every era. Free on Sunday.",
          "I loved visiting this museum as a child and spending time in the Buddha room enjoying the peacefulness. Coming back as an adult is wonderful, too; the museum has expanded considerably and hosts amazing exhibits, like this summer's Todd Oldham retrospective.",

          "I took my niece (12) to RISD Museum because they had a fashion display. Knew she'd love it, and she did. But she also loved the furniture and interiors. She was especially attracted to the minimalist and arts and crafts tables. That was surprising to me. She walked out of",

          "Nothing much to add. I have said it all but I appreciate the reviews. A major drawback in this museum is the lack of seating in the special exhibit. They had some great videos and no where to sit and watch. I got tired and left after seeing some American decorative arts b",

          "Had no idea his was so expansive; we scheduled a few hours, but there are actually about 5 distinct museums buildings connected together. We spent as long as we could until we were all so hungry we had to leave for our lunch, which ended up so late we didn't bother with",

          "We were in Providence for the day and stopped in here, this is a great museum with a surprisingly good number of paintings etc for a college museum. The Todd Oldham show was also great if you can see it before it closes in Sept. also nice to walk around the campus area.",
          "We arrived at RISD and were pleasantly surprised at the breadth of the collection. The docents were knowledgable. The cafe was also very nice. Take time to go to the student collections. There is a nice museum store but the better shopping experience is at the art materials",
          "The RISD museum has an amazing collection, everything from Old Masters and Impressionist paintings to Asian art and \"decorative\" arts, including some masterpieces of design. It is not a huge museum -- you can indeed see it all on one long-ish visit -- but allow at least a few",

          "I had read the reviews, but I felt like many were lukewarm...this museum is awesome! As a fan of fashion, I can truly say that the Todd Oldham exhibit is the BEST museum exhibit E-VER. As a Buddhist, the Rockefeller Asian Art Gallery was fabulous! The silver exhibit was",

          "The museum was very nice, but the natural history or children's museums would've better choices. The front desk was very helpful.",

          "This museum was full of quality pieces, both historic and modern. The period house in the middle was particularly fun! The museum had a very confusing layout, and the only map provided was conceptual, rather than a literal floorplan, which would have been helpful.",

          "Beautiful and peaceful. Just the change of pace we needed while keeping up with our son, a graduate student at the school next door. It was Spring Break for them, so we had a bit more flexibility of moving about the campus. And while we visited same time last year, the mood was",

          "I love art museums, especially small-scale museums at colleges/universities. I did not fall in love with this one, though. That may say more about my frame of mind at the time than the museum itself, however. It costs $12 for admission. There is a mix of contemporary art,",
          "I have always liked artsy things. When I taught school, the fourth grade trip was to RISD. It was fabulous! The docents are so nice, and for the most part they are great with kids. The exhibits change regularly, so if you were there last year there will be something new to",

          "This museum is on the medium-small side, but it's collection is solid. What it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality (pardon the cliche). One of the great perks of its size is that the art seems more palatable-- it doesn't feel overwhelming or heavy, and you don't have",

        "wiki": "WaterFire is an award-winning sculpture by Barnaby Evans presented on the rivers of downtown Providence, RI. It was first created by Evans in 1994 to celebrate the tenth anniversary of First Night Providence, and has since become an annual public art phenomenon.\nWaterFire is simultaneously a free public art installation, a performance work, an urban festival, a civic ritual, and a spiritual communal ceremony, well known nationally and internationally as a community arts event. WaterFire's symbolism and interpretation is both inclusive and expansive - reflecting the recognition that individuals must act together to strengthen and preserve their community.On WaterFire evenings, downtown Providence is transformed by eighty-six anchored burning braziers (each with approximately 33 pieces of wood) that float just above the surface of the rivers that flow through Waterplace Park (the Woonasquatucket river) and the middle of downtown Providence (the Moshassuck and Providence rivers). The public is invited to come and walk the riverfront and enjoy the beauty of the flickering firelight, the fragrant scent of aromatic wood smoke, the changing silhouettes of the volunteer firetenders, and the music from around the world. \nAverage attendance is 40,000 a night, ranging from 10,000 to 100,000.  WaterFire is presented for free, with only ten percent of the funds needed to host WaterFire acquired through governmental means and the remainder coming from private and corporate donations. WaterFire is held May through November, with lightings typically on Saturday evenings once or twice a month.\n\n\n== WaterFire Providence ==\nWaterFire Providence is the independent 501(C)(3) non-profit arts organization responsible for presenting WaterFire. WaterFire Providence consists of about 15 staff members and relies heavily upon volunteers for the production of WaterFire. On a given night, up to 160 volunteers make the entire event possible.\n\n\n== History ==\nEvans created the first WaterFire, named First Fire on New Year's Eve 1994 as part of the tenth annual of First Night Providence. First Fire consisted of 11 braziers on steel tripods stretching from WaterPlace Basin to Steeple Street.  In June 1996, Barnaby created Second Fire for the Convergence Art Festival and the International Sculpture Conference.Through the support of dedicated volunteers, WaterFire returned as a seasonal event.  WaterFire gained regional attention and a coordinated effort to fund the project began.  In 1997, WaterFire expanded to 42 braziers, and had an estimated attendance of 350,000 people over the entire season.  Evans received The Renaissance Award for his effort to revitalize downtown Providence, and WaterFire became the symbol of the city's renaissance.\nFor the 1998 installation, WaterFire expanded to include 81 fires, with expansions up the Moshassuck River and into the basin at Waterplace Park.  WaterFire now enjoys national and international renown.\n\n\n== Proliferation ==\nIn June 1998 Barnaby Evans installed WaterFire in Houston, Texas on the Buffalo Bayou.\nIn July 2005 Barnaby Evans designed a WaterFire installation in Columbus, Ohio, called WaterFire Columbus. http://www.waterfirecolumbus.com\nIn 2007, Barnaby Evans created a new installation in Kansas City, Missouri on Brush Creek near Country Club Plaza and the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art https://countryclubplaza.com/event/waterfire/.\nOn September 24 and 25, 2011, Barnaby Evans installed WaterFire in Singapore.  The flame from Singapore was sent electronically to Providence to light WaterFire there.  The next day, the flame from Providence was sent electronically to Singapore to light WaterFire there.\nOn September 21 and 22, 2012, Barnaby Evans installed WaterFire in Rome on the Tiber River between Ponte Sisto and Ponte Giuseppe Mazzini on the Vatican side of the river near the old city.\nIn August 2013, Barnaby Evans designed a WaterFire installation in Sharon, Pennsylvania on the Shenango River, called WaterFire Sharon. http://www.waterfiresharonpa.org\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWaterFire website\nWashington Post travel article by Carlo Rotella\nThe Butterfly Effect blog entry about WaterFire\nthisplaceiknow.com entry for WaterFire",

          "This is an entertaining, unique event. The night we went was very hot and lighting the fires only added to the misery. We had to move away from the river because of the heat. Would like to go back on a cooler evening. I am sure it would be much more enjoyable.",
          "We went the first night when it was set up for the full stretch of the canal. It was beautiful and the music was so calming. They had people entertaining on the boats going by as well as the walk along the event. Actors in statue form were really interesting, fun to watch. Food",

          "First time and what a unique time we had. Though crowded there is plenty of walking room to get to a perch where you can see the fires burn on the water. Music adds to the atmosphere. Next time we'd love to try a boat or gondola ride. The vendors were selling unique crafts",
          "A nice night to walk the river, see the vendors, sit and relax. Music and lightning of lanterns/fire pits. Was expecting more as far as the fire display itself but that's just me. Certainly brings out a large crowd for Providence. Nice family event.",
          "Went with my daughter to WaterFire not expecting much. Wow, was I wrong. What a neat event with a calendar for the year! The beautiful night was enhanced by the fires on the water. What a hidden gem for Providence~!",

          "We visited the weekend before Veterans Day so there was an event to honor those who have and continue to serve our country. It was windy and a cold but we bundled up and enjoyed the evening! We listened to some of the speeches at the Capitol and then wondered down to the River",
          "Waterfire will be the highlight of any trip to Providence. There is just no describing the experience. Make sure to get there early to save a spot though!",
          "This is an enchanting experience. They pipe in opera music to the streets, and there are roaming performers as well. I love WaterFire!",

          "As a native of Rhode Island, and as someone who lives 10 minutes away from where this event occurs, you may think I'd be there each weekend, given how many positive reviews it has. Not the case. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine event. There's plenty of music, art, all sorts of",

          "Went a few times to see WaterFire, and although the first time was incredible to see, it is not something I would yearn to do more than once, unless you date different people frequently and want to see their enjoyment on that first visit. They basically light flames along the",

          "It is obvious that much planning goes into this event. We went 11/10/18 with special tribute to Veterans. It was very chilly and windy, otherwise would have been a great time. Was surprised at the large crowds on such a cold evening. I am not a City person and don't like",
          "Went on a Saturday night in September. It was Breast Cancer night. Very nice event. I'm not big on crowds, so it was a little unnerving. I will probably go back, but on some other night with no special event.",
          "This is one of Providence\u2019s most romantic things to do and couple it with dinner and you have a home run",
          "Went out to dinner for family birthday at the mall and walked over to the water fire. It was a beautiful night. I had never been and I enjoyed myself very much. Hope to go back again.",
          "An iconic signature event that is a must! Music, atmosphere, crowds, fire that casts amazing light on everyone & the city too, the wonderful aroma of burning logs. Stroll along the waterfront or take a gondola ride. You won\u2019t forget this experience.",
          "Iiving in Providence makes attending these events very easy but its worth a trip to watch a FULL lighting. Several food carts but I\u2019d caution the pricing is high so make reservations near by and then come to the show.",

          "This is something that was a first for me. The city of Providence has done something very right with the Water Fire. They have installed fire pits above the water in the river. During certain times of the year, they light up a fire on each of these fire pits creating a",
          "I don\u2019t see what the big deal is. They light a bunch of different fires in fire pits in the water. I thought there was going to be a show or something cool happen with how good the reviews were but a couple of people on boats playing with fire. And a boat going around adding",
          "We went last year over the Veteran's Day Holiday and loved it. Not only was it beautiful, but it was quite moving and brought me to tears. Highly recommend seeing it at least once.",
          "Website made it rather unclear about where to go, how long the event would last, or that vendors would have food and alcohol available. Event itself was pretty cool!",
          "We went when they were lighting the basin only and is was cool to see but not really a show. It\u2019s just some people in a boat lighting some wood on fire slowly. Cool for something to do if you don\u2019t have anything else. Maybe the larger lighting is better?",
          "I had been wanting to go there for years, finally scheduled it and booked a room downtown to stay over night. The event is quite something, nothing like I had pictured in my mind. It must be seen to be appreciated. The waterfire appeals to all senses, the smell of burning",
          "If you can time your visit to providence ri to see this then do it \ud83d\udc4d we had a superb evening at this event which was busy but not overly busy. There\u2019s much more to see/do than the water fire and the park has craft stalls and food trucks nearby and the state building also had",
          "We were not prepared for the moving experience we had. We attended a tribute by the Gloria Gemma Foundation. It included a performance by the State ballet, moving speeches, the State House lit in pink, and 150 cancer survivors and family members in a parade of torches to the",
          "Just a beautiful sight. The buildings were lit up and the boats moving through with fire performers on them were so unique. It's a must see!",
          "We were in town and didn't even know this event was happening. So glad we had a chance to experience this. It was a very festive atmosphere and everyone was so friendly.",
          "The Waterfire was really cool. The music they played and the lighting of the flames felt very ceremonious. There was a crowd but it was not rowdy. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. We look forward to returning next year.",
          "We planned our visit to Providence around this event. It was a full lighting of all of the Waterfire braziers, 80 I think. It is held in Water Place park right downtown and extends down the river to Memorial Park. They have different sponsors for each of there lightings",
          "This was an amazing experience! I had heard about this years ago, but finally was able to see it and it was so well worth it. It was the Celebration of Life - Breast cancer survivors and about 150 survivors and family held torches and walked down to the water with them, with",
          "My wife and I came to the WaterFire event for September 29 as a part of a short trip to RI from NY. We saw the event from 6:30 through 8:30. The event itself is very good and well designed. There was some additional activity in the park nearby that was interesting as well.",
          "Annual event held in Providence inviting science enthusiasts. The fair has booths showcasing magic of physics so kids can enjoy. Great river beside this has gondolas and wonderful small bridges. Must visit if you are in Providence for an evening stroll.",
          "Everyone told us we would love it and they were correct. Everything about this event makes you smile. Awesome bonfires on the river, street performers, music, food, vendors. Will definitely return and book one of the gondola rides.",
          "I have been looking forward to viewing WaterFire for years! We arrived late (after the show was already lit) and friends who were there right as it started said that aspect of it was breathtaking. We were late because of a show at PPAC, so be sure to check their schedule, too,",
          "We book the tour of the WaterFire and it was amazing. I told the guide they should charge much more than $10 with all the information we received. It makes you appreciate the WaterFire a lot more. Book way in advance. The tours sell out. Our guide was very knowledgeable on",
          "So Beautiful! Lovely place to visit. Would definitely go to see this again. For all ages to see. Wish there wasn't so much litter in the water",
          "The whole of Providence comes to see this and for good reason. It's amazing. I had no idea; friends told me they wanted to see this and I had no expectations. It was very crowded but everyone was in good spirits, excepting the occasional crying baby/child. If you are in the",
          "If you haven\u2019t gone, do it. A medieval and contemplative experience, just stroll and absorb the atmosphere. Thank you Barnaby Evans.",
          "This was our first trip to Waterier and we were blown away. It is an Art exhibit which is exceptional. We started our evening watching the lighting from one of the bridges. A gong sounds, music starts playing and boats Come along and start lighting the bonfires on the water.",
          "Waterfire is a unique Saturday evening late Spring to early fall Providence experience. It draws large family and date crowds and feels very safe. The music track is always enjoyable and the quality of the sound system is second to none. I always like to walk the entire loop",
          "We just happened to hear about this and am so glad we did. Go early to see whatever entertainment is happening before the lighting. We saw an exhibition of Capoeira which is an Afro-Braziliian combination of dance and defense. The lighting of the fires was impressive. Be",

          "WaterFire is such a relaxing, enchanting experience. I forget how unique it is until I bring someone from out of town. The combination of the curated playlist, the vision of the torches, the street art, and the yummy food make it a thoroughly enjoyable event. It is also worth",

          "We saw the water fire this past Saturday. It was our first time. It was amazing. Very beautiful. We will definitely be back!",
          "We love Waterfire and have been several times over the last few years. It\u2019s busy but a nice, relaxing time. The crowd is pretty mellow for the most part. You can choose to sit by the water and watch the fires or walk around to the many booths they have. There are public",
          "Disappointing. It's cool to see the fires lit in the water at night, but nothing really happens or changes throughout the 3+ hours. You can buy a ride in a gondola to ride around the water, but as a spectator, there's not much to it. Would not go there again.",
          "Always a fun way to spend a summer Saturday evening... Amazing how much this even has grown over the years.. super family event that for all ages..",
          "This was so much fun, something totally different to do on a nice summer day. the fire was impressive, the crowd large and enthousiastic, and the atmosphere very friendly. Loved it",

          "This is definitely Providence\u2019s signature event. It happens (more or less) every other Saturday night from May to October, and it\u2019s just really cool to see the fires being lighted along the river. It\u2019s easier to understand from being there in person than reading a review, but",

          "We happened to be in Providence on a beautiful day in late August and were told by our AirBnB hosts that the WaterFire would be happening that night. What a great way to spend an evening. I have traveled extensively in Europe and the US but have never seen anything similar in",
          "We finally were able to come see this event and it was well worth it. We did the walking tour prior to the start and it really tied all of it together. I would recommend the tour to anyone seeing this for the first time.",
          "Had a nice time with the family. Fire Festival with Japanese Drum Festival. It was bit crowded but manageable.",

          "GF lives in Boston, so I love to show her all the cool PVD stuff. Her take is that PVD is way cooler than Boston. Hee hee. I sometimes wonder why we go out- GF and I. We both tend to have high anxiety/panic attacks in crowds. Yet we both love to go out, try new things, hang",
          "A place yo have a stroll and relaxing time. Nice cafes and restaurants for a good meal and good deals.",

          "We were vacationing in Rhode Island and several people had told us that a must-do activity was to see the WaterFire in downtown Providence. We had no idea what to expect because we hadn't seen any photos or done much research, but we figured we should check it out. It was very",
          "Each time we go to water fire, it's just an amazing experience! Even though there are thousands of people, it still lends itself to a romantic feeling. Many different events going on, vendors, music, gondola rides, street music and instrument players all add to the ambiance.",

          "We had a chance to watch waterfire show. It was amazing. It was on July 28, 2018 and we were fortunate to be around. Besides the show, there were many activities like live music show, restaurants, Stalls from Alpert medical school, Brown University and many more. The city was",
          "In a sense, it's a non-event event that leaves you feeling quite satisfied. Mood music, sense of community, cool vibe, artsy, & uniquely Providence. Waterfire rocks.",
          "Came here earlier last month to see one of the fires and it was BREATHTAKING the whole city was together by the water basin and got to see the magical event. We can\u2019t wait to come back again for the next one!",

          "Great event as couples,families with children . Can be very busy but you can still move about. Classic event in Providence .Many vendors from food ,beverages and you name it. Best to start at Waterbasin for initial lighting , then move about.",
          "There's lots of little nooks and crainies to the water park area in downtown Providence. You truly don't get a grasp of the beauty unless you take the time to check it out. Great little cafes and restaurants nearby. Worth checking out for an hour or so.",
          "As an out of town visitor attending a conference, this was a neat experience to see. Be prepared for a very large crowd. There are vendors set up in various locations for treats, eats and art purchases.",
          "Dancing, and music and performance art abound. The city comes to life. It's a really special evening.",
          "I love to visit Waterfire every few years. It really is an amazingly beautiful experience. My latest trip was a few weeks ago and the weather was perfect to whisk the smoke away (unlike some nights we have gone) and just enjoy the fires and the music. The crowd was huge this",
          "Nothing like it anywhere else in the world. It\u2019s beautiful, enchanting and a wonderful experience. The lightings began as a Rhode Island School of Design art project and blossom into what it is today. Each lightning has unique features depending on the theme. The city goes out",
          "Tour and guides were great and I learned a lot! However we took the 7pm tour and there was no \u201cspots\u201d left for us at the end of the tour as indicated in its advertisement, as the tour group before ours (and others) took all the available spots and basically we were told \u201csorry",
          "We attended the waterfire show from one of the local event centers. The whole area gets completely packed and it's difficult to navigate the area right before the show. The show is literally lighting piles of wood on fire. Seriously. That's it. Yes, it's pretty but I can't",
          "After a wedding in Providence, my husband and I walked the WaterFire show around 11:30 p.m. The setting is beautiful, and the music paired with the WaterFire makes for such a serene, romantic atmosphere. There were many people around the canal, but we certainly feel it was too",
          "Been meaning to meet up with friends here for many years, but the weekends never seemed to match up. So glad we planned this, no wonder thousands of people come to watch and help. And there was a Jeopardy question on it two days later that none of the contestants could answer!",

          "Slightly not what I expected (I was expecting some sort of light show or something) but it's literally bonfires on the water. It goes from about 8:40 until past midnight. It is beautiful to watch the fire crackle on the water. They have performances throughout the night.",
          "Absolutely so beautiful! Highly recommend going atleast once! The music is also beautiful and piped in all along the river. Great place for date night or families! With lots of restaurants surrounding it so you can have a bite to eat and then walk the water fire.",

          "As advertised, this nightly spectacle is a sight to behold! The sheer largesse of this coordinated effort to illuminate the night was downright impressive!",
          "This is a wonderful event if you enjoy the arts and downtown Providence. Walking along the bonfire lit canals while music is being played through what must be an amazing sound system is very relaxing. There are all sorts of food vendors and you can even grab a Del's lemonade :)",
          "This is a deeply spiritual experience. The quiet, the music, the fires are so beautiful and so sacred. Enjoy. Also, fine dining available.",
          "We were lucky enough to experience Waterfire aboard a gondola......amazing experience! Great gondolier. Very romantic and such a lovely evening.",
          "Amazing view on the water. The gondolas were unexpected and added to the ambiance. Had to wait a bit for the show but it was worth it.",
          "I really wasn't sure what water fire entailed and all the information I tried to get was minimal. The website wasn't working. So we just went. The only spectacle we saw was people in open boats lighting small \"bonfires\" all along the river, with piped in music. Also on the",

          "I have been to the Waterfire festival at least three times. The ambient in downtown alongside the river is beautiful and can host a lot of people comfortably. The festival consists of lighting the fire in the fire pits placed along the river. Some beautiful boats and Gondolas",
          "I never knew so many people could be so quiet to enjoy the classical music in the background as Gondola boats went up and down the Providence River surrounded by lighted torches, hence the name Waterfire! A very spiritual and relaxing experience to be enjoyed by so many and at",
          "We have been talking about doing this for many years and we finally made it happen! What a great event, so pretty to see all the wood fires burning lighting up the river! There are food vendors , music, merchandise street performers, but it is very crowded but providence as been",
          "It's hard to explain the feeling of community and celebration that comes over the city during Water Fire. People of all ages, shapes, and cultures come out to stroll along the river, ride in gondolas, listen to music, watch street performers, and watch the bonfires in the middle",
          "We visited here right before we left the city heading back home to Pa. It was a quiet Saturday morning. Nothing was going on but the loading of the fire pits in the water. Loved the Wall of Hope. Just taking the time to read all the tiles. Would have loved to have been here",
          "If you\u2019re in town for WaterFire go check it out. Very unique. Music, food and drinks. Gets crowded and there was lot of waiting around. We were there when the Portuguese President was there and got to meet him. Never could of imagined.... Uber there and back. No parking anywhere.",

          "This was a great cultural experience! We attended a full lighting and were mesmerized by the music, fire and water. It was great to have experienced this event. I would highly recommend planning a summer trip to providence around a lighting. It does get crowded, so make sure to",

You have to be there at least an hour before it starts and sit on the big blocks of stone around the lake part, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll have the best view. The place is packed but definitely worth it. They come with boats and light up",

          "Waterfire is one of the best things about Providence! It\u2019s so relaxing to walk around the river with the fires lit and listen to the music! If you\u2019re planning on visiting make sure you come on a Waterfire weekend!",
          "I highly recommend water fire to anyone coming into Providence for the night. It is a beautiful walk along the water with music and people watching. You can grab baked snacks or popcorn along the way as well as some wine for those that are 21+. Romantic environment for couples",

          "This is a wonderful FREE outdoor event that incorporates the river, fire, and music. There are vendors if you want food or beverages or you can just stroll the river and enjoy the music and fire and not spend a dime. It is well worth the visit and we come from Boston to see this",

          "It seems strange to think that lighting a batch of wood fires in the river would be a major event, but it works. The restaurants and universities help make the event an excuse for strolling along the river and listening to music. Stop by one of the better restaurants near the",
          "Whether you live in RI or you are visiting from out of town, don\u2019t miss Waterfire, a unique experience you won\u2019t have anywhere else. Each can be different with various entertainment, themes and music. Many different people come together to wander around enjoying it, all ages,",
          "I love the concept of waterfire but in reality, I find myself claustrophobic from the huge crowds and shuffling along the river front. I have attended this event several times and love the music and event spaces. Hard to get a reservation at the nearby restaurants so plan way",

          "So many things to see and do. If you are lucky, there is a great water and fire exhibition happening.",
          "How much fun this event is really depends on the week. Sometimes it's just the fire on the water, which makes for a fun walk downtown. Other weeks there are also concerts and lots of crafty vendors.",

          "The Waterfire event started in Providence in the 1990s and has been entertaining crowds ever since. The pots of burning wood, the water, the soundtrack, the jugglers, dancers and other performers... it ends up being quite a spectacle. To put it bluntly, people love it. It\u2019s a",
          "So when you first hear about WaterFire Providence, it can sound sort of odd. Go to a river and see them play music and light it on fire? Yes, do it! In short, it's good for the soul to be out and about with people from every walk of life, every age, every background where the",

          "We regularly go to WaterFire a couple of times each summer. We typically make reservations at one of the close restaurants and stroll around and enjoy the music and entertainment afterwards. They always have new entertainment performances that keeps it fresh. Highly recommend if",

          "Beautiful but crowded. I went for the Gloria Gemma Breast Cancer Fund Raiser night October 2017. It is beautiful, but very crowded. Try to catch a water fire on an off weekend. You can walk along the river. It is beautiful. Note there is some uneven cobblestone so plan your",

          "Waterfire is a must see for anyone visiting Providence. Beautifully lit fires along the river with classical music in the back round. Food/drink vendors along the way. Sit for a spell or walk the whole river. A must see.",
          "What a beautiful, poetic and pleasant experience. So glad to have seen it. We went in November when it was a tribute to veterans, I thought it was very tasteful and elegant when they towed unmanned row boats down the river representing fallen soldiers. Music was odd but added to",
          "This was an awesome event. We went to the last one of the season, near Veterans' Day- it was very moving- opening ceremony and launching of unmanned canoes to remember those that gave their lives for our county. The lighting of the fires is really something to see. The event",
          "We've gone many times over the years, and it has only gotten better. The veteran's lighting was very nice, so glad to see so many of our nation's heroes honored.",
          "Came for the Veterans Day salute, which is my favorite Waterfire of the year. Pre ceremony army band and a great place to sit on the hill in the basin area and picnic. The giant flag over the basin is also stunning- a very special event and perfect way to salute our troops",
          "Went for last installation of the season, the salute to veterans. It was amazing to see!! The lighting of the fires and the ceremonies were awesome.. I will say though that the smoke from the fires did get overwhelming after a while and left you feeling like you\u2019ve breathed in",
          "A gorgeous experience, between the food trucks and the entertainment you can\u2019t go wrong. To see the families out in an otherwise dangerous city is nice. Spaga a performer on one of the boats is multitalented, he is the ultimate performer.",
          "Maybe I'm bias, but the whole experience is just kind of dumb and the people that attend are just rude. Another thing is once you've seen this once, why would you ever go again.",
          "Arrive early it gets crowded. It was a fun gathering and something free to do for an hour or two one evening. It wasn't as expansive as I expected - there were some related merch tents and arts, etc. but a little less festival like than I expected.It is dog friendly (at least in",

          "We've been going to WaterFire since it's first display in 1994 as part of an art installation. When it first started hardly anyone attended. But that made it all the more intimate, with the smell of the fires, and the ethereal world music playing in the channel of the river.",

          "This is on me. We found ourselves in Providence and decided to stay for WaterFire. Although we enjoyed the full lighting event, I think I'm missing the continuous draw of thousands. The campfires on the canal along the walkway are cool to see. On this night, the URI sponsorship",

          "I spent a delightful evening September 3 ,in Providence,to see Water Fire for the first time. I've always wanted to go and finally made it. They have partial lightings but this one was a full lighting which I would recommend. Please be sure to be at the basin to see the lighting",
          "There could be more interactive activities/ or rides and games that people and kids could play. Also could have better signage to find food and have more street food options available",

          "We just happened to be in Providence for the last weekend of waterfire! What a special night it was. Wasn't to cold but had a nice warmth from the fires on the river. The fire alone was an attraction within itself but you had tons of street performers, small pop up shops selling",

          "The smoke is pretty intense in the air. Wonder what else they could burn that's eco-friendly but not so smoky. Big crowds but people are sweet. Nice to think about our Native American forefathers. This is the second time I tried to attend but had to leave because Of smoke.",

          "I couldn't believe the wood burning above the water was real. They have boats going around constantly replenishing the fires which are warm and enchanting. Live music is all around you and there is food and other items to buy. Park your car and walk around. Don't try to",

          "I am not sure what I expected, but I had been warned it wasn't \"kid friendly\". It was great! We didn't take our kids & probably wouldn't... but only because it isn't designed for kids. It is a quieter, more low-key, intimate setting (with a lot of people). Great date night!",

          "Finally made it. It was cold and dark and magical. So glad we went. We missed the lighting so planning to go back soon. Now that I know where it is (and it's not that hard to find) it will make getting there a little easier. But I think with more people the parking will not be",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect so I can't say I was disappointed with the show. It comprises a lot of bonfires floating on the surface of the river with music being piped in. Perhaps for those who grew up with this attraction, it holds special meaning. I was underwhelmed.",

          "I missed the actual lighting; so maybe that is the event? Otherwise, it was like 30 campfires on water with soft music playing. Interesting for about 5 minutes. Downtown around there was awesome. Ate in a brewery and had another pint in an Irish bar just off the river.",
          "This was our second time attending a Waterfire and we enjoyed every moment of it. Our first visit 10 years ago was impressive and somewhat better than the 2nd in 2016. We suspect its due to the timing of the event throughout the year. We will definitely try going during a",

        "wiki": "The First Baptist Church in America is the First Baptist Church of Providence, Rhode Island, also known as the First Baptist Meetinghouse.  It is the oldest Baptist church congregation in the United States, founded in 1638 by Roger Williams in Providence, Rhode Island.  The present church building was erected in 1774\u201375 and held its first meetings in May 1775. It is located at 75 North Main Street in Providence's College Hill neighborhood. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1960.\n\n\n== History ==\nRoger Williams had been holding religious services in his home for nearly a year before he converted his congregation into a Baptist church in 1638. This followed his founding of Providence in 1636. For the next sixty years, the congregation met outside in nice weather or in congregants' homes. Baptists in Rhode Island through most of the 17th century declined to erect meetinghouses because they felt that buildings reflected vanity. Eventually, however, they came to see the utility of some gathering place, and they erected severely plain-style meetinghouses like the Quakers.\nRoger Williams was a Calvinist, but within a few years of its founding, the congregation became more Arminian, and was clearly a General Six-Principle Baptist church by 1652.  It remained a General Baptist church until it switched back to a Calvinist variety under the leadership of James Manning in the 1770s. Following Williams as pastor of the church was Rev. Chad Brown, founder of the famous Brown family of Rhode Island. A number of the streets in Providence bear the names of pastors of First Baptist Church, including Williams, Brown, Gregory Dexter, Thomas Olney, William Wickenden, Manning, and Stephen Gano.  In 1700 Reverend Pardon Tillinghast built the first church building, a 400-square-foot (37 m2) structure, near the corner of Smith and North Main Streets.  In 1711 he donated the building and land to the church in a deed describing the church as General Six-Principle Baptist in theology. In 1736 the congregation built its second meetinghouse on an adjoining lot at the corner of Smith and North Main Streets. This building was about 40 \u00d7 40 feet square (i.e.1,600-square-foot (150 m2)).\nWhen it was built in 1774\u201375, the current Meeting House represented a dramatic departure from the traditional Baptist meetinghouse style. It was the first Baptist meetinghouse to have a steeple and bell, making it more like Anglican and Congregational church buildings. The builders were part of a movement among Baptists in the urban centers of Boston, Newport, New York, and Philadelphia to bring respectability and recognition to Baptists.\n\n\n=== Association with Brown University ===\nCentral to the movement for greater recognition and growth was the creation of an educated ministry and the founding of a college. The Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches sent Dr. James Manning to Rhode Island to found the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (later renamed Brown University) in 1764. Beginning in Warren, the college then relocated to Providence in 1770. The college president, the Reverend Manning, was called to be the pastor of the Providence church in 1771. During his ministry the present Meeting House was erected \"for the publick worship of Almighty God and also for holding commencement in.\"  Subsequent Brown presidents Jonathan Maxcy and Francis Wayland also served as ministers at the church.  \nThe Brown family that soon gave its name to the University were prominent members of the Church, and descendants of its founders and those of the Rhode Island Colony (the second pastor of the congregation after Roger Williams was Rev. Chad Brown).  Although the university is now secular, in honor of its history and tradition, the Meeting House continues to be used, as it has been since 1776, as the site of Brown University's undergraduate commencement.Construction began on the building in the summer of 1774, and it was the biggest building project in New England at the time.  Due to the closure of the Massachusetts ports by the British as punishment for the Boston Tea Party, out-of-work ship builders and carpenters came to Providence to work on the Meeting House.  The main portion of the Meeting House was dedicated in mid-May 1775, and the steeple erected in three days in the first week of June. \nNotable additions to the Meeting House have included a Waterford crystal chandelier given by Hope Brown Ives (1792), a large pipe organ given by her brother Nicholas Brown, Jr., the younger (1834); the addition of rooms for Sunday school, a fellowship hall, and offices on the lower level (1819\u201359), and an addition to the east end of the Meeting House to accommodate an indoor baptistery (1884). The building was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1960, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.\n\n\n== Today ==\n\nIn addition to weekly worship services, the Meeting House hosts concerts, talks, and lectures by world-renowned artists, performers, academics, and elected officials. Brown University holds commencement services of its undergraduate college at The Meeting House.\nIn 2001, History professor J. Stanley Lemons wrote a history of the church, entitled First: The History of the First Baptist Church in America\n\n\n== Affiliations ==\nThe First Baptist Church in America is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches of Rhode Island (ABCORI) and the  American Baptist Churches/USA (ABCUSA). The church actively supports the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches, the Baptist World Alliance, and the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. Many members have served in various denominational, academic, and divinity school positions, including the presidency of Brown University.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Settled ministers (sometimes simultaneous pastorships) ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of tallest buildings in Providence, Rhode Island\nOldest churches in the United States\nList of National Historic Landmarks in Rhode Island\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Providence, Rhode Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMeeting House info\nHistoric American Buildings Survey (HABS) No. RI-38, \"First Baptist Meetinghouse, 75 North Main Street, Providence, Providence County, RI\", 37 photos, 5 data pages, supplemental material\nSAH Archipedia entry",

          "We were rambling across the river and came across this impressive church. We went in at a time with no formal tour, but we were given literature and told how to got through. It was nice to be able to take it at our own speed and to appreciate the architecture and history. Nice",

          "Enjoyed seeing the building and getting a quick tour from the office staff. It was free and we were the only ones there, but it was so sad to see how far this church's theology has changed from the day of its founding. Worth seeing for the historical value, but prepare yourself",

        "wiki": "The Old State House on College Hill in Providence, Rhode Island, known also as Providence Sixth District Court House, Providence Colony House, Providence County House, or Rhode Island State House is located on 150 Benefit Street. It is a brick Georgian-style building completed largely in 1762. It was used as the meeting place for the colonial and state legislatures for 149 years.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom colonial times to the mid-19th century, the Rhode Island General Assembly rotated meetings between the state's five county court houses, and five of these former Rhode Island state houses survive today. In 1760 The General Assembly built the Old State House to replace an earlier wooden courthouse built 1730 on Meeting Street. It was largely finished by 1762 with some details being completed by 1771. Many of the Georgian architecture details were borrowed from the larger and more ornate Newport Colony House. Before 19th century alterations to the Providence State House, the two buildings resembled one another greatly. After 1853 the state legislature ceased meeting at Kent, Washington and Bristol county courthouses, but continued to alternate its sessions between here and the Newport State House in Newport into the early 20th century.\nThe building was extensively renovated and dramatically altered several times in the 19th century. The first of these occurred in 1835\u201336 and 1840, and consisted of rearrangement of large portions of the interior. It was again altered in 1850, when Thomas A. Tefft of Tallman & Bucklin added the large tower facing Main Street, and a reorganization of nearly the entire interior. In 1867 James C. Bucklin designed an addition on Benefit Street that nearly doubled the size of the building. Both of these additions were sympathetic to the building's original design. The building was refurbished in 1877\u20131883, to designs by Stone & Carpenter.The building served as the legislature's meeting place until 1901, when the new Rhode Island State House began being occupied. The building was completely finished in 1904, and it was decided to use the old building as a courthouse. Major internal alterations by Banning & Thornton were completed in 1906, and the building re-opened as the Sixth District Courthouse.\nAt the Old State House on May 4, 1776, the General Assembly declared its independence renouncing its allegiance to the British crown, and the date is now celebrated as Rhode Island Independence Day. Debates about slavery occurred in the building in the late 18th century. George Washington visited the building in 1781 and 1790. By 1901 the new Rhode Island State House was occupied on Smith Hill and the legislature vacated the Old State House.  The Old State House was used as a Court House until 1975 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and as part of the College Hill Historic Landmark District in 1971.\nThe building is now home to the Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission.\n\n\n== Layout ==\nAn open space hall for public meeting was located on the main floor and later became a courtroom.On the second floor was the House of Representatives and Senate chambers. Additional space was create for the Governor's and Secretary of State's offices.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Providence, Rhode Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMain Website at Preservation RIConley, Patrick T.; Jones, Robert B.; Woodward, William Ray (1988).

      "name": "Blackstone Park",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Blackstone is a predominantly residential neighborhood in Providence, Rhode Island.  It is in the northeast corner of the city and is bounded to the south and west by Lloyd Avenue and Hope Street respectively.  It is one of six neighborhoods comprising the East Side of Providence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBlackstone is one of the last parts of Providence to be developed, as the remoteness of its location and marshy land had precluded significant development before the late 19th century. It wasn't until construction of Blackstone Boulevard in 1894 as a means of reaching Swan Point Cemetery that the area saw extensive residential development.\nThe area was largely marshland, and the earliest road was Cat Swamp Lane followed the high ground. Several farms were located in the area during the 1700s, and a few farmhouses from that era remain.   In the late 1700s, several burial grounds were established in the remote western part of the city. Several of these by 1847 and 1858 became consolidated into present-day Swan Point Cemetery.\n\n\n=== Construction of Blackstone Boulevard ===\nBy the 1870s the cemetery was accessible by means of a public omnibus which journeyed by means of a winding zigzag road which ran along present-day North Main Street, Olney Street, Morris Avenue, Sessions Street, Cole Avenue, and Rochambeau. In 1886 the directors of Swan Point Cemetery hired landscape architect Horace Cleveland of Chicago to plan a road to improve access to the cemetery from the town of Providence. This road opened in 1894 as Blackstone Boulevard.Blackstone Boulevard became a catalyst for development in the neighborhood, spurring construction of single family homes which were \"architecturally distinctive\" from the rest of the city.  Between 1890 and 1923, property values along the Boulevard tripled, as the neighborhood became one of the most desirable and fashionable in the city.The 20th century saw institutional development in the form of Central Baptist Church, Temple Emanuel, and St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Blackstone neighborhood comprises the northeast corner of the East Side of Providence, between the eastern ridge of the Moshassuck River Valley and the western bank of the Seekonk River. Blackstone is primarily residential, and made up of mainly of single-family dwellings. It is one of the city\u2019s most affluent neighborhoods.\n\n\n=== Houses of Worship ===\nNotable religious institutions in the area include Temple Emanu-El, St. Sebastian\u2019s Roman Catholic Church and the Community Church of Providence (formerly Central Baptist).\nThe Community Church began as an offshoot of the First Baptist Church in America. The congregation originally was known as the Second Baptist Church, then Pine Street Baptist, and in 1917 opened at Lloyd and Wayland Street as Central Baptist. In 2003, the church became known as Community Church of Providence. Between 1917 and 2018 the building featured a large Tiffany stained glass memorial to Frederick W. Hartwell created by Agnes Northrop titled \"Light in Heaven and Earth.\" The complex work was considered \"one of the largest and finest landscape windows ever produced by Tiffany Studios,\" but largely overlooked in the community. In 2018, the church sold the window to the Art Institute of Chicago where it is undergoing conservation and preparation to be displayed prominently in September 2020 as the Hartwell Memorial Window.\n\n\n=== Brown University ===\n\nBrown University built several facilities in the neighborhood. Ladd Observatory was built in 1891 on the edge of the neighborhood at Hope Street and Doyle Avenue. In the 1920s Brown built several athletic facilities along Elmgrove Avenue, including Brown Stadium (1925), Aldrich Field (1925\u20141961),  and Marvel Gymnasium (1927\u20141989). Aldrich field was sold in 1961 and developed as a residential neighborhood, with streets named for Brown presidents Maxcy, Faunce, Barbour, and Wriston. Marvel Gym was closed in 1989 and demolished.\n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\n\nButler Hospital, located off Blackstone Boulevard, is Rhode Island's only private mental health hospital. Founded in 1844, the hospital offers psychiatric and substance-abuse treatment programs. The hospital was built in 1847 on the Richard Browne Farm at the end of Rochambeau Avenue. The building is a huge Gothic structure surrounded by landscaping, built according to the philosophy of the time to remove patients from the stresses of urban life to a rural setting.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\nBlackstone Boulevard Park is a green space between northbound and southbound lanes of Blackstone Boulevard. It consists of 19.3 acres (78,000 m2) of parkland and a 1.7-mile (2.7 km) jogging/walking path.\nLippitt Memorial Park is located at the intersection of Hope Street and Blackstone Boulevard near the Pawtucket border.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the Providence Plan,a local nonprofit aimed at improving city life, 92.5% of residents are white, well above the citywide average of 54.5%.Blackstone is one of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city with a median family income nearly four times that of the city and housing values more than doubling in recent years. The median household income is $87,727, and the median family income is $117,522. Only 1.1% of families live below the poverty line.The neighborhood is home to a significant Jewish population. The Jewish Community Center of Rhode Island was established on Elmgrove Avenue in 1971; later this merged with other communal organizations and became known as the Jewish Alliance of Rhode Island. The area is also home to the Providence Hebrew Day School on Elmgrove Avenue and Temple Emmanuel on Morris Avenue.\n\n\n== Government ==\nWard Two encompasses Blackstone, all of College Hill and Wayland north of Angell Street, and parts of Mount Hope. As of the 2018 elections, Helen Anthony, a Democrat, represents the ward in the City Council.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nProvplan.org Neighborhood Profiles\nNeighborhood Profiles at providenceri.com",

        "wiki": "Roger Williams Park is an elaborately landscaped 427-acre (173 ha) city park in Providence, Rhode Island and a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  It is named after Roger Williams, the founder of the city of Providence and the primary founder of the state of Rhode Island.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe land for the park was a gift to the people of Providence in 1872, in accordance with the will of Betsey Williams, the last descendant of Roger Williams to inherit his land. It had been the family farm and was the last of the original land granted to Roger Williams in 1638 by Canonicus, chief of the Narragansett tribe. The family farmhouse was built in 1773 and is now known as the Betsey Williams Cottage; the cottage and the Williams family burial ground (including Betsey's grave) are still maintained within the park.The original bequest consisted of about 100 acres. Additional land to the south was purchased in 1891 at a cost of $359,000, consisting mostly of unimproved land that was covered with woods and ponds; it brought the total area of the park to about 400 acres. The natural history museum opened in 1895.\n\n\n=== 2016 renovations ===\n\nThe Rhode Island Foundation began a renovation effort in the park in 2016 as a celebration of their centennial, beginning with the park's historic bandstand in December 2016. The renovations will expand to other park buildings and entrances. In June 2017, a dedicated bike and pedestrian lane was added to Frederick Green Memorial Boulevard as part of these renovations, although this change was opposed by some Cranston residents, including Cranston mayor Allan Fung.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe park contains seven lakes which comprise approximately 98 acres (40 ha), and it is located in the southernmost part of the city of Providence bordering the city of Cranston. It was designed by Horace Cleveland in 1878 and was constructed in the 1880s. Many of the roads, bridges, and sidewalks were built by the Works Progress Administration from 1935 to 1940. The National Trust for Historic Preservation called Roger Williams Park one of the finest urban parks in the US in their 2000 annual report.It contains:\n\nThe Roger Williams Park Zoo\nThe Roger Williams Park Museum of Natural History and Planetarium\nThe Roger Williams Park Botanical Center\nJapanese Gardens\nVictorian Rose Gardens\nThe Providence Police Department's Mounted Command center\nThe Dalrymple Boathouse and boat rentals\nhistorical tours\na Carousel Village\nThe \"Hasbro Boundless Playground\" which is accessible for handicapped children\nThe Temple to Music\nThe Roger Williams Park Casino\nmany miles of walking paths\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoger Williams Park Zoo, third oldest in the U.S., and one of the top 20 zoos in the country\nRoger Williams National Memorial, a distinct park in downtown Providence\nProspect Terrace Park, park located in Providence's College Hill neighborhood\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Providence, Rhode Island\n\n\n== Notes ==\nNote1  Her headstone name is spelled as \"Betsey Williams,\" but she has been mistakenly called \"Betsy\" through the centuries, as it appears on numerous articles, postcards, and books.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Roger Williams Park\".

          "Let me first state that I love the park, it has beautiful trees, waterways, plants, etc.... However, I had to give it a poor rating, as the Park should be friendly & inviting to everyone. The main concern is that many of the walkways do not have accessible ramps, leading to",

          "If you happen to be by the Providence area in the fall, you must check out the Rogers Williams Park. The fall leaves are a beauty in itself, but add on the columns, the bridges, the ponds and lakes. They also have a jack-o-lantern display as well as a swan boat rides that light",
          "Great walking area with lots of history. Can get some good exercise walking the grounds of the park. Makes more room for seafood!!",

          "Wished we had more time to explore than the several hours we had actually allotted. The grounds are great for walkers, plenty to see with the zoo, Botanical Gardens, gazebo, etc. Lots of fun with a camera. Apparently quite populat with angulars is the number of fisherfolk was",

          "We have visited the Roger Williams Zoo twice now. For its size it is a fairly good zoo. Our most recent trip was not as wonderful as our last. We went in October and many of the animals are not on display. We did not get to see the elephants, which is one of my son's",
          "I like the variety of activites there are at RWP. The zoo, the carousel and children's park as well as the The bontanical center are but a few of the many great things going on at the park. There is also the Museum which is interesting and affordable.",

          "A nice mix of trails, open areas and drivable roads close to the city with a rural country feel. While I visit the park several times a year and love it, I do hold a little hate for the garbage that is not picked up exposing people to drug and sex waste products so to speak.",
          "I used to visit this place with my nephews only for the polar bears. The kids had never seen one before. It is a nicely kept zoo. Some cages were empty. Not too many visitors on the day we visited. But a great experience.",
          "There are several zoos in Boston-Providence area; among the best of them is the Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence. We visited there last weekend and, not having been there since I was a child, I wasn't sure if it was still as good as I remembered. I have to say- it was.",
          "This is just like I pictured New England. Nature at its best. We went there in October and the foliage was beautiful. Very nice playgrounds for kids of all ages. Most of the attractions were closed because of the off season but it was still worth the trip. Bring your camera !",
          "Love this place. Lots to see and do. A little expensive but not a quick trip. Our zoo pass is a reciprocol to RWP so when we visit family it is a great daytrip.",
          "The best parts are the 2 playgrounds. One is free and one is inside the zoo, so you must pay the admission",
          "This park is not mantained up to the standards of parks in other cities, it is the border of Cranston and a blighted neighborhood in Providence. We have not been there except to go to the zoo on free days.",
          "I've been to the Zoo several times but recently went to the park for a walk while my daughter was visiting the park planetarium with a friend. Within 10 minutes of walking, my driver's side window was smashed and belongings stolen. I was notified by museum staff and an officer",
          "The whole park is great but the zoo is fabulous. My children and their children as my wife andme totally enjoy the zoo",
          "Offers shady respite in the summer, free concerts, maps and wonderful rangers to help you plan your visit.",
          "I have visited this park and zoo numerous times and have always found it a great place to go. The park is beautiful to walk around, have a picnic, go on the carousel. The zoo is great for everyone. It is a really nice zoo. The pumpkin exhibit in October is one of the best I have",
          "I've been to the Halloween Pumpkin Event twice - a few years apart. I was not disappointed. It's amazing that volunteers carve all those pumpkins. The folks who do the displays have a very creative mind!",
          "I've grown up going to Roger Williams Park Zoo, I have many memories as a child there and now my husband and I take our daughter (18 months). We have gone to RWPZ with our daughter a couple of times and I felt like it was only alright, especially since they let go of the polar",
          "There is a wide variety of animals in comfortable habitats. The park itself is lovely.",
          "Went with my kids, very nice, plenty of bathrooms. Prices for food were reasonable, parking availability was great, right in and right out!",
          "This is a beautiful park to explore, a must for history buffs. There is a perfectly preserved Colonial cottage on the grounds as well as a magnificent turn-of-the-century casino (not the gambling kind), historic Japanese gardens, a Temple of Music, where concerts are sometimes",
          "Just a great place for a picnic or a stroll with the family",
          "A beautiful setting for a picnic. Huge facility with plenty of room to spread out. Unfortunately there aren't enough bathroom facilities. We had to drive our guests over to the carousel area to use that bathroom, which had run out of toilet paper.",
          "Roger Williams Park is truly a hidden gem as it is folded into an area of Providence/Cranston that is more on the upscale side yet close to the major highways. It is often called a city park for that reason. The park also contains seven lakes which comprise approximately 98",
          "So much to see and do... children love it. Bring a stroller for little ones.",
          "I thought this was the zoo but it wasn't. I did find the Zoo later which is name the same thing but after walking the whole city. So if you are looking for the Zoo its called Roger Willams ZOO Not Park",
          "Great park. Can get crowded at times, especially if there are wedding parties. Overall a very nice park. Great for picnics and pictures. The carousel looks fun, but didn't go. Crowded! There are horse stables and a small naturalist museum which is very interesting.",
          "The Zoo is delightful. Easy to get around with children. The gardens are well kept and the Casino can hold a variety of events including weddings and such. You can drive from place to place and usually find a space to part. You can picnic, sit under a tree and read and ride the",
          "RWP was the best, it's still good. The Park is outstanding but some of the grounds need work or are are under construction. The carousel is superb, old wooden horses, gayly painted animals and benches for adults. The kids play area is great swings, teeter totters, jungle gyms.",
          "Looks like a dumped beauty...The grounds are neglected as are the paths. The botanic garden is a joke, with two small warehouses and a landscape suffering of neglect.",
          "There's lots to do. Spend the day there. Paddle boats look cute, like big swans.",
          "A natural jem just south of Providence! Beautiful place for a picnic or go see the zoo! With a surprising number of exhibits and animals, the Roger Williams Zoo is fun for my friends at Brown and young cousins. Everyone loves visiting here.",

          "We came as a family with toddlers. The park was beautiful, felt safe, and offered lots of fun. My daughter especially loved the carousel and Del's Lemonade! There were many families playing together and soaking in the sunny day. This is great place for families and a good",
          "This park is absolutely beautiful. Pack a picnic and a blanket and enjoy yourself.",
          "The zoo is a great place to bring your family. The temple is strangely placed in the large park but very beautiful with a great view of the pond. During the fall there is a red maple by the temple that turns fire red. A lovely place to photograph.",
          "The park has the zoo in it, too. However, the park itself is a nice place to just relax, picnic, and enjoy the outdoors.",
          "Well kept, beautiful park, nice setting, great place to play",
          "The animals are usually the yearround attraction at Roger Williams Park Zoo, but it is walkable also with beautiful sculptures, the Arcade, and Gazebo. During the summer you can rent paddle boats with a friend or family members which is a nice way to spend a warm Providence",
          "We visited the Botanical Center in the park and it was a nice, affordable touch. We intend on going back when everything outside the green houses are in full bloom. The park itself is nice and lengthy as well as guarded. There are some shady people here and there but police were",

          "My husband and I took our engagement pictures here and they came out gorgeous.",

          "Great place to spend the day with the kids. The zoo does a great job with its animals--great care provided. The zoo is the right size, not too big or small, and not too difficult to push a stroller. Food is not too expensive either.",
          "One of the best zoos in the area. It is easy to get to & has plenty of parking. There is also a nice variety of animals there.",

          "The gardens are breathtakingly beautiful, peaceful and romantic. The botanical gardens had a number of exotic plants, flowers and beautiful fish ponds. This is a perfect place for picnicking, picture taking, or just walking and enjoying the view. Just a lot of natural beauty",

          "Roger Williams Park is beautiful in any season with many varied activities. It's a great place for a walk, a bike ride, enjoying the zoo or the beautiful flowers. It is especially attractive in spring and fall. In winter it is great for sledding and ice skating. Great photo",
          "It's easy to see why this park is considered one of the best urban parks in America. It's a beautiful oasis just minutes from a crowded capital city. The area has been saved from developers who would have cut down every tree, dredged the river, paved over the grass and hastily",
          "We visited the Roger Williams Park (on June 14th) and weren't disappointed! As I am a garden fanatic we mostly concentrated on the gardens and botanical center at the park. The Botanical center opened recently (2007). Although the Botanical Center is a work in progress (exterior"

        "wiki": "Hartford is a neighborhood located along the western edge of Providence, Rhode Island.  Route 6 and the Woonasquatucket River separates it from Olneyville.\n\n\n== History ==\nPrior to the arrival of white settlers, the area had been used as a soapstone quarry by the Narragansett natives.  The first white settlers were farmers.  Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, settlers built dwellings intended for temporary stays, though later, attracted by the country atmosphere, they adopted permanent residence.\nIn the early nineteenth century, the proximity of the Woonasquatucket River allowed the area to begin industrialization.  In 1812 the Mill Merino became the second textile establishment in the general area, producing a soft material called \"merino cloth\".  Merino Village, consisting of stone houses, a general store, and water supply, was built by the company to support its workers. As the area began to develop further, its economic opportunities attracted immigrants.  Though initially primarily Irish, later waves of immigration brought Polish and later Italian immigrants to the neighborhood.In the 1950s, massive housing projects altered the fabric of Hartford.  The construction of Route 6 meant the demolition of a swath of working-class housing, while two large low-income housing projects (Hartford Park Public Housing Project and Manton Heights Housing Projects) visually demonstrated a shift in the neighborhood's demographics.  As with much public housing in the United States, both fell victim to neglect and vandalism, with the demolition of a significant number of units occurring in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the 1990 census, three out of four residents in Hartford were white; about one in seven was Hispanic, nearly 10% were African American, and about 4% were Asian.  True to Hartford's heritage, the largest fraction (27%) of employed residents work in manufacturing.  The next largest fraction of employment (18%) was taken up by professional services.  The unemployment rate for Hartford was 9.4% compared to citywide average of 9.2%.According to the Providence Plan, a local nonprofit aimed at improving city life, today 48.4% of residents are Hispanic, 33.6% of residents are white, 10.6% are African-American, 5% are Asian, and nearly 2% are Native American. 64% of children under the age of six speak a language other than English as their primary language.The median family income is $28,065, below the citywide average of $32,058. 40% of families live below the poverty line while 18% of residents receive some form of public assistance. 12% of children under the age of six have suffered from high lead exposure, below the citywide average of 19%.\n\n\n== Government ==\nHartford is within Ward 7, which is represented in the Providence City Council by Democrat John I. Igliozzi.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nMerino Park is a 13.27-acre (53,700 m2) park on the banks of the Woonasquatucket River between Hartford Avenue and Route 6. It is the only large public park in Hartford.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Hartford\", Providence Neighborhoods from Providenceri.com",

        "wiki": "Providence is the capital and most populous city of the state of Rhode Island and is one of the oldest cities in the United States. It was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams, a Reformed Baptist theologian and religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He named the area in honor of \"God's merciful Providence\" which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers. The city is situated at the mouth of the Providence River at the head of Narragansett Bay.\nProvidence was one of the first cities in the country to industrialize and became noted for its textile manufacturing and subsequent machine tool, jewelry, and silverware industries. Today, the city of Providence is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning which have shifted the city's economy into service industries, though it still retains some manufacturing activity.\nThe city is the third-most-populous city in New England after Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nProvidence was settled in June 1636 by Roger Williams and grew into one of the original Thirteen Colonies. Williams was compelled to leave Massachusetts Bay Colony due to his differing religious views, and he and others established Providence Plantations. This settlement merged with others to become the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and it was a refuge for persecuted religious dissenters from the beginning.Providence Plantations was burned to the ground in March 1676 by the Narragansetts during King Philip's War, despite the good relations between Williams and the sachems with whom the United Colonies of New England were waging war. Later in the year, the Rhode Island legislature formally rebuked the other colonies for provoking the war.Providence residents were among the first Patriots to spill blood in the lead-up to the American Revolutionary War during the Gaspee Affair of 1772, and Rhode Island was the first of the Thirteen Colonies to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown on May 4, 1776. It was also the last of the Thirteen States to ratify the United States Constitution on May 29, 1790, once assurances were made that a Bill of Rights would become part of the Constitution.Following the war, Providence was the country's ninth-largest city  with 7,614 people. The economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, in particular machinery, tools, silverware, jewelry, and textiles. By the start of the 20th century, Providence hosted some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country, including Brown & Sharpe, Nicholson File, and Gorham Manufacturing Company.\n\nProvidence residents ratified a city charter in 1831 as the population passed 17,000. The seat of city government was located in the Market House in Market Square from 1832 to 1878, which was the geographic and social center of the city. The city offices outgrew this building, and the City Council resolved to create a permanent municipal building in 1845.  The city offices moved into the Providence City Hall in 1878.\n\nLocal politics split over slavery during the American Civil War, as many had ties to Southern cotton and the slave trade. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, the number of military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union. Providence thrived after the war, and waves of immigrants brought the population from 54,595 in 1865 to 175,597 by 1900.By the early 1900s, Providence was one of the wealthiest cities in the United States. Immigrant labor powered one of the nation's largest industrial manufacturing centers. Providence was a major manufacturer of industrial products, from steam engines to precision tools to silverware, screws, and textiles. Giant companies were based in or near Providence, such as Brown & Sharpe, the Corliss Steam Engine Company, Babcock & Wilcox, the Grinnell Corporation, the Gorham Manufacturing Company, Nicholson File, and the Fruit of the Loom textile company.From 1975 until 1982, $606 million of local and national community development funds were invested throughout the city. In the 1990s, the city pushed for revitalization, realigning the north-south railroad tracks, removing the huge rail viaduct that separated downtown from the capitol building, uncovering and moving the rivers (which had been covered by paved bridges) to create Waterplace Park and river walks along the rivers' banks, and constructing the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Alex and Ani City Center) and the Providence Place Mall.Despite new investment, poverty remains an entrenched problem. Approximately 27.9 percent of the city population is living below the poverty line. Recent increases in real estate values further exacerbate problems for those at marginal income levels, as Providence had the highest rise in median housing price of any city in the United States from 2004 to 2005.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Providence city limits enclose a small geographical region with a total area of 20.5 square miles (53 km2); 18.5 square miles (48 km2) of it is land and the remaining 2.1 square miles (5.4 km2) is water (roughly 10%). Providence is located at the head of Narragansett Bay, with the Providence River running into the bay through the center of the city, formed by the confluence of the Moshassuck and Woonasquatucket Rivers. The Waterplace Park amphitheater and riverwalks line the river's banks through downtown.\nProvidence is one of many cities claimed to be founded on seven hills like Rome. The more prominent hills are: Constitution Hill (near downtown), College Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and containing New England's largest Italian district outside of Massachusetts). The other four are: Tockwotten Hill at Fox Point, Smith Hill (where the State House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston and Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill at the lower end of Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early 1880s.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nProvidence has 25 official neighborhoods, though these neighborhoods are often grouped together and referred to collectively:\nThe East Side is a region comprising the neighborhoods of Blackstone, Hope (aka Summit), Mount Hope, College Hill, Wayland, and Fox Point.\nThe Jewelry District describes the area enclosed by I-95, the old I-195, and the Providence River. The city has made efforts to rename this area the Knowledge District to reflect the area's newly developing life sciences and technology-based economy.\nThe North End is formed by the concatenation of the neighborhoods of Charles, Wanskuck, Smith Hill, Elmhurst, and Mount Pleasant.\nThe South Side (or South Providence) consists of the neighborhoods of Elmwood, Lower South Providence, Upper South Providence, Washington Park, and the West End.\nWest Broadway is an officially recognized neighborhood with its own association. It overlaps with the southern half of Federal Hill and the northern part of the West End.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city of Providence is geographically very compact, characteristic of eastern seaboard cities that developed prior to use of the automobile. It is among the most densely populated cities in the country. For this reason, Providence has the eighth-highest percentage of pedestrian commuters. The street layout is irregular; more than one thousand streets (a great number for the city's size) run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places such as Market Square.Downtown Providence has numerous 19th-century mercantile buildings in the Federal and Victorian architectural styles, as well as several post-modern and modernist buildings located throughout the area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development. West Exchange Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two.\nThe newer area, sometimes called \"Capitol Center\", includes Providence Place Mall (1999), the Omni Providence Hotel (1993) and The Residences Providence (2007), GTECH Corporation (2006), Waterplace Towers condominiums (2007), and Waterplace Park (1994). The area tends toward newer development, since much of it is land reclaimed in the 1970s from a mass of railroad tracks referred to colloquially as the \"Chinese Wall\". This part of Downtown is characterized by open spaces, wide roads, and landscaping.\nThe historic part of downtown has many streetscapes that look as they did 80 years ago. Many of the state's tallest buildings are found here. The largest structure at 426 feet (130 m) is the art deco-styled Industrial National Bank Building (formerly Industrial Trust Tower). By contrast, nearby to it is the second tallest One Financial Plaza, designed in modern taut-skin cladding, constructed a half-century later. In between the two is 50 Kennedy Plaza. The Textron Tower is also a core building to the modest Providence skyline. Downtown is also the home of the Providence Biltmore and Westminster Arcade, the oldest enclosed shopping mall in the U.S., built in 1828.The city's southern waterfront, away from the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Russian Submarine Museum was located here until 2008, when the submarine sank in a storm and was declared a loss. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found here, built to protect Providence from storm surge like that which it endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol.The majority of the cityscape comprises abandoned and revitalized industrial mills, double- and triple-decker housing (though row houses are rare, found so commonly in other Northeast cities), a small number of high-rise buildings (predominantly for housing the elderly), and single family homes. Interstate 95 serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods such as Federal Hill and the West End.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nProvidence has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa) bordering a humid subtropical climate with hot summers, cold winters, and high humidity year-round. The USDA places the city in hardiness zone 6b, with the suburbs in zones 6a \u2013 7b. The influence of the Atlantic Ocean keeps the state of Rhode Island warmer than many inland locales in New England. January is the coldest month with a daily mean of 29.2 \u00b0F (\u22121.6 \u00b0C) and low temperatures dropping to 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) or lower an average of 11 days per winter, while July is the warmest month with a daily mean of 73.5 \u00b0F (23.1 \u00b0C) and highs rising to 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) or higher an average of 10 days per summer. Extremes range from \u221217 \u00b0F or \u221227.2 \u00b0C on February 9, 1934 to 104 \u00b0F or 40 \u00b0C on August 2, 1975; the record cold daily maximum is 1 \u00b0F (\u221217.2 \u00b0C) on February 5, 1918, while the record warm daily minimum is 80 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C) on June 6, 1925. Temperature readings of 0 \u00b0F or \u221217.8 \u00b0C or lower are uncommon in Providence and generally occur once every several years. The year which had the most days with a temperature reading of zero degrees or lower was 2015 with eight days total\u2014one day in January and seven days in February. Conversely, temperature readings of 100 \u00b0F or 37.8 \u00b0C or higher are even rarer, and the year with the most days in this category was 1944 with three days, all of which were in August.Monthly precipitation in Providence ranges from a high of 4.43 inches (112.5 mm) in March to a low of 3.17 inches (80.5 mm) in July. In general, precipitation levels are slightly less in the summer months than the winter months, when Nor'easters can cause significant snowfall and blizzard conditions. Hurricanes are not frequent in coastal New England, although Providence's location at the head of Narragansett Bay makes it vulnerable to them.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2000, the population consisted of 173,618 people, 162,389 households, and 35,859 families. The population density was 9,401.7 inhabitants per square mile (3,629.4/km\u00b2), characteristic of other small cities in New England such as New Haven, Connecticut; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut.  Its population peaked in the 1940s, just prior to the nationwide period of rapid suburbanization.\nProvidence has a racially and ethnically diverse population. In 2010, white Americans formed 49.8% of the population, including a sizable white Hispanic community. Non-Hispanic whites were 37.6% of the total population, down from 89.5% in 1970. Providence has had a substantial Italian population since the start of the 20th century, with 14% of the population claiming Italian ancestry. Italian influence manifests itself in Providence's Little Italy in Federal Hill.  Irish immigrants have also had considerable influence on the city's history, with 8% of residents claiming Irish heritage. The city also has a sizeable Jewish community, estimated at 10,500 in 2012 or roughly 5% of the city's population.\n\nIn 2010, people of Hispanic or Latino origin composed 38.1% of the city's population and currently form a majority of city public school students. The majority of Hispanics in Providence are of Dominican descent, having one of the largest Dominican populations in the United States. Other Hispanic groups present in large numbers are Puerto Ricans and Guatemalans. Hispanics are most concentrated in the neighborhoods of Elmwood, the West End, and Upper and Lower South Providence.  The city elected its first Hispanic mayor in 2010, Dominican-American Angel Taveras.\nAfrican Americans constitute 16% of the city's population, with their greatest concentrations found in Mount Hope and the Upper and Lower South Providence neighborhoods. Asians are 6% of Providence's population and have enclaves scattered throughout the city. The largest Asian groups are Cambodians (1.7%), Chinese (1.1%), Asian Indians (0.7%), Laotians (0.6%), and Koreans (0.6%). Another 6% of the city has multiracial ancestry. American Indians and Pacific Islanders make up the remaining 1.3%. Liberians compose 0.4% of the population; the city is home to one of the largest Liberian immigrant populations in the country.Providence has a considerable community of immigrants from various Portuguese-speaking countries, especially Portugal, Brazil, and Cape Verde, living mostly in the areas of Washington Park and Fox Point. Portuguese is the city's third-largest European ethnicity, after Italian and Irish, at 4% of the population; Cape Verdeans compose 2%.The Providence metropolitan area includes Providence, Fall River, Massachusetts, and Warwick, and is estimated to have a population of 1,622,520. In 2006, this area was officially added to the Boston Combined Statistical Area (CSA), the sixth-largest CSA in the country. In the last 15 years, Providence has experienced a sizable growth in its under-18 population. The median age of the city is 28 years, while the largest age cohort is 20- to 24-year-olds, owing to the city's large student population.The per capita income as of the 2000 census was $15,525, which is well below both the state average of $29,113 and the national average of $21,587.  The median income for a household was $26,867, and the median income for a family in Providence was $32,058, according to the 2000 census. The city has one of the highest rates of poverty in the nation with 29.1% of the population and 23.9% of families living below the poverty line in 2000, the largest concentrations being found in the city's Olneyville, and Upper and Lower South Providence areas. Poverty has affected children at a disproportionately higher rate, with 40.1% of those under the age of 18 living below the poverty line, concentrated west of downtown in the neighborhoods of Hartford, Federal Hill, and Olneyville.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nCompared to the national average, Providence has an average rate of violent crime and a higher rate of property crime per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2010, there were 15 murders, down from 24 in 2009. In 2010, Providence fared better regarding violent crime than most of its peer cities.

          "Right of the bat I have to say this should have been a 5 start review. The only reason I give 3 stars is the lack of public parking and the $20 lot fee. On top of that they lock the parking lot 30 minutes after the show. This makes it so \u2026",
          "Great venue. Big city feel but in smaller Providence. There's a garage but there's tons of street parking that you can hunt for especially on a weekday night. Bar prices were a little high, but it's not like you can sneak in your own.",
          "I love the plays they do here!!",
          "Great staff. The seats up high are cramped. Old and historic theater. Great acoustics for any shows or concerts. Have been here many many times! There is a lot of parking in the area. I would recommend using spot hero to look for the cheapest spaces. Easy in and easy out of the city for a show too",
          "Excellent venue for musical plays.",
          "Show was awesome. The whole cast was so energetic. It was fast passed. Kids would love it and maybe make them think of picking up an instrument.  Highly recommended.",
          "Wonderful place where you can appreciate the waste of talent and the agable atmosphere of security and good service in every sense of the word",
          "Based upon the show we saw \"Phantom of the Opera\".  Slow start but got increasing better as the acts moved forward.   Ending was great - please stay for it.  Quaint theater.   Lots of parking nearby.",
          "The peoples in the program where I work had an inside tour of PPAC.  We learned quite a bit about what goes in to a production and learned the history of the building.  It was fun to see the  view from the stage.",

          "Always a great experience. Staff is wonderful.",
          "Always easy in easy out.  Saw Waitress and it was very good.  The merch lady was not very nice though.  5 stars if she is not affiliated with PPAC.",
          "PPAC is awesome!!! I love that they host the Broadway Series every year. It's so convenient to be able to see a Broadway play  two cities away from where I live. I highly recommend this venue. It's SO worth the money!!",

          "Fiddler on the roof was fantastic,  especially at ppac",

          "Love the inside and the acoustics but they must do something about the lack of restroom facilities and crowd control at intermission.",
          "Beautiful inside. Have seen a few performances here. Specifically Waitress and the Harry Potter Movie Orchestra. The usually have a merch store related to the performance outside the theatre. Recommend sitting on the ground level as the balcony seating is so cramped.",
          "Beautiful building and great performances!",
          "Saw Cats on the opening night of their tour.  Excellent!! Sets and lighting added to the exceptional singing and dancing performances. Beautiful costumes.  A night full of beauty and song",
          "A nice performance venue for a dance competition. The food was surprisingly useful and not that expensive. There is no food allowed from outside. But no public WiFi is an absolute killer for a dance competition. I'm sure that is fine for a play or concert, but a dance competition is 3 minutes of watching, 3 hours of waiting around.",

          "Saw Aladdin tonight. Was amazing!",

          "Saw Fiddler on the Roof with my students. It was FANTASTIC!!!",
          "Wonderful venue for the performing arts. The Broadway show program is easy and fun and very entertaining",
          "Beautiful space- very luxurious and gorgeous theater. There's parking and restaurants within walking distance so its very accessible. If you get food or drink, be prepared for astronomical prices such as $8 for a bottle of water. Not worth \u2026",
          "Beautiful theater.  Great location.  Easy access and nice restaurants in the area.",
          "A terrific line of shows at a much more intimate venue than you get in other cities",
          "It is a beautiful theaters that brings in wonderful productions. The only downside is that the seats are small and tightly together. I don't think a tall man would be comfortable or may not even fit there.",
          "We experienced Hamilton it was awesome, a little hot at the back of the theater but our seats were comfortable",
          "Limited leg room in the balcony, like most older theaters. But the sight lines and acoustics were good, and the women's restroom up there was quite large for a theater.",

          "Wonderful theater!  Hope PPAC continues long into the future.  They bring in great shows and provide a nice evening out.",

          "A great venue to see plays with amazing actors at a cheaper price than Broadway or the Boston Opera House!",
          "The structure is just Stunning! Mesmerizing! I attended the ShenYun performance last night and a sweet woman, Debra was volunteering as an usher. The attendants were all very professional and helpful! I had such a memorable evening.",
          "Most disruptive theater experience I've had. Ushers' flashlights and people talking at full volume when they entered late. During intermission the building had some major drafts filled with the smell of cigarette smoke.",
          "One guy at the bar downstairs?? Poor performance",
          "Parking is a bit of a nightmare but other than that, amazing venue!",

          "Great costumer service.",
          "This theater is amazing! And ladies, I know it sounds silly, but seriously, they are SO efficient with the bathroom situation. There are probably 50 stalls so you're not waiting too long, past the end of intermission, just to pee. Also, the ushers and all workers are wonderful! Always smiling!",
          "The place is very nice. Consider parking at one of the other lots. I would not park at the one right across the street as it takes much longer to get in and out.",
          "First time at this theater. We saw Phantom of the Opera, which was enchanting, of course. Plenty of options for snacks and booze! Helpful staff. Loved it!",
          "Nice venue, but like most old theaters, seating is tight.  Maybe I am spoiled with the new movie theaters, but I hate being sandwiched between people, fighting for arm rest space, etc.  If you end up next to someone overweight, forget it... \u2026",

          "The seats are not slanted downward, there was only 1 line of seats in front of me, but that was enough for me to not see 3/4ths of the show. There was someone directly in front of me and my spouse and we could not see around them, when we \u2026",

          "I had front-row tickets to Diana Ross and I moved about 2 feet away because there was a man in the corner so I could see Diana Ross and the usher came down and told us to get in our seats. It took Diana Ross to say something to the woman to let us be Rowe middle age watching her we're not around a crowd unbelievable good Acoustics though",
          "Chris Tucker was so funny \ud83d\ude02!  Laughed until I lost my breath.",
          "Wonderful! Saw Phantom of Opera on a Friday nite. Sat near front in orchestra and think ticket price was very fair for all that we got. The theatre, and the chandelier that went up and down, beautiful and thrilling!",
          "We just came from a performance of the musical Aladdin. Expertly and exquisitely staged. The whole new world magic carpet Ride was as amazing as a stage setting can get. The seating is tight and the isles relatively narrow but this is to be expected with an old historic theater. Come to downtown Providence and bask in the history.",
          "Never a bad experience with the place. It's all matters were you sit. Ironically the best view for any show so far is in the upper sections not below.",

They have affordable drinks that you can bring into the theatre I paid ten dollars for like a 16 oz of Jack and Coke. The only petpeave is if your not on time they make you wait until a scene ends before you can enter the theatre. So be there early.",

          "I go here a few times a year and have always had a enjoyable time,it always tends to be extremely crowded especially at Intermission and i have found that the upper level seats are more comfortable than the lower level so if you want some cushioning go for the upper balcony seats.",

But its a 15 minute walk from the Providence Place Mall.\n\nWalk directly away from the statehouse, over the river, and take a right onto Fountain St. Then an immediate left down Union. Just keep walking till you see it down the street on your right.",
          "I sent my parents to Hamilton last night.  They ended up getting seats 11rows back from the stage due to a mixup (something we could never afford!)  The staff the actors and production were all top f'ing notch!",

          "Between the RISD art museum, Brown University, and all the historic houses you could spend an entire day just on Benefit Street. Don\u2019t miss the Anthenaeum. It looks like a library out of a movie with floor to wall books. Have a great historic day on benefit street.",

          "I walked down this street after visiting the RISD. There are lots of houses named after the people who presumably first lived in them. Unfortunately, as a non-local, I didn't know who any of them were. Some of the houses seemed to have been restored to the point that they were",

          "We took a short walk from our hotel, crossed the rivers, and ascended the hill past the first Baptist church to benefit Street. There are plenty of colonial era and newer homes with interesting architecture. Worth the walk. Highly recommend.",

          "I never tire of walking up and down Benefit Street. It has to be one of the most extraordinary streets in the U.S. Every building is beautifully preserved and/or renovated, and most are from the 19th or 18th century. Treat yourself and take a walk through history on this",
          "We enjoyed our walk of a mile or so along Benefit Street, The houses are incredibly well-preserved and the street is quite beautiful. You can visit the Atheneum (library), John Brown's mansion and several other historic homes along your way.",

          "I have always enjoyed benefit Street because it takes you back many, many years and gives you the feeling of the 1700's. My daughter went to school at RISD and we always feel welcome there.",

          "Benefit Street was very interesting because of its history. We particularly enjoyed the library, but it was so hot in there. As we discovered, that was why so many visitors were in the very bottom part of the library. The librarians should crank up the AC when it's 95\u00b0F in",
          "On my first trip to New England I\u2019ve been making my way south from Maine over the last couple weeks. So far Rhode Island has been the friendliest place so far, and besides the obvious history of the Boston area, rich in colonial and more recent history. The walk down Benefit St",

          "A free tourist activity to do! I thoroughly enjoyed walking along this street, browsing at the old houses, comparing the different styles and reading what year they were built in. It doesn\u2019t take long out of your day, factor this in to your sightseeing day.",
          "This street oozes history. Some places are open to the public, such as the Stephen Douglas House, the Providence Athenaeum, or the RISD museum. But other houses and gardens on Benefit and adjacent streets have markers about the first inhabitants. Do enjoy this walk through",

          "Excellent, historic, definitely fun walking area. Must see! One of our more fun experiences in Providence!",
          "We had time to kill so we walked over to Benefit St. to check out the old homes. The big church was being renovated so it was covered in scaffolding, therefore no good photos. Watch where you walk as the ground is uneven with the old pavers and you can trip if not paying",
          "This is a beautiful street and what postcards are made of! The street is as beautiful during the day as it is at night. Night time, however, brings out a charm that takes you back in time. The street is absolutely gorgeous in the fall and spring/summer. The bricks are hundreds",
          "We noticed some reviewers say \" not much more than a stroll\" --I will add, oh-but how beautiful this stroll will be! The homes and churches, views through the openings between rooftops, the little gardens tucked here and there-the DOORWAYS!!! is a small delicious feast for the",

          "This is a great street to walk through the historical homes of Providence. Most have placards on the front that tell when they were build and in some cases moved there. Nice architecture and leaves you wondering what it would be like to be there back in that time. Well worth the",
          "I love Providence and this is one of my favorite streets. You have to admire the citizens of Providence as they really take care of their homes. They do not do tear downs the way so many areas do. As a result you have a great mixture of various styles on every street.",
          "One of the few streets it is easy to park in. No real through traffic to worry about, so you can have a leisurely stroll and view the dates and residents of the buildings. The footpath is a bit uneven and is tree lined. It is interesting to see the same names crop up on various",

          "It is uplifting to see how beautifully maintained these old houses and gardens are. I wish more American towns could boast such a spot. Benefit Street reminded me of a trip we made sometime ago to Griswold, CT, and to parts of downtown Newport, RI.",

          "We walked only about for 20 minutes down the Benefit St and it was peaceful and quiet area. Narrow street with beautiful small houses and historical buildings. You will find restaurants and lounges along Benefit street but they don't open until 5pm. That part was really weird",
          "We only had a short time to quickly absorb some of the history and culture of Providence. We decided to do the Rhode Island Historical Society's walking tour of Benefit Street. We met at the Brown House, where we signed up and paid the small fee. There was one other couple on",
          "If you like Colonial architecture, you should see Benefit Street. House after charming house, each with its own unique features. While other cities have some colonial houses, this neighborhood gives you an idea of what those others once were. A bpnus if you are a reader of",

          "I guess if you don't live in New England this street may seem unusual. But this street looks like entire neighborhoods in Boston, MA, Lexington, MA, Portsmouth NH, Bath, ME, etc.",

          "One of everybody's favorite streets in Providence, Benefit and neighboring streets is worth a long leisurely walk day or night (the gas lamps cast a nice Victorian glow) or any time of year. There's a wonderful array of American architecture. All this was preserved because when",

          "Bottom Line: If you absolutely have to see it, drive through it. Tip: Plenty of metered parking around the Brown campus. Details: We stopped here after reading the great reviews online but were quickly disappointed by it. Starting at College Street, we headed one direction on",
          "For a feel of early colonial homes and nice of the city, I highly recommend this street. It was a nice part of the course for the Rock and Roll Half-Marathon, and even better to go back with a tour guide (Deena) and take pictures.",

          "Wonderful architecture, lots of hills, historic area",

          "It was okay. Nothing great. Visited here on a Monday. It was not crowded at all. For some reason the water level was low and there were some areas of the river that was dried up! Nothing really to do here on a Monday. I guess on the weekend it would have been better.",

          "I thought the lighting of fire on the river was very nice. Problem noticed, people came early for seats and late comers would just stand in front of them blocking their view. Should rope off a stand only area away from seats. It was just too crowded for me.",
          "This feature is a noble attempt to make the most of the Providence River, which is more like a canal. There is a lot of concrete and stone, so the park is sterile, but it is lined with high-end eateries and perhaps in warm weather there are kiosks and muscians and crowds, which",

          "Visited the Riverwalk before going to dinner on a warm Sunday afternoon. You can park across the street in the mall parking garage - $2 for us. Little confusing to get from parking level to street - have to go thru mall. Not many people in the area, great place to stroll,",

          "Its my understanding that this river was previously covered and exposured as part of the city's refurbishment in the 1990s. They did a nice job. The tiles under the bridge may be the best part. You'll get a great view of Water Place Park and the Riverwalk from the mall. But",

          "Water Place Park is just as the name implies, a park divided by a river in the middle of downtown that allows you to forget that you are in the city. A place where you can walk, talk, and relax. If you get hungry along the way there are plenty of places to stop and eat.",
          "We walked along the river walk as they were preparing for the firewater event that would be taking place that evening. It was peaceful. The walk was very clean. We enjoyed the posters showing the history of the riverwalk over the centuries. We also appreciated how the",
          "We strolled along the Riverwalk during the WaterFire festival. It was lovely, and offers plenty of seating along the walk. The chandeliers along the walk are a nice touch, and the hand-painted tiles by local children were touching as well. We were incredibly shocked by how much",

          "Very nice water front park, a little oasis in the center of the city of Providence. This park features a bridge called the General Pershing Bridge. That connects to the Union Plaza.",
          "Yeah, not really too exciting, but I love being able to walk down by the river, and when they have the fires on the water on special weekends, it's worth going down to see it. It could be cleaner; we could have no problems in an urban environment, but hey--it's safe enough to",
          "This place is a wonderful use of public space to attract people, awesome views, Yes it could use a little cleaning Remember your in a City. The tile wall is such a great idea it is beautiful with all the childrens drawings commenting of 9/11. Well done RI,",
          "The display of tiles by students after 9-11 was amazing and interesting. The gondola tours were scenic, and there were numerous kayaks using the waterway as well.",
          "In an age where people want to build condominiums along rivers blocking public access, I must commend Providence preserving this tranquil space for public access. Yes, it could be more tidy, but that is a small issue. It is there for us to use. Thank you, Providence!",
          "It could be better with some clean up. Litter detracts from the experience. But it is certainly a great effort for a city that restructured itself to enhance it's downtown. It was a short walk and weather was not on my side. A good activities for families .",
          "I can't believe that Providence was so ugly (the original I-95 and river-blocking roads ruined everything, coupled with the city's previous pure industry background) not so long ago and now...everyone here likes to take a walk by the beautiful riverwalk from time to time",
          "The picture and written address seem to indicate India Point Park (with a quasi-bay water area), but the map point to the place where you see Waterfire (definitely an artificial river area with stuck-up \"racks\" to put woods on it and make fire in some occasions). The latter is",
          "Of course you have to dress for the weather. And it's always better when there is no crowd. But it's a great place to view downtown, and if you don't examine the water too closely, it's very nice. Providence needs to take better care of it, but it's fine as is.",
          "The Water Place River walk is a lovely, family friendly place for a stroll. Unfortunately for us, it was November and cold and windy. We hear the fire on the water event is incredible, hope to make it back someday.",

          "The river is always one of my favorite place to visit when I go to any city. We were not luck enough to come on a time that we can not see the fire and water show.",
          "We came to Providence to check out the waterfire show. Other than the show I wouldn't recommend the river walk unless you happen to be in the area and have nothing else to do. Not a lot of restaurants to enjoy and the ones nearby are very pricey. Not to mention many homeless",
          "Riverwalk is a great way to get at the 'heart' of Providence. On one side is 'downtown', many fine hotels and restaurants near and on the river. On the other side is historic Providence, grand homes, Brown University, and the excellent Rhode Island School of Design Museum, in",

          "Walked around and enjoyed the river. Cool stuff going on - from gondolas to bridges to plenty to see along the way. Set below street level, so a great break from busy avenues. With fewer crowds on Saturday afternoon, there were some homeless who were making camp, which might",
          "I used to live a few blocks from here and would go to take my dog for a walk. When Water Fire is not going on it's calm, peaceful, and safe (not always 100% clean, but getting there). It's a real jewel in the city",
          "This is the perfect place to walk around down by the River and enjoy the views. We came in the afternoon on the day we knew there was a WaterFire show that night. The area has been revitalized recently and has a lot of interesting views, as well as a wonderful exhibit by the",

          "I had read about Waterfire at Water Place Park and was disappointed to learn that the fires would not be lit during our visit. It seems they are lit just two nights a month. But we decided to visit the area during the day to see the canals and The Wall of Hope 9/11 memorial",
          "My phone's camera roll became cluttered with amazing shots of Providence's Water Place Park and Riverwalk after we got back to our hotel. At the Park, you'll get an amazing shot of the city's skyline and there are many stairways leading up to the streets of Providence in case",

          "The riverwalk is nice, especially during a WaterFire night! Parking on the street is hard to come by, but there are two parking garages nearby without a ton of walking. Restaurants along the walk are more upscale, but well worth the price. Plenty of other restaurants in the",

          "We came to this place during the day on a Saturday and thought this area was a little run down. The paint was chipping off some of the railings and there was hardly anyone around. I guess it's best to come at night when there is a Waterfire show or don't bother coming at all.",

It is a single-story brick and stone structure, built in 1928, replacing an earlier library building which had originally housed a library established by the Wanskuck Mill Company for its employees.  The building was designed by Clarke & Howe, and is an excellent local example of Colonial Revival design, with a tetrastyle entrance portico.  It was the first of ten libraries built based on Howe designs.The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Providence, Rhode Island\nRochambeau Library-Providence Community Library\nSouth Providence Library-Providence Community Library\nSmith Hill Library-Providence Community Library\nFox Point Library-Providence Community Library\nMount Pleasant Library-Providence Community Library\nOlneyville Library-Providence Community Library\nWashington Park Library-Providence Community Library\nKnight Memorial Library-Providence Community Library\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nResidents fight to keep library open\nProvidence Community Library website",

          "Let me first state that I love the park, it has beautiful trees, waterways, plants, etc.... However, I had to give it a poor rating, as the Park should be friendly & inviting to everyone. The main concern is that many of the walkways do not have accessible ramps, leading to",

          "If you happen to be by the Providence area in the fall, you must check out the Rogers Williams Park. The fall leaves are a beauty in itself, but add on the columns, the bridges, the ponds and lakes. They also have a jack-o-lantern display as well as a swan boat rides that light",
          "Great walking area with lots of history. Can get some good exercise walking the grounds of the park. Makes more room for seafood!!",

      "name": "Ladd Observatory",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Ladd Observatory is an astronomical observatory at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Founded in 1891 it was primarily designed for student instruction and also research. The facility operated a regional timekeeping service. It was responsible for the care and calibration of clocks on campus including one at Carrie Tower and another that rang the class bell at University Hall. Meteorological observations were made there from the time the building opened using recording weather instruments.In addition to general astronomy courses it was also used for teaching civil engineering topics such as geodesy. Nautical science subjects, including celestial navigation, were taught there during the First World War.Ladd began a regular schedule of open nights for public viewing in 1930. This led to the creation of the Skyscrapers amateur astronomy society in 1932 which regularly met at Ladd. The Skyscrapers then acquired the Seagrave Observatory in 1936 which was then used as a meeting place. Amateur astronomers from the group continued to volunteer at Ladd and also participated in Brown University solar eclipse expeditions. Members constructed a Schmidt camera for the 1937 Brown eclipse expedition.Ladd was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It continues to be used by the Department of Physics at Brown for astronomy instruction. It is regularly open to the public as a science center and technology museum.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe observatory is named for benefactor Herbert W. Ladd who offered to fund the construction in the spring of 1889. The building was designed by the Providence-based firm of Stone, Carpenter & Willson in the Classical Revival style. The selected site was the highest point in Providence at the time, on what was once known as Tintop Hill on the East Side. Construction began in May 1890 and the building was dedicated on October 21, 1891. The total cost of construction and equipping the facility in 1891 was US$40,000, equivalent to $1,100,000 in 2019.\n\n\n== Telescopes ==\n\nThe primary telescope is a refractor with a 12-inch (300 mm) aperture objective and focal length of 15 feet (4.6 m). The lens was figured by John Brashear following the design of Charles S. Hastings. The crown glass was made by Mantois of Paris and the flint glass by the optical works at Jena in Germany. The equatorial mount and mechanical clock drive were made by George N. Saegmuller. This telescope was used for scientific work such as lunar occultation timings to make a more precise determination of the orbit of the Moon. Instruments such as a filar micrometer could be attached to the telescope.\nAnother telescope, a 3-inch (76 mm) meridian circle instrument, also made by Saegmuller, was used for observations related to timekeeping. Similer, but smaller, instruments were used for student instruction.\n\n\n== Timekeeping ==\n\nAs a number of other observatories did in the late 19th century Ladd provided an accurate regional timekeeping service by transmitting a time signal via telegraph wire. Observations of select stars were made with the meridian circle instrument as the star transited (or crossed) the meridian. This data was then used to calibrate a high quality pendulum clock set to keep sidereal time. Calculations were then performed to convert sidereal time to local standard time. A second clock keeping standard time was equipped with a telegraphics break circuit mechanism to automatically generate the time signals. These precision clocks were known as astronomical regulators. Timekeeping instruments used at Ladd include regulators made by Robert Molyneux, Edward Howard, Hezekiah Conant, and Sigmund Riefler.\n\nPrior to the Ladd time service the city relied on time signals from either Harvard College Observatory or the United States Naval Observatory that were transmitted via Western Union Telegraph wires. In many cases these signals were found to be inaccurate due to tranmission delay or accidents. Time signals from Ladd were first sent on September 12, 1893. The observatory sold these time signals to Rhode Island Electric Protective (RIEP) company, a local fire and burglar alarm firm. The signals from Ladd were redistributed to RIEP customers including \"jewelers\" (i.e. clockmakers) who repaired and calibrated watches.The signals were also used to directly control a clock network of several hundred slave clocks in various business offices. The revenue that the university received from the time signal service in 1906 was US$200 (equivalent to $5,700 in 2019) per year. Another telegraph wire connected the observatory to the Fire Department at City Hall which was used to signal the accurate time to the community by fire alarm bells at noon and 8:30 p.m. every day. Time signals from Ladd were also used to synchronize the regulator used to ring the bell in the cupola of University Hall on the main campus. The bell marked the beginning and end of class periods.\nLadd first received experimental wireless time signals from the Naval Observatory in November 1913. The purpose of the experiment was to measure the difference in longitude between Washington and Providence. The signals were transmitted by the Navy radio facility NAA in Arlington, Virginia. In 1915 Brown installed a sophisticated \"wireless plant\" consisting of a 450-foot-long (140 m) antenna strung between a tower on University Hall and another tower on Maxcy Hall. The operator's station with transmitting and receiving equipment was located in the basement of Wilson Hall, a building midway between the two towers. Primarily intended for engineering instruction and physics experimentation it was also used to receive the time signals from Arlington. On November 24, 1916 the transit instrument observations were discontinued and the clocks were instead calibrated by the NAA signals. The transit observations resumed on April 10, 1917 due to a US government order to dismantle the radio set at Ladd when the U.S. entered the First World War. These calibration observations continued through October 16, 1919.\n\nCalibration by Naval Observatory time signals from radio station WWV resumed after the war ended. These early transmissions were longwave, so called due to the long wavelength. Frequencies, and corresponding wavelengths, from 15 kilohertz (20,000 m) to 150 kilohertz (2,000 m) were used. These transmissions required special equipment such as the installation at Wilson Hall to receive them. By the 1930s it had become common to use a simple and inexpensive shortwave radio of the kind used to receive broadcast programs. This radio could also be used to receive time signal transmissions from Greenwich, Paris, and Berlin. The radio was directly wired to the clock circuits to allow recording the time signals.The sirens on fire stations continued to sound at noon using the time signals from Ladd until at least 1955. Clocks in a number of buildings in Providence were regulated using the signals from Ladd late into the 20th century. After determining no one was receiving the time signals, the transmissions were discontinued in 1973.\n\n\n== Associations ==\nScientists affiliated with the observatory include Winslow Upton, Frank Washington Very, Frederick Slocum, Robert Horace Baker, and Charles H. Smiley. Notable graduates from Brown or Pembroke who performed work at Ladd include Slocum (A.B. 1895, Ph.D. 1898), Leah Allen (A.B. 1907), and Harlan True Stetson (B.S. 1912).H. P. Lovecraft, author of weird fiction, had free access to the observatory for several years. He wrote astronomy articles for Providence newspapers based upon his study there between 1906 and 1918.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of astronomical observatories\nList of Brown University buildings\nList of largest optical refracting telescopes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLadd Observatory blog",

        "wiki": "Cape Verdean Americans are Americans whose ancestors were Cape Verdean. In 2010, the American Community Survey stated that there were 95,003 Americans living in the US with Cape Verdean ancestors.\n\n\n== Immigration waves ==\nCape Verdean immigration to the United States began in the early 19th century. The first Cape Verdean immigrants aboard New England whaling ships, which would often pick up crewmen off the coast of Cape Verde. Yankee captains valued Cape Verdeans as crews, because they \u201cworked hard to save what they could while on board vessel they could be hired for much less money than American seamen.  Furthermore, they made a disciplined crew.\u201dThe Cape Verdeans were universally regarded as \"hardworking, honest seamen.\" When all others abandoned the old sailing ships, the Cape Verdeans bought the decrepit vessels out of their earnings as seamen and kept patching them up with loving care. Eventually, they came to own almost all that remained of the New Bedford fleet, either by purchase or by default. In some cases, they received the ships as outright gifts and \"sailed them all over the earth with their own crews and made a modest profit by whaling in the old and tried manner.\"\nThis Cape Verdean immigration \"trickle\" grew to a \"flood\" in the 20th century as Cape Verde suffered drought, starvation, and economic decline.  Once on whaling ships and in America, Cape Verdean men were able to send home money and news of other family and friends already in \u201cthe land of opportunity.\u201d  They also sent bidons (gasoline barrels) full of food, clothes, and other items from New Bedford, Massachusetts; and Providence, Rhode Island.  The latter are the oldest and largest Cape Verdean communities in the United States.  These communities and new Cape Verdean communities are marked by close kinship ties and interdependence among families, a traditional Cape Verdean practice that has been passed down through the generations.\nOne of the major forces that brought Cape Verdeans to the Americas was the whaling industry. American whalers from New Bedford first began travelling to the islands in the 1790s, and further developed their trade as time progressed into the 19th century. During this time, many Cape Verdeans joined American whaling crews in order to escape Cape Verde, a land plagued with poor natural resources and an often abusive Portuguese colonial government. By the mid-1800s New Bedford had transformed into an economic maritime center, where Cape Verdeans were not only about to excel in the whaling industry but in other maritime industries (such as fishing) as well. New Bedford Whaling Museum explains, \u201cAs the 20th century went on and the ties between the islands and the port strengthened, entrepreneurs like Roy Teixeira, Henrique Mendes, Louis Lopes, Frank Lopes and Antonio Cardoza purchased, managed and owned packet ships like the Coriolanus, the Savoia, and the Arcturus... Importantly, not only did Cape Verdeans settle in New Bedford, but between 1860 and 1965 41% of the packets trading between New England and the Islands were owned by Cape Verdeans.\u201dMany Cape Verdeans worked in the cranberry bogs for the cranberry industry in Southeastern Massachusetts.Cape Verdean migration to the United States in the 19th century and early 20th century was composed of the islands' poorer classes. In 1922, the U.S. government restricted the immigration of peoples of color, greatly reducing Cape Verdean immigration. The new regulations also prevented Cape Verdean Americans from visiting the islands for fear of being denied reentry to the United States. The two communities thus were relatively isolated from each other for approximately 40 years. With doors to America closed, Cape Verdeans began to immigrate in larger numbers to Europe, South America, and West Africa along routes charted by commercial shipping and the Portuguese colonial empire. During the same period some Cape Verdean Americans migrated from the long-established East Coast communities to the steel towns of Ohio and Pennsylvania; and to California.\nIn 1966, due to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the U.S. government relaxed its regulations, and a new wave of Cape Verdean immigration began. The new arrivals in Boston, Brockton, Taunton and Onset, Massachusetts; Pawtucket, Rhode Island; Waterbury, Connecticut; Brooklyn, and Yonkers, New York; and other communities on the East Coast met a Cape Verdean-American ethnic group whose members looked like them, but differed culturally. Separated for so long, the groups knew little of each other's recent history or treasured memories.Full independence was achieved by Cape Verde on July 5, 1975 after a long struggle for complete rights and unrestricted control from the struggle of the country's colonial past. Though growing nationalism, prior efforts for independence slowly gained momentum and territory led by the efforts of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). This newfound independence allowed a new path that would be essential to the migration of Cape Verdean American as Cape Verde was one of few African countries allowing overflight of European and U.S. air travel. This was accompanied by two further actions of independence that aided Cape Verdean migration: broken political unity between Guinea in 1980, and the election of Antonio Monteiro which brought economic struggles that incited emigration.\n\n\n== Areas ==\nThe states with the largest population of Cape Verdeans (as of 2010) were:\n Massachusetts - 53,174\n Rhode Island - 19,490\n Connecticut - 4,381\n Florida - 2,983\n California - 2,514\n New Jersey - 1,430\n Virginia - 1,059\n Maryland - 1,022\n New York - 844\n Georgia - 802The largest communities of Cape Verdeans (as of 2010) were:\nNew Bedford, Massachusetts - 11,709\nBoston, Massachusetts - 11,284\nBrockton, Massachusetts - 11,262\nPawtucket, Rhode Island - 8,720\nFall River, Massachusetts - 7,197\nTaunton, Massachusetts - 7,313\nWareham, Massachusetts - 5,015\nProvidence, Rhode Island - 4,852\nRandolph, Massachusetts - 3,784\nEast Providence, Rhode Island - 2,265\nCentral Falls, Rhode Island - 1,158\nBridgeport, Connecticut - 1,080Cape Verdean immigration continues to this day. Dorchester, Massachusetts; Brockton, Massachusetts; Taunton, Massachusetts; New Bedford, Massachusetts; Pawtucket, Rhode Island; and Onset, Massachusetts are the fastest-growing new immigrant communities in the United States.There are an estimated 265,000 Cape Verdean immigrants and their descendants living in the United States, according to a June 2007 article in The New York Times.  \nCape Verdean Americans reside mostly in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\nSome Cape Verdeans also settled in the Midwestern United States, Florida and California.\n\n\n== Assimilation ==\nThe Cape Verdeans suffered discrimination when they came to America. Cape Verdeans retained a unique culture apart from the groups of Afro Americans who were the descendants of slaves in the United States. This was especially true for those who settled outside the Cape Verde environments concentrated in New England, and settled in the Midwest. Due to their Catholic religion, most Cape Verdeans were related to other Catholics, who were mostly white. The Cape Verdeans maintained their own ethnic identity and lived in separate communities from other Afro American groups. However, during the civil rights struggles of the 60s, the Cape Verdeans saw similarities between their own struggle and that of African Americans and emerged a sense of solidarity with them. While some islands have a heavy European-descended population, most Cape Verdeans have African ancestry mixed with European and Moorish Jews. Because later people from all over the world settled in Cape Verde, not only Europeans, the population is one of the most unusual ethnic melting pots in the world. Due to this uniqueness, most Cape Verdeans choose to cite \"Cape Verdean\" as their race, which not only reflects a strong sense of Patriotism, but a sense of community that is only found among Cape Verdeans regardless of skin-tone.For well over a century, the U.S. has hosted the largest proportion of the worldwide Cape Verdean diaspora residing in any one nation.One important consequence of the technological development in recent decades has been the emergence of Cape Verdean transnationalism on the Internet. S\u00f3nia Melo discusses how Cape Verdean websites have become important for linking diaspora communities with each other, for maintaining ties with Cape Verde, and for the local politics of emigrant communities in their countries of residence.Additionally, most Cape Verdeans have a lighter skin color than Africans from the continent. This partially comes from the fact that in the beginning, Portuguese encouraged miscegenation between Portuguese colonizers and the members of African colonies throughout their empire (with the government often rewarding soldiers and officials with monetary or land benefits if they married indigenous people). Also, the prime location and solidarity found in the island allowed for interracial relationships to develop without traditional suppression. As a result, when it comes to hair textures, skin and eye colores there are a wide variety ranging from blue and blond eyes on the islands of Fogo and Brava, to crisp and darker shades on the island of Santiago. Yet it is not uncommon for nuclear families to have a variety of tones and textures for members. The uniqueness of Cape Verdeans is reflected in the Massachusetts census permitting a \"Cape-Verdean\" check-box for ethnic identification.\n\n\n== Languages ==\n\nGenerally, Cape Verdean Americans speak English, Portuguese, and Kriolu (or Crioulo). The Creole language is a mixture of Portuguese and the native African tongues spoken by slaves. Although much of the vocabulary stems from Portuguese, many of these words were no longer used in twentieth-century Portugal. The African tongues, mostly Mande, influenced Kriolu chiefly. Since the Republic of Cape Verde became independent of Portugal in 1975, Kriolu has become the dominant language among the islanders.\nCreole has not received official status nor has it been standardized across the country. Several scholars note that this is difficult to do given that there is substantial dialectical variation between the islands. This can be seen from migrants who left Cape Verde often identifying more with their island of origin than the archipelago as a whole. Language, food and music are the most important cultural markers of CV identity.The Cape Verdean Creole Institute was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1996, to teach the Cape Verdean language. In addition, many schools in the Boston Public School district offer Cape Verdean Creole (CVC) as a language class. Currently 2.3% of the population of Boston speaks CVC.Formal CVC language research in both Cape Verde and America has been ongoing since the late 1800s. The elite class of the island was mostly responsible for recording the earlier studies of the language in an attempt to make CVC more acceptable as an artistic language. When the first printing press came to Cape Verde in 1842, the elites began publishing written work in CVC for the first time. Additionally, the  Seminary of S\u00e3o Nicolau was created in 1866, which allowed for the elite mixed race and the black elite to have access to education and begin a scholarly debate about CVC. These developments, along with other improvements in technology, allowed the study of CVC to flourish in Cape Verde.\nIn general, there are two different schools of thought on CVC research. One school of thought is Creole Exceptionalism, which regards creole languages as a socially inferior dialect or degenerate language. Another school of thought however is referred to as Crioulidade, which celebrates Cape Verde's unique heritage, consequently referring to the language not in terms of its African or Portuguese heritage, but rather as its own unique hybrid of the two that has its own history and cultural significance. Proponents of this school of thought argue that the processes of miscegenation and creolization were positive, rather than negative as the Exceptionalism school of thought suggests.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nDue to a history of Portuguese colonization, the vast majority of Cape Verdeans and Cape Verdean Americans are Roman Catholic. Early Cape Verdean migrants to the United States originally joined Portuguese parishes that had sprung up throughout Southeastern Massachusetts. Cape Verdeans also began to establish their own masses in Criolu at many Massachusetts Catholic Churches. One such church is the St. Patrick's Church of Roxbury which has held a mass in Criolu for years. However, many Cape Verdean Catholics encountered racial prejudice amongst Portuguese parishioners and looked for religious alternatives. In New Bedford, the Cape Verdean community established the Our Lady of Assumption, the first Cape Verdean American church, in 1905 in response to such prejudice.Furthermore, in spite of colonial ties to Catholicism and the Portuguese, many Cape Verdeansin turned towards Protestantism in response to discrimination and a lack of support from the Archdiocese. In response to racism from the Portuguese community in Providence, the Cape Verdean community founded the Shelmer Street Church in 1905. Cape Verdeans in New Bedford at the turn of the 20th century were rejected by Portuguese parishioners at St. John's and turned towards Nazarene sects.The mythic Daddy Grace also started his first church among a Cape Verdean community in Wareham, Massachusetts in response to rejection by Portuguese Catholics. In addition to Daddy Grace, who later founded a national religious movement, the United House of Prayer for All People, around his cult of personality, the Cape Verdean Protestant community has produced another religious leader of national acclaim, Reverend Peter J. Gomes. Today, a greater proportion of newly arrived Cape Verdean immigrants to the United States identify as Protestant due to an increased presence of evangelical missionaries in Cape Verde following its independence.While Christianity is the dominant ideology of Cape Verdeans in Cape Verde and the diaspora, there has been an interest in the Jewish ancestry of Cape Verdeans amongst Cape Verdean Americans. The Cape Verdean Jewish Heritage movement is mainly led by the diaspora and its interest is predominantly in preserving history, not practicing doctrine. Accordingly, one of the major goals of the movement is preservation of Jewish cemeteries in Cape Verde. A manifestation of this interest is the annual Cape Verdean - Jewish Passover Seder held in Roxbury, Massachusetts since 2005  The Seder brings together Cape Verdean and Jewish Americans in a celebration of both cultures. The traditional Seder is adapted with a bilingual Haggadah that includes Criolu prayers and elements of Cape Verdean history, such as the addition of Amilcar's Cup.\n\n\n== Music ==\nCape Verdean music has evolved to be composed of diverse styles and genres that reflect its mixture of racial identities, such as: African, Portuguese, Caribbean and Brazilian influences. Older styles include morna and coladeira. These styles, though distinct, carry a commonality of somber, slow, and soulful tone that often reflects themes of love, longing, and nostalgia. Re-emerging forms of Caper Verdean Music are funan\u00e1 and batuque. These quick tempo, percussion filled styles are high energy songs that are typically accompanied by hip-moving dance. These styles were banned previously due to overly sexual allegations but are now re-emerging in the past decade. Hip hop, Reggae and Zouk are styles of Cape Verdean music that are now being explored. These fusions with contemporary styles of music are often reflective in lyrics with ongoing themes of Cape Verdean life.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== State totals ==\n\n\n=== Numbers and percentages of residents ===\nMassachusetts - 52,753 (0.7%)\nRhode Island - 17,685 (1.5%)\nConnecticut - 4,270 (0.1%)\nFlorida - 3,554 (0.1%)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Cape Verdeans\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBishop, Marlon; Halter, Marilyn, \"Diaspora Encounters: Kriolu in New England, the Cape Verdean-American Story\", Afropop Worldwide, Hip Deep edition.

          "This is just like I pictured New England. Nature at its best. We went there in October and the foliage was beautiful. Very nice playgrounds for kids of all ages. Most of the attractions were closed because of the off season but it was still worth the trip. Bring your camera !",

        "wiki": "First Unitarian Church of Providence is a Unitarian Universalist congregation located at the corner of Benefit and Benevolent Streets in Providence, Rhode Island. The congregation was founded in 1723, and the current church building was dedicated in 1816. For many years it was known as the First Congregational Church of Providence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first churches in Providence were Baptist. It wasn't until 1721 that the First Congregational Society was formed, and it erected its first house of worship in 1723. This building was known as the \"Old Town House\", and stood where the Providence County Courthouse now stands. By 1728, there were nine members of the congregation, led by Josiah Cotton as pastor.A new, larger building was built on the corner of Benefit and Benevolent Streets, where the current church now stands. This building was destroyed by fire June 14, 1814.\n\n\n=== Current building ===\nThe current building was designed by local architect John Holden Greene, who designed many buildings in Providence. The design scheme of a pedimented portico in front of a tower and tall spire was similar to Charles Bulfinch's design for Boston's New South Church.The building was dedicated October 13, 1816. It was built with white stone quarried in Johnston, Rhode Island. The original floor plan was 77 x 80 feet. The spire is 189 feet, 11 inches tall. The original cost was over $50,000.The bell in the church's bell tower is the largest cast by the Paul Revere foundry in Canton, Massachusetts.Renovations were made to the building in 1868 and 1916. In 1966, a bolt of lightning started a fire, which burned for four hours. Plaster detailing was destroyed along with the church's organ, but both were meticulously restored.  The architect for the restoration was Irving B. Haynes, of Johnson & Haynes.\n\n\n=== Theology ===\nAlthough founded as a congregationalist church, the church later became explicitly Unitarian in theology under the leadership of Rev. Henry Edes (1803-1832). For many years it was known as The First Congregational Church (Unitarian). In April 1953 the congregation voted to change the name to The First Unitarian Church of Providence.On March 26, 2017, the church voted to become a Sanctuary Church, a policy which would allow non-citizens to stay in the church and claim protection against deportation.\n\n\n== Notable masses and members ==\nProvidence Mayor Thomas A. Doyle's memorial funeral service was held at the church on June 14, 1886.\nA funeral mass for Sarah Elizabeth Doyle, suffragist, educator and sister of Mayor Thomas Doyle, was held in December 1922.\nFrank F. Olney (1851\u20141903), 18th mayor of Providence, was a member of the church.\nJournalist Ben Bagdikian (1920\u20142016) was a member of the church.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFirst Unitarian Church of Providence official website",

          "Went on a recent short business stay and ate at a local Italian eatery. Food was excellent and so many choices around. Hard not to find something you like here to eat. Only bad thing is parking. We had to pay $15 for lot parking to eat at the restaurant that owned the lot.",

          "Atwells is great during the day, full of old school Italian culture. Perfect for meandering around and stopping and smelling the roses. At night it turns into a club scene. There are a few quiet spots hidden down at the north end (Lilli Marlene's and Nolan's Corner Pub).",

          "It's too small to top Boston's North End or San Francisco's North Beach as North America's best Little Italy, but here quality allows it to surpass the Belmont section of the Bronx which is too cheesy, Brooklyn's Bensonhurst or what \"was\" both Manhattan's versions. Spanish",
          "Stop in to every little market - you will be amazed at the variety you will find here. Of course Venda Ravioli is not to be missed but there are many others including Scailo bakery for authentic Italian pastry.",

          "Back in the day Federal Hill was the place to be! It was an Italian American community and the shops and restaurants reflected the culture. It is now a 20 something crowd, restaurants are pricey, parking is limited and safety is a concern. Many recent shootings have prevented us",

          "Brown is a beautiful university in the center of Providence. Take a walk through the center of the campus and admire the architecture. Like most campuses in cities it extends well beyond the main green and has buildings scattered about.",
          "Not much to do for tourists. The grounds and buildings are beautiful but I can't see any reason to make a special trip just to see it.",

          "We toured Brown University and thought the campus itself was pretty. I was a little turned off by the emphasis on the emergency buttons around campus where someone would be there in 60 seconds if you pushed the button. The campus itself felt safe but it borders on the downtown",

          "A beautiful Ivy League school, in the heart of Providence, Rhode Island. In a super location, with lots of college action. Brown is a city school with a campus. Providence is a great town to live in. Less than a mile from RISD and Johnson and Wales University, there is always",
          "This is a great place to see and walk around. The architecture here is beautiful and unique. A good place to be outside and walk around in Portland. There's a visitor parking lot at the corner of Thayer and Power.",
          "This was a very nice campus to walk around and was able to look inside some of the buildings within the grounds. I was also able to see the sports facilities which were very impressive and able to see a number of students during practice. A nice thing to do on a sunny afternoon",
          "Definitely walk around this campus. The architectural and historical building details are wonderful. The campus grounds are very pleasant and kept. Lots of spots to explore. Very recommended. Thumbs up!",
          "Took advantage of the beautiful weather and walked about the campus. It was bustling with students and non-students. The campus covers a wide area, so if you're looking for something specific, find one of the campus maps for guidance. I didn't find it as nice as some other",

        "wiki": "The Graduate Providence is an upscale hotel that opened in 1922 as the Providence Biltmore Hotel, part of the Bowman-Biltmore Hotels chain. It is located on the southern corner of Kennedy Plaza at 11 Dorrance Street in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 and is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Providence Biltmore was constructed by the Bowman-Biltmore Hotels chain, founded by John McEntee Bowman and Louis Wallick. It was built in the neo-Federal Beaux-arts style and designed by the architectural firm of Warren and Wetmore, who also designed Grand Central Terminal. The hotel opened on June 6, 1922, and was the second-tallest building in the city after the Rhode Island State House, until the Industrial Trust Tower was finished six years later. Today, the Biltmore is the 9th-tallest building in the city.\nThe Biltmore was bought by Sheraton Hotels in 1947 and renamed the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel. Providence was flooded by Hurricane Carol in 1954, and much of the lobby of the Sheraton-Biltmore was underwater; a plaque commemorates the high water mark today, eight feet up on lobby columns. Sheraton sold the hotel, along with sixteen other aging properties, to Gotham Hotels in 1968 and it became the Biltmore Hotel & Motor Inn.\n\n\n=== Restoration ===\nIn 1975, Gotham Hotels closed the Biltmore. It remained vacant for four years. At one point, with the hotel facing demolition; Mayor Buddy Cianci helped with efforts to designate the hotel a landmark and assembled a group of local businessmen, including Bruce Sundlun of the Outlet Company, Michael Metcalf of The Providence Journal, G. William Miller of Textron, and Jim Winoker and Dominic Zinni of B.B. Greenberg Company, who purchased the hotel and implemented Federal tax credits to rehabilitate the building, reopening it in 1979 as the Biltmore Plaza Hotel. The Biltmore's external glass elevator was added during this rehabilitation, and served all 18 floors of the hotel (though it no longer runs). In 1983, the owners retained Dunfey Hotels to manage the property, and it was renamed Biltmore Plaza, A Dunfey Hotel. Soon after, Dunfey's owner, Aer Lingus, purchased the Omni Hotels chain, and the hotel was renamed the Omni Biltmore Hotel. By the 1990s, the Omni Biltmore was fully owned by The Providence Journal. They sold the hotel to the Grand Heritage Hotels chain in July 1995 for $7 million, and it was renamed the Providence Biltmore. The hotel was sold out of receivership on May 31, 2012 to Finard Coventry Hotel Management, for $16 million. Finard Coventry invested a further $10 million in renovations, and the hotel joined Curio - A Collection by Hilton, on December 16, 2014.\n\n\n=== Graduate Providence ===\n\nIn October 2017, the Biltmore was sold to AJ Capital Partners, a Chicago-based hotel and real estate firm, for $43.6 million. The hotel was renovated and renamed Graduate Providence on April 2, 2019, as part of AJ Capital's boutique chain of \"Graduate\" hotels, in college towns across the United States. The new owners have retained the hotel's iconic neon \"Biltmore\" sign.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe hotel was originally built with 600 rooms; later, walls were knocked down and suites were created. It now offers 292 guest rooms. \nThe hotel contains banquet space of over 19,000 square feet (1,800 m2). The rooftop level Grand Ballroom offers expansive views of the city and Kennedy Plaza and can hold up to 750 guests; its event space is designed for functions such as wedding receptions, banquet service, and conferences.\nIt was the tallest and largest hotel in Providence for 71 years, until The Westin Providence (today known as the Omni Providence Hotel) was completed in 1993. the hotel was home to the largest Starbucks in New England from 2003-2019.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Cinema backdrop ===\nThe Providence Biltmore features prominently in the 2004 Jeff Nathanson film The Last Shot, and the 2007 Anne Fletcher film 27 Dresses.\nShowtime episodes of Brotherhood from 2004 to 2007 were also shot here.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe Hotel is the scene of a Brown University collegiate reunion in The Devil Wears Prada by Lauren Weisberger.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Providence, Rhode Island\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGraduate Providence official website\nOmni Biltmore Hotel at Emporis",

        "wiki": "Slater Park is the oldest and largest public park in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  The park is named after Samuel Slater, a famous American industrialist who constructed America's first water-powered textile mill in Pawtucket.  The park lies on the banks of the beautiful Ten Mile River and features the 1685 Daggett House, the oldest house in Pawtucket. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. It also features an original Looff Carousel.\n\n\n== History ==\nCovering 197 acres (0.80 km2), the majority of the land (formerly known as the Daggett farm) was purchased by the city in 1894. The land of the original Daggett farm bore little resemblance to the park that exists today.  The Providence Journal described the original tract as \"...part swamp and part remains of a wornout farm... In its primitive state less than one-quarter of this area was open to the public. The rest was either densely wooded or so swampy that it was impossible to penetrate anywhere without sinking deep into the mud.\" Initial development of the park did not begin until 1907 when major improvements were made to this situation. All the swamp growth was removed in the process of turning the low-lying areas into ponds. The heavy underbrush on higher ground was also cleared out, while the established pines and maples were carefully preserved. At the same time, hundreds of oak and pine saplings were set out in selected areas, and grass was coaxed to grow once more on the abandoned fields. The result of these programs is a park which today displays a nearly even balance between grassy fields and open woods.\nIn 1894, the only roadway on the Daggett farm ran in a straight line from Armistice Boulevard (then Brook Street) to the Daggett House. A major project in the first years of park development was the building of a network of winding drives which opened most of the park to the driving public. At the same time, a system of paths was begun, with emphasis on walks along the river bank, the shores of the ponds, and out across a pair of bridges to the island in the Ten Mile River.\nBetween 1909 and 1917, several buildings were also erected within the park.  This early development was largely directed by three men: the City Engineer, George Carpenter; the president of the Park Commission, James C. Potter; and the first Park Superintendent, George Saunders.\n\n\n== Notable features of the Park ==\nIn addition to the Daggett House and Looff Carousel, the park contains other buildings and features:\n\nSlater Park Zoo: Early in Slater Park's development, a small collection of animals was put on display just across from the Daggett House. In 1916, this miniature zoo housed only pigeons, rabbits, and deer which roamed in a fenced run. Suffering financially, much of the zoo was closed in the 1990s. Today, while many of the original enclosures are still there, the area now serves as a petting zoo called Daggett Farm.\nPotter Casino: Built in 1917, the \"casino\" or \"resthouse\" was constructed on the shores of the central pond. The building was the gift of James C. Potter, a member of the Pawtucket Park Commission since its inception, and its president since 1904. A Pawtucket architect, R. C. N. Monahan, designed the rest house in the Colonial Revival style, with walls of red tapestry brick, and a low hipped roof covered with green Ludovici tile. Its lower floor opened to the lake and was largely given over to an \"aquatic room\" to serve canoeists and skaters; the upper floor contained lavatories at the ends, separated by a wide \"rest room\" finished in oak and furnished with easy chairs and popular magazines. The building now houses the Rhode Island Watercolor Society and serves as a gallery.  It is also used for various seasonal events such as Pawtucket's Winter Wonderland.\nBandstand: Also erected during the building campaign of 1917, the bandstand was erected at the opposite end of the pond from the Potter Casino. Of granolithic composition construction, the bandstand is in the form of a circular open temple, 24' in diameter, with ten columns carrying a steel dome and tile roof. The dome's underside is sheathed in quartered oak, and the temple's frieze carries the names of ten famous composers. The location of the new bandstand, and the layout of the paths leading to it, were determined in consultation with John C. Olmsted, nephew and former partner of the more famous Frederick Law Olmsted.\nPark Superintendent's house:  A story-and-a-half cottage, built for the Daggett family about 1874, was remodeled in the early twentieth century to serve as offices for the Parks department.\nCogswell Fountain: Located in the triangle at the Newport Avenue entrance. Its shaft of polished gray granite once bore aloft a bronze stork while pure water gushed from the carved figures at each side of its triangular base, the fountain was presented to the citizens of Pawtucket and Central Falls by Dr. Henry D. Cogswell in 1880, and was originally set up in front of the Miller Block at the corner of Main and Mill Streets, (now Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue). The fountain was relocated to Oak Grove Cemetery for a brief period before it was finally transferred to Slater Park about 1904. In 1990 it was returned to its original spot at Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue.\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Pawtucket, Rhode Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Slater Park (Rhode Island) at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Lincoln Woods State Park is a public recreation area covering 627 acres (254 ha) around Olney Pond four miles (6.4 km) northwest of Pawtucket in the town of Lincoln, Rhode Island. The state park is known for its giant glacial boulders and the stony nature of its terrain which prevented most of the parkland from being used as farmland or for other development.\n\n\n== History ==\nNamed in honor of President Abraham Lincoln, the park traces its origins to the state's purchase of Quinsnicket Pond and 71 additional acres in 1908. It had its official founding on the 100th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s birth, February 12, 1909. Until the 1940s, the park was popularly known as Quinsnicket, a faux Indian name commonly said to mean something like The Domain of Many Rocks. Quinsnicket was actually a name invented by white settlers, and the original Indian name for the area was Caucaunjaivatchuck.\n\n\n== Activities and amenities ==\nThe park offers a freshwater beach, extensive picnicking facilities, trails for equestrians, mountain bikers, snowmobilers, and hikers, boating, ice skating, and fishing areas and game fields. Canoe rentals, kayak rentals and kayaking lessons are offered by a concessionaire. The park is also known for bouldering, a type of rock climbing that does not utilize ropes or harnesses.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe park was a favorite haunt of the author H.P. Lovecraft, who spent summer days walking in the park and writing long letters recording vivid accounts of the park's landscape and ambiance. In 2011, part of the film Moonrise Kingdom was filmed at the park.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLincoln Woods State Park Rhode Island Dept. of Environmental Management, Division of Parks & Recreation\nLincoln Woods State Park Map Rhode Island Dept. of Environmental Management, Division of Parks & Recreation",

          "Frequently go during the summer to walk the park loop. A nice 2.5 miles work out of mildly hilly paved terrain. Plenty of parking. The only down side to this park are the people that don't pick up after their dogs. Besides that it is quite a nice place close to the city.",

        "wiki": "I Am Providence is a 2016 murder mystery novel by American author Nick Mamatas. It was first published in paperback on August 9, 2016 through Night Shade Books in the United States and United Kingdom. The work alternately follows two writers both before and after one of them is murdered.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book follows two horror writers, Colleen Danzig and Panos Panossian, the latter of whom is strongly disliked in the Lovecraft literary community. Both writers are attending the Summer Tentacular, a Lovecraft themed convention held in Providence, Rhode Island, and sharing a room together. Before the first day of the convention's end, Panossian is brutally murdered, his face peeled off of his body, mimicking an anonymous post left for Panossian on his blog by someone years ago who appears to know a great deal about his past.\nThe novel's chapters alternatively follow both writers. The third-person chapters following Colleen are partially set before Panossian's murder while his chapters are told after his death, as his disembodied consciousness drifts around the convention following participants and thinking about his past. Panossian can feel his nerves dying and his brain shriveling like a \u2018sponge in the sun\u2019, and he spends his time lamenting over not remembering who it was that killed him, trying to figure it out, and letting his mind drift into long monologues about his past and opinions, his thoughts on Lovecraft, and his opinions on the other con-goers.\nColleen recklessly searches for the truth and believes that there's a connection between \"Arkham,\" the book Panossian was supposed to be selling when he died, and who killed him. The book is rumored to be bound in human skin. She corners Chloe, another one of the authors, in a bathroom where a physical altercation takes place.\nShe then convinces Hiram to give her a ride with partial lies. The truth is that they're following a group of others from the con into the forest, where she believes they're doing something related to the murder. She calls the police and it's revealed that they were just trying to locate the grave of H.P. Lovecraft's long-deceased cat. Colleen is taken in for questioning many times, and is banned from the convention for her assault on Chloe. From the Mortuary, Panossian can hear the interrogations and uses them to further speculate on who may have killed him.\nAfter the night in the woods, Colleen finds out that another writer from the con was killed: Charles Cudmore, who she mentally calls \"asparagus head\" due to his malformed head and haircut. His death is dissimilar to Panossians, leading Colleen to believe that he was killed because he knew too much. She goes to Norman, another's con-attendee's room to look for more info after finding out that a drag queen named Ms. Phantasia and Chloe have been accused. She doesn't get much from this encounter and ends up having to take part in a group attempt to summon Cthulhu. She is taken into custody once more when the police arrive, and during her subsequent interrogation believes that the police are trying to hint at her to help. She is given an eventful ride back to the hotel for the closing ceremonies.\nDuring an odd speech on Christianity, Hiram tries to hint at her to leave but it's too late. Colleen is tackled because it's believed that she's the real killer. She manages to escape and an officer drives her out of state. Whilst at the airport, she is looking into some of the con-goers and their pasts and is struck by inspiration. She returns to Providence.\nFrom his position, Panossian hears who murdered him reveal themself, an exchange that is overheard by Colleen and Hiram. The book ends with gunshots and Colleen whispering to an unknown other person that it will be okay as Panossian finally slips away for good.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPublishers Weekly and NPR both reviewed the work, the latter of which felt that the book's coverage of a niche fandom harmed more than helped the book because \"As deep as the book gets, it's equally narrow, and no matter how accessible Mamatas makes his mystery, it's still mired in the in-fighting and minutia of a subculture that few can relate to.\" Tor.com was critical of I Am Providence, writing \"Clearly, there are some great ideas in here, but even if you can get past the flat characters and the circumnavigative narrative and the nastiness of the entire enterprise, I Am Providence goes nowhere of note, oh-so-slowly.\"Locus Online and Fangoria were more favorable towards the work, with Locus Online stating that \"Mythos fans, mystery fans, and convention-goers (some of us are all three!) will all find plenty to like here.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Newport is a seaside city on Aquidneck Island. It is located in Narragansett Bay approximately 33 miles (53 km) southeast of Providence, Rhode Island, 20 miles (32 km) south of Fall River, Massachusetts, 74 miles (119 km) south of Boston, and 180 miles (290 km) northeast of New York City. It is known as a New England summer resort and is famous for its historic mansions and its rich sailing history. It was the location of the first U.S. Open tournaments in both tennis and golf, as well as every challenge to the America's Cup between 1930 and 1983. It is also the home of Salve Regina University and Naval Station Newport, which houses the United States Naval War College, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, and an important Navy training center. It was a major 18th-century port city and also contains a high number of buildings from the Colonial era.The city is the county seat of Newport County, which has no governmental functions other than court administrative and sheriff corrections boundaries. It was known for being the location of the \"Summer White Houses\" during the administrations of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy. The population was 24,672 as of 2010.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Colonial period ===\n\nNewport was founded in 1639 on Aquidneck Island, which was called Rhode Island at the time. Its eight founders and first officers were Nicholas Easton, William Coddington, John Clarke, John Coggeshall, William Brenton, Jeremy Clark, Thomas Hazard, and Henry Bull. Many of these people had been part of the settlement at Portsmouth, along with Anne Hutchinson and her followers. They separated within a year of that settlement, however, and Coddington and others began the settlement of Newport on the southern side of the island.\nNewport grew to be the largest of the four original settlements which became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, which also included Providence Plantations and Shawomett. Many of the first colonists in Newport became Baptists, and the second Baptist congregation in Rhode Island was formed in 1640 under the leadership of John Clarke.  In 1658, a group of Jews were welcomed to settle in Newport; they were fleeing the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal but had not been permitted to settle elsewhere. The Newport congregation is now referred to as Congregation Jeshuat Israel and is the second-oldest Jewish congregation in the United States. It meets in Touro Synagogue, the oldest synagogue in the United States.\nThe Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations received its royal charter in 1663, and Benedict Arnold was elected as its first governor at Newport. The Old Colony House served as a seat of Rhode Island's government upon its completion in 1741 at the head of Washington Square, until the current Rhode Island State House in Providence was completed in 1904 and Providence became the state's sole capital city. Newport became the most important port in colonial Rhode Island, and a public school was established in 1640.\nThe commercial activity which raised Newport to its fame as a rich port was begun by a second wave of Portuguese Jews who settled there around the middle of the 18th century. They had been practicing Judaism in secret for 300 years in Portugal, and they were attracted to Rhode Island because of the freedom of worship there. They brought with them commercial experience and connections, capital, and a spirit of enterprise. Most prominent among those were Jacob Rodrigues Rivera, who arrived in 1745 (died 1789) and Aaron Lopez, who came in 1752 (died May 28, 1782). Rivera introduced the manufacture of sperm oil which became one of Newport's leading industries and made the town rich. Newport developed 17 manufactories of oil and candles and enjoyed a practical monopoly of this trade until the American Revolution.\nAaron Lopez is credited with making Newport an important center of trade. He encouraged 40 Portuguese Jewish families to settle there, and Newport had 150 vessels engaged in trade within 14 years of his activity. He was involved in the slave trade and manufactured spermaceti candles, ships, barrels, rum, chocolate, textiles, clothes, shoes, hats, and bottles.  He became the wealthiest man in Newport but was denied citizenship on religious grounds, even though British law protected the rights of Jews to become citizens. He appealed to the Rhode Island legislature for redress and was refused with this ruling: \"Inasmuch as the said Aaron Lopez hath declared himself by religion a Jew, this Assembly doth not admit himself nor any other of that religion to the full freedom of this Colony. So that the said Aaron Lopez nor any other of said religion is not liable to be chosen into any office in this colony nor allowed to give vote as a free man in choosing others.\" Lopez persisted by applying for citizenship in Massachusetts, where it was granted.From the mid-17th century, the religious tolerance in Newport attracted numbers of Quakers, known also as the Society of Friends. The Great Friends Meeting House in Newport (1699) is the oldest existing structure of worship in Rhode Island.\nIn 1727, James Franklin (brother of Benjamin) printed the Rhode-Island Almanack in Newport. In 1732, he published the first newspaper, the Rhode Island Gazette. In 1758, his son James founded the weekly newspaper Mercury. The famous 18th century Goddard and Townsend furniture was also made in Newport.\nThroughout the 18th century, Newport suffered from an imbalance of trade with the largest colonial ports.  As a result, Newport merchants were forced to develop alternatives to conventional exports. In the 1720s, Colonial leaders arrested many pirates, acting under pressure from the British government. Many were hanged in Newport and were buried on Goat Island.\n\n\n=== Slave trade ===\nNewport was a major center of the slave trade in colonial and early America, active in the \"triangle trade\" in which slave-produced sugar and molasses from the Caribbean were carried to Rhode Island and distilled into rum, which was then carried to West Africa and exchanged for captives. In 1764, Rhode Island had about 30 rum distilleries, 22 in Newport alone. The Common Burial Ground on Farewell Street was where most of the slaves were buried.\nSixty percent of slave-trading voyages launched from North America issued from tiny Rhode Island, in some years more than 90%, and many from Newport. Almost half were trafficked illegally, breaking a 1787 state law prohibiting residents of the state from trading in slaves. Slave traders were also breaking federal statutes of 1794 and 1800 barring Americans from carrying slaves to ports outside the United States, as well as the 1807 Congressional act abolishing the transatlantic slave trade. A few Rhode Island families made substantial fortunes in the trade. William and Samuel Vernon were Newport merchants who later played an important role in financing the creation of the United States Navy; they sponsored 30 African slaving ventures. However, it was the DeWolfs of Bristol, Rhode Island, and most notably James De Wolf, who were the largest slave-trading family in all of North America, mounting more than 80 transatlantic voyages, most of them illegal. The Rhode Island slave trade was broadly based. Seven hundred Rhode Islanders owned or captained slave ships, including most substantial merchants, and many ordinary shopkeepers and tradesmen who purchased shares in slaving voyages.In addition to being one of America's most active slave ports, Newport was also home to a small community of abolitionists and free blacks. Reverend Samuel Hopkins, minister at Newport's First Congregational Church, has been called \"America's first abolitionist\". Among subscribers to Hopkins' writings were 17 free black subscribers, most of whom lived in Newport. This community of free blacks, including Newport Gardner, founded the Free African Union Society in 1780, the first African mutual aid society in America.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== American Revolutionary era ===\n\nNewport was the scene of much activity during the American Revolution. William Ellery came from Newport, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. He later served on the Naval Committee.\nIn the winter of 1775 and 1776, the Rhode Island Legislature put militia General William West in charge of rooting out loyalists in Newport, and several notable individuals were exiled to the northern part of the state, such as Joseph Wanton and Thomas Vernon. In the fall of 1776, the British saw that Newport could be used as a naval base to attack New York (which they had recently occupied), so they took over the city.  The population of Newport had divided loyalties.  Many pro\u2013independence Patriots left town, while loyalist Tories remained.  Newport was a British stronghold for the next three years.\nIn the summer of 1778, the Americans began the campaign known as the Battle of Rhode Island. This was the first joint operation between the Americans and the French after the signing of the Treaty of Alliance. The Americans based in Tiverton planned a formal siege of the town. However, the French refused to take part in it, wanting a frontal assault.  This weakened the American position, and the British were able to expel the Americans from the island. The following year, the British abandoned Newport, wanting to concentrate their forces in New York.\nOn July 10, 1780, a French expedition arrived in Narragansett Bay off Newport with an army of 450 officers and 5,300 men, sent by King Louis XVI and commanded by Rochambeau.  For the rest of the war, Newport was the base of the French forces in the United States.  In July 1781, Rochambeau was finally able to leave Newport for Providence to begin the decisive march to Yorktown, Virginia, along with General George Washington. The first Roman Catholic mass in Rhode Island was said in Newport during this time. The Rochambeau Monument in Kings Park on Wellington Avenue along Newport Harbor commemorates Rochambeau's contributions to the Revolutionary War and to Newport's history.\nNewport's population had fallen from over 9,000 (according to the census of 1774) to fewer than 4,000 by the time that the war ended (1783). Over 200 abandoned buildings were torn down in the 1780s. Also, the war destroyed Newport's economic wealth, as years of military occupation closed the city to any form of trade. The Newport merchants moved away, some to Providence, others to Boston and New York.\nIt was in Newport that the Rhode Island General Assembly voted to ratify the Constitution in 1790 and become the 13th state, acting under pressure from the merchant community of Providence.\nThe city was the last residence of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry and the birthplace of Commodore Matthew C. Perry and the Reverend William Ellery Channing.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Gilded Age ===\nBeginning in the mid-nineteenth century, wealthy southern planters seeking to escape the heat began to build summer cottages on Bellevue Avenue, such as Kingscote (1839).  Around the middle of the century, wealthy Yankees, such as the Wetmore family, also began constructing larger mansions, such as Chateau-sur-Mer (1852) nearby. Most of these early families made a substantial part of their fortunes in the Old China Trade.By the turn of the 20th century, many of the nation's wealthiest families were summering in Newport, including the Vanderbilts, Astors, and the Widener family, who constructed the largest \"cottages\", such as The Breakers (1895) and Miramar.  They resided for a brief summer social season in grand, gilded mansions with elaborate receiving rooms, dining rooms, music rooms, and ballrooms\u2014but with few bedrooms, since the guests were expected to have \"cottages\" of their own. Many of the homes were designed by New York architect Richard Morris Hunt, who kept a house in Newport himself.\nThe social scene at Newport is described in Edith Wharton's novel The Age of Innocence. Wharton's own Newport \"cottage\" was called Land's End. Today, many mansions continue in private use. Hammersmith Farm is the mansion where John F. Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy held their wedding reception; it was open to tourists as a \"house museum\", but has since been purchased and reconverted into a private residence. Many other mansions are open to tourists; still others were converted into academic buildings for Salve Regina College in the 1930s, when the owners could no longer afford their tax bills.\nIn the mid-19th century, a large number of Irish immigrants settled in Newport. The Fifth Ward of Newport in the southern part of the city became a staunch Irish neighborhood for many generations. To this day, St. Patrick's Day is an important day of pride and celebration in Newport, with a large parade going down Thames Street.\nThe oldest Catholic parish in Rhode Island is St. Mary's, located on Spring Street\u2014though the current building is not the original one.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century and beyond ===\nRhode Island did not have a fixed capital during and after the colonial era but rotated its legislative sessions among Providence, Newport, Bristol, East Greenwich, and South Kingstown. In 1854, the sessions were eliminated in the cities other than Providence and Newport, and Newport was finally dropped in 1900. A constitutional amendment that year restricted the meetings of the legislature to Providence.John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier were married in St. Mary's Church in Newport on September 12, 1953. Presidents Kennedy and Eisenhower both made Newport the sites of their \"Summer White Houses\" during their years in office. Eisenhower stayed at Quarters A at the Naval War College and at what became known as the Eisenhower House, while Kennedy used Hammersmith Farm next door.\n\nThe city has long been entwined with the United States Navy. It held the campus of the U.S. Naval Academy during the American Civil War (1861\u201365) when the undergraduate officer training school was temporarily moved north from Annapolis, Maryland. From 1952 to 1973, it hosted the Cruiser-Destroyer Force of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, and subsequently it has hosted smaller numbers of warships from time to time. Today it hosts the Naval Station Newport (NAVSTA Newport) and remains home to the U.S. Naval War College and the Naval Education and Training Command (NETC), the center for Surface Warfare Officer training, numerous other schools, and the headquarters of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center. The decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Saratoga (CV-60) was moored in an inactive status at the docks previously used by the Cruiser-Destroyer Force, until it was towed to Brownsville, Texas in August\u2013September 2014 to be dismantled. The USS Forrestal (CV-59) shared the pier until June 2010.The departure of the Cruiser-Destroyer fleet from Newport and the closure of nearby Naval Air Station Quonset Point in 1973 were devastating to the local economy. The population of Newport decreased, businesses closed, and property values plummeted. However, in the late 1960s, the city began revitalizing the downtown area with the construction of America's Cup Avenue, malls of stores and condominiums, and upscale hotels. Construction was completed on the Newport Bridge. The Preservation Society of Newport County began opening Newport's historic mansions to the public, and the tourist industry became Newport's primary commercial enterprise over the subsequent years.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nNewport is located at 41\u00b029\u203217\u2033N 71\u00b018\u203245\u2033W. It is the most populous municipality on Aquidneck Island in Narragansett Bay.

The Newport Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in New England, connects Newport to neighboring Conanicut Island across the East Passage of the Narragansett.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 2013, there were 24,027 people, 10,616 households, and 4,933 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,204.2 people per square mile (1,239.8/km\u00b2). There were 13,069 housing units at an average density of 1,697.3 per square mile (656.7/km\u00b2).

In addition to the colonial architecture, the city is known for its Gilded Age mansions, summer \"cottages\" built in varying styles copied from the royal palaces of Europe.\nThe White Horse Tavern was built prior to 1673 and is one of the oldest taverns in the US. Newport is also home to the Touro Synagogue, one of the oldest Jewish houses of worship in the Western hemisphere, and to the Newport Public Library and Redwood Library and Athenaeum, one of the nation's oldest lending libraries.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Outdoor activities ==\n\nNewport is sometimes referred to as the \"Sailing Capital of the World\". The city was chosen as the new home of the National Sailing Hall of Fame which moved here from Annapolis, Maryland in 2019. Several sailing clubs are based in the city, including the New York Yacht Club and the Ida Lewis Yacht Club. Newport was the site of the America's Cup races from 1930 to 1983, and it remains the starting point of the biannual 635 nautical-mile Newport Bermuda Race.\n\nAquidneck Island has many beaches, both public and private. The largest public beach is Easton's beach or First Beach, which has a view of the Newport Cliff Walk. Sachuest Beach or Second Beach in Middletown is the second-largest beach in the area. Gooseberry Beach is private but is open to the public on certain days of the year; it is located on Ocean Drive, along with the private Bailey's Beach and Hazard's Beach. The Cliff Walk is one of the most popular attractions in the city. It is a 3.5-mile (5.6 km) public access walkway bordering the shoreline and has been designated a National Recreation Trail.\nBrenton Point State Park is the site of the annual Brenton Point Kite Festival. Newport is also home to the Newport Country Club, which hosted the 2007 Women's US Open and the 1995 Men's US Amateurs. Fort Adams dates back to the War of 1812; it houses the Museum of Yachting and hosts both the Newport Folk Festival and the Newport Jazz Festival. The Jazz Festival was established in 1954 by local socialite Elaine Lorillard and music promoter George Wein. It was held annually until 1971, and was re-established in Newport in 1981. In 1959, Wein, folk singer Pete Seeger, and music manager Albert Grossman established the Newport Folk Festival as a counterpart to the Jazz Festival. It was held in Newport through 1969, returned to the city in 1985, and has been held annually at Fort Adams since then. The Folk Festival was the venue for a controversial performance by singer-songwriter Bob Dylan in July 1965 that proved influential to the \"folk rock movement\". Both festivals were held at other venues in Newport before moving to Fort Adams when they were revived in the 1980s.As of Fall 2013, Newport has been designated a Bronze Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists. The International Tennis Hall of Fame is also located in Newport. The Campbell's Hall of Fame Tennis Championships is held every year in early July, the week following Wimbledon. The week also includes annual enshrinements into the Hall of Fame. The annual Citizens Bank Pell Bridge Run is held every Fall to raise money for local charities.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nNewport Public Schools operates public schools: Claiborne Pell Elementary School, Thompson Middle School, Rogers High School, Newport Area Career and Technical Center, Aquidneck Island Adult Learning Center. Prior to 2013 multiple small public elementary schools served the Newport community; the Pell School, a consolidation of those schools, opened in 2013.There is one private elementary school in Newport, St. Michael's Country Day School. Nearby private primary schools include All Saints Academy in Middletown, The Pennfield School in Portsmouth, and St. Philomena School in Portsmouth. Nearby private secondary schools include Portsmouth Abbey School in Portsmouth and St. George's School in Middletown.\nSt. Joseph of Cluny School was formerly located in Newport, on property given by the estate of Arthur Curtiss James to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence in 1941. Military families from Fort Adams requested a Catholic school; Cluny opened in September 1957 as a kindergarten and added grades until 1965, when the first eighth grade graduation was held. Since the period, the overall population of Newport declined and the concentration of the middle class declined; much of the housing became too expensive for families with young children, and there were relatively few houses being sold in Newport to new residents. In addition many families previously going to Cluny instead sent their children to the Portsmouth School Department. From circa 2014 to 2017 the enrollment decreased by one fourth; the school administration stated that this decline and the general competition among private schools in the Newport area caused the operation of the school to be no longer viable. It closed in 2017. Betsy Sherman Walker of Newport This Week described the closure as a \"curveball\" unexpected by the community.\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nPost-secondary schools include the Naval Academy Preparatory School, Salve Regina University, Naval War College, International Yacht Restoration School, and the Community College of Rhode Island Newport Campus.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Principal employers ===\nAccording to Newport's 2016 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the principal employers in the city are:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n Japan: Shimoda, Shizuoka\n Ireland: Kinsale\n Portugal: Ponta Delgada\n Italy: Imperia\n Greece: Skiathos\n Canada: Saint John, New Brunswick\n United States: Staten Island, New York\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nNewport was a filming location for High Society (1956), The Great Gatsby (1974), Mr. North (1988), Wind (1992), and Moonrise Kingdom (2012).\n\n\n== See also ==\nBuildings and structures in Newport, Rhode Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nBridenbaugh, Carl.
